 | the present unfortunate incident . As you know , the captain is completely responsible for this vessel . While we are at sea , his authority is absolute . At his direction I am in command of this room . I am here to see that no further disorder occurs ; I have plenty of men with me and you need have no apprehension on that score . I must also reassure you respecting the lights . A temporary accident has occurred to our main dynamo , but the emergency motors are in perfect condition and there is no cause to fear that the lights will fail again . No harm whatsoever has been done the ship . ' He paused and from several parts of the room came scattering applause . I must now ask you , ladies and gentlemen , for your co-operation . I do not know as yet just what has happened here , but I am told that there has been violence of a serious nature . On behalf of the captain and of the Line I assure you that the circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with by proper authority . We regret extremely the disagreeableness to which you have been subjected ; I can promise you that there will be no recurrence . It is now necessary for me to clear this room , so that we may make our investigation . My men are stationed at all the exits and if you will please assist me by giving them your names , and if possible by identifying yourselves as you pass out , it will be greatly appreciated . We will inconvenience you no more than is absolutely necessary . This room will be closed for the remainder of to-night , but the other services of the ship are at your disposal exactly as usual . ' He paused again and looked down the room to the tables where the two detectives stood . Mr. Bone , ' he called , will you designate who is to remain ? ' Only the people at these two tables , sir . We will want no one else just now . ' Our detectives are in charge where the accident has occurred , ' the officer continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of you ladies and gentlemen please leave  | now ? Kindly do n't crowd at the doorways , as it will take a little time to get your names . Oh , and one thing more . Naturally we can not expect that you will not talk about this very unfortunate excitement . But we would ask you kindly not to exaggerate what has happened . Perhaps it is not as bad as it seems and rumours will easily go to undue lengths . Once more I assure you that the Line very greatly regrets the inconvenience to which you have been put . I wish to thank you for your attention and assistance . ' As the officer finished , the applause  --  intermingled with several Bravos ' and a loud Hear , hear , ' from Sir Henry 's table ? broke out again , and there was a general movement toward the doorways . While there were undoubtedly a few who would have been glad to remain and acquaint themselves with the forthcoming details , the majority , now that the crisis had passed , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable surroundings , to recover themselves at leisure . In a shorter time than would have appeared possible , they had filed through the exits , leaving behind them only the officer , the stewards and the group about the two tables far down the room . The officer descended from the bar , whence he had superintended the evacuation of the smoking-room . Schmidt , ' he called to the petty officer at the port entrance , you 'd better see that the winter garden outside here is cleared also . Be easy about it , though . My God , there 's going to be enough hell to pay about this , as it is . ' He hurried down the room to where two men were bending over the quiet figure of the girl . What about it Pell ? ' he asked , sharply . Can anything be done ? ' The ship 's doctor , a bearded , professional-looking man of about fifty , left the girl to his colleague and straightened up . Nothing for this gentleman , ' he answered at once . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . The young  | lady , however ? . I do n't understand it . This doctor , Dr. Schall is it ? Yes . Dr. Schall says he examined her as soon as the lights went on ; she had fainted . But she does n't respond . We must get her up to the hospital at once . The officer was staring down at the girl . He was struck by her extraordinary beauty . Then his glance fell upon the red trickle over her shoulder , and for the first time he felt a wave of anger sweep over his body . She 's been shot , too , ' he cried , Look there ? ' It 's nothing , ' Dr. Schall reassured him . A little scratch on her neck ; you can see it 's stopped bleeding already . We can find no signs of any other wound . ' Younghusband suddenly caught the officer 's arm . Her necklace ! ' he ejaculated . She was wearing a pearl necklace . It 's gone . It must have been worth thousands ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? It 's been stolen . It 's gone . ' Here , Heddes , ' the officer turned to the detectives . He says a valuable necklace has disappeared . Take a look about , right away , will you ? Better help him , Bone . We must find that at once . ' As the two men began a hurried search under the nearby chairs and tables , Dr. Pell spoke again . We must get her out of here immediately , where I can attend her properly . Her pulse has almost ceased . ' He motioned to a pair of attendants standing by the now closed main entrance with a collapsible stretcher . Go ahead . Can you take her through the winter garden ? It 's been cleared . We do n't want any more attention than we can help . ' They were lifting the girl 's body gently on to the stretcher when the second young man who had been at the Smith table found his voice for the first time since the lights had gone up . Doctor ! ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My God , do n't let her die ! There must be something , there  | must . ' He sat down abruptly and began to mop his face with a handkerchief . Surprised , the doctor turned to him briefly and spoke in professional tones . She will be all right , ' he said soothingly . She has only fainted . A bad shock . She could n't come to here . No use taking chances ; perhaps her heart is not too strong . We 'll take care of her . ' He turned to the officer . You wo n't need me now ? I had better attend this lady myself . ' ' I shall stay , ' spoke up the other doctor . ' I can tell them anything they wish to know , as I was here when it happened . ' As the two attendants started out with their burden , You 'll send back ? ' asked the officer , indicating the second still body , slumped in its chair . The doctor nodded and motioned his men ahead . Half-way up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat and started uncertainly after them . Dr. Pell , glancing around , stopped , walked back and took him decisively by the shoulders . But his voice , when he spoke , was kind . Now see here , young man , ' he said firmly , you are only delaying matters . I shall take care of this lady . Do n't worry ; she 'll be perfectly all right . Get one of the stewards to give you a brandy . You 've had a shock yourself . You can inquire at the hospital after they have finished here . ' The executive officer met them at the door . A brief word with the doctor , and he walked rapidly in . As he approached , the junior officer drew himself up and saluted smartly . Sir , this is a very serious matter . This man has been shot . ' The executive officer stopped short . Shot ? ' he repeated incredulously . Killed ? ' In an instant he had recovered himself . ' Mr. Lane , ' he said sternly , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few sentences he was acquainted with the occurrences since Lane 's arrival . ' That 's all I know , sir , ' concluded the officer . ' Of course , the shooting took place before I got here . '  | I see . Very good , Mr. Lane . ' The executive officer turned to the people grouped behind his lieutenant . Now who can ? ' Both the women at de Brasto 's table had risen to their feet . They broke out volubly , It 's a mistake , officer . ' . . . He did n't mean to ? ' . . . He did n't shoot ? ' . . . This man was acting very ? ' Younghusband was also trying to make his voice heard above those of the women . Do n't you believe what they say , sir , they are all in it together . We have plenty of witnesses . ' Mr. Drake , sir , ' began one of the detectives . Just a moment now , ' interrupted the executive officer . His voice held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll all have every opportunity to speak . First of all let me hear what our detectives have to say . You were in the room when this ? this assault took place ? ' I was here , sir , ' said Bone , stepping forward . Ah , go ahead , Bone . Kindly do not interrupt him , ' he added , glancing meaningly at the rest . I was sitting near the centre of the room when the lights went out . These two men had been bidding against each other in the pool . Quite nasty it got , sir , at one time . ' Which two men , Bone ? ' This man , sir ; he says his name is de Brasto . And the man who has been shot . His name is Smith , V. T. Smith . ' The executive officer nodded . Then the lights went out . While they were out , a shot was fired from his table , ' indicating de Brasto . Then they went up again ? ' The officer cut in . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Because , as soon as the lights went out , sir , I got to my feet . There was some noise down this end of the room and I was looking that way . I saw the flash of the gun . When the lights came on , this de Brasto was standing beside his table . His revolver was still in his hand . Then he dropped it and this gentleman ,  | Mr. Younghusband , who had been sitting with Mr. Smith , grabbed him . Of course , there was plenty of pushing and crowding ; as soon as I could , I got here and took him in charge . I have his gun ; there 'll be no doubt about the prints on it ' Heddes , can you confirm this ? Just a minute , sir , Mr. Younghusband , is it ? Just let me hear what Mr. Heddes has to say . ' No sir , I ca n't , ' spoke Heddes , replying to the first question . I was n't here . Except I saw Bone get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in the lounge . I got up , of course . Then I heard the shot in here . Before I 'd got out of the door of the lounge and past the elevators , the lights went up again . I saw Stym ? , er , one of the men we 're watching , just going into the smoking-room here . I jumped along and said , " I 'd like to have at look at you . " Thought it had sounded like a shot , you know , sir , though I was n't sure . Well , he resisted , tried to break away . ' Just a moment , Heddes . ' The two hospital attendants had reappeared , and the detective stepped back a pace or two . In complete silence they lifted Smith 's corpse , lowered it on to their stretcher , which they had placed across two chairs , and departed once more through the port doorway forward . The silence was maintained for some seconds . The young man who had pled with Dr. Pell , sitting now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side , looked up for an instant as the bearers passed him . He said , Ugh , ' in a grating voice , and resumed his set posture . Heddes stepped forward again . He continued in the same tone . We struggled for quite a bit , until part of the emergency squad came up and held him . I found two holsters on him , one under his arm and the other in a gun-pocket in his trousers . No gats in ' ern . I did n't want to make a show there , so I sent him down to the brig with two of the men , to hold him there until I get a chance to get down and give him a good go-over . Then  | I came on in and saw Bone getting the gun from the floor , as I said . Then someone said there was a pearl necklace missing and we 've been looking around for it since . It 's nowhere around the floor or these tables . We ought to search these people right now , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ominous look at de Brasto 's party . What 's this about a necklace ? ' began the executive officer , when Younghusband broke in imperatively . Yes , sir , that 's perfectly right . Miss Smith was wearing a very valuable pearl necklace ; had been all evening . I saw it just before the lights went out . Later it was gone ; and her neck was scratched where it had been jerked off . There , ' he cried suddenly , pointing to the wreckage on the table at which he had sat , there 's one of the pearls now ! ' He leaned over and rescued the small globe from where it lay imprisoned between the fragments of a glass . The officer took it and looked at it curiously . Perhaps it only broke when she fainted , ' he said . The rest of it may be here somewhere , too . ' Heddes was peering around his side . No , sir , ' he insisted , there 's no more of those around here at all . We 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . Only place we have n't looked was on top of that very table . ' Of course not , ' clamoured Younghusband . Pearls like that have knots between each of them . That 's a valuable stone , Officer . When the necklace was broken , that one fell off , but none of the others . I insist on being searched . Everyone here should want to be . Furthermore , ' he hurried on , I want to confirm what your man has already told you . That Jew there shot Mr. Smith . We all saw him . They had been having a little brush over the bidding , and when the lights went out , he saw a chance to shoot and throw his gun away . But they came up too soon . Everyone in the room saw him with the gun in his hand . I was right next him here ; he shot right past my face . I charge him with murder , Officer . I demand that he be arrested . And I  | want those people searched ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Those are serious words , Mr. Younghusband . ' I repeat , sir , ' said Younghusband . I charge that man with murder . And I want these people searched . ' Does anyone object to a search ? ' The officer , though impressed , still seemed somewhat in doubt . The larger of the two women raised a shrill voice . Certainly we object , Officer . No one at this table took any necklace . We were nowhere near that girl . You wo n't search me , I can tell you. , The voice of the large , red-faced man who still sat next her and , so far , had taken no part in the proceedings , boomed forth deeply . Yes , we object to being searched . I am Stander , Bering Y. Stander , and Mr. de Brasto is my law partner in New York . The lady who has just spoken is his wife , and the other lady is mine . I do not believe Mr. de Brasto shot the man at all . I was sitting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else 's . In the excitement his revolver was discharged accidentally , that 's all . He was n't even facing toward the man . And most certainly we know nothing of a necklace . I protest most vigorously against the indignity of a search . ' The officer was plainly perplexed . What do you say about this , Mr. de Brasto ? In the face of the evidence you can not deny you fired a shot . What explanation have you to offer ? ' Do n't you say anything , Saul , ' counselled his partner . This man is not the captain and this is only a preliminary investigation . You wait until the real hearing . Meantime , I will consult with you . ' What about it , Brasto ? ' The man was still badly shaken . At his first attempt no sound came from his lips . Then , I have nothing to say , ' he managed . That attitude will get you nowhere , sir . If you persist in it , I shall have to order you confined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Brasto . Very well . You are under arrest ; when we are through here , you will be taken ' below . Now , let 's see ; do you think a search necessary , Mr. Bone ? ' I demand ? ' began Younghusband . One moment , one moment . Well , Bone ? ' We 'll have to search them , sir . If one of them has it , and we let them go , they might hide it anywhere . It 's a pity we did n't know before everyone else got away . But there 's no use letting these birds fly . ' That 's right , sir . We ought to search ' em now , ' confirmed the other detective . Stander growled , You 'll hear more of this ? ' The executive officer cut him short . I 'm in charge here . I 'll take the responsibility . You will all be searched . Heddes , you have a man in confinement now . You 'd better go down and get through with him ; you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , send us a stewardess and a couple of screens . We 'll get through with this at once . Tell them to make it right away , please . ' With Heddes ' departure an uncomfortable silence fell . No one seemed inclined to make the next move . It was not until a competent-looking stewardess arrived , followed by two sailors bearing a pair of large screens , that the executive officer recollected a witness hitherto unheard . After directing the setting-up of the screens in opposite corners of the room , I suppose , Doctor , you will not object to the formality of a search , ' he ventured . In your case , I scarcely feel able to insist , but you can help us greatly if you are willing . It will be much better if everyone is treated alike . ' Dr. Schall made a wry face . I ca n't say I like it , ' he answered . But yes , of course , I can see it would be better . ' Thank you , Doctor . Then will you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detective Bone will search the men , while the stewardess is attending to the ladies . I 'd like a few words with you while the others are , ' he smiled , undergoing what I hope is a useless ordeal . ' In a few moments the doctor again presented himself . Now , Doctor , what can you tell me of this affair ? ' Nothing , I am afraid , that you have not already heard . I was sitting with a friend at one of the alcove tables behind these . During the darkness I heard and saw the shot , and when the lights came back , I saw the man whom your detective accused , drop the gun . There can be no doubt that it was he who fired the shot . ' What about the incident of the bidding ? Was there a serious fracas ? ' Dr. Schall appeared to consider . Then he said slowly : Well , no ; I should not have thought so at the time . Certainly the man who was shot seemed to have decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He overbid him drastically whenever it seemed likely he might get a number . But I must say he did it well , almost impersonally . I never even saw him look across at the other table . ' And Brasto , or whatever his name is , how did he take it ? ' The doctor shrugged . Not so well . But you know the man 's an excitable type . And , so far as I could see , it was the women who became really disagreeable about it . On these boats , you know , sir , you have many people who , how shall I say , are a trifle lacking in background . ' The officer nodded . Yes , I know what you mean , but after all , we ca n't help that . ' He dismissed the side topic . Now just what did you find when you came over to these tables ? And , by the way , how soon did you get here ? ' Oh , I got here right away . I saw at once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone sat in their  | chairs , quite stunned . I found the man they call Smith dead . He must have died instantly . His daughter  --  I believe it was his daughter  --  was in a faint , or at least it seemed at the moment that she had fainted . I ca n't understand why she is so long coming out of it . A weak heart , no doubt . And , well , I guess that 's about all I can tell you . ' The doctor stopped speaking . Then he seemed to recollect another point , and continued . Oh , yes , about this necklace you are looking for . Of course I do n't know whether she really was wearing it ; I had n't noticed it , but I can see no reason to doubt the statement . What I want to mention is the small wound on the young lady 's neck . It was only a scratch , but it might very easily have been made if a necklace had been snatched away from her . Just a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cut could have been caused by many other means , a broken glass , for instance , if she had fallen across the table . But she had n't . ' By this time both the women had been searched and most of the men . De Brasto 's party had defiantly resumed their seats ; their attitudes spoke plainly of their vindication . The detective came round the corner of his screen and approached the pale young man who continued to sit in an almost crouching position to one side . Will you come with me ? ' he asked quietly . You 're the last . ' The young man struggled to his feet . He was white as a ghost and seemed scarcely to know where he was . The executive officer looked at him not unkindly . Just a moment , young man . I do n't believe I 've heard yet what your name is . ' Oh  --  ah  --  Gnosens , sir . John I. Gnosens . Ah ? ' How was that ? Nuisance , did you say ? ' No-sens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss ? that is I was at Mr. Smith 's table . ' All right , my boy . Go ahead now . We 'll be through in a  | few minutes . That lad needs a bracer , ' he added to the doctor , as Gnosens stumbled after the detective . ' He 's all in . ' ' He certainly does , ' agreed Schall . ' I 'll give him one when he comes back . ' The officer turned to the rest of the party . ' We have practically finished to-night , ' he said ; ' unless anyone of you has something to add that I have not heard . Come , Mr. Brasto , I do n't want to arrest you . Ca n't you give us some explanation of your behaviour ? ' De Brasto seemed now to have composed himself completely . In a decided voice he repeated his former decision . ' I have nothing to say at present . ' ' Very well , ' snapped the executive officer with some heat . ' You are under arrest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . There will be a hearing in the captain 's office at nine-thirty . Everyone now present will be there promptly . Ah , Heddes , you have finished with your prisoner and turned him loose ? ' Heddes had just re-entered the room and his face broke into a broad grin . ' I guess not , sir . But I 've found the necklace ! It was in a little pocket at the back of his vest . He 'd had no time to get rid of it . Lucky I grabbed him when I did . ' From his own pocket he produced a magnificent string of rose-touched pearls , practically intact , and triumphantly offered it for inspection . As everyone bent forward to see the exhibit , Dr. Pell entered hurriedly through the main entrance . He came up to the group around the two tables with a grave expression and addressed himself at once to the executive officer . ' I have some further information for you , Mr. Drake . I have found , not one , but two bullets in Mr. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must also tell you that , despite all I could do , the young lady we took above has died . ' Returning to the group , Gnosens was coming up behind the doctor . As he heard the latter 's words , he came to an abrupt  | stop . The last vestige of colour drained from his face , and he fell forward at full length on the floor . The suite of the Meganaut 's captain would have been unbe-lievable to a commander of thirty , or even twenty , years ago . It comprises a bedroom , a large bath- and dressing-room with a built-in shower and wardrobes , a dining-room and service pantry , a commodious office and a comfortable living-room containing a brick fire-place . From such surroundings Captain Horace Mansfield superintended the operation of his ship , maintaining among his officers and men an almost military discipline . Hardly ever did he appear in the public rooms of his vessel during a voyage , and never in the dining saloons , except when inspecting ; occasionally he took a meal with his officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but usually he dined alone or with his executive officer . Of all his subordinates it was only to the latter that he allowed himself , upon occasion , to unbend . The present morning was to be one of those occasions . Seated at breakfast with his trusted junior , the captain attacked an ice-cold grapefruit with vigour . Have the repairs been com-pleted yet , Mr. Drake ? ' he inquired , between mouthfuls . Hastily swallowing a piece of his own fruit , the executive officer replied that they had not . The men have been working all night , ' he continued , but I am afraid the damage was more extensive than we thought . The two main dynamos were prac-tically ruined . The armatures were simply melted together , and every fuse in the main circuit was blown . The fuses , of course , were replaced immediately , but the dynamos are an-other matter . The chief electrician tells me , sir , that we shall have to lay to during the final adjustments ; the armatures naturally have to be adjusted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary vibration makes this impossible . ' How long does he want ? ' Several hours , sir , I believe , at the least . He says the job is too important to be hurried . I 'm afraid there 's no doubt he 's right . ' I suppose so , ' growled the captain . I must say , though , that I 've never heard of such a thing happening before . How lightning could ever reach those dynamos down in the engine-room is beyond me . You 're certain it had nothing to do with that trouble in the smoking-room ? ' I 've been into it thoroughly with the chief electrician , sir . We have examined the whole system for any signs of tampering and there are absolutely none . The electrician happened to be there himself when it occurred . He is certain that the lightning struck one of the funnels instead of grounding through a mast , and was carried through the walls and floors to the dynamos , where its force was sufficient to pass through their insulations . Incidentally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never designed to hold anything like a million volts . I think we must conclude that the lightning did it , sir . No one in the smoking-room , even if he had an accomplice somewhere else , could possibly have effected it . ' Apparently not , ' the captain concluded . Unless his accomplice was God . ' During the recital the steward had cleared away the grapefruit and brought in a substantial repast of bacon and eggs , jams , marmalade , toast and muffins , and coffee . You can go now , Mann , ' the captain directed him , as he finished pouring the hot coffee into their cups . Close the door and see that I am not disturbed . I will ring when I want you again . ' For a while they ate in silence . The captain 's appetite was always hearty , and the executive officer , having remained on duty all night , was easily prepared to equal him . At length the captain wiped his mouth , took a deep draught of water and  | turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he presented a frankly worried countenance . Tell me , Drake , ' he said , have you made anything further of this damnable situation since you left me at two o'clock this morning ? ' To tell you the truth , sir , ' replied his executive , I have n't had much time to think about it . But it has certainly occurred to me that this affair is perhaps not quite as simple as I thought at first . There 's the man who got away with the necklace ; what is his relation to the mix-up ? Then Bone told me that in the first excitement this de Brasto accused Smith of firing at him , or attempting to . Everyone seems to have thought that they were strangers to each other , but after all what do we know of them ? There may have been some connection that we know nothing about . ' We know this much about Smith , ' asserted the captain gloomily . He was one of the richest men in America . And one of the best known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To have had him shot in one of our saloons is a terrible blow to the boat . It is a very serious thing under any circumstances ; and the only way we can save any face for the Line is to have the whole thing completely cleared up . Everything having the slightest bearing on this horrible situation must be brought to light . We must establish the culprit without any doubt whatsoever , and we must collect sufficient evidence to make certain of his conviction . My God , ' the captain exclaimed bitterly , to think of a murder being committed on my boat , , my boat ! ' Drake , who understood that to his superior the honour of the ship was as precious as that of their - daughters is to most men , attempted consolation . Well , sir , so far as the shooting itself is concerned , there should be no difficulty . Although it took place in the dark , there seems to be no doubt at all as to who did it . The flash and noise could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who saw the gun in de Brasto 's hand when the lights went up a few seconds later . No matter what else comes out , I do n't see how that can be got round . It 's as plain as if it had happened in broad daylight that de Brasto shot him . By the way , sir , have you had the report on him yet ? ' Yes . Came in this morning . It was n't very full , but as much as we could hope for in the middle of the night , I suppose . Stander and de Brasto are in the law ; the firm is poorly thought of , in fact they have a rather shady reputation , but they seem to have always kept on the safe side . They have never actually been charged , although it appears that some investigation or other skirted pretty close to them no longer ago than last year . ' He seemed rather a slimy specimen last night . And he was certainly in a funk . Was there anything in the report on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course there was much more on Smith than on de Brasto . He was the regular American self-made millionaire . Started from nothing and made his first fortune in lead mines ; then he branched out and now he is credited with having his finger in the pie in a dozen different lines . No one knows what he 's worth , but the estimates range from two hundred to six hundred millions . Seems to have been a rough customer but well enough liked by those who did n't happen to be on the opposite side of the fence . Of course he had plenty of enemies too , must have had with that sort of career . For all we know de Brasto may have been one of them . Well , there 's no use our guessing about it . ' We 'll get something out of him this morning , sir . Although it may be hard to get him to talk . That partner of his advised him not to , last night . They may stick to that programme . ' He will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're not on land now , with a paid judge to back them up . And they 'll damn soon find it out , if they try any monkey business here . ' He straightened up and poured out another cup of coffee .  | Have one , Drake ? ' Receiving a negative answer , he went on , We ca n't do much here talking . I 'll see if they 're ready yet . ' Mann appeared at the door immediately , in response to the bell . Mann , ' the captain addressed him , you can take those people into the sitting-room ; the office will be too small . How many of them are here ? ' They are all here , sir , ' answered the steward . Except Dr. Pell and the  --  ah , the prisoner , sir . Mr. Bone has not brought him in yet , sir . ' The steward disappeared , and Drake got up from his seat , crushing out his cigarette . The captain also stood up and smoothed out the full dress uniform he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face set itself in stern lines . Let us go , Mr. Drake , ' he said . That is the second time you have interrupted , Mr. Stander , ' said the captain . He spoke with some heat . I want you to understand that this investigation is not to be obstructed with interruptions or otherwise . I will not allow it for a moment . Proceed , Mr. Bone , if you please . ' The captain stood at the end of the long table that occupied the centre of his sitting-room . As he resumed his seat , he shot a quick glance around the comfortably furnished apartment . On the divan at his left were de Brasto and his party of the night before . Gnosens and Younghusband , with the two doctors , sat in leather upholstered chairs near the foot of the table , and on the captain 's right were the two detectives and his executive officer . The side lights and the handsome lamp in the middle of the table furnished the illumination , for although the morning was gloriously bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows to shut out the gaze of any of the  | curious who might be walking the boat deck . At each of the doors , one to the deck , the other to the captain 's office and dining-room , a pair of sailors stood stiffly to attention . The detective continued his interrupted evidence . As I said , sir , the two men had been fighting over the bidding . Mr. de Brasto had got himself quite worked up ; his people became very angry because Mr. Smith was always overbidding him . Then the lights went out and he fired . I saw the shot and I saw him drop his gun when the lights came up . I took the gun and it is in evidence , sir . It is a .38 , the same calibre as the bullet that killed Mr. Smith . As there were so many witnesses , we have not bothered to take any prints from the grip . There is no question about it , sir ; the man is guilty . He got so mad at his opponent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain called upon Younghusband , who corroborated Bone 's testimony in every particular . Dr. Schall came next , his evidence being to the same effect . The captain then turned to the ship 's doctor . Dr. Pell , what is the medical finding ? Have you made any autopsy ? ' I have not had an opportunity to make a detailed autopsy , sir , as yet ; in fact , I can see no reason why one should be necessary . The cause of death is perfectly obvious ; Mr. Smith was shot and his heart was punctured . In such a case death must supervene immediately . To be sure , there appear to be certain features , of a purely technical nature , which I should like to discuss with Dr. Schall and which I should very much like to clear up by means of an autopsy , if possible . But in view of the nature of the wound , they can have no bearing on the present investigation . I have no hesitation in saying that Mr. Smith died as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was there more than one ? ' To be strictly accurate , there was only one wound , sir . But I discovered two bullets in the body . They had entered at the  | same place , one very slightly above the other , and both had ruptured the heart . I have recovered these bullets and they are in evidence . They are both of .38 calibre . ' Is that all , Doctor ? ' That is all , sir . ' I will recall Mr. Bone , ' said the captain . Mr. Bone , how many shots had been discharged from Mr. de Brasto 's revolver when you took charge of it ? ' The detective got to his feet once more . I have been puzzled about that , sir , ' he admitted grudgingly . Only one shot had been fired and all the other chambers were filled . There was only one shot that I heard , sir . I do n't know where the second bullet could have come from , but I know who fired the first one . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired it , ' he insisted ; I saw him do it . ' The captain 's face wore a frown of perplexity . If there were two bullets , ' he considered , there must have been two shots . ' He looked around the room . Is there anyone here who heard the second shot ? Did Mr. Smith have a gun of his own ? ' De Brasto 's party said nothing , but Dr. Schall , Younghusband and the detective were certain that they had heard no more than one shot fired . That shot had been so loud in the darkened and momentarily quiet smoking-room , that it would have been utterly impossible for them to have missed a second explosion . Gnosens sat forward in his chair with his hands tightly clenched ; he stared ahead of him and made no remark . Both Bone and Dr. Pell were positive in their assurances that the victim had been unarmed . The executive officer leaned over and touched Captain Mansfield 's arm . May I ask a question , sir ? ' Certainly , Mr. Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Pell , that Mr. Smith had carried one of these bullets in his body , having been wounded on some previous occasion ? We understand that Mr.  | Smith came from the western part of the United States . Is it possible that he might have received this bullet in his younger days ? ' ' It is entirely out of the question , Mr. Drake , ' the doctor answered . ' Absolutely impossible . Mr. Smith could not have carried either of those bullets for ten seconds without dying . Also , on medical grounds , neither of them could have been in his body for any period when I removed them . Their appearance before I had them cleaned , established at once that they had recently entered . ' ' I see , ' said Drake . ' Thank you , Doctor . ' ' It is time we heard from Mr. de Brasto , ' the captain announced , turning to the man who up to now had sat perfectly still on the end of the couch . ' You have heard the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . What have you to say in your defence ? ' Before de Brasto could speak , his partner leaned across from the other end of the divan and said in a clearly audible undertone , ' Do n't say a word until we land , Saul . Remember what I told you . ' ' Mr. Stander , ' cried the captain sharply , ' I have warned you before . I will not tolerate your interference in this matter . Leave the room at once , sir . Mr. Drake , have one of your men take him out . ' ' I have a perfect right ? ' began the portly lawyer . Before he could complete the sentence , one of the sailors was at his side and attempted to take his arm . With a sudden movement Stander threw the man away from him against the table . The captain rose abruptly from his chair . His face had paled slightly with anger and his voice was deadly quiet . He motioned to the remaining sailor . ' Take this man below . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he directed . ' I shall teach you , sir , ' he continued to the astonished lawyer , ' who is in command of this vessel . I  | do n't know what you can do at home , and I do n't care . According to international convention this ship , while at sea , is entirely under my jurisdiction . My investigation of this murder will take place while we are at sea , not after we have landed . You have obstructed my hearing in spite of repeated warnings , and you have assaulted one of my men in the performance of his duty . For that you will be confined as I have directed . Do you intend to go peaceably , or shall I have you handcuffed and carried ? Kindly make up your mind at once . ' Why , I ? This is the most high-handed ? When I reach ? ' When you reach wherever you are going , you can do as you please . While you are on my ship , sir , you will obey my regulations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two sailors had escorted the still protesting Stander from the room , the captain turned to those who were left . You have seen , ladies and gentlemen , that I will stand no nonsense . The matter we are engaged upon , is by far the most serious that has ever come under my hand , and I am determined to make a final disposition of it . Any further obstruction will not only meet with immediate punishment here , but I shall prefer the most serious charges against the culprit the moment we reach port . I am in earnest , I assure you . Let us proceed with the investigation . Mr. de Brasto ? ' No one had failed to be impressed by the captain 's action ; de Brasto , in particular , had quickly decided that silence was no longer the better part of caution . Small beads of perspiration gleamed on his pale forehead as he addressed himself to the task of explaining his position . There is no doubt , Captain , ' he began in a subdued voice , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were guilty of this crime . ' That is so , Mr. de Brasto . Do you wish to plead guilty to this murder ? ' I do not ! ' de Brasto cried , suddenly vehement . I do not even  | care to claim immunity on the ground that I might incriminate myself . I never had the slightest intention of shooting Mr. Smith , and I did not shoot him ! ' How can you deny that you did so , in the face of all these witnesses ? ' I do not deny firing a shot , nor do I know where it went . But I do know that it went nowhere near Mr. Smith , because I shot it in an entirely different direction . ' That is a strange statement , Mr. de Brasto . Why did you fire at all , may I ask ? ' I fired at a man who was drawing a gun to kill me in the dark . I saw him in the right hand door of the smoking-room just as the lights went out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no time to do anything but get out my own revolver and shoot . ' Who was this man ? ' I do n't know . That is , I do n't know his name , or the name he is travelling under . He has been following me about ever since I got on board . I 've caught him several times spying on me . And last night he found the chance he had been waiting for . I tell you I did n't dare not defend myself . ' Why had you not reported this before , Mr. de Brasto ? You know well enough that such behaviour would not be allowed to continue for an hour aboard this ship . Why did you not appeal to my officers ? ' I did n't care to , Captain . There would have been notoriety ; I did n't want it . And I was n't sure about him until I saw him drawing a gun . ' It comes to this , then . You say a mysterious man has been following you about . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights went out last night and you saw him drawing a gun . You then fired at him . No , I 'm afraid that wo n't hold , Mr. de Brasto ; that is a pretty thin yarn , if you will permit me to say so . And where did your shot go ?  | No one was found wounded by that door . In fact , no one , so far as we know , has been wounded on the boat , except Mr. Smith . ' How do I know where it went ? I shot as quickly as I could , and in the dark . Perhaps I missed him . Maybe the bullet is in the door or on the deck . I do n't know , but I swear that 's the truth , Captain , so help me God ! ' Surely , sir , you can not expect us to take this as an explanation . Who is this strange man ? Do you expect us to believe that you fired at some stranger because you thought he had been spying upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably for a handkerchief ? ' But he did fire at me . I saw the flash of his gun ! ' What ? Why , everyone is agreed that there was only one shot . You have heard that brought out . ' There was only one in my neighbourhood . But no one was paying any attention to the opposite end of the room . His shot came from there ; it was just a little ahead of mine and ? ' We shall have to look into this , of course , ' said the captain . Mr. Drake , will you kindly go below and see if there are any signs of Mr. de Brasto 's bullet where he claims it should be ? Look very carefully around the starboard doorway ; also out on deck where it should have struck , had it gone out through the door . And find out from the stewards if there was any trace of blood on deck when they cleaned up the winter garden last night . ' The executive officer had already started to leave when the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he added , I believe you have a list of all the passengers who were in the smoking-room last evening . See if you can locate any who were near the starboard doorway . Let us be sure about this shot that Mr. de Brasto says was fired at him . Detective Bone , you should know most of the passengers by sight now . Do you recall anyone in particular who was near there ? '  | Well , ' the detective considered , yes , sir . I remember a large party in that part of the room ; I think the name is van Ness . De Witt van Ness , I think . Shall I see if I can find him , sir ? ' Do so , Mr. Bone . All right , Mr. Drake , you may go . Now , ' when the two men had departed , I want to be perfectly fair to you , Mr. de Brasto ; that 's why I am having this search made . But to be frank , I think it is probably a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The appearance of the accused man was one of complete sincerity . But , do n't you see , Captain , ' he urged , that 's where the bullets came from that killed Smith ? He missed me and hit Smith , who was at the next table to mine . I missed him , too , apparently . I know I should n't have let off a gun in that crowded room , but what was Ito do ? ' Your whole story , sir , ' repeated the captain , including the mysterious stranger , is very hard for me to credit . ' It 's true all the same , Captain , ' de Brasto insisted . Can I see you alone for a few moments ? I can soon convince you that I have not made it up on the spur of the moment . ' You certainly may not see me alone , sir . Everyone here is under oath . If you wish to make a confidential communication , I will exact a statement under oath , remember , from all present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , unless it becomes necessary in the proceedings growing out of this investigation . If you are innocent in this matter , Mr. de Brasto , such a statement should be all that you require . May I have your assurance , ladies and gentlemen ? ' The captain looked keenly around the room . A chorus of agreement greeted his request . Captain Mansfield made sure that everyone had definitely and verbally declared himself , then turned his attention once again to de Brasto . You may feel perfectly secure on this point ; I shall deal personally with any infringement of the promises that have just been given . I may add that you will be well advised to make  | entirely clear anything whatsoever that has a bearing on the shooting . ' It was plainly apparent that de Brasto 's reluctance had been overcome in part only . For some moments he continued to hesitate , before a full appreciation of the captain 's cold and unconvinced attitude turned the scales in favour of frankness . After a short , inward struggle the suspected passenger straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's like this , Captain . Mr. Stander and myself are in the business of law ; and part of our business is to defend criminals , that is , ' he hastily amended , men accused of crime . We have been moderately successful . ' He favoured the company with a deprecating smile . But of course some of our customers , clients , have been a pretty hard lot . Last year we undertook to defend some men who had been charged with murder in connection with a beer racket , and unfortunately we lost our case . Two of the men were convicted and electrocuted , and a third is in prison with a life sentence . In spite of all our efforts , and how Stander and I worked on that case , the other members of the gang accuse us of letting their pals down . It 's crazy , of course , but they believe , or say they do , that a rival mob got to us and bribed us to connive at a conviction . Most unfortunately they have obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misleading , which has confirmed them in their false belief . They have threatened us , they have shot at Stander on the street , and they have wrecked our offices . ' De Brasto paused and shrugged his slim shoulders . What was there for us to do ? We decided to come abroad for a few months and let the storm blow over . Then on the boat I thought I recognized one of the mob that is trying to get us . I became suspicious . Twice I caught this man following me , trying to get me alone in a deserted passageway , but each time I found a steward or another passenger in time . Then last night he came in that door just as the lights were going  | out . I looked up and saw him . He drew his gun and fired , and so did I. My God , Captain , ' de Brasto concluded , wiping away the sudden perspiration , I do n't see yet how he missed me . All that gang are crack shots . ' For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern adventure . His astonishment was reflected in his features when he finally said , But my good man , do you mean to tell me that such lawlessness goes on unchecked in New York City ? And how could some member of this gang of toughs possibly pass himself off as a first-class passenger on board my boat ? Why , it 's unbelievable ! ' Oh , no it is n't , ' he was assured . This particular mob makes three , four hundred thousand a year . The beer is n't the only racket they have , they have strong connections and influence and go about wherever they want to . And one of them is certainly on this ship ! ' Despite his doubts the captain could not avoid being impressed by the urgency of the man 's avowal . He was still frowning over this new affront to his boat when there came a knock at the door and an elderly , smooth-shaven gentleman entered , accompanied by Detective Bone . Mr. van Ness , sir , ' announced the detective , as he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain , Mr. van Ness ; he wants to see you for a few minutes , as I explained . ' The newcomer 's glance went rapidly around the room , as he advanced with a slightly pompous air . Ah , Captain Mansfield , I 'm sure this is an honour , ' he said . Not so much an honour as a duty , ' the captain replied grimly . I am obliged to you for your prompt appearance , Mr. van Ness . We are investigating last night 's unfortunate mishap , and we believe you can be of some assistance . ' Ah , a shocking affair , Captain , shocking , I 'm sure . And how can I be of help ? I shall be only too glad ? ' Yes , yes , Mr. van Ness , we appreciate your offer . Now I believe  | you were sitting near the starboard , that is , the right hand door of the smoking-room last evening when the excitement occurred . Is that right ? Yes . Well , now will you please cast your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , and see if you can help us determine just what happened . ' I shall be most pleased , Captain . Yes , I have cast my mind back , as you suggest . ' Now think most carefully , Mr. van Ness , and tell us how many shots were fired during that period of darkness . ' But , my dear sir , I do n't have to think about that . There was only one ; everybody in the room must have heard it . It was enough to shatter one 's ear drums , Captain . Why ? ' You are perfectly sure ? ' the captain insisted . Think well , Mr. van Ness . We have no idea of doubting your evidence , but it is more important than you may imagine . It has been claimed that a gun was discharged from the doorway , very near where you were sitting , while the room was dark , or just as it became dark . ' De Brasto leaned forward , his face paler than ever . Think , sir , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind you , did you hear anything at all at that time . Anything ? ' The elderly gentleman looked somewhat bewildered . Well , well , ' he ruminated , if it is as vital as this . . . . No . . . no , I certainly heard only one shot . . . . Of course , there were other noises . . . . A scuffle of some kind , but not near me ; and I think a chair fell over . . . . No , I would n't say that , either ; I could n't be sure what it was . . . . And yes , ah yes , indeed , ' he brightened and smiled as everyone 's attention became focused on him , I do remember something that I thought most extraordinary at the time . After the lights had gone out , somebody opened a bottle of soda just behind me . I could n't understand it at all , somebody opening a bottle like that in the dark , ' he finished triumphantly , and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Approbation did not seem to be forthcoming . Everyone 's expression appeared to be covered by the shadow of anti-climax . De Brasto 's face especially was the picture of despondency . Then all at once it was lit up vividly . In his haste he sprang to his feet . That 's it ! ' he cried . Do n't you see , Captain ? It was a silencer ! The hiss was a silencer . No one could have opened a bottle then . That accounts for it . That 's why no one heard the shot . ' Well , ' the captain considered , I suppose it might be so . But I do n't know . I 've never heard a silencer . Do you think it sounds like a bottle of soda ? ' But I have ; that 's just ? ' Captain , ' a voice interrupted from the opposite end of the table . Yes . What is it ? Yes , Mr. Younghusband . ' I do n't believe there was any silencer , sir , or any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle in the dark . We were all surprised and no one knew quite what he was doing for a moment . In my opinion , Captain , this whole cock and bull story is being just cooked up for the occasion . ' But it is not ! ' de Brasto cried . A silencer also hides the flash . I saw a glare when the shot was fired , but I do n't remember any noise . I thought it was because I was so excited that I did n't remember it , but now I see that there really was n't any noise to hear . ' The captain shook his head slightly , as if to accommodate the new aspect of the situation . Your case is certainly strengthened considerably , Mr. de Brasto , ' he admitted . Upon this basis we have now accounted for both bullets , at least . Accidental manslaughter is the gravest charge that can be brought against you , if your story is true . If so , it would appear that both you and this gangster fired at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong man . '  | But I could n't have hit him , sir . Mr. Smith was behind me to my left . I was almost in a line between him and the door . My back was to him when I fired . Both of the bullets that killed him were meant for me . ' Once more all eyes were turned upon van Ness . The captain immediately demanded : Did you hear two of these hisses , Mr. van Ness ? ' No , I did not . ' The latest witness was positive . I am sure there was only one , and I am sure I am not mistaken . It was a long hiss , as if the top were being pried off a bottle slowly , but I know it was not repeated . ' No , I 'm afraid we ca n't allow you two shots from the doorway , Mr. de Brasto , ' was the captain 's conclusion . Still , I do n't quite see how you could both manage to hit the same man by mistake . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? ' Pell 's face evidenced his astonishment at the turn affairs had taken . In a surprised voice , he replied : But there was only one wound , sir . You will understand my amazement when I tell you that the second bullet entered through the aperture made by the first . You will bear me out , Dr. Schall ? ' He turned perplexedly to his colleague . That is so , ' the latter confirmed . The wound was no doubt enlarged by whichever bullet entered last , but very slightly so . The trajectories could not have been more than half an inch apart , at the most . I suppose there is a chance in some billions that it might happen , but  --  well , it 's incredible . ' The two doctors shook their heads solemnly at each other . It was perhaps fortunate that at this juncture a hurried step was heard outside and the executive officer re-entered the room without knocking . As he burst in , the captain looked up sharply . Somewhat breathless with his haste , Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time beginning to speak .  | I am sorry to interrupt you , sir , but I feel you should have this new evidence at once . We could find no signs of anything near the door , but before I left I went over to refresh my memory as to the exact location of Mr. Smith 's and Mr. de Brasto 's tables . As we were arranging the chairs approximately as they were last night . the chief steward leaned over and noticed a mark in the central leg of Mr. de Brasto 's table . We investigated and found the bullet that I have just given you , sir . I was delayed because we had to break up the table to get it out . It was up near the top of the leg , just below the under side of the table . It was directly in front of where Mr. de Brasto had been sitting and in a line between his position and the starboard entrance . He must have fired too quickly , before his gun had come up level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this discovery , that we can any longer doubt that he fired as he claimed . ' The captain had been comparing the new bullet with the other two which had found a living target and were now lying on the table before him . Yes , ' he said . They are all of the same calibre . This bullet you have just given me , could have come from Mr. de Brasto 's gun . ' Might not the table have been turned around since last night , Captain ? ' queried Younghusband . Perhaps this is the bullet fired from the doorway . ' No , that ca n't be , ' Drake answered him . All the tables in the smoking-room are bolted down . They ca n't be moved or turned in any way . ' If you will look at the side of that bullet , please , Captain , ' suggested de Brasto quickly , I mean the one you have in your hand , you will find a small star cut in the jacket . You will find these stars on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think you will find them on the bullets that struck Mr. Smith . The concern that sells me my ammunition , mark their products that way ; I 've just remembered it . All the time I 've  | known there was some little point that would clear me . Thank God I 've got it at last . ' An immediate examination bore out the assertion . Well , Mr. de Brasto , ' the captain said thoughtfully , I guess that settles the matter . I have no option but to consider the charge against you dismissed . Nevertheless , it is fully established that you let off your gun in my smoking-room ; and I intend to hold you to account for that inexcusable action . When we reach port , you will not leave this boat without my permission . Meanwhile you are free to go where you will on the ship . You have no more firearms in your possession , have you ? ' No , sir , ' answered de Brasto . His voice was both relieved and subdued . In view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having Detective Bone search the cabins occupied both by you and by Mr. Stander for other weapons . You will give him every assistance in his duty . ' There was a slight pause . Now furthermore , I am led to believe by your story that there is a dangerous criminal at large on this ship . By the way , it 's not by any chance the man who was arrested last night ? ' If it is , sir , ' spoke up Bone , he did n't give any sign of it this morning . They both had breakfast together below . ' He indicated de Brasto by a jerk of his head . I still think this man had something to do with the murder , sir . It stands to reason no one could get as mad as ? ' That is finished , Mr. Bone , ' replied the captain decidedly . There is quite sufficient proof as to where Mr. de Brasto 's bullet went . ' He turned to the latter . You say you know what the man who shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have below ? ' No , sir . He is not at all like that man , Captain . And now that you have disarmed me , how am I to protect myself ? That man is still after me ; he wo n't stop until he gets me , either . '  | If you are nervous , I will speak to the chief steward about having your cabin changed quietly . Also I intend to detail one of my officers to be near you constantly until we have captured that man and put him where he can do no more harm . If you will wait in your cabin , he will report to you in mufti in a short time . I am afraid your opponent may be on the look-out for our detective . I want you to agree upon a sign with my officer , who will be armed , and at your first glimpse of him I want that man taken . I am very serious about this , Mr. de Brasto ; do n't you try to incriminate him , leave that to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my boat , that 's final . ' The captain rose from his chair and made a general survey of the room . He continued in a different tone : The hearing will be adjourned for the present , ladies and gentlemen . It would seem that the man responsible for Mr. Smith 's death , is the criminal of whom Mr. de Brasto has told us . Our first task must now be to effect his capture . Of course I shall expect you to hold yourselves in readiness to assist us , but on the other hand it may not be necessary for us to trouble you further . At all events I wish you would accept my thanks for the cooperation you have offered this morning . That is all , ladies and gentlemen . Thank you again . ' As they all rose to file out , Younghusband broke the silence with : Anything I can do , Captain ? I wish you would call upon me . I am very anxious to see the man responsible for Mr. Smith 's death brought to justice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me help . ' You are no more anxious than I am , Mr. Younghusband . I shall be very glad of your assistance . After luncheon I shall meet with our detectives in my office to discuss the situation . If you care to attend as a friend of Mr. Smith , I shall be pleased to have you . ' Thank you , sir . I shall be there , ' said Younghusband . He  | bowed slightly and left the room . The others also walked to the door held open by the sailor guard ; the last to pass out were the two women and young Gnosens , none of whom had said a word during the hearing , beyond giving their names when they first entered the room . Gnosens looked pale and ill ; it could be seen that he had passed a sleepless night despite the doctor 's tonic . He stumbled out , and the captain and his executive officer were left alone . Well , sir , ' said Drake more cheerfully than he had spoken since the previous evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lie hidden long aboard ship . We should have him locked up by to-night or to-morrow morning . ' The captain shook his head doubtfully . I 'm not so sure of that , Drake . We ca n't hold de Brasto after the evidence of the bullet you found . But I am not so greatly taken by the story of the hypothetical gangster he saw in the doorway . Although of course it may be true . Even so , ' he added , as he reached for a cigarette , do n't forget that we still have one extra bullet to account for . '  | PART TWO DR . FRANK B. HAYVIER : CONDITIONING HE sun was setting in mid-Atlantic . Behind the Meganaut it burst forth from beneath a bank of low clouds far to the westward , flooding the sun deck and the stern in golden brilliance . Already the covered deck spaces forward were darkening ; in the winter garden with its thick windows and towering palms the early arrivals for the cocktail hour found it gloomy until a steward switched on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of the wiser passengers , already arrayed for the evening , found their way to the Veranda Cafe which still basked in sunset glory . In comfortable wicker chairs , behind small , glass-topped tables , they prepared to enjoy Martinis and salted nuts while gazing out into the orange and purple splendour of the west . Far beneath them the boat 's wake trailed out from its white point under the stern to a broad , flat plume that finally intermingled with the green , following swells and was lost . A few points to the north the glaring , molten path of the sun spread a blinding carpet from their feet to the horizon . At the moment not more than half a dozen passengers were enjoying the advantages of this corner of the ship . They glanced curiously , and most of them with something approaching pity , at the haggard , nervous youth who for five hours or longer had  | sat alone in the farthest corner . His long legs , still clad in plusfours , were stretched out before him , his head with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . Occasionally he fingered his face with a twitching hand , but for the most part he sat motionless and stared at nothing . Younghusband , himself sleek and dinner-jacketed for the coming night , rounded the corner . Interrupting his walk , he made his way at once to the side of his acquaintance . My dear fellow , ' he said solicitously , seating himself at the table . Whatever is the matter ? You look like a ghost . Do you know it 's past six-thirty ? Time you went down and dressed . ' The other looked up slowly , and presently succeeded in focusing his gaze upon his companion . It 's late , ' Younghusband repeated . It 's time you got dressed . ' Gnosens responded hollowly : Dressed ? What the hell is there to get dressed for ? ' Dinner , I should say . ' Dinner .... Christ . ' Say , look here , what 's the matter with you ? Of course , it 's been a shocking business . But after all , we hardly knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be long before they have the man who fired the shots . Although I 'm still rather suspicious about that de Brasto , myself . ' It 's lucky for him , ' said Gnosens suddenly , that they found his bullet . I 'd have torn his heart out . If I had to kill his jailer first . ' But why are you so excited about it ? You did n't know them ; I introduced you to Miss Smith myself , not more than three days ago . ' An involuntary shudder ran down Gnosens 's long frame . Oh , my God , ' he groaned . Ah ! ' Younghusband 's bewilderment was illuminated by a ray of comprehension . You had fallen for her ? ' If that 's what you call it , ' said Gnosens , hopelessly . I was  | going to ask her to marry me , last night . ' Younghusband 's face was the picture of sincere astonishment . But , but ? . After knowing her two days ? Do you seriously mean to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know her very well myself , ' he continued , surprised into indiscretion , but I think you might have made a serious mistake . It is possible that she was not just the kind of girl you thought . ' The words did not penetrate Gnosens 's consciousness for some seconds . When they did , his long body jerked itself up in one swift movement . His pose was tensely minatory . Behind his eyes a fire burned redly . His voice was low , clear , ominous . Get . . . out . . . while . . . you ... can . ' For an instant Younghusband regarded him questioningly . Then he got quickly to his feet . You 're out of your mind , ' he said coldly . I advise you to go to bed and get some sleep . ' He turned abruptly on his heel and walked off . Gnosens , as if exhausted by the brief outburst , half rose and then slumped back into his former position . Another figure , a paunchy little man in a dress suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Will you excuse me ? ' he asked with a slight , foreign accent . I could not help overhearing . You are in trouble ; perhaps I can assist . ' Gnosens had not paid the slightest attention to his remark , and the newcomer continued . I am Dr. Malcolm Plechs of Budapest . I am a psychoanalyst . I can see that you have suffered a severe trauma . ' Gnosens looked up . Can you ? ' he asked , in no way flippantly . Of course you have , my boy , ' said Dr. Plechs kindly . It will do you good to talk a little , if you find it possible . Almost everybody has left ; we are quite secluded . Can you bring yourself to tell me a little of this unfortunate young woman who has ? gone ? '  | I love her , ' said Gnosens simply , as if she had not gone at all . I see . . . . I see . . . . Yes . She was very beautiful , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tone ? ' you must pull yourself together . She has died and she will not come back ; you must face the situation . You must not allow it to sink into the unconscious , whence it will trouble and upset the rest of your life . I will help you . I will be glad to help you . Let us face the fact . After all , you have known her but a very short time . ' Five years , ' said Gnosens with a painful grimace , ... five years . ' But I thought ? ' Under the analyst 's sympathetic attitude Gnosens 's pent-up speech burst forth . It was five years ago last week that first I saw Coralie . On my twenty-first birthday . I was at a night club with some friends . She was there with a large party . No one knew her . I cut in , and she danced with me . Five minutes , maybe . I have n't seen her since until this trip . I could n't find out who she was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred girls , but they 're not like her . She 's  --  she 's sort of a goddess ... . And then I found her . I came up the gangplank right behind her . And next day I scraped an acquaintance with that skunk Younghusband and got him to introduce me . I 've waited and searched  --  and I found her . Coralie Smith . And now ? Oh , my God ! ' he cried suddenly . His expression crinkled into a tortured mask and he hid his face in his hands , sobbing violently . The disturbance attracted the attention of two men who were just passing the open rear of the cafe . Commander Drake and his companion hesitated ; the latter peered uncertainly into the darkening room , then turned back and said a few words inaudible at the distance . They approached . What 's this , Doctor ? ' asked the man in the business suit . Something gone wrong ? '  | Ah , it 's you , Pons , ' Plechs answered , his mien troubled . Alas , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young man shrank back , wriggled , finally lifted a tearstained countenance . He spoke in a rather smothered voice . I  --  I do n't want to make a disturbance . Let me go , go away from here . ' Why , man , you 're sick ! ' Pons exclaimed . He looked at the haggard face , the deep circles under the eyes , the crooked mouth . Come , will you let me take you down to your cabin ? ' Gnosens 's grunt was unintelligible , but taking it for assent , Drake helped him to his feet . Pons took his arm and started through the ballroom toward the after stairways , Dr. Plechs and the executive officer bringing up the rear . Where is your state-room ? ' asked Pons casually . Eh , oh , it 's Aroi : They made their way the whole length of the boat without meeting anyone . Before the door Gnosens , after some fumbling , produced his key . During the walk Pons had been covertly observing the young man at his side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how long is it since you 've had any sleep ? ' Do n't know , ' said Gnosens vaguely . Oh , well , night before last maybe . ' And food ? ' Ca n't eat . ' Gnosens stood uncertainly in the middle of the floor , as Drake and the analyst closed the cabin door . How the hell can I eat ! ' Pons regarded him searchingly and spoke with decision . You get undressed and into bed . You 're going to have a double eggnog and then you 're going to sleep . We 're psychologists , not doctors , but I do n't think you need a doctor . You 're worn out and exhausted ; things will look different when you wake up . Dr. Plechs or I will look in on you in the morning . If we can help you get straightened out , we 'd like to . What you need first  | of all is rest . Now do n't be foolish ; go ahead and get undressed , there 's a good fellow . ' Gnosens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped . But I ca n't . They have n't found the murderer yet . ' He looked at Drake , who shook his head in confirmation . I must help find him . I ca n't go to bed until he 's caught ! ' Dr. Plechs looked surprised . I was told the assailant had been apprehended . Is it not true ? ' Was n't the right man , ' Gnosens answered , retrieving a stocking from the floor . But I do n't understand that , ' said Pons , puzzled . I was in the smoking-room last night . I saw the whole thing . The man was arrested on the spot . ' No , ' Drake explained . We found that man 's bullet in his own table . There was another man who is supposed to have fired from the doorway . With a silencer , ' he added , replying to Pons 's puzzled look . We are looking for him . Perhaps I should not say this , but I feel sure you gentlemen are to be trusted . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a hiss ; I remember it distinctly . I 've seen experiments with silencers , and it could have been one , certainly . ' But no one except the man we arrested knows what this other man looks like , ' the executive officer continued . He is looking for him , with a guard , but he has n't found him yet . ' Now you see , ' Dr. Plechs admonished his charge , there is nothing you can do at this minute . I agree altogether with Dr. Pons that you should rest . And later you may be able to give better assistance . ' Pons added his persuasion . That 's right , ' he urged . Please be a good fellow and do as we ask . You can do nothing now . When you 're fresh again , you can help . ' Gnosens , exhausted as he was , could oppose them no longer . he capitulated . But look here , you men are pretty  | clever chaps , I 'd say . If I go to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't think now ; it seems all crazy to me , all mixed up . Will you see if you can help discover who did it ? Mr. Drake , sir , surely the captain will let them ? ' Why , I suppose so . Of course . I 'll be glad to speak to him about it . ' Will you do it ? ' Yes , yes , of course we will . Now do get into bed . We will help if we can ; and we will let you know in the morning everything that has happened . ' A few minutes later Pons , quietly opening the door , heard his deep , regular breathing . Fatigue had accomplished what advice could not . The chief electrician stood very stiffly at attention . The captain had just returned his salute . Will you please inform me , Mr. Holt , ' asked the latter , as to the exact condition of your repairs at the moment ? ' I had hoped to be finished long before this , sir . We have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed . But as soon as we resumed full speed , it became clear that the bases will not hold in their present condition . They have been too badly burnt out , sir . ' I suppose that means you will have to dismantle them again ? How long will the job take ? ' Six hours , at the least . Maybe longer . ' Then it 's too late to begin it now . Eight bells went long ago . You 'll have to start in the morning . ' But we ca n't run more than half speed , sir , if you want the regular dynamos to-night . Wo n't the emergency ones do for this evening ? In that case we can go right ahead ; we 'll have it done before midnight surely . '  | No , Mr. Holt . ' Captain Mansfield was decided . I ca n't have any more disturbance among my passengers . There has been a great deal too much already . The lights must be in correct order as soon as it becomes dark . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Yes , sir . I can guarantee that . I can brace the bases temporarily . ' With another salute the electrician departed . As Captain Mansfield re-entered the office , his steward , a privileged character , duly noted the scowl that darkened his face . When something was seriously amiss , there were no scowls . Nevertheless , Is something wrong , sir ? ' he inquired . Nothing serious , ' responded the captain . But it 's annoying . Already we 've lost a quarter-day . And it looks as if we would lose the third of another one . ' He sat down abruptly and began to go over the log . Four friends sat late in the smoking-room . The attendance had been even larger than usual , the prevalent and recurring topic of conversation being the astounding occurrence of the evening before . But now all had departed to dance or retire , except two couples who still lingered at tables near the main entrance . To all purposes the four in the centre of the room had the saloon to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the contrary they were all authorities ' and all of them were ' eminent ' . Reading from right to left ( rather than in the usual manner ) , there was Dr. Frank B. Hayvier , the well-known behaviourist ; Dr. Malcolm Plechs , the equally well-known psychoanalyst ; there was Dr. L. Rees Pons ( whose first name was Love , and who never allowed this parental oversight to be pronounced in his presence ) , the noted inventor of Integrative  | Psychology , and finally there was Professor Knott Coe Mittle , whose opinions had , scientifically , perhaps more weight than those of any of the others , since , not without care and agility , he had escaped the fate of becoming identified with any of the special , contending cliques in his science . For some time they sat smoking in silence , Pons , whose enormous measurements suggested a limitless capacity , occasionally raising his tall glass , or calling a steward for its replenishment . Professor Mittle broke the interlude . Of course , ' he remarked , as you describe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plechs nodded . And so it is . A most severe psychic trauma . But it needs careful handling . Many abnormalities could be prevented if someone were at hand to offer treatment when such traumata occur . I am most interested to see what can be done . ' I have no doubt , ' the professor replied . Perhaps you can report the case to the Convention when we reach London . ' I shall perhaps make mention of it in my address . If it turns out as I foresee . ' Pons spoke up . While I can not agree with you at all upon the terms you use , I do think you may be able to help the young fellow . I should like to see you do it . ' Dr. Plechs bowed slightly . Too bad , ' said Dr. Hayvier , the fourth member of the quartette , that Pons has no chance to use his lie detector on your subject . You 've got all the gadgets with you , have n't you , Pons ? " Yes . They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least important thing I 've ever done , but no one seems to forget it . The publicity value , I suppose . They can see it work . ' Dr. Plechs felt impelled to return Pons 's compliment . But perhaps you will have the opportunity . I hope so . The young man has urged us to assist in the investigation . Dr. Pons may be able to test the criminal . '  | Oh , that was just to get him to bed . I do n't think the officer took it seriously . I rather wish he had ; it 's an interesting puzzle and I 'd like to see how it comes out . But I guess we wo n't have any chance of that . ' What officer is that ? ' asked Mittle . Oh , trust Pons , ' smiled Hayvier . I ' 11 bet he 's picked up everyone on board by now . Probably be having dinner with the captain to-morrow . ' Pons grinned . A steward approached and stopped before the table . Is Mr. Pons here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliments , sir ; if convenient , he would like to see you two gentlemen in his office . . . . Yes , sir , right away . I will conduct you , if you can come . ' Pons rose with alacrity . Come on with us , ' he said . But we 're not invited ? ' ' Oh , that 's all right . He wants to see us about this crime . We 're to be detectives ; might as well all be in on it . Come along , I 'll get you in , do n't fear . ' Hayvier was persuaded without further argument , but the professor said he would walk to the elevators with them and then go below . All right , ' said Pons . But I think you 're making a mistake . Well , let 's go . We must n't keep his nibs waiting too long for us . ' From which it may be seen that Dr. Pons was not a person of natural reverence . The captain carefully counted out all the bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty-five dollars , just the amount of last night 's pool . Five ten-pound notes , five twenties , seven hundred and thirty dollars in travellers ' cheques , all signed , sixteen dollars in miscellaneous  | coins , thirty in marks and two hundred and nine in francs . Will you count it , please ? ' Thanks .... Yes , I guess that 's right . I do n't know about some of this foreign money ; take your word for it . Where shall I sign ? ' Oh , that wo n't be necessary . I 'll just keep this memorandum , so we can check it later . ' No , I 'd rather , really . Habit I 've got into , maybe ; with laboratory equipment . ' Hayvier smiled and reaching over , signed the memorandum . I 'm sorry I had to trouble you for it , but you know , we psychologists do n't usually have a thousand dollars lying loose in our pockets . ' No trouble at all , Dr. Hayvier . I only hope you are successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good luck . ' Thanks . Of course , you understand I ca n't promise a thing . ' Stuffing the large wad of currency into a side pocket of his suit , the psychologist left . Good luck , ' called Drake after him . At the doorway Hayvier waved his hand in a gesture of acknowledgement , and was gone . Have you had breakfast , Mr. Drake ? ' the captain asked . Well , come in and have a cup of coffee with me , anyhow . I only hope this new scheme will produce some results . ' Captain Mansfield knew little of technical psychology . He had heard of Freud , although not of Dr. Plechs . During his last voyage he had found time to read a tale of mystery in which a noted psychologist had successfully baffled the more ordinary agents of justice and had produced , at the conclusion , a brilliant train of reasoning through which the villain had been seized . Yet Horace Mansfield was a hard-headed and self-reliant man . He was not accustomed to seeking help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caused him to grasp at the straw in Drake 's suggestion . Twenty-four hours had passed with nothing accomplished , while a murderer  | was at large on his ship . The first suspect had been released and the second continued to be viewless . He had come to the reluctant conclusion that his detectives , while qualified to handle the innocuous crooks and professional gamblers of whom no boat can remain free , were not adequate to the solution of a major crime . He was becoming desperate and any suggestion was welcome . But when they had answered his invitation of the night before , the psychologists did not remind him of those illustrious Corinthians of fiction who always get their man . Dr. Plechs in his fashionable dress suit did , indeed , look the part of a professional consultant ; but Hayvier and Pons , the latter of whom scorned to dress for dinner , struck him simply as two very pleasant gentlemen . They all looked capable , and he had no doubt that in their particular field they were capable ; but when all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the searching eye , the inscrutable expression promising inevitable disclosure and punishment , possessed by all master minds . Nevertheless , he had taken these gentlemen into his confidence ; if by any chance they should be able to assist him , it would be foolish not to avail himself of their aid . He promised them his fullest co-operation . Now he was becoming dubious . I do n't know , Drake , ' he complained , after the coffee was poured . I do n't know . ' He shook his head doubtfully . I 'm afraid we wo n't get anywhere this way . What do you suppose he wanted all that money for ? He would n't tell me a thing about it . ' I do n't know , I 'm sure . Damned meticulous he was about it , too , sir . Must have the exact amount paid into the pool last night ; nothing short , nothing over . ' I ca n't imagine , ' echoed the captain . Somehow I 'm afraid it wo n't come to anything . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you know ? '  | I believe , sir , ' said Drake , that it 's the International Convention of the Psychological Association . Or the Convention of the International Psychological Association . So the purser told me when I asked him . There 's one every ten years , he said . This year it 's in London . ' They 'll have a fine time when they get there , ' the captain smiled , reminiscently . Did you ever hear anything like that argument they got into about the Bedido or whatever they called it ? I was greatly surprised . I had no idea that there was any such disagreement among scientists . ' Nor did I. But what got me was what Dr. Hayvier had to say about consciousness . Apparently he does n't believe there is any such thing . ' With a final swallow the captain finished his coffee . Well , ' he concluded , I do n't know what they were talking about . But if Hayvier can find our man for us , I 'll agree with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked about him curiously . He had taken an elevator to the swimming pool on G deck ; thence , by a small stairway hidden behind the suite of apartments devoted to the therapeutic baths , he had descended yet farther into the apparently limitless depths of the ship . Now he stood at the end of a brightly lit , white painted passage directly before a small desk from which an armed sailor had just risen . In a wall bracket beside the man 's chair stood a polished rifle and a few feet further along a steel grill stretched from wall to wall completely across the passageway . Dr. Hayvier presented his pass and the note he had received from the captain . Looking up from a brief perusal of the note , the glance of the sailor fell upon the large wad of bills protruding carelessly from the passenger 's left-hand jacket pocket . You 're going to lose that money , sir . Had n't you best leave it in my desk , until you 're through here , anyway ? '  | No , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologist . Are you ready to help me ? ' Yes , sir . This note says I am to do whatever you direct , sir . ' Good : For the next few minutes Hayvier was occupied in giving the man his instructions and in making sure that they were fully understood . By the way , ' he asked as he concluded , have you many prisoners here now ? ' No , sir , ' answered the guard . Only one passenger . The crew is behaving themselves pretty well these days , ' he added with a grin , as he proceeded to unlock a small door in the steel barrier and to lead the way to one of the cells ' down the passage . Producing a second key , he unlocked the door to this room , allowed the doctor to enter , then closed and locked it again . It was a small , bare chamber , painted entirely in white and containing only an iron berth , a wash basin , a table and a small , straight chair . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a low , insistent purring evidenced the presence of a small ventilator above the wash basin . In the corner stood the prisoner 's steamer trunk , hastily removed from his more luxurious quarters above . What the hell ? ' said the latter , looking up from behind the table , where , to judge by the amount of writing paper scattered over its surface , he was engaged upon a voluminous letter . Good morning , ' responded Hayvier pleasantly . I am F. A. Kerr . I have received permission to come down and see if I can assist you in regard to the charge on which you are held . Your own lawyer , I suppose , is not on board . Mr. Stymond , I be-lieve ? ' That 's me , ' acknowledged the prisoner . Though I do n't know how them dicks found it out . I got a passport for Desmond Gize . This damn radio , I suppose . I was just writing my lawyer ; hell of a lot of good he is to me now . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation trip , Mr. Stymond , may I ask ? '  | Yeah  --  for my health . ' The prisoner grinned , not pleasantly . Kerr nodded , as one man of the world to another . A little unhealthy at home , eh ? Something go wrong with your drag ? ' Naw . ' Stymond looked surprised and contemptuous . I ai n't worried about the cops , if you mean them . There ai n't nothing the matter with things there . But I got competitors , see ? They been getting nasty . And I do n't think the weather looks like it 's going to be too good in the city this summer ; too hot . ' Yeah , I see . ' Kerr 's attempt was not too successful . Stymond experienced the beginnings of a suspicion . Say , what 's your racket , mister ? ' he demanded . Trying to string me along ? That ai n't very healthy either . ' Certainly not , my friend . I came down here to help you . If you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't do anything for you that way . ' The psychologist turned toward the door . Well , well , keep your shirt on , ' grumbled the gangster . I ai n't turning down no helping hand . These dicks has got me with the goods and I have n't any in with this judge . ' Stymond got up from his table and crossed over to the bed . Sit down over here , fella , away from that door and let 's hear what you got to offer . ' Well , I do n't know . ' The psychologist seemed to hesitate . Come on , come on . What 's biting you ? I ai n't going to . ' As Kerr turned back , two of his pound notes fluttered out of his pocket to the floor . Retrieving them and pushing them back with the others , he chuckled . Looks as if I 'd had a break when you did n't , ' he observed . Just won the pool . ' Yeah ? I thought they did n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't usually . But we 've been lying to , this morning . They 're making some repairs and we wo n't start up again till about noon ? '  | That 's right . I noticed . ' Well , the Low Field is sure to win . I was lucky enough to buy it last night . The steward said he might as well pay me after breakfast . ' You sure got a break , bo . That 's a bale you got there . How much did you pull down ? ' Why , I do n't really know ; have n't bothered to count it yet . About a thousand , I guess . ' Yeah ? One grand , eh ? Sit here . What do you say we get down to business . ' Sure . ' Kerr seated himself beside the prisoner on the bed . But say , you have n't got a pal on board here , have you ? ' Stymond looked up sharply . Not that I know of . What put that in your head ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a gunman after him . Tried to nick him that night , he said . ' I do n't know anything about it , ' Stymond asserted . There 's none of my mob on board . If there 's a rodman around , he 's like to be after me , not that other mug . ' You have n't a grudge against him yourself ? ' Me ? ' the gangster asked indignantly . I never saw the guy before yesterday . Why , he was n't touched that I could notice . When I puts a guy on the spot , he stays there , see . He do n't say nothing about it afterward . Anyhow , I ai n't taking no rods with me this trip . ' For the third time since he had entered , Hayvier covertly observed his wrist watch . Well , let 's get down to business , ' he began . Now you say that you were caught with the ? ' Without warning the single light in the ceiling of the tiny cabin went out . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hell , that 's the second time it 's happened , ' said Kerr testily . What 's the matter now ? ' In the darkness Stymond leaned back to stretch his left arm  | toward the light switch on the wall beside the berth , while his right stole out in the opposite direction . Just as he clicked the switch impotently back and forth , Hayvier turned and grasped the hand that was withdrawing quickly . In the hand was a crisp note . It crinkled sharply as Hayvier seized it . Stymond wrenched himself free and struck out as Hayvier jumped to his feet . The blow glanced off his shoulder , and then Stymond also was up . He struck again . The psychologist felt a terrific pain start at his eye and shoot over his whole body ; he staggered back . There followed grunts , shufflings , a crash .... Then the lights came on as abruptly as they had snapped off . A few seconds later the door opened and the guard looked in inquiringly . His mouth dropped open and he stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and into opposite corners of the cabin . Where they had been , Stymond lay groaning , doubled up over a broken arm , while Hayvier his eye already swelling to large dimensions , crouched above him still maintaining his simple jujitsu grip . None too gently , he gave the fallen gangster 's head a final bump against the hard floor , and rose , dusting himself off , with a grin of triumph . My word , Doctor , what has happened to your eye ? ' Captain Mansfield surveyed Hayvier 's face , with its court plaster and black eye-shield , with some concern . Do n't worry , Captain ; it 's nothing serious , ' the psychologist reassured him , his naturally good-natured expression breaking into a smile . The experiment was successful , but a little rough on the experimenter . Still , ' he considered , it was rougher on the subject . I 'm afraid I 've given your doctor some work . ' Well .... Let 's go into my office and be comfortable while we hear about it . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 'd like to hear . '  | No second invitation was necessary . The four men walked into the captain 's sanctum and the latter seated himself before his big , roll-top desk , a relic of earlier days . Now , ' said Captain Mansfield , when they were seated , let us hear all about it . You said the experiment was successful ? Have you found the criminal ? ' Hayvier became serious . Yes , I 've found him all right . No doubt about it at all . But the evidence to convict him is another matter . I 'll have to leave that to you . ' Oh : The captain 's face fell . Well , if you 're sure of the man , perhaps we can get the rest . At any rate , it 's something to know who did it . But , without evidence , how can you be so sure ? ' When I said evidence , I mean the sort of evidence that you 'll want to produce in court . We have n't reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law ; those fellows still spend their time talking . ' At heart the captain was quite in agreement with the statement . He said so . I do n't know exactly what you mean by scientific proof , but lawyers certainly talk too much . That man Stander , for instance . But first , how were you injured ? Had you a fight ? ' Short and sweet . He hit me , and I broke his arm with a little trick I once learned from a gymnasium instructor . I am sorry to say I also bumped his head  --  afterwards . ' But who was the man ? ' Younghusband put in . Drake answered . Why , Stymond , the man they arrested in the hallway the other night . Did n't you know ? ' Ah , ' said Younghusband profoundly . So he 's the man , is he ? By George ! ' I hope , ' said Drake , that we can convict him . He probably does n't love you particularly , Hayvier . And from all accounts he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again later on , if he 's free . Our detectives say they were warned by radio the day after we sailed that he 's a dangerous gunman . '  | Yes , I 've heard of him , ' the doctor admitted . But I 'm willing to take my chance . Where will we be if we let these gangsters terrorize us ? There is n't much danger in my profession , but if I happen to come across some , it 's my duty to face it . ' I admire your attitude , sir , ' the captain asserted warmly . And certainly I can not thank you enough for what you have done . But we have yet to hear exactly what you have done , ' he went on to remind the psychologist . I suppose I 'd better begin at the beginning , ' Hayvier responded . The others settled back in their seats . I was n't in the smoking-room when the shooting took place , you know , so I had no means of knowing whether the vital actor had perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely entirely upon the characters you supplied me with . There were , however , quite a few . I made a survey of them all , but only , of course , from what I had been told or could gather by observing them casually . I had no facilities for taking them all into a laboratory and watching them under test conditions . I probably should not have done so anyhow . Science does not make tests the results of which had been ruled out in advance . De Brasto 's innocence had been established before I took part ; he had fired only one bullet and it had been found and identified , not in the victim but in his own table . Then had some other member of his party fired the shots ? I did not take very seriously the assertion that there had been but one shot heard . The value of testimony under the unusual and exciting conditions that obtained , is practically nil . There might easily have been several shots fired . What really surprised me was that the witnesses agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a much better reason that excused almost everyone on my list . All these people had been searched soon after the crime , and none of them possessed a firearm . Moreover the detective had searched on the floor and among the  | tables for a missing necklace , so that an incriminating gun had not been hastily disposed of by any of them . This same train of reasoning disposed of the possibility of Smith 's having committed suicide . It also let out Dr. Schall and those who had been at the victim 's table . Of all my cast only two had not been searched , Detective Bone and Detective Heddes . Frankly , I could not find it credible that they had had a hand in the murder . Commander Drake tells me that such an outcome is a favourite device with the writers of mystery stories . I do not read them myself , but if he is correct , then I must say that these stories resemble practically all our literature both past and present . It has been devised by persons entirely ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been consistently conditioned to oppose crime should suddenly , for the benefit of a harassed author , turn into criminals themselves , is an extremely remote possibility . So now I was left with only two candidates , the phantom gunman of de Brasto 's and the man arrested in the hall . At first glance the former looked much the best . But was there such a man ? I understand that he is still being searched for in vain . Out of scores of people only one man saw him , de Brasto ; and de Brasto looks to me , on casual observation to be sure , like a viscerally controlled person , what used to be called an emotional type . I should not be at all surprised to find that he suffered from sensory hallucination . Of course I use the term , hallucination , because it is popularly understood ; it has nothing to do with those ghosts of sensations , the so-called images that still bewilder some of my colleagues . When I got at last to the man found just outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well worth thinking about . Here was none other than Stymond , a notorious gunman , sailing under a false name and already watched by your detectives . There had been shooting and here was a real gunman , not an imaginary one . Where had he been  | when the murder occurred ? At first he claimed to have been walking the decks ; and then the necklace belonging to the victim 's daughter was found upon him . He was a killer and a liar , a fully conditioned criminal . And at the very moment of the crime he had demonstrably been close enough to touch the murdered man ! It occurred to me that de Brasto 's shot might have been just a confusing coincidence due to his unbalanced reflexes and originating primarily from the unstriped musculature of the viscera . It is possible that , hearing Stymond 's gun right in his ear as it were , a swift reflex caused him to pull out and discharge his own revolver . It all happened so quickly that he scarcely knew it ; the fact that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shows the reflex nature of the act . And afterwards he imagined a totally different gunman , in order to account for his behaviour . The events , as I reconstructed them , were these : Stymond was sitting somewhere near Smith 's table , with his eye upon the jewellery worn by the daughter of the famous millionaire . His " racket " was not robbery , but we must remember that he was as completely conditioned a criminal as we would be likely to find anywhere . The human body is a very complicated mechanism , and it is conditioned not only segmentally but as a whole . Present this man with a striking stimulus to crime of any sort and he can not refuse to react . His first stimulus was the necklace ; it was followed by a second equally strong one , the sudden darkness . His response was not difficult to predict . He got up and seized the necklace . Now came a series of further reactions . Smith , who had his wits about him , seized the man who had attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus . Stymond reacted entirely in accord with his previous training , or conditioning . He tried to break loose , and failing that , shot and killed his opponent . Then he rapidly made his way out and  | threw his guns overboard . He was returning to brazen it out , as his former experiences with the police had taught him to do , when the lights went up and he was caught . Now what is against this theory ? In the first place , was there time ? Well , no one knows exactly how long the lights were off ; indefinitely , it is said to have been a short time , and that might be anywhere from thirty seconds to two or three minutes . There was plenty of time , I think ; you gentlemen probably have no idea how long and complicated a series of reactions can take place well within a minute . In the second place , only one shot was heard . I have already spoken of the reliance we can place upon such testimony . As a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but actually . Three bullets have been found . It is possible that two of them were fired with silencers ; I am told that a Mr. van Ness reported a hissing sound and , under the suggestion of a man in the doorway , thought it came from behind him . Pons would have made no such mistake ; he knows perfectly well that the human ear is not so constructed as to be able to place the direction of any sound in the dark . The hisses , I submit , came from Smith 's table . I have spoken to Dr. Pell about Smith 's wound . You all know its peculiarity . Stymond had been carrying two guns ; the two empty holsters were found on him when he was arrested . My idea is that as he pulled the guns , Stymond 's hands were knocked together in the struggle , and the two shots came simultaneously from muzzles that were at the moment in contact with each other . I asked Dr. Pell if there were powder stains upon Smith 's clothing and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the silencers , with which I assume both the guns were equipped . Well , I constructed my theory so . And then it became necessary to verify it . That is the method of science , and , ' he smiled , I also am conditioned to a special mode of procedure , you see .  | In fact , ' he added , I am so conditioned to giving lectures , either in class-rooms or publicly , that I 'm afraid I have forgotten that I am not just now on the lecture platform . I have been talking for some time ; you are being bored . I 'll just hurry over the rest . ' The captain straightened up from his slightly tensed attitude . As for me , ' he said , I find it very interesting . You put it so simply that I ca n't imagine why we had n't thought of all this ourselves . I 'm sure everyone else feels the same . ' He too looked around the room . I do , ' echoed Younghusband . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainer than the man 's guilt . ' Hayvier smiled , a little mournfully . Ah , but we ca n't accept theories so readily in science . It is just because I have now to tell you of the somewhat technical experiment I made , that I am hesitating . If you wish , I will just say that I verified my hypothesis and leave it at that . ' By no means , ' said Captain Mansfield hastily . As to the technicalities , I wish to assure you that , entirely apart from this murder , I find your general ideas extremely sensible , Dr. Hayvier . ' Hayvier smiled with pleasure . I am glad to hear you say so , Captain . When behaviourism has superseded the former religious psychology , there will be a great many more people interested in our work . In the profession itself our success is nearly complete ; we have been innovators and to some extent rebels . I must n't lecture you on that subject , though . But I must tell you a little about the processes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand my experiment . To begin with , the human infant starts out in life with a few reflexes , simple in comparison with what they later become . Typical stimuli call out these reactions . Already the baby is equipped to respond to the nipple with sucking , and so on . A loud noise or loss of support stimulates him to the more complicated response we call fear , restraint results in rage behaviour ,  | and tickling or gentle stroking calls out the love responses , gurgling , cooing , smiling . This is our original equipment . And this has been discovered , not by arm-chair theorizing , but by actual experiments with babies in hospitals and nurseries . How then does it happen that we later find in humans all those tremendously complicated reactions involved in holding a job , getting married , having children , attending banquets , making speeches , the whole life behaviour in modern society ? A relatively simple thing accounts for it all ; the conditioned reflex . Even consciousness we have discovered to be a mere substitute for the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really has no definite and legitimate meaning that can be accepted by a true science . ' But my dear Hayvier ! ' It was the executive officer who again broke in , and his intonation expressed an evident determination to pin the other down . Do you seriously mean to tell me that I am not conscious when I ask you this question and that you are not conscious when you hear it ? ' Oh , ' said Hayvier with another of his frank smiles , I see that this statement about " consciousness " upsets you . It need n't ; it only means that we have finished fooling around with imaginary " souls " , that we 're not preachers , but scientists . Now how does all this apply to our problem ? The point is just this : a human being has been conditioned so that certain stimuli call out certain responses , in the absence of an unconditioning process those stimuli will always call out just those responses . That much is certain ; neither the " person " nor his " soul " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reactions . Very well . Now , I had theoretically deduced that Stymond , when successively stimulated by an object of value , then sudden darkness , was conditioned to try to possess the object and , if opposed , to do what injury he could to an opponent . Of course , I am making it all as simple as possible ; it is not just the sight  | of the object and the ensuing darkness that cause his response , it is the entire and very complicated stimulus situation . My theory was that a certain situation stimulated him to a particular series of responses . My next step was to reproduce the situation and make a scientific test of this hypothesis . For this purpose I made my laboratory his place of confinement , appearing in the guise of a friend and having instructed the guard to extinguish the lights after I had been closeted with him for ten minutes . I took with me a large amount of money , the supposed proceeds of last night 's pool , and I made this both noticeable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that several of the bills stuck out in plain view . In my conversation I explained the presence of this money and admitted that I had not counted it and was not sure of the exact amount . Naturally most of my conversation was concerned with far different topics . When the lights went out as arranged , Stymond took a twenty-pound note from my pocket . I was waiting for this and seized his arm , whereupon he attacked me and we had a bit of a set-to until the guard had switched on the lights again and appeared in the door . Incidentally the note was badly torn in our struggles ; but I am relieved to say that the purser has accepted it and pasted it together . As a result of this experiment , however , I take it that my theory regarding Stymond and his reactions has been fully confirmed . I should be glad to hear if you gentlemen agree with me . ' He looked around the room and caught Captain Mansfield 's eye ; the latter took the opportunity to speak first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your story as closely as possible , Dr. Hayvier . I find it very convincing . I am forced to agree with you further , I regret to say , that we can not take your evidence into a court and hope for a conviction . ' Said Drake , That being the case , and I also think you are right about the crime , what are we to do ? We must see that  | Stymond is brought to justice . ' Would it be possible , ' suggested Younghusband , to frame him in some way . If he is actually guilty , I do not see any harm in it . Naturally , ' he added , as the captain favoured him with a sharp glance , as a friend of Mr. Smith 's I am anxious that his death be avenged . He was a fine and very able man ; it is unendurable that his murderer should go free . ' I am as anxious as you are , Mr. Younghusband , have no doubt about that , ' replied the captain . And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some way must be found to secure the proper evidence . Let us all put our minds on the problem for a few minutes . ' Some moments passed in silence . Finally the captain turned again to the psychologist . Can you think of nothing , Dr. Hayvier , no means at all ? By God , we shall have this criminal ! ' His fist banged upon the desk with a gesture of impotent determination . I see how you feel , Captain , ' acknowledged the psychologist , although I find it hard to share your indignation . From my viewpoint , you know , this man is only the mechanical product of his environment . Of course , though , I should like to help you convict him . ' He paused . I do n't know , Captain ; I ca n't think of anything now . ' Hayvier smiled rather hopelessly . There are so many devious technicalities in the law ; they seem to have been arranged entirely for the benefit of the criminals . Dr. Pons , for example , has invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness stand which has been highly successful in convicting offenders and has often secured their confessions . And would you believe that it has been outlawed on the ground that the criminal is thus forced to give evidence against himself , although he never has to say a word directly ? The evidence comes from such things as the changes in his heartbeat . ' The captain spoke decidedly . I have no use for nambypamby  | methods for hardened criminals . I 've never had a crime of this nature on any boat I 've commanded before , and I am not exactly sure of the precedents . But my authority runs quite far enough for me to put this man on the stand and have him crossexamined . Do you suppose we could persuade Dr. Pons to help us with this invention of his ? I 'll take the responsibility for it ; and if we obtain a confession , Stymond can appeal later if he wants to . ' Hayvier considered the matter and yet again he smiled . Oh , I think you will have no difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately he has all his apparatus with him ; he is taking it over to give a demonstration at the Psychological Convention . I 'll speak to him , if you want . But I 'm sure there wo n't be any trouble there . If you like I 'll examine , while Pons does his tests . I 've never worked with the lie detector before , but the reports of it are excellent . We might get a confession , after all . ' Very good . You gentlemen are certainly coming to my assistance nobly . I can only tell you how greatly I appreciate your help . ' That 's perfectly all right , Captain . You owe me no thanks , for I 've found it interesting myself . Shall I go take a look for Pons now , and get things arranged ? ' The sooner the better , as far as I 'm concerned , ' answered Captain Mansfield . Hayvier went . The captain 's sitting-room had been transformed . A heavy curtain of canvas had been stretched directly across the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To one side of this canvas the long centre table had been moved , now completely cleared of its lamp and the other objects that were wont to adorn its surface . Several chairs had been placed  | along the table , facing the large , single armchair before the curtain . Two appliances lay on this chair , a rubber bulb with an attached tube , and a large band that looked as if it might also be of rubber , from which led a second tube . Hidden from view on the opposite side of the barrier were three small tables , accompanied by chairs . The small tables bore various pieces of apparatus ; and on all lay ruled forms and several sharpened pencils . The door opened and a small crowd came in . There were Captain Mansfield , Commander Drake , and Younghusband , Pons and Hayvier , Plechs and Mittle . Behind them two sailors brought in the prisoner , who already looked ill at ease . Last of all Dr. Pell hurried in with a stenographer and shut the door , closing it upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Pons looked around ; everything seemed just as he had left it . Now , Dr. Plechs , ' he suggested , if you will take the galvanometer and you , Professor , the hand bulb and the pneumograph , we will go behind and see that everything on the recording end is in order . ' Leading the way for his fellow scientists , he disappeared behind the curtain . Say , what the hell , ' Stymond began , eyeing with distaste the lone chair and the apparatus now on its seat . You ai n't going to put me through no hanky-panky with all this junk . I wo n't do it , see . ' He halted , and the sailors on each side of him , uncertain what to do , stopped also . You will sit in that chair , ' Drake directed him , and you will answer the questions that Dr. Hayvier puts to you . ' I will , hey ? That 's the guy that tried to double-cross me this morning . The hell I will ! ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' spoke Captain Mansfield . There was an angry light in his eye but his voice was low . He was remembering the unforgivable insult of the murder of one of his passengers . Now see here , my man , you can make up your mind that you are going to do exactly what my executive  | officer has told you . You may not know that the penalty for serious breaches of discipline on this ship is fifty strokes with a cat-o-nine tails . I do n't threaten , I do n't have to ; I am telling you what will happen . ' Why , you would n't dare , you God damned ? . ' Stymond started forward toward the captain , his face flushed an angry red . One of the sailors caught his shoulder and impeded his progress . Hit him , ' said Captain Mansfield . The second sailor drew the short club , like a policeman 's nightstick , with which they were both armed , and struck the prisoner a sharp blow over the head . Stymond staggered and would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , where he bent over groaning and holding his head with the arm that was not in a sling . The captain waited a few moments . I hope you see , ' he said , that I mean business . It 's time you thugs learned a lesson in discipline from the authorities , and you will certainly learn one from me . I meant every word literally that I said about that whipping . Give him a drink of water , seaman . ' He pulled out his watch . You have exactly three minutes , my man , to decide whether you will answer these questions before or after a beating . ' Stymond looked up groggily . He drank the water that was offered him and shiftily tried to take stock of the unusual situation . He was forcibly reminded of an early adventure when , before he had risen to the heights from which he now dispensed gold with one hand and paid assassination with the other , the police of Philadelphia had put him through the third degree . He had never forgotten that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his confidence waning , but he decided upon one further attempt . When I , ugh , when I get back , you guys had better , ugh , say your prayers .  | Hayvier regarded him coldly . In that case , ' he offered , playing up , perhaps it will be just as well if he does n't get back . ' Captain Mansfield said nothing ; he continued to look steadily at the gangster in grim silence . It was borne in upon Stymond that he was in distinctly hostile company . The easy contempt in which he held the law-abiding abruptly vanished ; for one thing these men did not appear to be quite as law-abiding as he had supposed . It occurred to him that this captain was himself the head of a well organized mob ; it also occurred to him that an inconvenient body would not make any noticeable splash if dropped over the stern early some morning . Without another word he swayed to his feet and groped toward the chair he had never doubted was being reserved for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long table and opened his note-book . From around the corner of the curtain Pons approached the gunman and , having seen him seated , proceeded to adjust the instruments upon his body . Next he pushed back the chair until it touched the canvas and directed Stymond to thrust his uninjured arm through a slit in the curtain just behind him . Arranging the chair in the most comfortable position possible in relation to the slit , he left and disappeared behind the curtain . When Pons reappeared before the curtain , the stethoscope was dangling from his ears . He addressed Stymond in calmly professional tones . Let me tell you something . Calm down . Oh , I know you look calm enough , but these instruments do n't lie ; inside you 're all upset right now . You need n't be afraid ; nothing will hurt you if you behave yourself and answer the questions . But do n't make any mistake about this : the apparatus you are connected with always tells the truth ; we do n't have to guess about what you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might be able to fool us , but you wo n't fool the sphygmomanometer ; so do n't try . '  | Say what the hell is all this hop about , anyway ? ' Stymond grumbled . But his voice was nervous . You got the goods on me , did n't yeh ? Sure I took the doll 's neckpiece . The dick found it in my vest , did n't he ? Well , what the hell do you need all this junk for , then ? ' Dr. Hayvier had seated himself at the table , facing the prisoner . Now he leaned forward and addressed him sharply . Go ahead ; tell us the rest of it . ' What rest of it are you talking about ? ' Stymond appeared plainly surprised . Have n't I just spilled the beans ? What do you mean ? ' All right , we 'll get the rest in a minute . Captain , can we have the stenographer type out the theft confession and get that signed ? ' Rapidly the clerk opened a small portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the prisoner . Pons disconnected the galvanometer and Stymond 's arm , still bearing the blood pressure bandage , was withdrawn through the slit . He read the prepared statement through quickly and signed it as if glad to get the ordeal over . There it is , ' he said . Now take this harness off me and let me get out of here . I ca n't see as it did anything , at that . ' Not quite so quick , ' Hayvier hastened to interpose . I have a few questions to put to you . Let me know when you 're ready , Dr. Pons , will you please ? ' In a few minutes Pons 's head reappeared around the end of the canvas . All set , ' he called ; and disappeared again to take charge of his instruments . Hayvier addressed himself to the gunman . What did you do with your guns just before you were arrested outside the smoking-room the other night ? ' I did n't do anything with them ; I did n't have any guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . We know you had two guns , and we know you jumped out to get rid of them . What did you do , throw them overboard ? '  | How could I throw anything overboard ? The windows were all closed and there was a dandy little storm going . I tell you I did n't bring no rods with me . ' Oh , so you did go out on deck ; you knew that the promenade windows had been put up against the rain . If you could n't throw them overboard , how did you dispose of the guns ? ' If you do n't believe me , go and look for them . You wo n't find no rods , none of mine , anyway . I did n't have any . ' Then why did you go out on deck in the dark ? ' Because I wanted to get away , that 's why . ' Then why did you come back ? ' Because that was the safest thing to do . Any boob 'd know that . ' On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guns with which you had just killed Smith ! You might as well come clean . We 've got the goods on you and we 've got the apparatus on you that will prove it . ' For a moment Stymond went pale . Say , for Christ 's sake , ' he cried , what are you trying to do ? Frame a murder on me ? ' We know all about it , Stymond , ' Hayvier said steadily . You might as well admit it now and be done with it . ' I will not ! I wo n't admit anything . I do n't know anything about it . I tell you I did n't even know he 'd been shot until the next day . ' Is that so ? Well , we know all about it . We know you grabbed Miss Smith 's necklace and cut her neck wrenching it off . She cried out and her father caught hold of you . You struggled , pulled your guns and shot him dead . Then you made your way outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back . ' For some seconds Stymond appeared to consider . Then he said earnestly : Say , look here , I do n't know why you guys are trying to frame this on me , but it ai n't true . I did n't bump him  | off and I did n't do any shooting at all . ' It was plain that none of his audience believed him , and after hesitating another few moments , he continued : This is what happened and it 's God 's truth , see . When the lights went out , I did go over and grab the necklace ; I 've admitted it , ai n't I ? But when I took it , the doll made no noise at all ; she did n't yell out to her old man and there was n't a peep out of him , either . When I got to the table , she was lying back in her chair with the beads around her neck all right . I thought she had fainted ; it was a lucky break . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was n't a sound from the old boy next the girl . I was careful to come up on the side away from him , and as soon as I got the beads , I beat it . Just as I had got away from the table , there was a crash behind me and someone let off a rod right next door . I was afraid the lights would come on before I got out ; my first hunch was that that shot was meant for me . But I made it all right . And then I figured to be coming in when they lit up , so as no one would think I 'd been in there in the dark . That 's what happened , and that 's everything I know about it . It 's God 's truth and I 'll swear to it on all the Bibles you got on the boat . ' He finished and stared at his accuser . Humph , ' said Hayvier , that 's a fine story . You 're mixed up in it yourself . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash of the body . Does that make sense ? ' The gunman paused , as if struck by the point for the first time . Well , ' he answered finally , I ca n't help it . That 's the way I remember it ; and I 'm perfectly sure of it . I ca n't explain it . I heard it that way , but I could n't see it . ' Is that all you 've got to say , Stymond ? ' Hayvier 's voice was cold and unimpressed . I told you before you might as well come clean and tell us the truth . We 've got the records on these instruments to prove that that story of yours is a lie . You wo n't say anything more ? '  | Of course I wo n't . Ai n't I spilled you the whole thing ? Every last thing I know about it . That guy next door shot him , did n't he ? ' He did not . You shot him . And we know it . We 'll take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lying . Unless someone else has some questions ? ' Dr. Hayvier turned inquiringly to the captain . Captain Mansfield in turn looked around , but no one offered any further interrogation . You stay where you are , Stymond ; I suggest we have Dr. Pons tell us the results so far . ' Pons had already removed the prisoner 's arm from the slit for the second time . Now he drew back the curtain and the instruments behind it were exposed to view . The professor and Dr. Plechs were bending over their respective tables , jotting down their last records . Dr. Pons addressed the room . It will take us a little time , gentlemen , to co-ordinate and interpret these results . However , we will do so as quickly as possible . Take a look , Stymond . There 's some apparatus you ca n't beat . Think it over before we hook you up again for some more questions . ' He stepped back to his own table , the centre one of the three , and collected his sheaf of ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the galvanometer and Professor Mittle disconnected the smoked paper on the drums of his instruments , upon whose murky surfaces there now appeared a series of wavy lines traced in the soot by the recording needles . All these informative papers and charts were transferred to the long table in front of the prisoner , where the scientists proceeded to pore over them and elicit the story they told . It seemed a long time while they were matching the various records together and co-ordinating their time elements with that of the stenographic report which the clerk was rapidly typing out . As the work progressed , a puzzled frown appeared upon Pons 's ample brow , and he rematched several of the long strips  | and checked them again . He questioned his colleagues closely and they appeared to give him renewed assurances . Once more he set about checking off the recorded sequences and they , not sufficiently familiar with the technique to take an active part , bent over his shoulders with interest . Elsewhere in the room the other spectators had gradually entered into desultory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , an outcast from the central activity of the room , but watched attentively by the two guards . With a final gesture Dr. Pons produced a huge handkerchief and mopped the perspiration from his face . He rose and with his back to the table , faced the gathering . At once the talking ceased . Gentlemen , ' he began , the outcome of these tests is very different indeed from what I had expected . In view of its surprising nature , I should like to explain to you briefly the kind of measurements we have been taking and the theory , that is , the already verified theory of these tests . Of course with your permission , Captain . ' Indeed , yes , ' Captain Mansfield responded . I can promise you a close attention at any rate . ' Thank you , Captain ; I will be as brief as possible . And first of all I must tell you that these tests have been thoroughly verified not only by myself , but by other qualified psychologists . Both Larson and Landis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them 90 per cent . accurate , even in the hands of police officials , and Landis confirmed the original claim that they were " highly diagnostic " . Were this not so , I would not presume to recommend their results to you . The accurate measurement of emotional states or experiences on the part of the subject , ' he went on , is a very difficult problem at the present time . Personally I believe that the consciousness of emotion occurs in human beings at the central synapses of the motor system and we have as yet no instruments that are able  | to report directly the complicated and delicate energy changes there present . I know that Dr. Hayvier will not agree with me as to this use of the term , consciousness , but as all the measurements I make are purely objective , I do not think he will quarrel with the procedure or the results . After all , in these tests we are measuring the responses to certain stimuli , and if I firmly believe that these responses are much more complex than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we remain agreed upon the principle underlying the present method . With the techniques now perfected , I feel confident that the most reliable of all is the measurement of the consciousness of deception experienced by the subject , the tests of which we have just made . I regret again that I must use that word , consciousness , but it is what I mean . Naturally these records show nothing as to the objective truth or falsehood of the subject 's story . But what they do unquestionably show is whether or not the subject himself believes that he is telling the truth ; in many cases , as in the present one , this amounts practically to the same thing . We all feel sure that Stymond , if he wanted to , could tell us whether or not he killed the murdered man ; our measurements indicate , with an extremely minute possibility of error , whether he himself believes his denial to be true or false . Just a few words about the instruments and what they measure . First we have the Tycos sphygmomanometer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stethoscope is placed on the arm next to the bandage and when the blood is heard rushing into the vessels , a reading of the sphygmomanometer is taken . We take five readings to the minute . The fingers of the subject 's same arm are dipped into an electrolytic solution connected with a galvanometer which measures the variations in the action current of his body . The band which you have seen around the subject 's chest is part of a pneumograph . This records the periods of inspiration and expiration of the breath .  | The bulb under his elbow is ordinarily used for measuring the unconscious variations in hand-grip , on the principle of a dynamometer . In the present case , since the subject 's arm was broken , I had to place it under his elbow . The resulting inaccuracies were about what I had expected , and I think we shall have to throw out this part of the record . All these instruments measure what are called " non-voluntary " or unconscious reactions over which the subject has no control , thus obviating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again mopped his face . Then he put away his handkerchief and looked slowly and impressively around the room . Gentlemen , ' he said , with the exception of the hand-grip just noted , the results of the test agree remarkably well . I have checked and rechecked the results , and I can only say that personally I have the most complete confidence in them . They show in the first place that Stymond 's story about his guns was false . He did have the guns or gun , and he did either throw them overboard and secrete them somewhere outside the smoking-room when he left it . The records also show with entire unanimity that he sincerely believes what he told us of his theft of the necklace to be true . His story as to what happened to him at the Smith table in the dark was not false . He did not kill Smith ! ' A dead silence followed , while the expressions of all those present registered astonishment in their various ways . Pons 's surprise was that of the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had supposed was being used to frame him , had actually established his innocence ! Drake was the first to speak . But , but , ' he broke out , as if he could hardly credit his ears , how can it be so ? Dr. Hayvier 's theory , his reconstruction , was perfect . He accounted for everything . He gave us the motive ? ' Hayvier himself interrupted . No , Mr. Drake , you are wrong  | there . I said nothing whatever about motives . Motive is an old word , handed down from subjective psychology . I know no more about motives than I do about instincts , or " consciousness " , or " sensations " . I must say that I am as much astonished as the rest of you , but there are the results . ' Do you mean , Dr. Hayvier , ' asked the captain , that you agree with Dr. Pons ? You are convinced by his findings ? ' Yes , ' Hayvier admitted , strange as it may seem , I am convinced . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully understand how rigorous a mistress Science really is . We who follow her , acknowledge her decrees even when a pet theory is knocked in the head . Let me say at once that I do not agree with Dr. Pons about this " consciousness " of his , but that does not affect the question . What he was measuring was not a " consciousness " of deception or anything else ; it was a belief , and that is thinking . Thinking is largely sub-vocal talking , it all comes under behaviour . So I believe he was measuring very definite behaviour , regarding which it is not necessary to mention " consciousness " at all . I have read of these tests in the literature , of course , although I have not hitherto seen them made . I can see no objection to be raised against them . They are natural science tests and we must bow to their results , whatever our private prejudices happened to be in advance . ' Captain Mansfield , who had listened somewhat abstractedly , looked up . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of science , in my opinion it is also the method of good sportsmanship . Naturally I am disappointed . I hoped we had the criminal , and I may say I was practically sure of it ; I merely expected confirmation . But the same theories that cast suspicion upon this man , have now exonerated him . ' I am sorry , ' began Hayvier . I 'm afraid I have led you on a wild goose chase . I can only say that I was sincerely convinced , and I am only sorry I have wasted your time . '  | ' Not at all , ' replied the captain . As far as I am concerned , I was fully convinced by your idea . It appears we were both wrong , and there is nothing more to be done about him . Of course , he will have to answer to the theft charge when we reach England : He motioned to the sailors . All right , men , you can take the prisoner below . ' The others stood about silently , offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sailors prepared to take him from the room . As he was led past , he turned to the two scientists . I 'll say this for you guys , ' he pronounced . You 're square shooters , if I did think different . You wo n't have to worry about my mob when I get back . ' The others watched his going in silence , hardly appreciating as yet the full breakdown of the case against him and that the real slayer was still at large in their small , floating community .  | PART THREE DR . MALCOLM PLECHS : INFERIORITIES CHALL and Pell walked the sun deck outside the ship 's hospital ; it was shortly after luncheon but already the players of shuffle board and deck tennis were at their games , between which the two doctors strolled in and out . It was a glorious day with blue sky and fleecy clouds , just the time for a quiet constitutional . Nevertheless , Doctor , ' said Dr. Schall , I am sorry it ca n't be done . I admit to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autopsy , I 'm afraid we can do no more than guess . However , if the regulations forbid , I do n't see what we can do . ' I feel as you do , Doctor . But you know , on shipboard ? ' Pell shrugged and let the sentence go unfinished . I have suggested it to the captain but I suppose he does n't want to let himself in for any extra complaints later . ' I suppose so . ' Schall walked in silence for a few minutes , then continued irrelevantly : I 'm still surprised you do n't remember me , do you know ? With the beard you have grown I will say I scarcely recognized you at first , but of course as soon as I heard your name , I remembered you perfectly . I do n't think I 'll ever forget those long discussions we had on that awful crossing on the Panther , or for that matter how you used to show up my game of chess . By the way , do you still play ? ' Occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen off a  | good deal lately . With these bigger boats there has been considerably more work for us doctors , and then I find it takes more time nowadays to keep up with the medical literature . We must try a match , though , some evening . ' With pleasure . ' I hope , ' Pell went on , that you do n't feel offended at my not remembering you . The truth is that I have n't a very good memory . And of course I meet so many new people each trip that what happened ten years ago on the old Panther has pretty well gone out of my mind . ' Yes , ' Schall admitted , I can well understand it . As for me , though , I make so few trips abroad that I am not likely to forget much about them . ' My first trip on the Meganaut , you know , ' the other added . I only joined her in New York last week . It was quite a decision for me to make , after being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more I see of the gentlemen here , the more satisfied I feel . Our officers are really very fine men , I find . ' My impression is the same , ' Schall agreed . To get back to that question of the autopsies , do you really think we can not persuade Captain Mansfield ? I was surprised at the lack of bleeding when I examined the body . There should have been a good deal of bleeding , certainly ; especially as the possibility of the blood draining off into the pleural cavity was obviated . ' You are undoubtedly right , Doctor . But there it is ; I have not succeeded as yet , and we ca n't wait much longer . ' There 's the captain now , ' said Schall suddenly . Up forward . Let us speak to him together . ' Why , I do n't think ? . I would n't bother him now about it . ' But Dr. Schall was already hurrying toward Captain Mansfield 's figure at the forward end of the deck and his companion had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mansfield said , when Dr. Schall had succeeded in accosting him , I can not appreciate the necessity for an autopsy .  | We know how Mr. Smith died ; what more remains to be found out ? Dr. Pell has suggested it , but I do not recall that he was especially anxious . Just why do you ask this , Dr. Schall ? Do you suspect that something important might be discovered ? ' I 'm afraid not in the sense you mean , Captain , ' was the reply . From a medical point of view , though , there are several puzzling features that both I and Dr. Pell are curious about . I am very curious about the strange lack of bleeding , and when I examined the body in the smoking-room , it struck me as unusually cold for that of a man who had died no more than a minute or so before . And the eyes were curiously dilated , too . ' This is all true , ' Pell put in . As to the eyes , however , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden darkness , possibly in combination with fear . The daughter 's eyes were somewhat dilated also . ' Her case seems remarkable to me , too , ' Dr. Schall went on . I was amazed to hear that she had died . You know , Captain Mansfield , that in many places a thorough autopsy is obligatory in all cases of death by violence . While I do not wish to appear as if I were attending to what is not my business , I am supporting Dr. Pell 's request in this case . ' Captain Mansfield , despite his courteous attention , was in a hurry and he came to a quick decision . You 've no objection , Pell ? ' he asked . None at all . On the contrary , Captain . ' Very well , then , ' said Mansfield . There 's nothing to prevent it , that I know of . You gentlemen may make your autopsies whenever you wish . If you will excuse me now , gentlemen , I must go to the bridge . Not so difficult after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain had gone . From what you said , I hardly thought we would succeed so easily . ' No more did I , ' Pell admitted . He certainly seemed to me to throw cold water over it when I first suggested it . Anyhow ,  | we have our permission now . ' When shall we make use of it , Doctor ? ' Oh , I do n't think we need worry about that . Say , nine o'clock to-morrow morning ? I suppose our permission included the girl ? Or do you think not ? No , on the whole I do n't think it did . ' Schall was surprised . He pulled at his beard and considered the matter . Yes , ' he said finally , I think so . I think it did . And I am anxious to get a look at that heart . I think we can assume that both autopsies were included in the permission . And speaking of the time , I must get down below if I want to see the races . I 'm greatly obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very courteous of you to permit me to assist to-morrow . ' Not at all , ' Pell assured him . And I think I 'll come down with you . I 'm scarcely familiar at all with this boat as yet and I 've never seen their races . I shall have to stop at the hospital a moment , but you go right ahead down and I 'll join you in a few minutes . ' Schall considered . All right , I 'll see you a little later . And thank you again , Doctor . ' He held out his hand , shook that of the ship 's doctor with a touch of formality , and turned away . Do n't mention it . ' Pell started aft . I 'll be with you presently . ' He walked away rapidly toward the hospital . Dr. Pell entered the hospital on the after-end of the sun deck and looked down its neat interior with approbation . As he came in , a trim nurse rose and walked down the ward to meet him . While awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep half way down the ward . The nurse produced her chart and glancing over it , Dr. Pell assured himself that everything was progressing nicely . He nodded and turned toward the first door on his right , behind which lay the bodies of the victims of the mysterious tragedy . As soon as he had gone in and closed the door he knew that  | something was wrong . But it was so very wrong that for a few seconds he quite failed to grasp the significance of what he saw . When he did , he sprang back through the door with alacrity . Wildly he gesticulated to the nurse , who came hurrying down the aisle to him . Nurse , ' he cried , with great difficulty lowering his voice . Has anyone moved one of the bodies from that room ? ' Why , why , no , Doctor . Not since I came on this morning . The door has n't been opened . Is ? ' Dr. Pell looked hastily into the second private room . It was empty of any human form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Smith 's body is not in the room . It is n't there , ' he repeated in complete bewilderment . Dr. Pell attempted to pull himself together . Telephone the night nurse as once , Miss Jenkins , ' he directed , I want to see her just as soon as she can get here . ' The nurse ran lightly down the ward to the telephone at the far end . But I know it 's no good , ' Pell mumbled to himself . I saw her when she went off duty this morning . ' Left to himself , the doctor gazed about him in a dazed fashion , as if expecting to discover what he sought on the floor or under an adjacent bed . Once more he strode to the room where the body of Victor Timothy Smith lay still and rigid , just as he himself had placed it . Again he came out and stood in the centre of the general ward . The nurse had finished telephoning and from the distance nodded to him in confirmation that his instructions had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model hospital , Dr. Pell rushed out on deck . Once more the sun slanted down from the west upon the  | Meganaut , now pushing steadily ahead through the Atlantic rollers . The cocktail hour approached , and down the length of the broad promenade deck , stewards were folding up the two outer rows of deck chairs , leaving a single line for the accommodation of evening strollers . In the winter garden small plates of salty pretzels and nuts were being set out upon the wicker tables in anticipation of the coming gathering . Around and around the deck marched several passengers , arrived from dressing a little too soon for their appetizers . Among them Dr. Plechs trudged forward with uniform pace , apparently deep in thought . Occasionally he raised his head and looked abstractedly out over the immense expanse of waves , shading now to a deep purple , above which hung three tenuous , rose-tinted clouds in the east . As he approached the starboard companionway , a new idea seemed to occur to him ; he entered the enclosed stairs and mounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some minutes , his ambition rose to yet higher levels , and he climbed to the sun deck . Coming out upon this yet sunlit space , he arrived eventually near the hospital entrance , just as Dr. Pell rushed out in haste for the second time that day . The face of the ship 's doctor was a study in pent-up emotion ; he appeared to be on the point of bursting with ill-suppressed excitement . The psychoanalyst , deep in his own thoughts , failed at first to notice these symptoms , and as Pell hurriedly approached , he greeted the physician in precise accents . Ah , good evening , Doctor . I have been thinking over the problem of these mysterious ? ' How are you , Plechs , ' cried the physician , speedily . ' Mysterious  --  my God , yes , mysterious  --  I 've just finished an autopsy . ' He dashed on , abandoning Dr. Plechs to solitude and a considerable amazement . Somewhat more leisurely , though still quite evidently in a  | hurry , Dr. Schall appeared at the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Plechs walked up to him in a determined fashion . What is all this , my friend ? ' he demanded . Dr. Pell has just passed in a state of high excitement . He states that he has completed an autopsy . But what autopsy ? And why is he so distraught ? Surely , ' Plechs added , with a sly attempt at humour , it is not his first experience . ' Yes , yes , ' answered Schall , who also seemed unduly upset . We have made an autopsy upon the body of Mr. Smith . We made a most remarkable discovery , astounding . If you care to hear about it you can come with me . I am going to join Pell in the captain 's office . As you have been invited before , I 'm sure he wo n't object . ' I shall come , certainly , ' Plechs said at once , falling in with the hasty steps of the somewhat taller doctor . I have been thinking about this problem all the , afternoon . I perceive now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should say it has ! ' Dr. Schall added . They reached the forward companionway and descended rapidly . Rather unceremoniously they opened the door to the captain 's office and went in . They found Captain Mansfield seated at his desk , having turned his ancient swivel chair toward Pell , who stood beside him and had apparently only finished imparting his news . The captain appeared calmer than any of the others . But Pell , ' he was observing , I can hardly credit what you say . Naturally I do n't doubt your findings , but how could the man possibly have died of poisoning when he was shot ? I ca n't see yet that it 's reasonable . Reasonable ! ' the doctor exclaimed . Why , there 's been nothing reasonable about the whole thing . We have a man shot and arrest the man whom everybody practically saw shoot him . But he did n't do it . We arrest a gunman who was robbing his  | daughter at the very moment ; and he did n't do it , either . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by poison ! And you ask me to be reasonable ! ' Yes , I know , ' Captain Mansfield answered soothingly . But I still do n't see why you now attribute his death to the poison when he was shot through the heart . ' Schall now stepped forward from the background where he and Dr. Plechs had remained since entering the room . When he spoke , it was in much quieter tones than his colleague 's . ' Captain , ' he asserted , Dr. Pell was kind enough to allow me to assist at the autopsy , and I can confirm everything he says . Strange as it may seem , and is , for that matter , we are convinced that Mr. Smith was dead of poisoning before either of the bullets entered what was not his body , but his corpse . ' But he was alive when the lights went out , Doctor . And it was during the darkness that he was shot . ' Even so , sir , the lights were out for some time . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute at least , if not longer . It may have been anything up to three or four minutes . They came on almost immediately after Mr. de Brasto 's shot ; but at some moment before that , the poison must have entered Mr. Smith 's body and caused practically instantaneous death . ' What poison was found , Doctor ? And how was it adminis-tered ? ' Dr. Pell again took up the report . It was hydrocyanic acid , sir , ' he said ; I guess I forgot to tell you , I was so upset about the fact of the poisoning itself . It is sometimes called prussic acid , and it is one of the deadliest and speediest poisons known . A very small amount is sufficient to cause immediate death . It is absorbed at once through the tissues into the blood ; a few drops of the pure acid on the tongue are quite enough to be fatal to anyone . The action is primarily on the central nervous system , paralysing the respiratory and heart actions . In the present case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the toxin  | still in the stomach , so in all probability it was taken in through the mouth . It might , of course , have been in the form of a capsule , but I think it practically certain that it was introduced into some of the drinks at Mr. Smith 's table . ' Well , this is certainly most astonishing , ' considered the captain . I should have thought that the results of so drastic a poison as you describe , Dr. Pell , would have been evident at once . And yet there appears to have been no suspicion until this moment . Had you some suspicion of this when you made your request of me , Dr. Schall ? ' Absolutely none , Captain . Our interest was just what we told you , and it is not really so remarkable as it sounds , ' Dr. Schall hastened to come to his fellow physician 's assistance . You see , in the case of this poison there are no convulsions , and the circumstances were such that everything conspired to conceal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible when he died , the symptoms would have been unmistakable . But after he had died and the lights went on again , he was found with two bullet wounds in his heart , quite enough surely to render the cause of death so obvious that it would not occur to anyone to look beyond those wounds . Moreover , the smell of alcohol on his breath was sufficiently strong to cover the distinctive odour of bitter almonds , due to the hydrocyanic acid , which in any event does not persist long . Both Dr. Pell and myself did notice that his skin was peculiarly cold and his eyes dilated , but such minor symptoms were not enough to alter our opinions in view of the heart lesions . ' It is true , ' Pell contributed , that the post-mortem symptoms of the poison were present , but as Dr. Schall says , they were so overshadowed by the gunshot wounds that at the time I had no definite suspicions at all . You will recall though , Captain , that I was considerably puzzled by the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an autopsy . If the heart had been perforated while beating , there must have been a considerable  | discharge somewhere ; as the man had fallen forward , I could not imagine where this discharge had gone , and I wanted to find out . Naturally , as soon as I began my autopsy , it became evident that this bleeding simply had not taken place , and there could be but one adequate cause for that ; the heart could not have been beating when punctured . In short , the body must already have been dead when the bullets entered . Of course , the question arose immediately as to what had caused death if the gunshot wounds had not , and in prosecuting the autopsy further , we soon discovered the presence of hydrocyanic acid in the stomach , in quantity sufficient to kill half a dozen men . And the girl must have died of the same thing , ' Pell continued . An extremely minute dose , however ; it must have been too small to be measured . That is one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she had taken just a mere sip of it in solution , she might have had so little that her death was delayed . Her symptoms were those of hydrocyanic acid poisoning , much modified , so modified , in fact , that they resembled those of a severe heart attack : I suppose that explains the disappearance of her body ? ' the captain suggested . Of course . The criminal feared an autopsy upon her because there was no adequate cause of death , rather than upon her father . In some way he has stolen and either hidden or disposed of the body . ' Have you ascertained anything further , Dr. Pell ? ' No , sir , I have not . ' The ship 's doctor was obviously distressed . I can get no light upon it at all . The night nurse assures me that she was in the ward all night and that she did not leave it at all . Her midnight supper was brought in by a steward and she ate it at her desk . ' Is she reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion , sir . Miss Jenkins , the day nurse , is also dependable ; and she says that  | nothing out of the way has occurred since she came on in the morning . I am certain that neither of them could be influenced or bribed to so serious an offence . That accounts for the entire time since I was last in the private room , when both bodies were there . To be sure , there is a window in that room , through which a daring man could have removed the body at some time during the night . But not unless he had an accomplice . ' Hum  --  well  --  supposing all this , what do you think they could then have done with the body , Dr. Pell ? ' asked Captain Mansfield . My God , Captain , I do n't know . I can only suppose that they managed to convey it unobserved to the boat deck and then to drop it overboard . They must , of course , have chosen their opportunity carefully , and in addition been aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger , seeing a body fall past the lower decks , would have raised the alarm immediately . ' Would the body float ? ' Possibly . But of course it would have been weighted . The captain waited some moments but Dr. Pell had nothing further to offer . Well , ' he summed up , I suppose for the time being we must take such happenings for granted . Of course , I have already instructed the detectives and the ship 's police to be on the look-out for anything suspicious . Now about this other matter , ' he continued , observing the two physicians , you are both agreed that Mr. Smith 's death was caused by this poison and not by the bullet wounds ? As I understand it , you feel sure that the poison acted first because of the lack of bleeding from the heart ? Am I right in that ? ' That is correct , ' Dr. Schall answered . Of course , there are other and more technical reasons for this conclusion , to which we would both be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith 's body can not be charged with his actual murder ? Only the poisoner can be charged ? '  | That is so , ' echoed the doctors . But that opens up again the possibility of suicide , or of a suicide pact . No , it does n't either , ' the captain contradicted himself . I have taken possession of all the belongings of Mr. Smith and his daughter and there is no sign of any poison or means of administering it among them . Nor in the garments they were wearing when they died . Also , the vicinity of their table was thoroughly searched at the time , although for a different reason . I do not think they themselves could have disposed of all evidence of such a plot , even in the unlikely event that suicides would care anything about the point . We must conclude , then , that someone deliberately poisoned them . That is the person we must find . I must admit , gentlemen , that your news is very discouraging indeed . ' Captain Mansfield ! ' Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone turned to look at him where he still stood near the door . Plechs launched forth with animation . I do not think that the situation is so bad , Captain . To me it seems that the light is breaking at last . All this afternoon I am thinking and thinking about this problem ; and always I come up against the final argument that the murder is committed by shooting . It is out of key with the other factors ; it will not fit in with the picture I have of the real criminal . But , now , now we find that the case is poisoning ! It is the missing factor ; now at last I think I see my way clear . ' Captain Mansfield looked surprised and interested . I am glad to hear you say so , Dr. Plechs . And I should be very glad to hear your view , if you can give it to us now , ' he said . I shall be pleased . But again , I can not offer you the police proof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to the criminal , who is revealed by the psychological elements of the crime . '  | Ah ! you have a definite suspect in mind , then ? ' Oh , yes ; very definite . But if I am to tell you how I came to my conclusion , I must first say something about psychology , because I have come to it through psychology . You have heard of psychology from Dr. Hayvier . But Dr. Hayvier , highly as I regard him both personally and in his scientific work , is not a psychologist . He is a most advanced physiologist , being interested in what he calls highly complicated reflex actions ; really responses of the muscles . The whole rich field of the mind he leaves unexplored ; he even denies that it exists , a denial which all true psychologists will hardly think worthy of refutation or argument . People do have thoughts and feelings quite apart from their bodily accompaniment , and the laws governing thoughts and feelings are the true subject-matter of psychology . Even if they are not " apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were . ' Do you mean to say , ' Pell asked , that a thought has no relation to what goes on in the brain ? I have always taken it for granted that the two were simply different aspects of an identical happening . ' Dr. Plechs fingered his tiny moustache for a moment , and then went on . It may be , ' he acknowledged , as the medical profession in general takes it for granted that when we think , there are certain occurrences in the brain . It may even be that such occurrences take place , not in the brain , but in the larynx , as Dr. Hayvier supposes . But those occurrences , wherever they may be , are not in themselves the act of thinking , they are only the accompaniments of that act . Psychic life , gentlemen , is not a mere reflection of these mechanical movements ; no , psychic life is always and everywhere purposive . It seeks some goal , it has a will . The will to power , ever seeking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key to psychic life . The psyche strives , and not for nothing ; the psyche strives to attain the goal of superiority . So I find it , always .  | But we must get back to the present crime . Now as to this , who could have poisoned Mr. Smith 's drink ? Anyone at his table , presumably , the steward who served him or someone at an adjoining table . I dismiss the steward , I dismiss Miss Smith , who was also poisoned as we hear , and I dismiss the two young men sitting with him . Mr. Younghusband I have not analysed of course , but I believe him to be a normal young man ; all of his actions since the tragedy have been those of a well-adjusted personality . Mr. Gnosens is abnormal just now , in fact is informally under my care , but his abnormality is well accounted for by the fact that he was greatly in love with Miss Smith . I am sure he is not of the unbalanced type of sadist who would have seriously considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all I think of Mr. de Brasto . And I do not think we have farther to go . Here we find ? ' But de Brasto has been acquitted , ' interjected Schall . Of the shooting , but not of the poisoning , ' Dr. Plechs reminded them . In other respects Mr. de Brasto was indicated as the man , but these indications also showed that he could not have killed with a gun . Then why did he ever fire at all ? Perhaps I can show you why , now that we know the real weapon was poison , a weapon he would be much more likely to choose . What do we find of Mr. de Brasto ? ' Dr. Plechs asked again . He suffers from an organic inferiority , ' he asserted , answering his own question . I would not hesitate to say that he has a weak stomach . It is well known that those who suffer from a defective digestive apparatus develop great psychic capabilities in nutritional directions ; they frequently exhibit gourmandism on the physical side , together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do not know if Mr. de Brasto is stingy , but we may believe that he has an inordinate desire for money , if only from his occupation as a dubious lawyer . He is even willing to give up a portion of social respect in his efforts to acquire money .  | In such unfortunate people , when they discover or suppose that they are organically inferior , a psychic compensation arises . They strive in distorted ways to become the Perfect Man ; we call this the " masculine protest " . But they do not do so normally ; they devise a guiding fiction in which they become more and more enmeshed , until they hang suspended in a world of unreality . I have thought much of Mr. de Brasto , and I have , even this afternoon , made inquiries about him . I find that he eats only in the Ritz restaurant and that he insists upon " kosher " food , prepared for him according to special recipes which he has given to the chef personally . Here , in one action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronizes an exclusive restaurant instead of the ordinary dining-room ; he sets himself off from many of those , even of his own faith , by eating nothing but " kosher " food on all occasions ; and he sets himself off from most of mankind by being a delicate gourmand , with his dishes further specially prepared . By these abnormal means he attempts to reassure himself as to his superiority when in fact he really feels inferior . He is a very bad case of the ego-centricity which so often finds the antithetical inferior-superior expression . And all this in addition to the fact that he is a Hebrew , one of those who , because of racial prejudice , frequently suffer from a feeling of inferiority in the absence of a true organic cause . ' At this point Captain Mansfield interrupted him . Wo n't you sit down , Dr. Plechs ? Take this chair over here . You will be more comfortable . ' No , ' said Plechs . I speak better on my feet . ' He continued to walk up and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow his progress . I have ascertained further that he was being actively persecuted by Mr. Smith . In every auction pool of the voyage Mr. Smith , who possessed far greater resources , tried to keep him from acquiring a number , and of course succeeded . Can you  | imagine , gentlemen , the effect of this upon a man already suffering from de Brasto 's feeling ? In Smith he saw the actual personification of that brutal , unreal world of his fiction , which scorned and humiliated him . With what greater gesture could he seek the goal of superiority , could he reassure himself of his own suspected manhood than the destruction , the death , of this enemy who stood for all his enemies ? I should like to know , ' said Dr. Plechs , if there is any poison in Mr. de Brasto 's luggage . And I should also like to know where he was last night during the hours when the body of Miss Smith disappeared . ' He paused and regarded the captain as if expecting an immediate reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor 's questions . It occurred to Captain Mansfield that they might be obtained . He pressed a button on his desk . While awaiting the response , he said slowly : I must confess again that none of this had occurred to me . I know nothing of the controversies between you and Dr. Hayvier , but your theory is certainly as plausible as his . While I am not convinced this time , as I was last , nevertheless , I feel it my duty to inquire at once into the points you raise . ' He was interrupted by the entrance of his steward , who opened the door and stood waiting beside it . Mann , ' said the captain , I want you to find Lieutenant Lane and give him a note . He will write a reply on it which you are to bring back . Also I want you to find Detective Bone or Detective Heddes and give him another note , to which there will be no reply . ' He hastily scribbled on two sheets of paper and handed them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain turned again to the others . We shall find out something from Lieutenant Lane . And I have instructed the detectives to make a quiet search of de Brasto 's cabin , if they find it unoccupied . While we are waiting , I should like to have you tell us , Dr. Plechs , how you reconstruct  | the actual crime . How do you account for the bullets ? And why did de Brasto have a gun to fire , if your theory is correct ? ' These questions I have considered , ' answered Plechs at once . I suppose in the first place that de Brasto had found out where Smith would sit and took the table next him . He had brought his poison and awaited an opportunity to slip it into the drinks . He may have done this when Smith 's steward passed his own table , although of course I was not there and I do not profess to know just how it was accomplished . It was done in some way , for the drinks were poisoned . De Brasto then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps Smith left his drink alone , appeared to have forgotten it . Not only did it not come , but the lights went out , occasioning an unusual situation . If Smith had not taken his drink before , it was unlikely now that he ever would ; it was possible that the room would be cleared and the passengers sent out . The attempt , so carefully planned , was on the verge of failing and de Brasto , with a gun in his pocket , at the last moment found his courage with an uncongenial weapon that he would never have used in the first place . His will to power forced him , in the end , and at the last moment , to an actual shooting . The very fact of the darkness , while not really valuable in the case of a gun without a silencer , made the shooting resemble more closely a poisoning than would a man-to-man encounter in broad daylight . We must remember that all these considerations were unknown to de Brasto himself ; they were in his unconscious mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket I do not know ; but I do not think he had it with him in the first place with the explicit intention of shooting anyone . Perhaps the nature of his law practice had accustomed him to go about armed . Thus I account for the fact of de Brasto 's shot , but regarding the bullets that actually entered Mr. Smith 's body I am forced to admit that I have no definite theory . The fact that he was  | shot at all is a most amazing coincidence . It may be of course , that Mr. Smith has another enemy on board whose attempt to kill him was forestalled by de Brasto . If so , this second enemy would be of a very different type from the poisoner . I must say that I do not have a great confidence in the story of the gunman who was said to have fired at de Brasto . At any rate it seems now that these shots , for whatever reason they were fired , constitute a different offence than the murder we are engaged at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . ' I am afraid you did not take my meaning , Doctor , ' said the captain . I mean regarding the bullets that killed , that is , I should say the bullets that entered the body . I did not mean to ask you who fired them . I wondered if you could explain how Mr. Smith , having already died from the effects of this poison and fallen forward on to the table , could still be shot from in front . That is a point we must consider . ' Dr. Pell as he listened to the captain 's words , suddenly remembered something . He said , It sounds queer , the way you put it , sir . But if I recall correctly , that is the way it must have happened . Do you remember that Stymond testified that he had heard the fall of Mr. Smith 's body before the report of de Brasto 's gun ? Dr. Hayvier caught him up on it at the time , but , I think , that was later proved truthful . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I think I see how it could have happened , ' contributed Dr. Schall . I think , yes , I remember distinctly , that Mr. Smith 's chair had fallen over backwards when the lights came on . is it possible that as the poison took effect , Mr. Smith got to his feet , knocking over the chair , and as he pitched forward , already dead , received the bullets ? Of course , it is only a guess , a rather wild one , I fear ; but it would account for what seems to have happened . ' Yes , ' cried Pell , that must be it . That accounts for the sequence ,  | and we know nothing that would preclude such an effect ; he may have risen to his feet with some notion of seeking assistance at the first moment . ' But it does n't account for it , ' Captain Mansfield put it . You have yet to explain how Mr. Smith had already fallen before the shot went off . Oh , no , I forget . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' No , ' said Dr. Pell in confirmation . And de Brasto said he saw the flash of the other gun before he fired himself . In fact , we know it must have been fired sooner , if Smith 's body had already fallen with two bullets in it before de Brasto shot . ' The captain seemed impressed . Yes , ' he admitted , I see that it could have happened that way . Now the question is , how can we finally determine the guilt of this man , if he is actually guilty ? I am not optimistic about the search of his cabin ; I am afraid he would have found plenty of time in which to have disposed of any remaining poison by now . What do you say , Dr. Plechs ? Will you examine him as Stymond was examined , if Dr. Pons is willing to set up his apparatus again ? If de Brasto is the type you describe , I should think our chances of obtaining a confession from him under those conditions were better than with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Plechs responded . I feel , however , that I have done all I really can in pointing out the man I suspect . Of course , I shall be glad to make an examination of him , if you wish . ' But I thought all you scientists were never satisfied until you had completed your theories with an experiment ? ' Ah , Captain , perhaps we are not all just that kind of scientist . Personally , I have always received verification for my own theories from the results of my treatment as evidenced by my patients . ' I see . Well , I 'm sure I do n't know much about it , Doctor , although I am trying hard to learn something of your science of  | psychology , ' Mansfield observed with the suggestion of a smile . It is a little difficult because you do n't seem entirely to agree with each other . ' That is true . As for me , these tests of Dr. Pons 's do not impress me greatly . I do not mean to imply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add , or that it is not really excellent work . But for me they are too  --  well , too physiological . I do not see that they are actually psychological . I would not care to give the same kind of test as Stymond was given ; I am not familiar with it . But if you wish , I will examine Mr. de Brasto with the free association method . It has often been very effective and it is a much better way of dealing directly with the mind of the subject . ' Any way you like , Doctor . So long as it may lead either to a confession or to some further evidence . Will you examine him in the morning , then , Doctor ? ' As Dr. Plechs expressed his agreement , there came a knock at the door . Heddes entered and saluted the captain . Did you find anything , Heddes ? ' the latter asked immediately . Well , no , sir , we did n't . They were out , and we had a good look around . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this track again . That fellow de Brasto is the man we want . Bone and me have been sure of it all along . ' But you found no sign of a poison or anything that might have contained it or by which it could have been administered , such as a hypodermic syringe ? ' No , sir . We looked for any capsules , too . The only thing in the luggage  --  it was all open  --  or in the cabin either , that was like it , was a bottle of Bell-Ans . I brought up a couple of tablets for analysis , but they look like the real thing to me . ' He handed two small pellets to Dr. Pell . The ship 's doctor peered at them closely . They look all right to me , ' he admitted , but of course , we ca n't tell . I 'll have them  | analysed right away , to be on the safe side . ' Oh , yes , sir , and here is a note from Lieutenant Lane . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , spread it out and read , With B. all evening . Left him at his cabin about one-thirty . Said he was turning in . Heard him lock door and left . Met him again at cabin this morning ninethirty before his breakfast . ' Just as I thought , ' Captain Mansfield commented . He had the opportunity , but that does n't prove he used it . Well , we shall see . ' Coming out on the bridge-like projection of the deck in front of the captain 's quarters , Pons took up a position at the forward rail and looked out over the brightening sea ahead . At Drake 's suggestion he had risen early to observe a sunrise at sea . The leaden sky remained overcast but away in the east it was broken by several long horizontal and parallel cloud banks just above the horizon . Here a very light blue peeped through , and the lower edges of the banks began to be tinged a faint , rosy gold . Slowly the bow rose and fell , with the slightest of motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-grey and all the possible shades and shadings of the two colours . The smooth water , the clouds overhead , the cloud banks , all contributed these tones . Slowly the banks ahead changed colour ; by infinitesimal degrees they became purple , red lights shot through them in unexpected places ; and finally the brilliant orb of the sun itself appeared , edging its way above the lowest bank . Not until then did the doctor happen to glance to his left along the platform on which he stood , and espy another solitary figure , leaning bareheaded and in evening clothes against the farthest limit of the rail . I 'll be damned , ' muttered Pons ; and with involuntary friendliness  | walked over to the man whom he had recognized at once as Younghusband . Well , young man , ' he cried cheerfully , as he came up , I see you are also out enjoying nature . ' Younghusband turned sharply at hearing himself addressed , and Dr. Pons was amazed at the startling change in his appearance . His dark hair , blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat aspect ; one dank lock hung raggedly down over his left eye . His rather good-looking face bore deep lines , especially from the ends of his mouth to his nostrils , and his straight nose seemed unaccustomedly long , heightening the pinched expression of his features . His black eyes had retired into his head ; under each of them depended great , dark circles . Altogether he reminded Pons forcibly of a worried and desperate fox . A gust of wind brought on overpowering smell of liquor to the doctor 's nose . What 's the matter , Younghusband ? You look sick . ' I 'm not sick , ' replied the other , a little thickly , and Pons noticed that he kept a tense hold with both hands on the rail . Drank too much ; trying to sober up . ' Oh . ' Pons leaned up against the rail beside him , and again looked out ahead . Well , I ca n't blame you for drinking good liquor while you can . Still , I 'd say you 'd missed the pleasantest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down now and sleep it off ? ' Hell , I ca n't sleep . I 'm worried . Ca n't you see I 'm worried ? ' Younghusband demanded jerkily . All damn gunmen around , shooting people . Letting ' em off with silly tests . Must get one of them . Dangerous ; they 'll get us . Who killed Smith ? ' he cried bitterly . One o ' them . Ought to get him . Nobody safe till we get him ! ' Abruptly he became calm . He faced Pons and said more quietly , I know I 'm making a fool of myself , but I am worried about this thing . Not reassuring to sit at a table with a man and  | have him shot at your side . I ca n't doze off comfortably with things like this . Went up to the Ritz when everything else closed and stayed there till four , when that closed . Been walking around since then , trying to think how to get him . ' Dr. Pons considered him steadily for some moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no condition to do much thinking just now . Better take my advice and go down . Anyhow , Dr. Plechs believes he has solved the crime . He is going to examine his man before the captain this morning ; maybe the criminal will be in a cell before you wake up . ' Who is it ? ' Younghusband turned eagerly toward the doctor . Why , it 's de Brasto again . So Plechs told me . ' De Brasto ? ' Younghusband 's face fell . But we finished with him before . He was let out . ' Sure . But did n't you know ? Smith was killed by poison . De Brasto was only let out of the ? ' Poison ! ' Younghusband 's face , already pale , went dead white ; even his lips were blanched . He swayed slightly and caught at the rail . Who found that out ? Why , it 's not true . It is n't true , I tell you ! He was shot , I saw the holes in him myself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Pons soothingly . But he was already dead when he was shot . Anyhow , you 're upset , no use your worrying about it now . Much better if you get your steward to bring you a bromo , and then get some sleep . Why , you look almost as bad as your friend Gnosens did a couple of days ago . ' Younghusband stood now with his face averted , gazing down over the side , shivering a little and mumbling . De Brasto , de Brasto , yes , I did n't like his looks . Poison ; do n't believe it . They 've made a mistake , another silly mistake . ' He looked up again and spoke more clearly . You 're right , I ought to be in bed . Going now . '  | He turned away and took a few steps , then staggered perceptibly . Pons caught his arm and assisted him along the deck . Younghusband was evidently drunker than he seemed . Pons helped him into his cabin , rang for the steward , and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door upon the other 's muttering , and proceeded back toward the elevators . When he reached them , he saw that one , at least , was now in commission . Pons pulled out his watch . Nearly seven o'clock . He was n't sure just when breakfast was obtainable , but his stomach demanded suddenly that he find out . He pressed the button of the elevator . The car was then at the boat deck ; it descended , lingered some moments at A deck , and then came down . The doors opened . Good morning , sir , ' said the operator . Good morning , ' responded the doctor , stepping within . The dining-room , please . Well , everyone seems to be up early this morning ! How are you to-day , Gnosens ? ' Fine and dandy , Dr. Pons , is n't it ? Looks like a nice day . On your way to a bit of breakfast , Doctor ? ' Gnosens 's face was pink and freshly shaven , his hair carefully brushed ; he wore a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful and altogether he presented the picture of a healthy young man , looking forward eagerly to a day filled with pleasant diversions . For the second time that morning Pons found himself astonished by a remarkable change . He regarded his companion curiously . You surprise me , ' he admitted . Oh , here we are . Will you join me ? That is , if we can find anything to eat yet . ' With the greatest pleasure , Doctor , ' Gnosens answered , almost jubilantly . Perhaps we 're a little early , ' he ventured , as a steward appeared around a corner and approached . Good morning , sir . Breakfast ? Will you sit over here , please ? The full staff has not come on yet , so if you do n't mind leaving  | your regular table ? Thank you . ' The ordering completed , Dr. Pons pursued his previous remark . Look here , young fellow , ' he continued , I have n't seen you since day before yesterday , but I must say you seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but really I 've seldom seen so much of a change . ' Gnosens 's expression changed slightly , but he proceeded as cheerfully as before . Ah , you see I have been favoured by the good Dr. Plechs . Let us give him the credit . A splendid chap , our Plechs . ' The young man 's eyes twinkled suspiciously . Pons grinned in spite of himself . Then he said more seriously , But you ca n't fool me that way , Gnosens . Plechs is competent , and successful . He does a lot of people a lot of good . But not so rapidly . And you were n't fooling the other day ; you were pretty miserable up in the cafe . ' Gnosens appraised the doctor closely and also seriously . But when he replied , his tone was still light . Yes , that 's right , I was . . . . Well , I got over it , that 's all . ' He smiled brightly . I was suffering from a  --  well  --  an infatuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but that 's what I 'd call it . Anyhow , it 's gone and there you are . Why not give the man some credit ? He 's worked hard . A complete cure ; I shall send him a testimonial , a signed statement , or something . As I said , a great fellow , Plechs . " Pons shook his head humorously but dubiously . Well , have it your own way . You 've done it yourself somehow , though Plechs doubtless helped . Not that it matters , as long as you 've recovered . I was worried about you , boy . ' Do n't think I do n't appreciate it , Doctor ; I do . If I have n't thanked you very well , it 's only because I do n't know how . I ? ' Oh , do n't think about that , ' Pons assured him . I did n't do much that I can remember . Do n't think about it again . Are you going up to the trial this morning ? I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again ? ' Yes . That is , if they 'll let me in . ' They 'll let you in . Of course Plechs has told you about the new matter of the poison ? ' Yes , sure . Oh , he told me all about it , all his dope on de Brasto , too . But if you ask me , I think he 's wrong . I do n't believe de Brasto did it at all . ' You do n't eh ? Well , Plechs is a pretty shrewd judge of people . Still , he might be wrong . Who do you think did it ? ' How should I know who did it ? I 'm not much of a detective , you know . ' But if de Brasto is n't guilty , I think you 'd better be a detective . There are n't many who had the chance , if it was put in his drink , as they suppose . Only you and Younghusband , and his daughter , if de Brasto 's party is ruled out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side ? ' No , not near enough to reach across , if that 's what you mean . One of those standing lights they have , was on that side , and then a little space , before the next table . Not much , but enough to prevent any reaching . That 's the side I was sitting on with ... with Coralie . ' Well , how about her ? ' asked Pons . I suppose I can ask , now that you 've got over your infatuation ? Do you think she did it ? ' Coralie ! Why , you 're crazy , man ! She could n't have done ; she was poisoned herself , was n't she ? ' Might have made a mistake . ' Now , look here . Get that right out of your head . Why , she ? she would n't have poisoned anyone . She was a damn sweet girl , even if I 'm not silly about her any longer . She would n't have poisoned her father ! ' All right , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't accused her yet . But after all , you did n't really know much about her , did you now ? Was she actually his daughter ? '  | Actually his daughter ? ' Gnosens 's face was a study in astonishment . Who said she was n't ? Has that chap Younghusband been hinting around to you ? He tried me and I told him to go to hell . But , my God , he did n't say she was n't his daughter . Of course she was his daughter ; I ought to know , ought n't I ? What did you think ? ' A cousin , maybe ; I do n't know . I saw them that night , and certainly they did n't look much alike . But then , I have no reason to think she was n't ; it was only a chance remark . Let 's pass it . What about Younghusband , then ? He had the opportunity . ' I do n't like that bird at all , ' said Gnosens frankly . ' Something about him gets under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think we 've come to him yet , do you ? And how could he have done it , anyway ? I was sitting right there next to him all evening . I do n't see how he could have done anything without my seeing him , and I did n't . ' In the dark ? ' No , not in the dark , either . When the lights went , I put my hand out and touched him , unintentionally . He sat perfectly still right up to the shooting , I know he did . Could n't have seen where the glasses were if he 'd tried , anyhow . It was pitch black , and no one could have known it was coming . ' Yes , well , it looks as if you were right . I have n't any reason to suspect him , either . And that only leaves you . You did n't do it , did you ? On account of parental objections ? ' Pons looked quizzically across the table at his fellow breakfaster . Gnosens smiled back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And you forget there were n't any parental objections ; there had n't been time for anything to object to . ' You were so sure she was his daughter , I only wondered if you had had an interview . ' I see . But it had n't got that far . I 'm sure Coralie was Smith 's daughter because it 's so absurd to go imagining anything else . She said so , he said so , everyone said so . You do n't usually  | suspect people because they do n't show you a birth certificate . ' You 're right , of course , Gnosens . It was nothing but a chance idea ; the only reason I 've thought of it twice myself , is because you took me up on it so sharply . And now we 've let everyone out , except de Brasto . Somehow his motive does n't seem strong enough to me , but then what do we know about it ? He may have had another connection with Smith that we know nothing about . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Plechs were right about him . It 's a strong case , as he puts it . ' Pons wiped his mouth with his napkin . Are you through , Gnosens ? There 's nothing the matter with your appetite , I 'll say that for you . You 've eaten enough for two men . Let 's go up on deck and have a cigarette . ' Gnosens also rose , and together they walked over to the elevators . ' I ' 11 join you later , if I may , ' he said . I want to go back to my cabin for a few minutes . But I 'll go up to the captain 's room with you , if it 's all right . ' Meet me up there , ' the doctor answered , now in the car , which had arrived while they were talking . I have some more junk to fix up for them for this session . Just ask for me and they will let you in . The captain 's office again . So long . ' Pons got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw when he came out on deck was Dr. Plechs . The latter was just mounting the enclosed stairway to the captain 's quarters . He stopped and turned at Pons 's call ; then came down to the deck again and awaited him . I have been looking for you , ' said Dr. Plechs . Your steward tells me you got up very early . You have arranged everything successfully for the key you were speaking of ? ' The voice-key ? Oh , yes . I 've fixed everything . It will be ready for you . I 'm to meet the electrician in the office at eightthirty , to connect the motor to the chronoscope and make any adjustments necessary . Do n't worry , we 'll have everything ready in time . '  | Ah , I am glad . It is very kind of you , Doctor , especially as I did not want the other apparatus . But you know , I am not familiar with those instruments , that is how it is . And I do not think they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confession ob  --  er  --  we will obtain a confession , I think , when the association test is over . And after I explain it to the subject ; yes , after I explain it . ' I hope you 're right , ' Pons responded . The captain will think we 're all a set of dubs , if we do n't produce the goods . I certainly hope you can get a confession . ' This time , I think , we are right . I have found out more . This de Brasto , he will eat no food that is red , the waiter tells me . No , not even pink ; everything of those hues must have false colouring added , artificial , I think he said . If it is not possible , then he will not eat it . A most curious symptom ; I have never met with it before . Of course it must have to do with the guiding fiction , but as yet I do not know about it . We shall see , perhaps it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny one , ' Dr. Pons acknowledged . Never heard of it , either . By the bye , I had breakfast with a patient of yours , Gnosens . You seem to have fixed him up all right . He was as chipper as a daisy . Bit of a change , that man . ' Ah , that Mr. Gnosens . ' Dr. Plechs looked far from happy over his success . I have failed badly there . I have made a mistake . But I still have hope . Do n't you see , ' he advanced a step and tapped upon Dr. Pons 's broad chest with his finger for emphasis , the poor young man , his troubles have not been cured . They have not been brought out and calmly analysed . There has been no ab-reaction at all . No , he could not face them and they have disappeared into his unconscious ; I fear they have gone very deep down . For the moment he presents a false happiness , but they will trouble him all his life unless something is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry . But I am afraid it is even worse . He shows the clinical  | picture , what some call maniac-depressive . He goes from the fever of misery to the fever of joy , both unreal . He is now entering upon an elation , a most serious elation . Yesterday he was , as you say , flippant with me , and last night he would not admit me to his cabin . ' Would n't , eh ? ' said Pons , as Dr. Plechs paused for breath . No , he would not . He forebade me to come again . It is most serious , that . But I shall try . I shall approach him gently , in the public rooms . Even yet , I may be able to succeed with him . Ah , but I must go . The captain awaits me . And I have not eaten yet . You will pardon me , Doctor ? ' Surely . Yes , go ahead . If you feel like I did , you must be starved . I 'll see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the voice-key . ' Dr. Plechs once more mounted the steps . He was shaking his head doubtfully and as he vanished , Pons heard him repeat , A serious elation . ' He himself lit a cigarette and continued his walk thoughtfully . A sudden idea had occurred to him . When Gnosens was admitted to the captain 's sitting-room , whither he was told the inquiry had been shifted , he found Dr. Pons still at work with the chief electrician . As he came in , they were engaged in stowing several apparently heavy boxes and coils under the centre table . The room had been returned to its customary appearance . It was now arranged as it had been on the occasion of de Brasto 's first examination . The table had been cleared , but before the end and one of the side chairs , reposed what looked like telephone instruments ; and in front of another chair rested a circular dial , with a pointer pivoted in its centre and graduated markings around its circumference , the whole enclosed in a case with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small motor . From all three instruments wires ran to the mysterious boxes underneath the table ; other wires connected these  | objects on the floor with a side-light bracket . You 've just come at the right moment , Gnosens , ' Pons grunted , getting up from his knees and mopping off his brow . Everything 's fixed and now we want to try it out and be sure it 's working properly . Sit down at that phone beside the table , will you ? And you at the end , if you will , ' he added , indicating Holt , who had also risen to his feet . Now speak into them , Mr. Gnosens first , please . ' He himself sat down before the dial , reaching into his portfolio on the table for some paper and pencils . Gnosens sat down gingerly . He hesitated , then said , Hello , ' into the receiver . The electrician hesitated still more , but finally answered , Hello . Well , that 's no good , ' explained Pons good-naturedly . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds or so you 'll run the pointer off . We 're measuring in twelve-hundredths of a second here . Now try again , Gnosens first , then a quick answer , then Gnosens , and so on for a few times . All right ? ' Hello ' ? Hello . ' . . . Hello ' ? Hello : Wait a minute , ' cried Pons . Stupid of me ; I forgot to tell you . You 'll find little catches on each of the receivers ; just turn them over and start again . I had better not speak after you turn them , so begin again when I raise my hand . ' Obediently both men found and turned their switches . Dr. Pons raised his hand . Hello ' ? Hello . ' . . . Hello ' ? Hello : . . . Hello ' ? Hello : ... Hello ' ? Hello . Pons turned a switch on his dial and raised his hand again . All right , ' he said . That 's fine . Thank you . Everything is workink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holt , if you can . I 'm afraid I 'm not familiar enough with your transformers , to fix them up if they go wrong . Can you stay ? ' The chief electrician acquiesced . I can stay all right , if you  | need me . ' It was evident that his curiosity was aroused . That 's a clever arrangement you 've got there ; I 'd like very much to see it in real action . ' Drake and the captain appeared in the doorway . The latter bowed slightly . Ah , good morning , gentlemen . Glad to see you , Mr. Gnosens ; I hear you have been ill the last few days . I can see you are quite well again now , however . ' You wo n't mind if I stay , sir , ' Gnosens began . Captain Mansfield waved his hand . Not at all , not at all . Is Mr. Younghusband coming this morning ? ' Pons answered , I do n't believe so , Captain . I put him to bed not so long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the murder . ' Humph . It is beginning to worry me a little , too . But I did n't stay up all night . ' The captain pulled out a large , gold watch . Nine-thirty , ' he pronounced . Where are the rest , do you suppose ? ' Hardly had he spoken when the door opened again , and Dr. Plechs entered , followed by de Brasto . His bodyguard , Lieutenant Lane , Detectives Bone and Heddes came next and Stander , recently released from his confinement , came in last , to all appearances as full of importance as ever . Captain Mansfield looked rather surprised . I see you have brought Mr. Stander , Mr. de Brasto . ' Stander stepped forward . I am here as Mr. de Brasto 's counsel . I intend to be a witness to this illegal examination . You will prevent me at your peril . I warn you . ' The captain seemed unimpressed . He motioned to the divan . Sit over there , Mr. Stander , ' he said . You will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult a competent Admiralty lawyer . Meanwhile , I have no objection to your presence , provided you refrain from interruption . At the least sign of it , you will go out again , and you will  | remain in confinement until this voyage is ended . Mark my words well , sir . And take a seat . ' Stander moved ponderously to the divan without another word , and sat down . De Brasto was seated at the end of the table and Dr. Plechs at the telephone instrument nearest the door . The others found various places around the room . When they were all settled , the captain inquired : Perhaps you will explain , Dr. Pons , what these instruments are for , before we begin to-day ? Unless there is some reason why you do not wish the accused to know about them . ' None at all , ' said Pons . This set-up is what is known as a Marston-Troland voice-key . It measures the interval between the stimulus word of the examiner and the response of the subject , what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice coming over the first telephone starts the pointer revolving on the dial , and the following voice over the second , or response , line , stops it . That 's all there is to it , a simple measuring device . Dr. Plechs will tell you about the " free association " test he is going to make . ' Dr. Pons sat down , arranging his records , and looked across the table at his confrere . Oh , and one more thing , ' he added . The instruments are rather sensitive , so we should have silence during the test , except for the stimulus word , given by Dr. Plechs , and the response of the subject . ' The stenographer-clerk entered , chatting amiably with Dr. Hayvier , and Plechs in a few words instructed him in his duties for the examination . Then he turned back to the others . What I am about to conduct , ' he explained , is sometimes called the " free association " test . It is used generally in my profession for diagnostic purposes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The method is of the most simple . I will read off to the subject a list of words and he will respond to them verbally with the first word that occurs to him . He should not stop to think and arrange a reply ; in case he should  | expect to outwit me by those means , I will say at once that such hesitation , even if so slight as to be unnoticed by us , will nevertheless be recorded on Dr. Pons 's instruments and serve as a valuable guide to our conclusions . He should reply at once , as quickly as possible , as soon as he finds a word to speak . Regarding the detailed interpretation of the results , I should prefer to wait until the responses are recorded , when I shall explain the matter fully both to him and to the rest of you gentlemen . ' He turned about and faced de Brasto . Do you understand what is required ? ' he asked . Yes , ' de Brasto answered tonelessly . He looked worn-out , almost ill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural curl and was plastered back dankly from his pale forehead . But there is no use in this persecution . I am innocent ; I have been proved innocent . I did not shoot Mr. Smith . I am in continual fear of further attack myself . I do n't know why you wish to subject me to this again . ' He ended rather piteously and sank back in his chair . Dr. Plechs , secure in his correct belief that all knowledge of the autopsy had been kept from his victim , regarded him with satisfaction . It is not necessary , ' he said , that you should know our motive at present . You must place yourself in our hands . You should co-operate and answer to the best of your ability . Are you ready to begin ? ' De Brasto reached slowly for the instrument before him and responded listlessly : All right . I see you are set upon it . I suppose I have no choice . ' The doctor sat down , arranged his papers before him , glanced across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he inquired . Dr. Pons nodded , as did also the stenographer , who had pulled up a chair next to him . Plechs turned toward the end of the table , raised his telephone , and spoke into it clearly , so that his voice would also carry directly to the subject .  | Table , ' he pronounced . Cloth , ' responded de Brasto . Dark : Light ' Music : Violin : Sickness . ' Sickness ? Health . ' Dr. Plechs glanced up sharply . Then went on without comment . Man : Woman : Deep . ' Light ' Soft ' Heavy . ' Eating . ' Drinking : Mountain : Hill ' House : Chair . ' Poison . ' Rats : Black . ' White . ' Mutton : White . ' Comfort : Mutton : At the end of the first twenty-two words , Dr. Plechs stopped . We will rest a little , ' he announced . Across the table Pons jotted down his last notation , reset his dial , and leaned back . The stenographer looked up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . Are you ready ? Let us begin . Sweet : Bitter . ' Whistle . ' Engine : ... Presently , with a hundred and ten words , the list was completed . To de Brasto it had seemed interminable , but actually the whole operation had consumed less than ten minutes . If you do not mind waiting a little , gentlemen ? ' said Plechs . We will proceed as fast as compatible with accuracy . I shall hope to have the preliminary results for you presently . ' Gradually the others drifted into conversations , as Pons and Plechs worked on . The time dragged on , conversations lapsed into silence again ; it was fully half an hour before all the computations had been completed , and Dr. Plechs , with a sheaf of notes in his hand , rose to address the assembly . Hayvier and the chief electrician , deep in a discussion beside one of the windows , sought chairs and everyone became attentive . Gentlemen , ' Dr. Plechs began in his best platform manner , I have just given our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of one hundred words , referred to in the KentRosanoff monograph , which has been used extensively upon both normal and abnormal subjects . The responses of a thousand normal subjects have been collected and organized ; they form a standard , as it were , against which we can check the replies of any new person we wish to examine . Certain associations have been found prevalent in normal cases ; when any word is responded to in a way different from any of the thousand response words already recorded , we call that an individual reaction . The Kent-Rosanoff manual tells us that in normal adults the individual responses will be about 6.8 per cent . of the whole , the great majority being common responses represented in the standard thousand , with a few doubtful instances .  | I may say now that this subject shows nearly 27 per cent . of individual responses . When the results vary as greatly as this from the normal expectation , they are to be more fully explored , and we may confidently expect that they will yield valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But such complexes , or sore spots , are revealed not only by the response word itself , but also by the reaction time , that is , the time between the hearing of the stimulus and the spoken answer of the subject . These times have usually been taken upon hand-manipulated stop-watches recording 1/ro seconds ; I need hardly say that Dr. Pons 's voice-key , which you have seen in operation , is a great improvement in accuracy , since it measures in 1/1200 seconds and also cuts out the individual variations introduced by the stop-watch operator . We may therefore have greater confidence in the results . It is agreed upon that a long reaction time almost always indicates that a complex has been touched . In these and further ways we may conclude much regarding the present subject . I will refer to some of these points in a moment . But I have also introduced at random into the KentRosanoff words this morning , a list of crucial stimulus words bearing directly or indirectly upon the crime we are investigating . We know as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , looking across at the divan , that Mr. Smith was poisoned , not shot . I have plenty of evidence here to implicate you in his death . ' De Brasto , who had been slouching back on the divan with his hands in his pockets , in an attitude that might have been an assumed nonchalance , jerked up spasmodically . His mouth fell slightly open and to everyone except the psychologist he appeared typically amazed . P-p-poisoned ! ' he stammered . Why , you 're crazy . I  --  I do n't  | know anything about it . He was shot ! ' He looked around at the other faces , saw that with the exception of Standees and the stenographer 's they expressed no surprise at all ; his own face took on a tinge of horror , and he broke down , commencing to whimper in a fashion extremely disturbing to everyone but Dr. Plechs . You 're trying to railroad me , ' he gasped , between sobs . There was  --  was n't any poison at all . You 're all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it , ' his voice rose shrilly , I did n't do it . I did n't do it ! ' Dr. Plechs spoke calmly to the captain . You see , ' he pointed out , how abnormal he is . The conspiracy delusion is a frequent occurrence with this type of inferiority complex . ' He turned back to de Brasto . Will you admit your guilt now , or do you force me to go further ? ' The Hebrew 's outburst had spent itself . Now he lay back on the couch , his gasping breath hardly audible . He shook his head hopelessly and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief . I do n't know anything about it , ' he said again , in a voice so low as scarcely to be heard . Plechs went on with his recital as if no interruption had occurred . To take up the first part of the test , the Kent-Rosanoff list ; here we find many illuminating side-lights upon the subject 's personality . In the first place , he is a fast reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 1/600 seconds , whereas any average less than I 1/2 seconds is to be considered unusually fast . His median time , perhaps a better measure than the average , is still considerably below I 1/2 seconds . The pertinence of this finding will appear in a minute . The results here bear out my diagnosis of an unstable type with a serious organic inferiority , centring about the digestive apparatus . The responses to words suggesting food were uniformly unusual . I may cite the instance of " mutton " , where the response was " white " , a significant repetition of the preceding  | response to " black " , where the disturbance was carried over to the next response ; that to the word " comfort " , the response being a repetition of the preceding stimulus , " mutton " . There were enough similar instances throughout the list to confirm this finding . Then also , when the stimulus word was " sickness " , we find a repetition of it in the response , namely " sickness ? health " , indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychic malady within him . Now we come to a striking point . Of the fifteen words in the Kent-Rosanoff list referring in some way to food or to eating , the subject 's reaction time to twelve of them was far below both his average and his median . Even the average for the whole fifteen is but 872/1200 second , or slightly more than %4 second . Now , gentlemen , what does this show ? ' demanded Dr. Plechs . It shows , ' he continued solemnly , that this subject is of a relatively small type , discovered by Dr. Pons some years ago . He is A " negative liar " , the type that lies faster than it tells the truth . Of course , this propensity is carried over to the responses , to words touching upon his abnormal complexes or the guiding fiction . Dr. Pons tells me that his researches lead him to believe that about one person out of eight or nine is of this extraordinary type . An exaggerated instance of this is to be found in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the crucial list . He replied with the word " hippopotamus " , an unheard-of reply as concerns the Kent-Rosanoff control list of a thousand , in the record time of 313/1200 seconds , about % second . I take it that this stimulus word touched off certain complexes concerned with his business ; being the type of " negative liar " that he is , he had , as it were , responses up his sleeve for such words , producing them with unusual speed when needed . But our instruments have revealed him just as readily as if he had taken an undue length of time to answer . This brings us to the " Crucial " list . The words , scattered  | through the longer list , together with the subject 's responses , were as follows : poison rats shady hippopotamus glass drink enemy man , woman Smith what ? oh , Jones vial needle die born beverage stein auction out kill die . From this we can see at once that the subject feels very inferior ; both man and woman are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the name of his victim , " Smith " , and asked " what ? " before responding . His mind was also running upon drinking , the means he used to administer the poison , his response to " glass " not being " tumbler " , the usual response , but " drink " , and to " beverage " it was " stein " , a container in which many drinks are served on board this boat . No doubt Mr. Smith drank his fatal dose from a stein . ' No , ' Gnosens put in , he did not . He was drinking absinthe , as a matter of fact . ' Well , ' Dr. Plechs went on , it is not important . Let it pass . It shows the trend of the thoughts . The response , " die " , to " kill " is obvious , although in this case it must be admitted , not unusual . And when he answered " aution " with " out " , we find a key to his actions that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Dr. Plechs , ' he asked , but what was the average time for this list ? ' For the crucial words ? ' Yes , for the list you are now discussing . ' Let me see , ' said Dr. Plechs , referring to his notes . Oh , yes ,  | here it is . The average times for these words , if we omit the response to " Smith " which was untypically long , was just I 19/1200 seconds . Of course , including the " Smith " response it was somewhat longer , but in so short a list , the inclusion of one exception would be misleading . That is why we take the median ; the median was almost precisely one second . ' And what did you say the average and median was for the whole list ? ' the captain persevered . It was ? . Ah , yes , the average was I 2/1200 seconds and the median I 23/1200 seconds . Then we may take it , since these measures are so close together in both cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regard to the crucial words ? ' Dr. Plechs shrugged deprecatingly . You are a close critic , Captain , ' he admitted . But you are right . I do not think that we would be justified in any conclusion as to his guilt from the reaction times recorded upon the crucial words . But as to their content , that is a far different matter . There , I think , I have been successful in demonstrating , so far as my technique will enable me in this brief time , that the subject is seriously involved in this crime . I believe I am right , sir , and I should advise that he be held for trial upon our arrival on shore . Meanwhile I shall organize my data more fully and have ready a complete report for the examining judges . ' He started to say more , then concluded not to , and sat down . Captain Mansfield seemed sorely perplexed . He hesitated , looked doubtfully around , and finally said : I am sorry , Dr. Plechs , but I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that there is something wrong with Mr. de Brasto ; so much has been established , and it is plain that he is nervous and overwrought . But that is a very different thing from a confession of guilt , even an unconscious one , regarding the death of Mr. Smith . That , of course , is my first interest . I confess that I am puzzled . ' Again he looked around the room  | and noted that at some time during the proceedings , Professor Mittle had come in and taken a seat near the door . I should like to ask the opinion of your associates on this question . How do you feel , Dr. Pons ? Is this a clear demonstration in your view ? ' Pons looked uneasy ; it was evident that he did not care to express himself . Seeing no alternative , he finally answered : To tell you the truth , Captain , I am not a psychoanalyst like Dr. Plechs . I am familiar with these techniques , of course , but I have never employed them myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion in this case . I am sorry , but I shall have to ask to be excused . And I would ask , if possible , that you take my remarks as having no bearing one way or the other upon your decision . ' The captain 's appearance was one of disappointment . I am disappointed , ' he acknowledged , and turned to Hayvier . Well , what do you say , Doctor ? ' I ? ' Hayvier answered at once . Oh , well , I do n't like to drag our controversies into your office , Captain Mansfield , but Dr. Plechs and everyone else knows that I have no use for all this talk about the unconscious and all the rest of it . Do n't believe in these " minds " , conscious or unconscious . Sorry , but I ca n't recommend the present theories . ' He looked over at Plechs with his frank smile , in time to see a slight frown of annoyance on the latter 's face . However , the frown disappeared at once . The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor , ' he said . Would you be so good as to let me have your opinion ? ' Ah , ' said Mittle , placing his fingers together and observing the captain judicially . Like Dr. Pons , I do not care to have my snap-judgment taken too seriously . I may , however , say this : I take no part in the current controversies of modern psychology . I am neither upon the side of Dr. Plechs nor upon  | that of Dr. Hayvier . How can I take sides in these arguments , when both sides go to false extremes ? To be sure , there is much to be recommended in both viewpoints . ' Captain Mansfield interrupted the discourse to put in : But about the test that has just been made , Professor ? ' Oh , ' said Mittle , there I fail to see how I can help you . No more than Dr. Pons would I care to commit myself as to this point . Especially as I came in late and did not witness all the proceedings . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you not ? ' Yes , well , yes I think I did . Practically all of it , at any rate . But I am afraid you will have to excuse me , too , Captain . I am afraid I shall have to be excused . ' His look plainly indicated that in his opinion the decision rested with the ship 's commander . Well , dammit , ' complained the latter , I have n't enough information . ' He looked to his detectives . Have you found anything at all incriminating in Mr. de Brasto 's cabin or effects ? Anything at all ? ' he asked . Heddes answered for them both . No , sir . just this morning we made another search when they were all down to breakfast . He 's either thrown the poison away , or he 's got it hid somewhere else now , sir . ' But I have n't got any poison , ' de Brasto broke in feverishly ; then he caught his breath and halted abruptly . Detective Bone looked at him suspiciously . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden inspiration , can I see you outside just a moment , sir ? ' Mansfield was surprised , but went immediately to the door . Only a moment , gentlemen ; I 'll be right back . ' He went out with his detective . Within five minutes he was back . I have come to a decision , ' he announced . We have not sufficient evidence on which to hold Mr. de Brasto in confinement , especially as he can not possibly escape . Accordingly I  | order him released for the present , and his position will be just as it was before this examination took place . I am sorry , gentlemen , that I have to close this meeting so abruptly , but I must go back to my duties . If you will all leave except Dr. Plechs and Lieutenant Lane , I should like to see them for a few moments . I have some instructions for Lieutenant Lane in regard to his men . He has not had much time for them for the past several days . All right , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments . ' With a final nod he dismissed the others . When they had left , he said to the doctor : I wanted you to stay , Dr. Plechs , so that I could explain to you that I have not over-ruled your case . I am still suspicious of de Brasto , even if I am not fully convinced . Meantime , Detective Bone has offered his advice . It is that we release Mr. de Brasto unconditionally , in the hope that he may incriminate himself , lead us to the poison , or commit some other act upon which we may fasten . I fear that it is too late for anything of the sort , but it seems our last chance . You will see yourself that you have not given us enough proof to go into court . ' That is all right , Captain , ' responded Plechs with complete good nature . I am used to the criticisms just brought against me , and I agree with you that we have not got all I could wish . In such complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not to be expected that we should find everything plainly and openly exposed . I am convinced , nevertheless , that de Brasto is the man , and sooner or later we will get a confession from him . ' Perhaps we shall do so , Doctor . Now , Mr. Lane , this is what I want to say to you : I want you to go about with Mr. de Brasto just as you have been doing . But every now and then , not too often , make some excuse and leave him alone for a time ; in short , give him some opportunities . Naturally , I do not want you really to leave him ; you must keep an eye on him , especially when he thinks himself unobserved . Leave him in this  | way in different parts of the boat , so that he may have as much chance as possible to reach anything he may have secreted . You have seen nothing of his alleged assailant , I suppose ? My God , it sounds as childish as a nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else can we do ? ' Very well , sir , ' the lieutenant answered . I will carry out your instructions carefully . ' He grinned . No , we have n't seen anything of the mysterious gunman . I 'm beginning to think there is something imaginary about him , myself . Hoped not , to begin with . ' Captain Mansfield said : I do n't doubt it . You know , Dr. Plechs , this young man is our crack shot ; that 's why I put him in command of the ship 's police and the emergency squad . How is your shooting , Lane ? ' he asked affectionately . Up to scratch ? ' Four-thirty out of five hundred this morning , sir , ' grinned Lane , patting the revolver beneath the edge of his sack coat . I can stop them if they 're around to be stopped . ' Captain Mansfield made a wry face , not so much over the bloodthirsty words as over the idea of weapons being discharged on board his boat . Do n't be too anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't want any unnecessary violence , if it does come to an arrest . And certainly no firing . But I guess we need n't worry about that . The stewards have made a quiet search of the ship and I do n't think you will ever find this strange gunman . What is important now is to watch de Brasto diligently . It 's lucky we have the excuse for you to be with him . Keep your eye peeled and he may slip up on something . ' Right , sir , I 'll tend to it , ' promised Lane , saluting . With no less formality , Dr. Plechs extended his hand . ' Goodbye , Captain , ' he said , I shall work up my results into a more complete form for you this afternoon . I shall have them ready for any new event . ' That 's fine . Thank you again . ' Captain Mansfield opened his  | office door and passed within to his interrupted duties . The night had come bringing with it a silvered sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meganaut . The ship slipped rapidly and silently through the smooth water . In the many passageways where , side by side , the cabins aligned themselves geometrically down the body of the boat , the lights burned dimly ; here and there a steward trod their lengths quietly , bearing on his tray a belated nightcap to one of his charges . Mostly they were empty ; into the deserted distance stretched the rows of paired shoes outside the doors , mutely awaiting the attention of the Boots ' , and no figure stirred . The first hour 's sleep enfolded the great vessel . Only in the Ritz restaurant at the forward end of the sun deck was activity still in full swing . In fact , it had just opened , after the interval of recuperation following the exit of the last diners who had departed about ten o'clock , replete and content . Light streamed from the windows into the night outside ; within was the babble of high-pitched laughter and repartee , the cheerful popping of corks , and ( literally the first time to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side of the Atlantic . To the two men who paced slowly around the sun deck through the mild evening the melodies came in snatches as brief and infrequent as their own remarks . De Brasto and Lieutenant Lane had almost reached the end of their conversational tether . And Lane was tired . I wish to God he 'd go to bed , he thought , if all he wants to do is to walk around and around . But de Brasto had no idea of bed ; he was suffering the reaction from the morning 's grilling and never had he felt more wide awake . Suddenly Lane pulled out his watch . My word , ' he exclaimed ,  | I must report up forward . I 'm five minutes late now . Will you excuse me a few moments ? I 'll be right back , say in ten minutes . Meet you here , where we are now , just outside the Ritz door . ' Scarcely waiting for his companion 's reply , he turned through the entrance and ran down the interior staircase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protruded the fraction of an inch around the housing of the outside steps from the deck below . For the third time since leaving the captain in the morning his efforts obtained for him nothing but disappointment . No more than twenty feet down the deck de Brasto was leaning negligently against the rail , lighting a cigarette . The minute flare of the match lit up his face as plainly as a thousand watt spot light . The lieutenant waited , stooping and bringing his face nearer to the surface of the deck to guard against any unexpected glance of de Brasto 's in his direction , as he peered around the corner from his place of concealment . After what seemed an interminable period , the latter threw his cigarette in a wide arc toward the dark waters below and started slowly down the deck , walking aft . Lane straightened up , hazarded a further extrusion of his head , and prepared to follow as soon as his quarry was far enough ahead . He reflected that he could always say he had just come back and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least fifteen modern and powerful lights borne aloft on standards resembling those to be seen on the best avenues of any large city . But at this time of night most of them had been extinguished ; on Lane 's side of the deck only two were functioning , one half-way down and the other at the farthest limit aft . As de Brasto passed under the first of these , the lieutenant saw a slight glow from the distant reaches of the deck ; it looked as if someone had pressed the button on a flash-light whose batteries had been almost worn out . ' Aiysh-ARRSH ! ' De Brasto 's bubbling shriek rose in a wail ,  | cut off as if by an axe . He pitched forward . It happened as quickly as that . As Lane leaped out from the doorway , the moonlight flashed and glinted on the upward swing of his nickelled revolver . C-rack ! . . . Crack-crack ! ! He sprang down the open deck , every consideration of safety momentarily wiped out in his blinding , furious rage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot down before his eyes . By God ! As he cleared de Brasto 's prone body in a great bound , he saw something move in the shadows further down the deck . Increasing his mad dash , he brought up his gun and shot from the hip . Crack ! There had been no answering glow from his opponent 's weapon as he hurtled along the deck . Now he dropped his own gun clattering on the planking behind him and sprang upon the deeper shadow prone in the shadows next a ventilator . By pure chance his gripping fingers found a throat . Before the slide engendered by his headlong rush had stopped , bracing himself on one elbow he had raised the head a foot from the ' deck and brought it down again with a shivering bump . Lane scrambled to his feet . He looked searchingly for his enemy 's hands , his foot drawn back to kick the weapon out of them . But his precaution was needless . The man was dead ; a thick smear of red described their slide along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mufti was splotched with scarlet where the other 's body had pressed against him . At the forward end a commotion arose . Twenty people were vainly endeavouring to push through the doorway which , at most , could accommodate three at a time . The lights from inside streamed down on the shoulders of women and the white faces of the men . Dr. Schall with the two men he had been sitting with , came out into the open space before the crowded doorway . Take him , ' yelled Lane , pointing to where de Brasto still  | lay , under the centre light . Schall bent down over the recumbent figure . Two sailors ran up the aft companionway behind Lane and approached him hurriedly . One of them , seeing the crimson stains , caught hold of him with apprehension . Not hurt at all . His blood , ' gasped the lieutenant , yet somewhat dazed by the rapid succession of events . See to that man ; dead I think , but better make sure . ' The two sailors leaned threateningly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with the crew . Dead as a smelt , sorr , ' said one , a huge Irishman . And ripped up pretty , too . Did you get him , sorr , might I ask , sorr ? ' Yes  --  yes , I did , I guess . ' Lane leaned up against the ventilator , drawing long breaths of air , for his final exertion had taken every ounce of strength he had . Stand guard here , ' he directed a few moments later , and started up the deck toward the small crowd that had now gathered around de Brasto . As he approached , Captain Mansfield ran up the forward companionway , still buttoning the coat of his uniform . What is this disturbance ? ' cried the captain , hastily dropping his revolver into his pocket and keeping his hand there for a moment to mislead any chance glances that might have noticed the action . Lane pushed his way through one side of the circle just as Captain Mansfield emerged from the other . It is my fault , sir , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a few minutes , to follow our plan . He was shot while I was watching . How is he , Schall ? ' he asked , looking down . One look was enough ; he knew that de Brasto was dead before Dr. Schall stood up and said quietly , I 'm afraid there is nothing I can do . He was shot through the heart . And if I 'm not mistaken his wound is exactly the same as that inflicted upon Mr. Smith . The penetration is too large for one bullet ; we shall find two I think , although there is only one wound . '  | Where is the man who fired these shots ? ' demanded the captain , his voice trembling with anger . Have you arrested him , Lieutenant ? ' I got him , ' said Lane simply . He 's dead . Further down the deck . I have two sailors on guard . O'Flaherty 's one of them . ' The captain stood on tiptoe and looked over the heads of the throng . He espied his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some disarray . Mann , ' he bellowed , call out the emergency squad . Instruct them I want this deck cleared immediately . And notify Dr. Pell . Tell him to come here at once ; he 'll want two stretchers . Come , Lieutenant , let us see what 's at the other end of the deck . Tell me what happened . ' Lieutenant Lane told his superior in a few terse words the events of the last fifteen minutes . So de Brasto was innocent ; his story was only too true , ' he finished , his voice still tinged with bitterness . They approached the pair of sailors , standing above the sprawled-out object beside the ventilator . The body was huddled stiffly , and a strange dead smile lifted the lips , showing a gold tooth . The features had a grim humour as if they had witnessed a last desperate joke . The strong jaws and the slightly bulging eyes were more prominent than in life . One of the sailors stepped forward , saluting . Here , sir , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there . ' Lane took the outstretched weapon and examined it curiously . I guess that 's the answer , sir , ' he commented , handing it over to Captain Mansfield . The captain took it and held it up to the light . He saw a large , strange pistol , equipped with a long silencer . But the remarkable part about it was that it was double-barrelled , not in the usual way of a shot-gun , but with the barrels one above the other , separated only by a thin partition of steel . It could fire but two bullets without reloading ; and both of them must be fired at once . A light of comprehension broke over Captain Mansfield 's expression , as he felt for an empty pocket and slowly dropped the captured weapon into it .  | PART FOUR DR . L. REES PONS : DOMINANCE DR . HAYVIER 'S prophecy was on the verge of fulfilment . Although it was the breakfast rather than the dinner hour , Dr. Pons was turning his steps toward the boat deck forward , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal with Captain Mansfield in the latter 's tiny but luxurious dining saloon . Overhead the clouds were sullen and unbroken ; the sea , a slate-grey with here and there a few touches of white on the crests of the mounting rollers , stretched in all directions to a drab , colourless horizon . A rising wind , cool and bleak even if not bitterly cold , whistled past Pons 's ears as he progressed with the landsman 's uncertainty along the damp deck whose movements were becoming more and more unexpected . It must be admitted that the doctor 's large and pleasant countenance did not exhibit its usual colour of complete health ; in fact , it looked just a little pasty . However , he reached the captain 's room without mishap . Entering , he found the table laid for two , and Mansfield standing beside it with Lieutenant Lane . He had evidently interrupted them in an earnest conversation . Good morning , Dr. Pons , ' said the captain , approaching to shake hands with his guest . Breakfast is about to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about de Brasto 's  | murderer . He 's been up all night , keeping in touch with New York by radio . Go on , Lane . Dr. Pons will excuse us . ' Is it right for me to hear it ? ' asked Pons , politely suggesting his own exclusion , although the keenness of his curiosity for the moment banished his growing physical qualms . Certainly , certainly ; I 'd like you to know . You were saying , Lane  --  about the last report ? ' It told us no more than the others , sir . The gang de Brasto went in fear of was the Videtti gang  --  well enough known , it seems , in Chicago . De Brasto and Stander were shady lawyers , and got several of these gangsters off  --  probably saved more than one from the chair . The gang turned against them after their defence of a man called Derringham . His name was the only new thing we learnt from the last radio . And Stander had told us that . ' So de Brasto 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely did take a bribe from another gang to let this Derringham down . It 's not likely that his clients would have turned murderous against him for an honest failure to get their man off . About that the police tell us nothing , and probably do n't know much , either . They may be able to tell us something later about the man that I shot . But there 's no reason to doubt that he was one of these Videtti gangsters . ' Has Stander been troublesome ? ' asked the captain , frowning . Lieutenant Lane gave a wry grin : Very , sir . Threatened and talked big , about criminal neglect of his partner 's safety , and so on . I finally shut him up . He 's a coward , anyway , and will do nothing . You can be sure enough , sir , that neither of those men was entitled to much police protection . ' Then the whole de Brasto business is over , ' put in Dr. Pons , and has nothing to do with the crime you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , sir , ' said Lane . Yes , ' said the captain . That 's that . '  | The Lieutenant shortly departed , as Mann entered balancing himself and two breakfast trays upon a floor that was beginning to heave and sink surprisingly . Still , Pons 's sensations , as he seated himself at the table , were a little less disturbing than they had been on the deck without . Even so , he did not find himself able to regard the captain 's very excellent fare with marked favour . The culinary display seemed slightly too lavish . No , thank you , ' he earnestly assured the captain for the second time . Only coffee and a little toast . I eat very little for breakfast . ' Captain Mansfield had taken his role as host the more seriously since it was in sober truth the first time he had ever played it thus with one of his passengers . A full selection from the extensive breakfast menu of the ship had been ordered brought up in portable heaters by Mann , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance . Captain Mansfield , at any rate , was enjoying his own munificence . Now , having dispatched both his grapefruit and a generous helping of oatmeal and cream , there lay spread before him a large slice of appetizing ham upon which two fried eggs reposed side by side , an assortment of hot muffins , a dish of marmalade and , of course , a cup of coffee . Already there rose before his mind the prospect of a few buckwheat cakes , with perhaps a grilled frankfurter , to follow . From the midst of such delicious thoughts he once more urged the doctor to have anything he wanted . No , really , ' Dr. Pons reiterated . I never eat anything at all for breakfast . Have n't for years . ' He became unusually silent . Just as you say , ' responded his host , munching contentedly . As for me , I ca n't understand that system at all . I 've always eaten a good breakfast ever since I was a lad . I can go without it , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really up to scratch . Well , have another cup of coffee , anyhow . ' Thank you , I will , ' said Pons , deciding that this , at least ,  | was within the bounds of possibility . An extraordinarily long dip , as the bow of the Meganaut fell forward , made him regret his acquiescence a moment afterward ; but it was too late , already Mann was replenishing the cup . The one-sided meal went on ... . At last  --  Pons felt certain that the time must now be well on toward noon  --  Captain Mansfield wiped his mouth , drank off his tumblerful of water , and leaned back in his chair . About to address himself to the real purpose of his invitation , he noticed his guest 's pale features for the first time . My dear Dr. Pons , ' he cried contritely . You 're not feeling well . Good gracious , you must forgive me . All this food . I had no idea . It is blowing up a bit , but of course I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't worry , Captain , I shall be all right . This is my first experience of rough weather , you know , I ca n't claim to feel fit as a fiddle . I 've an idea you wanted to see me about something , ' he went on , directly ; I 'm all right for that , so let 's go ahead . ' You 're correct , of course , ' Mansfield admitted . I did want to talk seriously with you and obtain your opinion . But perhaps it would be better if you lay down for a while in your cabin . The barometer has fallen sharply . ' Not at all , ' Dr. Pons insisted . The best thing in the world for me will be to give my attention to something besides the weather . I know what I 'm talking about . Once I had to have six or eight teeth removed , and I made some interesting experiments in the dentist 's chair ; with the same apparatus on me that I used on Stymond , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really have developed a slight control over antagonistic stimuli . I 'm quite sure there is no reason why we should not proceed , if you are willing to . ' The captain looked doubtful , but the last thing he wanted to do was to waste time . Very well ; if you will promise to let me  | know the moment you do n't feel like going on with it , ' he provided . Pons nodded , and Captain Mansfield began , I find myself in a damned awkward position . I am not a criminal investigator and I do n't know the first thing about it . I have a pair of detectives who are supposed to take care of such matters ; hitherto they have always been able to do so satisfactorily , but it is plain as day to me that the present situation is too much for them . All that will not excuse me , either in my own eyes or in those of the Line . This murder , ' said the captain bitterly , must be solved . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not too proud , I hope , to accept it , if I can find it . ' And , ' Pons put in , you have n't found it . You have already had the assistance of a pair of eminent psychologists , and found them eager and willing but no more satisfactory than your detectives . I should think you would be about through with that brand of help . ' For heaven 's sake , ' Mansfield said hastily . Do n't go away with the idea that I do n't appreciate what these gentlemen have been kind enough to do for me . I am very grateful . Nevertheless , they have failed to solve this crime . You yourself have cleared the most likely suspect we had , and poor de Brasto , I am very much afraid , has paid with his life for the suspicions I harboured against him . Dr. Plechs 's idea was so plausible that I found myself convinced for a time . Too much so , I guess . Never before have I made such a mistake in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't feel that way about it , if I were you . It was n't your fault , nor Dr. Plechs 's either , for that matter . The notion of leaving him alone occasionally came from one of the detectives . But I ca n't see that anyone is really to blame . That gunman would have got a shot at him sooner or later in any event . And the mystery of those three bullets is explained , at any rate . ' Yes , ' the captain agreed ; he was too practical a man to spend  | overlong in vain regrets . That matter seems to be entirely cleared up now . But we are still left with the original problem . Who killed Smith and how are we to bring him to book ? I wo n't feel safe until we have that fellow under lock and key . I do n't want anything else to happen , that 's certain . ' Well , naturally , I see how you feel . I 'll be glad to do anything I can . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unaccustomedly vague . Why , really what I wanted to see you for , was to ask your advice . Without any reflections on the others , you strike me as a very competent man . You have already assisted your friends excellently in their own attempts ; and you must have been thinking about the case yourself , and I thought you might be willing to give me your impressions . We might talk over the situation . . . . But perhaps , ' he said suddenly , you yourself supported one of the previous theories . ' No , ' said Pons , I did n't . I do n't like to criticize these men , both of whom I regard very highly . I hope you 'll consider this confidential , but in my opinion their theories were examples of their particular weakness . Hayvier is really a very pragmatic fellow ; his idea was too simple and obvious to suit me . The conditioned or unconditioned reflex on which he founds himself is no more than a verbal abstraction ; in nature it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theorist , and that 's why his theories are weak . Now Plechs , on the other hand , is strong on theory . His theories are involved and complicated , and also logical , provided you admit the premises . He suspected de Brasto , not for obvious but for subtle reasons . I thought in the first place that Plechs 's idea was too cleverly subtle , just as Hayvier 's was too simple . It is astonishing that the contributions of these two men , which no one can overlook , have been just the opposite of their own characters . Hayvier , the pragmatist , has done an inestimable service in clearing out a whole swamp of subjectivity  | and prejudice from psychological theory and method ; and Plechs , the theorist , still indulges , it seems to me , in much muddled thinking , but has given practical help of untold value to hundreds of patients . It is strange ... . As you put it , ' Captain Mansfield said , lighting another cigarette , it is very strange indeed . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the immediate problem ? ' I wo n't say I 'm not interested in this rather complicated world of your science , ' admitted the captain , but of course the other matter is pressing . I should like to hear who you think might have committed the crime . ' Dr. Pons smiled . That 's just the trouble , you see . I have n't any suspect in mind that I can introduce on the spot . Human responses are very complex things ; but the ultimate criterion for understanding human behaviour is that it is integrated behaviour . When we come to a particular problem in this behaviour , a problem of a practical nature , there is one element that is overwhelmingly important , that , properly grasped , will give the clue . That element is motive . But I must explain to you what I mean by motive , if you care to have me go on . Perhaps you will feel that this is n't getting us anywhere ? ' On the contrary , Doctor . Go ahead , please . ' As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining saloon , which in the past fifteen minutes had become more and more unsteady , described a definite arc to starboard and downward . The doctor gulped , and grasped hastily for a glass of water . Captain Mansfield smiled involuntarily . Do n't try to balance , ' he advised his guest . Go with the motion , do n't oppose it and you will feel much better . Shall I have the steward bring you a bromo ? Might settle your stomach a bit . ' I think so . Yes , ' Pons accepted , still somewhat green . Mann , who had previously cleared off the table , much to the psychologist 's  | relief , brought the order at once . Pons drank off the sharp , effervescing tumblerful and wiped the resulting tears out of his eyes . Let 's see , where were we ? ' he continued . Oh , yes ; motive . I never use the word , purpose , another subjective term that I hope we shall soon be rid of . Motive is very little like purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in police courts and detective stories under the name . It is not just " here 's a necklace , let 's steal it " or the more vague , general situation of the criminally disposed in the face of a criminal opportunity . I believe human beings to be motivated by three fundamental " drives " ; the appetitive , self-seeking drive which is based upon the hunger mechanisms of the body and develops from their operations , the love drive , originally based upon the genital system , and what I have called the procreative drive , arising in the first instance from the reproductive functions . All these constitute spontaneous drives of the organism toward specific types of behaviour , and each of them may be opposed or assisted by the external forces of the environment . ' But surely , ' put in the captain , these three drives will not account for all kinds of behaviour . ' Yes , I think so , ' Pons responded . You see , the connectionmaking functions of the correlation centres in the cerebrum allow these fundamental motivations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things , even to mental abstractions , so that the drive that in the first place served to relieve hunger-pangs can become directed later to the acquisition of preferment , or honours , or yachts , or almost anything under the sun . And here we have to take account of environmental influences , which act upon the individual in various ways . A human being is the centre of strong forces which he generates within himself . But of course the forces outside him are not negligible , and actual behaviour is the resultant of the balance of those two  | kinds of influence . Since we have two sets of forces , there result only four type possibilities in their integration . The outside forces may oppose the interior ones and be either weaker or stronger ; or they may be in alliance with the organism and again either weaker or stronger . I have given to these four types of situation the names of Dominance , Compliance , Inducement , and Submission . Such responses may be either active or passive and there may be many gradations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to take your time to go into this too fully . I shall have to say a little about emotions , though . This is not so surprising when one reflects that emotional consciousness is motor consciousness , as I believe . ' Captain Mansfield interrupted again . Now there , ' he said , you seem to me to base your conclusions as much upon the physical as Dr. Hayvier does ; but you apparently do not agree with him about consciousness . Is not " consciousness " one of your literary terms ? ' Not with me , ' answered Dr. Pons , and would have smiled , had not environmental forces too strongly opposed this spontaneous response . In my view , Captain , consciousness is a physical force generated within the body upon the " psychons " that are parts of the synapses in the central nervous system . Now we are confronted ? By the way , Captain , what is that terrific booming I hear ? ' The doctor braced himself uneasily in his chair as he listened , then remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Meganaut heaved forward . Oh , that . That 's only the fog-horn . ' Are we in a fog ? Perhaps you should leave ? ' Of all the perils of the sea Dr. Pons was least enthusiastic about fog . No , I guess not , ' Mansfield smiled with reassurance . It wo n't be fog , anyhow . Just a squall , I imagine . Whenever the visibility drops to a few hundred yards , we blow ; it 's a rule . As soon as the squall goes over , it will stop . ' And indeed the hoarse sound ,  | tearing over their heads , had now suspended . Go ahead , Doctor , I am very much interested in your theories . Now just how are we to apply them to this crime ? ' From the depths of his chair , Pons resumed . Well , the principles I should apply are these . The strongest of all human motives is love and it is usually to be found somewhere in any drastic behaviour . As it is typically called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictum , " cherchez la femme " , is frequently a sound one . I see you are surprised when I allude to love in connection with a murder , but I mean love in the abnormal relationship in which it is controlled or used by dominance . Of course , some crimes express almost pure dominance emotion unmixed with anything else , but they are usually of a direct , simple kind , the slayings of rival gangsters , for example . De Brasto 's murder , for instance , I should be inclined to believe was an expression of dominance . Although even there we have some love elements coming in , if we believe that he was killed to avenge the member of some mob whom the others supposed he had betrayed . As regards the Smith murder , however , there was nothing straightforward about it at all . It was n't a shooting , but a poisoning ; and the appetitive type of person motivated by dominance alone , hardly ever uses poison . Moreover , if anything is plain about it , it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime is a subtle one , carefully planned and carried out with attention to detail . The criminal is an intelligent person and I should say that the motivation is correspondingly complicated . I should guess that the crime was committed by a duplex type of personality , one in whom the appetitive and love responses are usually kept separate but in whom the abnormal control of the love element by the dominant interest might occur . I should look for such a person . ' But this is so general , ' the captain objected , it might be almost anyone , so far as we know . It might be either a man  | or a woman . ' Yes , it might . And then ? By George , I have an idea ! ' Pons cried , with a semblance of animation . I knew there was something , a sort of hint , floating around in my mind . Wait now , let me see . . . . Yes , that 's worth thinking about . ' In his excitement , Pons got up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny room . I ? , ugh , ahr , arh ? ' said Pons . Here , Mann ! ' the captain called loudly , with sudden energy . The steward 's surprised face appeared at the doorway . Here , take Dr. Pons ? ' He got no farther . The steward 's first glance told him all . As Pons buried his face in his enormous handkerchief , Mann took him by the arm and propelled the heaving bulk of the psychologist rapidly through the door to the captain 's cabin ... . It was ten full minutes before Dr. Pons reappeared . When he did , he still looked pale but it was evident that he felt somewhat better . I 'm very sorry , Captain . Not a nice way to reward your hospitality . I 'm afraid I over-rated my endurance . Yes , thanks , I do feel much better now . But I 'm still a little weak , and I think I 'll go down and lie on my berth for a while . ' Best thing you can do , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have insisted earlier . But just before the  --  er  --  catastrophe you said something about a hint ; you seemed to have an idea . Can you tell me what it was before you go ? ' I can , but I do n't think I will , if you do n't mind . If you can let me work it out alone for an hour or so , I 'll step in about four , say ? ' Better make it five , if you can , ' the captain answered . I can give you more time . Naturally I 'm curious . ' Five will be better for me , too . ' A recollection came abruptly to Pons . My God , ' he groaned , I 've an engagement at twothirty myself . I wonder if I can keep it . It is with a most attractive  | lady . ' Oh , you 'll be all right long before then . There should be good weather just ahead of us now . Meanwhile ? ' Meanwhile , will you get some information for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where Mr. Smith 's daughter was born , who his wife was or is , and anything else that can be found out about his family . You have none of this already , have you ? ' No , I 'm afraid not . But I 'll try to get it for you right away . Funny , now that you mention it , there was n't anything at all about his family in the resume that was sent when I made my first request . Just his business career ; I suppose that was the important thing about him , after all . ' The other may be more important for us , though , ' answered the doctor . I 'll go along , then . Be sure to ask especially about his daughter , will you ? ' Surely you do n't suspect his daughter ? ' No , I do n't suspect his daughter , ' said Pons , and nodded his adieux . As Dr. Pons walked through the lounge , his step was firm and his eye clear . His complexion , furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to the Meganaut 's captain . Secluded within his cabin , he had worked out a theory of the crime that had astonished even himself ; at the end of his three hours ' cogitation he had felt so gratified at his success that he had ventured to partake of a little nourishment . This had further aided his recovery until , when he emerged promptly at two-fifteen , he looked much as usual . There had followed his participation in the ship 's ping-pong tournament with a certain , very attractive Madame Sudeau , a tournament which , chiefly through her efforts and much to his surprise , they had actually won . As Dr. Pons , on his way to revisit the captain , pressed the  | signal button beside the elevators outside the lounge , he felt again the little thrill that he always experienced when , his theory painstakingly and elaborately constructed , he took his first glance at the experimental results that would either confirm or destroy it . At his entrance Captain Mansfield looked over his shoulder and thrust the report he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , Dr. Pons , ' he invited heartily . You look fully recovered , eh ? Did you have to stay in your bunk long ? ' Only a couple of hours , ' Pons assured him . I 've been up and about all the afternoon . I even found it possible to win a ping-pong tournament . ' And have you thought over that clue that occurred to you this morning , Doctor ? Have you come to a conclusion ? ' Oh , yes , ' Pons answered . I 've been thinking about that . I have a theory of the crime entirely worked out . But before I go into that , I would like to hear what has been found out over the radio . ' The captain reached into one of his desk drawers and pulled out a large radio sheet . Yes , ' he said , quizzically , and that 's one reason I 'm so glad to see you strong and healthy again . You are in for a shock , I 'm afraid . If you have built up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may as well throw it out now . It seems ? ' Pons interrupted quickly , almost with relief , it seemed . He never had a daughter , then ? Is that what you found ? ' Well , I 'm damned ! ' Mansfield 's eyes opened widely in surprise . How in the name of heaven did you ever guess that ? ' Part of my theory , ' grinned Pons . Not only that , ' the captain continued , but he has n't any family at all . He has been in the limelight for a good many years , too ; I doubt whether it would have been possible to conceal any relatives of his , if he had had them . '  | Oh , I do n't think we need contemplate an unknown relative with a grudge , ' Pons added . I was n't thinking of that . But I 'm glad to hear my guess about the girl was right ; otherwise my carefully built hypothesis would have gone smash . ' I am more anxious than ever to hear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wait a moment , will you have a cigarette ? . . . All right , go ahead then , if you will . ' Dr. Pons nodded , lighting a cigarette of his own , and commenced his exposition forthwith . Nothing but pure chance put me on to it in the first place , ' he admitted . A conversation I had with young Gnosens the other morning at breakfast . Simply by the way we happened to mention " Miss Smith " , although it was natural enough , since he had been rather madly in love with her ; got over it now , it appears . That started me thinking about the young woman , more or less casually , and the more I thought , the more curious I began to feel . She was such an entirely different type from her " father " , one of the purest blonde types I have ever seen . Then there was something else about the girl that no one could possibly miss . I only saw her twice , I believe ; once was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply breath-taking . I 'm not sure that she is n't the most beautiful woman I have ever looked at . ' I did n't see her , ' remarked Captain Mansfield gravely . I appear to have missed an opportunity . ' You did , ' Pons assured him . And I must tell you this , ' he went on with the utmost seriousness , the beauty of women is the strongest stimulating force in the whole world . Why , if I could direct the influence exercised by the world 's beautiful women for just one year , I could change the direction and the future history of the entire human race ; I could re-make the social life of the planet . Some day perhaps we can educate them to use their power for themselves intelligently . . . . But I am getting off on a subject that I must admit fascinates  | me . In this present case we find a woman who represents in herself the most powerful forces conceivable for influencing her fellow creatures , both men and women , for women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , worship the outstanding beauty of other women just as men do . Here are two points , then . First " Miss Smith " is very beautiful , and thus very powerful ; and second , she is not " Miss Smith " at all . And I may add a third point . Although I saw her only twice , and each time for a very short period , I have no question in my mind but that she is a natural captivatress of men ; she practised all the little tricks of beautiful women , not artificially but naturally , as is entirely normal ; all the little , intriguing , captivating mannerisms that are so irresistible in inducing the submission of men to the love-spell . If you will add up these three points , Captain , you will get the answer at once as to who this young lady was . She was not Mr. Smith 's daughter ; she was his mistress . I hope you will not be shocked at the presence of such an affair on your boat , for I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind among your passengers . ' No , ' said the captain , with a thoroughly worldly smile , no , I am not even greatly surprised . Of course we can not countenance such proceedings if we know about them , but they happen , ah , in spite of our best efforts , frequently . And at the eastern end of our run , my dear Doctor , they do not cause anything like the excitement that appears to be felt over them in your own country . However , while I am no great moralist myself , I must say that I do not approve of the practice . ' Nor do I , ' Pons replied . But my objections certainly have nothing at all to do with morals , by which I suppose you mean Christian morals . In my view Christianity will have some day to answer the very serious charge of destroying and polluting true love-relationships by its self-assumed and moralistic restrictions . My own objection to mistresses is not that they are unconsecrated  | but that they are impermanent . A real love-relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and properly , whereas these affairs usually last a few months , or at most a few years . And in by far the greatest number of instances , as in the one we are discussing , they are motivated entirely wrongly . But let me get back to my theory . This beautiful and captivating woman ? . By the way , Captain , did you find out what her real name is , as a result of your inquiries ? ' Yes , it was in the reply . Let 's see now , it was a peculiar name ; quite gone out of my mind . ' The captain rummaged about on the top of his desk for the radio sheet . Yes , here it is . Coralie R-e-a-k-e hyphen L-y-o-n-s , ' he spelled out . One of those hyphenated names . Probably assumed . These women seldom go by their real names , anyway . ' Yes . Well , we ca n't tell about that , of course , ' the doctor considered . Coralie Reake-Lyons . Reake-Lyons . I do n't find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back again ... . We have this beautiful captivatress and her lover , a man old enough to pass himself off as her father . Her captivation is perfectly normal , as I said , but the fact that she was his temporary mistress is not normal at all . No matter how expensively you dress it up , it is an abnormal reversal of the harmonious emotional sequence , Inducement-Submission . The prostitute completely reverses the organically efficient combination ; first she submits to the man , and subsequently she induces payment from him . Frequently , and especially often in these affairs with wealthy men , she does not even use Inducement , but extorts payment from her victim by dominating him with the threat of blackmail . The Submission is made in this case only for the purpose of and with a view toward the subsequent Dominance . You remember that I mentioned previously , and upon quite different grounds , that we should look about for a duplex type  | of personality in our search for the criminal . Most duplex types are quite normal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the appetitive varieties , are excellently organized but kept pretty well separated from each other in the behaviour pattern . But it can come about that the well-organized appetitive responses control the equally well-organized love responses . And that is the situation that I think we have to deal with at present . The young woman was certainly very successful in captivation , but she had equally strong appetitive interests . I think if we had known her , we should have found her extremely selfish and obstinate . Now what happened ? She had no difficulty in captivating Smith , who was himself a strong appetitive personality . But where she ran up against an insurmountable obstacle , was in trying to exact payment from him . In moments of Submission he would probably have given her anything . But there is a selfregulating safety device in the love responses . It has been decided by nature that the love responses can not really be misused : they can only be distorted , with the resulting disease of the distorter . At any rate , Coralie Reake-Lyons made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . Naturally she was defeated , and doubtless she was defeated many times . Finally , with her own Dominance responses worked up and called out to their full extent by Smith 's probably brutal opposition , she yielded to their flouted clamour for expression and came under their complete control . Realizing in despair that she could never gain her original ends , for a man like Smith would laugh even at blackmail , she experienced a moment of full abnormality and decided to dominate him completely . The final domination , of course , is the death of one 's opponent . Actually she selected a poison and administered it to her lover in the smoking-room that night . That , Captain , is what I think occurred . '  | Dr. Pons paused , and sat back in his chair after his long speech . Again he mopped his brow . For some time Captain Mansfield sat in silence also , while his forgotten cigarette added to the scars already burned into his desk . Then he broke out with : My word , you psychologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now here 's the third suspect offered me , and once more I find myself convinced that this is the criminal . But wait ! Now I think I have you , at any rate . The girl herself was poisoned , Doctor . How do you get around that ? You wo n't ask me to believe that her Dominance went to such lengths that she even poisoned herself , I suppose ? ' Dr. Pons was smiling . And what makes you think that she was poisoned , Captain ? ' he asked quietly . What makes me think ? . Why , er , Pell said so , of course ! ' Did he ? ' asked Pons again . Now I did n't get that idea , myself . I thought he said that he had n't been able to tell what was the matter with her , and that he merely presumed she had been the victim of the same weapon as her " father " . What do you think yourself ? ' Why , well , why , yes , perhaps that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe that she could have feigned unconsciousness in such a way as to deceive an experienced physician like Pell : No more do I , ' said the psychologist at once . This girl was much too clever to try anything like that . No , I think she actually drugged herself with some harmless mixture that for a time would give her the appearance of having died . I do n't know enough about drugs even to guess at the nature of the self-administered one , although I suppose it might have been some hemp or hasheesh derivative . Those drugs can cause suspended animation closely resembling death , I 've been told . Undoubtedly she intended to revive later and , since it would  | seem that she had been poisoned also , she would avoid any suspicion being thrown upon her . ' And then , Doctor ? Why should her body have been stolen and disposed of ? ' Pons smiled again . But you see I do n't think it was . Who would have taken such risks as that ? So far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except de Brasto . And we know he did n't do it , now . ' You think she escaped herself ? ' I do . I think she climbed out the window . She might have been fully conscious for a half-day or even a whole day before she made the attempt . ' But Doctor , ' cried Mansfield , just think . You ca n't mean to tell me that a young girl , certainly accustomed to every luxury , could lie quietly in that little room in the hospital with a  --  with a corpse ? For a whole day , or half a day , either ? ' Human beings have been known to do far worse things than that , Captain , ' stated Pons calmly . But then what made her leave the hospital at all ? Why did n't she just wait and appear to come to , as you first sug-gested ? ' Ah , that I 'm afraid I ca n't answer . ' The psychologist 's face now reflected something of the captain 's puzzlement . And where is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard this boat , in hiding somewhere below , ' answered Dr. Pons . She is ? ' the captain cried , the full and exasperating significance of this repeated flouting of his authority dawning upon him for the first time . Now , by damn , this is too much ! I do n't know whether you 're right or wrong , but if that woman is hiding anywhere on board my ship , she shall be found at once . ' And just how will we do that ? ' Pons inquired . This ship is so big I can hardly find my way around it yet . The problem of getting enough to eat to live on , should not be hard for a  | clever person ; trays left in the passages , that sort of thing . ' We will find her , if she is there to be found . ' My dear Captain , I make no reflections against the boat , but I remember that there was a careful search made , lasting over a day or two at least , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in keeping out of sight . No , I 'm afraid the chances of finding her are pretty small . ' You may think so but I do n't , ' answered Captain Mansfield . When it came to doing something definite , he was not a doubter . I 'll go through this ship with a fine tooth-comb , sir ! Do n't you believe for a moment that , when I decide on it , there is anything aboard the Meganaut that I ca n't find out or deal with . ' The growing darkness in the office had finally caused Dr. Pons to pull out his watch during the captain 's last determined statements . We 've been talking longer than I had any idea of , ' he said apologetically . It 's nearly seven o'clock . I really had no intention of taking up so much of your time . ' Do n't worry about the time , ' growled Mansfield . If you 're right , it 's been worth it . ' And I hope , ' added Pons , that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been saying , I would n't give much for my own chances . I have n't the slightest doubt that she 'd seduce me first and murder me afterwards . ' She would , eh ? ' said Captain Mansfield , by no means ready to take the matter lightly . As Pons went out the door he shook an admonitory finger after the psychologist . If she 's on board , I 'll have her , ' he repeated . In spite of the sensation caused in New York , and even upon the Bourses of the Continent , by the sudden death of Victor Timothy Smith , the routine of the Meganaut 's voyage went  | forward much as usual for the large majority of her passengers . With the shooting of de Brasto and his assailant the excitement and the talking had flared up once more . But here the affair had been witnessed by a much smaller number . The general impression was that some desperado had been carelessly allowed to include himself in the ship 's company , had shot and killed three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had at last been slain in turn by the constituted authorities . As 99 per cent . of the travellers resided in America , and most of these either in New York , Chicago or Philadelphia , only the setting on a trans-Atlantic liner in mid-ocean made such events unusual . The little wave of interest raised by the sinister doings at their doorsteps flattened out rapidly into the unruffled surface of forgetfulness . To say truly , his charges were much less disturbed than Captain Mansfield feared . In spite of all that could be done by Chief Electrician Holt and his staff , the injured dynamos continued to give trouble and to force a reduced speed upon the ship . If this caused some minor changes in the future reservations of the passengers at their favourite hotels , it provided no further inconvenience , for there was so much entertainment to be found aboard the Meganaut that a few extra days in her luxurious quarters worked no hardship . Now , as the lights gleamed brightly on the evening throngs along the decks , in the lounge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the saxophones moaned , and the drinks were brought and the passengers danced and talked and flirted and played , the ship was the picture of careless and carefree enjoyment . It was just at this untroubled moment that a dozen of the higher officers , with very serious faces indeed , walked out of Captain Mansfield 's quarters , saluted him smartly , and watched him pass quickly to the bridge . Brroom ! ? Brrroom ! ? Brroo-doom !  | As the officers turned and scattered , running , the patter of their feet along the boat deck was echoed janglingly by the clangour of the big alarm gongs resounding simultaneously from all parts of the ship . The engines were slowing . Slowing . They stopped , and the Meganaut drifted forward over the waves . Brroom ! ? Brrroom ! ? Brroo-000m ! Again the deep-throated whistle , backed by all the steam in the boilers far below , hurled its thunderous note of alarm across the calm and quiet night . The deep roar penetrated resonantly to the farthest passageways of the ship , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ten miles away , over the silence of the sea , it could still be heard . And it was heard . Where the lights of a westward liner twinkled in the distance , a lookout called sharply to another bridge-officer , and the latter spoke hurriedly through a tube to his radio man . Crackle , crack , crack ; crackle , crackle , crack , crack , crackle , crack . The radio man was busy with his key . Below decks on the Meganaut consternation reigned . In the ballroom the music stopped , as if the score had been abruptly cloven by a giant sword . One of the wind instruments wavered on for a further note or two , and petered out . The dancers hesitated , and stood still , many of the couples yet in each other 's arms . The strongest native fear-stimulus of all , a loudly shattering noise , beat raucously at their ears . The colour drained from their faces , and they trembled like frightened sheep . Stewards dropped their trays and sprang to their stations at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs , exhorting those present to calmness and assuring them that there was no danger ; ridiculous enough the assurances sounded , in competition with the alarm bells . Boat drills have been mostly abandoned on the larger vessels since the war , nor had there been the slightest warning to the crew that one was intended . Both passengers and stewards feared the  | worst . Here and there a more sturdy-hearted man met the crisis calmly and proved invaluable to those in his neighbourhood . But Captain Mansfield 's rigid discipline was telling now . At the first signal all of the eight passenger elevators smoothly rose or dropped to the promenade deck , their starting-point at this hour in case of danger ; the doors clanged open , the operators stood at their posts , awaiting the first rush . The cars were filled , and dropped rapidly to the decks below ; returned , were filled again , and repeated their trips until no more remained to be carried . Then they descended once more and came to rest at the level of D deck , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat stations after they had obtained the life-belts in their state-rooms . Already small bands of sailors , under their petty officers , were scrambling up from below and running to their stations along the decks . Along the boat deck the covers were being ripped from the electric davit-motors and pulled back from the huge lifeboats ; into each of these one man was hoisted by his comrades , and a series of popping explosions heralded the smooth purring that spread along both sides of the ship as the gasoline motors in her boats settled down to a steady drone . Now most of the passengers were beginning to emerge from the cabins with their life-belts ; many also clutched in their arms small bags or parcels containing the most easily salvaged of their valuables . Quickly by stair or elevator they made their way back to the promenade deck , where they were received by other stewards and guided to their proper boat stations . Fortunately the sea was calm and the slight breeze through the opened windows warm ; but there was no mistaking the increasing slant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing greater . At this time the lobby between the tiers of elevators just forward of the lounge was the focus of greatest activity . The ordinarily ample space soon resembled a major subway stop at  | the rush hour . At the height of the press it was necessary for several of the elevators to remain with opened doors for some minutes before the loads they carried could push their way out into the lobby at all . Those passengers who passed through this mill at the period of its greatest congestion , reached the deck in a bedraggled condition . By a miracle no one was seriously injured . The deck outside began to fill with the mounting hundreds , and the jam in the lobby thinned ; it became possible to distinguish separate individuals in the onward-pressing stream . Here a family party debouched from the stairway , father , mother , and three children , the youngest so little a chap that he was being carried protestingly in the arms of his nurse . For the thirtieth time the father , liberally draped with their six life-belts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of the passageway toward the deck . Behind them an old gentleman with a cane hobbled up the now momentarily empty steps , looking on all sides and even behind him in a bewildered fashion ; his life-belt , hung rakishly around his neck , further impeded his feeble progress . As he hesitated just below the final steps , a pair of college boys , dashing up behind him , lifted him between them and deposited him gently in the middle of the lobby . Good luck , old sport , ' they cried excitedly , and dashed toward the bar , some idea of seizing a last emergency ration before the ship sank , obsessing their minds . The old gentleman , more bewildered than ever , looked dazedly about , and staggered shakily toward the exit . A door opened and out of an elevator came an assorted party of six or eight , among them a good-looking young man and his even better looking young wife . I wo n't go without you , John , ' cried the latter , between overwrought laughter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wo n't ! ' John put his arm around her white shoulders and pushed her rapidly ahead of him . You 'll go where you 're told , sweetheart : now please be ? ' They too  | passed through the outer doorway . On the open sun deck , above , was much feverish , though disciplined , activity . Two hundred or more of the crew went about their carefully-planned tasks in small , efficient squads . In addition to the usual illumination of the arc lights on their high standards , four searchlights , each controlled by a petty officer , played brightly upon special points from fore and aft . The great life-rafts , capable of carrying nearly a hundred persons each , were rapidly unlashed and pushed into their launching positions . A special crew of mechanics worked energetically to unfasten the two-seater open mail ' plane from its carriage behind the metal wind shields that guarded it just aft of the bridge . Now they had it unblocked and rolled it back along the track of the movable catapult in its rear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catapult outboard over the ship 's side , while one of the mechanics cranked over the ' plane 's propeller and with a bright flash of flame from the exhausts the big motor began to warm itself up . As its deep roar , like a magnified machine-gun in action , leaped over the deck , the two leather-coated aviators climbed up on the catapult , hastily adjusting their goggled helmets on their heads . They slipped into their seats , opened up the gas and throttled it down several times , as they glanced sharply over their various instrument dials and the mechanics swarmed about the ' plane making a final test of the control wires to wings and tail . As the ' plane had cruising radius of only three hundred miles , the purpose of its launching was not to save the aviators ; in an emergency it might prove of great assistance by guiding other ships to the point of disaster . Last of all the captain 's own boat was rolled out on its special carriage , a smart little mahogany tender holding no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only at the last moment when the ship was about to go down . Its tiny engine buzzed angrily and minutely as the coxswain started it .  | On the now abandoned ' plane carrier the officer commanding the deck stood overlooking the scene in his gleaming , white uniform . He blew a shrill blast on his whistle , and spoke briefly into his deck telephone . Sun deck prepared , sir ! ' With a groan from the iron wheels of its carriage the first lifeboat swung out and down the Meganaut 's side . Hayvier and Pons found themselves together in the same group of forty or fifty about half-way down the starboard side of the promenade deck . What in God 's name do you suppose is the matter ? ' Hayvier demanded , craning his head in all directions and seeing nothing but the crowded , inclined deck . How do I know ? ' Pons replied . I always thought they gave you some warning if it was just a drill . I 'm worried about that Mrs. Sudeau , too , I can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose on tiptoe and peered over the heads of those around him . Oh , I know whom you mean , ' said Hayvier . She 's all right . I saw her down the deck there when I came up . ' And indeed at the same moment , Pons himself caught sight of her . She felt his gaze apparently , for she turned and waved to him from the distance . Then calmly lit a cigarette and spoke to the woman beside her . Yes , she 's all right , ' said her previous partner , much relieved . Wonder how Plechs and Mittle are getting on . Well , they can take care of themselves as well as the rest of us , I guess . ' Hayvier agreed . Just the same there 's nothing funny about this list we 're getting . Look there ! ' As he spoke , a white beam cut through the night outside and played blindingly over the side of the Meganaut . Around her bows another great boat glided to leeward and with reversed engine , came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised silence a scattering cheer broke from the passengers on the promenade deck . A woman cried hysterically .  | Down the deck Commander Drake was making a slow progress , stopping continually to harangue the groups in his path . All along the windows the lifeboats were falling and rising almost rhythmically , as they were lowered to within a few feet of the water and then pulled up again . There is no danger at all , ' Drake assured his successive listeners . Absolutely none . In a short time I think you can go back to your cabins and take off your life-belts . I ask you only to wait as patiently as possible until you can be dismissed . ' He approached Pons 's group , and catching sight of him , called , Dr. Pons . ' Here , ' answered the doctor , pushing his way to the front . Oh , Pons , Captain Mansfield wants to see you on the bridge . No , I do n't know what he wants . Just wait a moment until I speak to these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' A moment later Dr. Pons perceived the significance of the executive officer 's remark . The entrance was firmly locked and not until Drake had produced and manipulated his key , could Pons proceed further . As soon as he had passed , the lock clicked shut behind him . An hour later , twelve hundred passengers , released at last , were returning over the now level decks from their rather drastic experience , and the lights of the Meganaut 's sister ship were rapidly dwindling in the westward distance . In Captain Mansfield 's office a small group was gathered , composed of Younghusband , Gnosens , Drake , Pons and the captain . The last sat slumped in his chair , drumming steadily with his fingers on the desk top . His expression was that of a discouraged man , and when he spoke a similar note appeared in his voice . That girl simply is n't on this boat , ' he said , in a disgruntled  | tone . There is n't so much as a rat on board that has n't been accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pons , or by Gnosens or Younghusband ; and while you were doing it Lieutenant Lane and his men made a thorough search through all the cabins and public rooms . Even the crew 's quarters were gone through , and the only baggage hold that had been opened since her disappearance was searched earlier in the evening and then closed . I gave no one but Mr. Younghusband and Mr. Gnosens any warning at all , and I made it look as much like a realistic abandonment of the ship as possible , with the idea that the woman might be frightened into showing herself on deck , if she were really in hiding below . I even had all our oil pumped into the starboard tanks to produce that list ... . Well , ' he finished with a deep sigh , she 's not on board . That 's all we have succeeded in finding out . ' They looked into each other 's faces , and if there was anyone there who was not completely puzzled , it was not apparent in their expressions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern psychology had misled him . I just ca n't believe it , ' said Younghusband , in the tone of one denying the plain evidence of his senses . I was certain she was hiding somewhere on board , the moment I heard about it . But we have looked everywhere , there is no getting around that . ' His voice trailed off , and for some minutes no one broke the silence . Finally Dr. Pons , despite his responsibility for the fiasco , found his curiosity undeniable . But what about that other ship ? ' he asked . Oh , that , ' said the captain . Fellows must think I 've lost my mind . I wanted to reassure my passengers , and luckily it was one of our own boats or I should n't have dared do it . ' He handed a radio blank to the doctor . Pons took it and read ,  | S.S. Meganaut rad. 9:46p to S.S. Argonaut , Fellowes commanding Acknowledge message Request you proceed and lay to alongside us No necessity transfer passengers or crew Mansfield commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were few on deck ; after their exciting experience of the previous night most of the passengers had found it necessary to compose their nerves , either in the saloons or in their own cabins , by sharing their adventure with friends and restoring themselves with liquid or more substantial refreshments . Now they were sleeping late . Not so Captain Mansfield . As always , he had breakfasted at seven . At eight-forty-five , when his executive officer presented himself to accompany him on the morning inspection , the captain was still engaged in going over the time sheets of the boat-drill performance recorded under actual circumstances and comparing them with the planned and predicted periods . Drake had been waiting for twenty minutes before the captain finally finished and they started out on their tour of the ship . On as admirably conducted a vessel as the Meganaut , the captain 's daily inspection amounted to little more than a personal confirmation that everything was as it should be . Some time later , emerging from the extensive kitchens of the boat , Captain Mansfield and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through , the captain noticed Dr. Pons and Mr. Younghusband breakfasting together at one of the small side tables ; with a word to Drake , he turned aside and stepped over to wish them a good morning . Good morning gentlemen , ' he greeted them as he approached . No , do n't get up , please . I only wanted to say , Dr.
