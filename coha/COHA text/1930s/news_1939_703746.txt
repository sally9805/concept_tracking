txt Encouraged by success of the holiday reduction in railroad passenger fares in the east . the Delaware , Lackawanna &; I.Vestern yesterday laid before the Eastern Railroad Presidents ' Traffic Conference a proposal to cut its weekend round-trip coach fares between New York City and Scranton . Pa , from 2i= to around 2 cents a mile . The Lackawanna seeks the reduction primarily as a move to meet bus competition . The Conference referred the Lackawanna proposal to a committee for study and recommendation . The road 's move reflected what appears to be a growing drift of management sentiment for a permanent reduction in basic coach tares from the 21z cents a mile now prevailing in the east . Other straws pointing in that direction include the recent cut to 11. , cents a mile for round-trip coach travel by the southeastern carriers , lower fares on the eastern roads for the holidays and the New York World 's Fair , dissatisfaction among a number of executives over the present basic rate , and desire of other districts for a uniform tariff . Before taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare , the Pennsylvania and New York Central railroads which carry the bulk of eastern passenger traffic , want time to study fully the results or the holiday reductions , which do not expire until January Meanwhile , it is learned that the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad probably would hold to the higher fares even though other Eastern roads decided to make reductions .
