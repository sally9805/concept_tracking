SOLID CITIZEN A STORY BY McCREADY HUSTON C UTLER H. TODD , vice-president and general manager of the Empire Sash and Door Company , of Empire , Indiana , was riding into the Randolph Street suburban station in Chicago when he should have left his train at Sixty-third Street . At Sixty-third Street he should have taken a taxicab and gone directly to the office of 1 . Frank , of Frank &; Frank , to see him about his account . By getting off at Sixty-third he could have straightened out Frank &; Frank with plenty of time to catch the eleven-o'clock train back to Empire , where he was expected at the annual meeting of the Empire Charity Chest . Mr. Todd looked like a man who should be hurrying with a brief case to see Frank &; Frank , not at all like one who was going to see a girl named Lisa in her apartment at ten o'clock in the morning . Lying in his metal Chippendale twin bed , thinking about Lisa , Mr. Todd had gradually evolved a way to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , the visit had seemed right and logical . But this morning , having let Sixty-third Street and duty slip by , he was n't as happy as he had expected to be . His wife , back in Empire , did n't know he was going to see Lisa . Neither did Lisa . This romantic idea existed only in the mind of Cutler H. Todd . She was of the team of Gennaro and Lisa , adagio dancers , who had appeared at a fashion parade and supper dance given by the Empire Junior League at the Empire Country Club . Mr. Todd had written to an agency to engage the professional acts from Chicago , and he had spent a fevered afternoon helping them get ready to perform on the crowded enclosed veranda of the club . He had helped Lisa the most . He had met her and Mr. Gennaro at the Empire Union Station with his Eight , had driven them to the club , and had attended them until their turn was announced . He had done little for Miss Billie Lynn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennings and Brown , the tap dancers . He had been too busy hovering around Lisa . Mr. Todd was like that . He was always ready to rescue the Junior League girls from their difficulties . It was he who rushed an electrician from Empire to the club to arrange the lighting for Gennaro and Lisa , guaranteeing his over-time ; he who talked the club steward into clearing out a linen room for Lisa 's costume changes ; he who drove her downtown for some last minute things for her make-up . The League simply did n't know what it would do without Mr. Todd . By the time he had driven Gennaro and Lisa to their midnight train back to Chicago after the show and had returned to the club to pick up his tired and patient wife , he had begun to feel that destiny intended him to see Lisa again . It was evident to him that the little girl had riot been able to conceal that she was interested in him . In the right number of days Mr. Todd remarked to his wife as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Elmhurst Avenue : " Guess I got to run into Chicago in the morning . Wish I could trust anybody down at the office to handle the customers . Nev ' mind breakfast . I 'll get a bite on the train . Customer of ours got to straighten out . " Mrs. Todd  --  Ella  --  from behind the society page of the Empire Herald , had asked : " Is n't the Charity Chest luncheon to-morrow ? " " Ca n't help it , " he had defended himself . " Got to keep the sash and door business going or we 'll be needing charity ourselves . " The truth was Mr. Todd did have to see Mr. Frank in Chicago sooner or later . But when he took the Frank account out of his brief case and began to look it over there in the living room , what he saw was not a statement of figures but the dark eyes , the cream complexion , and the smoothly drawn hair of Lisa as she had appeared and dissolved before his bemused eyes at the Country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black lace ; Lisa with a high comb and a fan ; Lisa , small , wistful , delicate ; Lisa daringly alluring . Cutler H. Todd was one of the solid citizens of Empire . He was thirty-nine years old and had been married to Ella for fifteen years . He was an active member of the Empire Chamber of Commerce and of the Greater Empire Committee of One Hundred . He was aviation-conscious and bad helped badger the city council into buying the old Simmons farm for an airport . He told himself he had n't tried to impress Lisa . For most of the afternoon and evening he had treated her just as he had treated a half dozen acts visiting Empire . It was n't his fault , he contended , that there was something between them . Saying good-by that night at the station , she had looked up into his face and had said , " You are so good , so wonderful . Surely I shall see you again . " That , connected with Gennaro as he had stood by the baggage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd to restlessness . The poor little girl had been appealing to him , trying to tell him something . At that moment he had been glad that between Empire and the Country Club , on the shopping errand to town , he had asked her for her home address . He recalled how quickly , eagerly , she had told him . Getting ready to leave the train , be took his pocketbook from his hip and sorted the soiled cards and folded papers . He fumbled his driver 's license , a book of gasoline coupons , three or four visiting cards , social , bearing the legend , " Mr. Cutler H. Todd , " and a half dozen business cards reading , Empire Sash and Door Co. , Cutler H. Todd , Vice President and Gen'l Mgr . " On the back of one of these were some numbers preceded by an initial  --  Lisa 's telephone number . After it was another number followed by a scribbled syllable  --  her street address . They were not written out clearly . There was just enough to refresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that nobody  --  Ella for example  --  could make anything of them if they should be found among his effects after an accident . As the clock pointed to nine , Mr. Todd hurried through the station and , taking the walk to Michigan Avenue instead of the businesslike and virtuous tunnel under it , swung aboard the first North Side bus that came along . There he sat and watched the street signs for ten minutes , then suddenly got off . He was one block from the street to which he wanted to go . He had not forgotten that he was supposed to be on the South Side seeing aman . He had no business connections on the North Side . He did n't wish any bus conductor to be able to testify in court that a round-faced man with horn-rimmed spectacles , about thirty-nine years old and wearing a brown-checked suit and an oyster-gray hat , had alighted from his bus at Michigan and Oak at nine-fourteen on the morning of April twenty-first . Mr. Todd had no patience with men who left trails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ordinary man , he told himself , would have got off the bus at the street he was bound for . It was carelessness like that which got men into trouble . In his private affairs a man should use the same intelligence he applied in his business . He waited till the bus was out of sight , went north a block , then crossed and walked rapidly down the cross street until he came to an apartment hotel . Instead of going in at once , he walked a block beyond and returned to the entrance . In the green , black , and gold lobby , Mr. Todd glanced uncertainly at the bleak-faced man behind the little marble-topped desk . If he had been calling to interest the clerk in a carload of birch doors he would have been easy , bland , assured in his approach . But Cutler Todd 's mind , trained by the talking pictures , instantly saw this clerk seated in the witness chair in a courtroom , with a district attorney standing in front of him saying : " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Mr. Todd appeared to you when he asked for this little girl 's apartment . Did he seem nervous or excited ? " Somehow he pushed forward , past that horrid scene , and said to the clerk in a voice that sounded somewhat faint , " I 'm looking for Miss Lisa , the dancer . She has an apartment here . " The clerk jerked his thumb . " House ' phone . Seven twenty-nine . " With a hand of ice , Mr. Todd picked up the receiver and uttered the number into the transmitter . After a moment a feminine voice , the voice , responded . " Yes ? " " Is this Miss Lisa , the dancer ? " " Yes . " " Well , this is . . . Mr. Todd . " " Mister who ? " " Mr. Todd . Cutler H. Todd , of Empire . You know , fellow you met in Empire . " " Oh . yes . " The words had no inflection . They were merely an admission that she had grasped his meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in town , and . .. well , I thought I 'd run in and say hello . " " Oh ! " " Yes , you know , just sorta wanted to see you and thought I 'd run in . You know . " " Do n't you think it 's kind of early ? I 'm not quite dressed yet . " Mr. Todd uttered a little low , purring laugh . " That 's all right . Do n't mind me . " " What ! " " Oh , I mean just do n't mind a little thing like that . I just thought I 'd drop in . And I got something I wanta show you . You ought a see what the Empire Herald said about you in their write-up after the show . " There was a pause . Finally Lisa said : " Well , come on up in fifteen minutes . Give me a chance to get something on . " " 0 . K. , , Mr. Todd hung up the receiver and turned to the clerk with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . " " Not bad , " the desk man said and disappeared behind the rack of key boxes . Mr. Todd strolled out and turned eastward , thinking to walk over and look into shop windows on the Avenue for fifteen minutes . He even thought he might pick up some trifle to take up to Lisa . But half-way down the block he turned back . There was a possibility that he might run into some Empire shopper on the Avenue . He put in a quarter of an hour in the opposite direction . Exactly fifteen minutes later he reentered the apartment house and said , " Seven , please " to the elevator boy . He was n't afraid now . He knew exactly what he was doing . Lisa was waiting for him . He eyed the back of the elevator operator 's head defiantly . At the door bearing the numerals ' 729 he rapped softly , discreetly , meaningfully . " Come in , " a woman 's voice called , and he opened the door and stepped inside . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was sitting in the middle of a plum-colored davenport , smoking a cigar . He was a plump , fair young man with protruding blue eyes and a thick neck . His fat little hands rested on his knees . On two fingers were diamond rings . As Mr. Todd stared at him , Lisa called from the kitchenette beyond : " Mr. Todd , I want you to meet my husband , Mr. Heintz . Angie , this is Mr. Todd , of Empire . " Mr. Todd laughed nervously and cleared his throat . Mr. Heintz said nothing . He was looking at Mr. Todd reflectively and rolling his cigar in the corner of his mouth . Mr. Todd said , in a manner intended to be casual and matter-of-fact : " Glad to meet you , Mr. Heintz. was in town on business and thought I 'd drop in to see . . . see about getting your wife back in Empire for a little benefit we may put on for the Charity Chest . Nothing definite yet ; but I like to get my talent lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went big the other night . " Mr. Heintz blinked . " You got ' em through the agency the other time , did n't you ? " " Why , yes . " " Well , try the agency this time . People 's Bank Building , in ease you 've forgot . " Lisa appeared in a doorway . At a quarter of ten in the morning she was a dark little woman in a pink cotton negligee . She leaned against the door frame and regarded the visitor coldly . Mr. Todd was still standing . Nobody asked him to sit down . With another little laugh he said : " I was just in town for the day and thought I 'd run in and ask how you 'd like to have another date in Empire . " Lisa said : " You 'll have to see the agent . He 'll know if we 're open on your date . And he 'll have to ask Pat if we can take it . " " Pat ? " " Pat Kelly ; Mr. Gennaro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the agent . You 'll find him in the ' phone book  --  in case you do n't remember , " Mr. Heintz put in . " Well , I guess I 'll be running along . Ca n't stay . Got an appointment . Just thought I 'd drop in . If we decide to put on the show I 'll see the agent . " " People 's Bank Building , " said Mr. Heintz around his cigar . " Well , good-by . Good-by , Mrs. Heintz . Good-by , Mr. Heintz . " " Good-by , " said Lisa in a flat voice . Mr. Heintz grunted . Cutler Todd closed the door on romance and walked rapidly to the elevator . At a drugstore deep in the Loop , far from North Side apartment houses , he called a number . " Mr. I. Frank , please . This you , Frank ? Todd speaking . Todd of the Empire Sash and Door . Wanted to drop in at your office this morning but I got tied up in a conference . How about lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And say , Frank , do n't worry about your discounts . We 're going to take care of you . Fine . See you at twelve-thirty . " In the living room of the Todd residence in Empire that evening , Mr. and Mrs. Todd sat reading the paper . From her half Mrs. Todd read aloud : " Say listen , Cut . What do you know about this ? ' Business Man and Girl Found Dead in Apartment . Suicide Pact Discloses Love Nest Say Police . " From behind his half , Mr. Todd said : " Funny some fellows never learn to shoot square . Fellow 'll never get anywhere monkeying around like that . " Ella Todd went on : " Did you see your picture in to-night 's paper ? There it is . ' Todd Boosts Charity Chest Drive : " She tossed him the sheet . " Say , " Mr. Todd responded , " they used that old picture of mine again . Igotta get a new one made . Still , that 's not so bad . " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like this I mean , if he was always ehasin ' around like that after women , I mean ? " HELOISE IN BRITTANY BY KATHERINE GARRISON CHAPIN H OW shall I live , knowing that other days Must come and pass , even as this day passes , That I must watch the moving sun 's long rays Make slowly changing shadows on the grasses ; Knowing that every stir of summer leaves , Or the warm thud of fruit against the ground , Or water dripping softly from the eaves Will echo in my heart another sound . The sound I wake at night and strain to hear , The sound I lie and answer in the dark , The sound of thee , or aught that tells thee near , Closing my eyes and ears lest they should mark Another day returning with the light And no beloved sound to break the night . I was not born to stand aloft and bleak , Like some high rock against a lonely sky . I am a woman only , I must speak To thee , and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barren shore where no seas run , Or empty river bed where no reeds grow . I am the fallow earth quickened with sun , I am the yielding earth where deep streams flow . The earth grows sick from many days of drouth , The shore grows hard where waves have ceased to press , The reeds will wither when the stream runs out , The heart will wither without tenderness . 0 come again , my love , my stream , my sea , And let my waiting shores be lost in thee .
