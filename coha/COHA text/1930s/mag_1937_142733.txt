Moonfaced , middle-aged and wearing a shabby black jacket , a north of England " poor man 's ' ' clergyman appeared at the gates of the Chteau de Cande last week and recited a little piece : <P> " I volunteered to conduct this ceremony . No permission has been asked or given . I did not consult any ecclesiastical authority . I consulted only my own conscience . I know that the Duke of Windsor and Mrs. Warfield strongly desired a religious ceremony . When I made my offer it was accepted by the Duke . It was an entirely voluntary offer on my part . " <P> The Rev. Robert Anderson Jardine , vicar of St. Paul 's , Darlington , was the little clergyman 's name .

Just before the Coronation at which , as one of the King 's supporters , he gazed for hours straight into the face of the Archbishop of Canterbury , the Bishop of Durham announced that he felt it disgraceful that Roman Catholics and Non-Conformists were allowed to play no part in such an Empire celebration . <P> Immediately after the abdication of Edward , it was Durham 's bishop who bitterly remarked : <P> " I was always trained to believe that the Church of England is governed by the several bishops reigning in their several dioceses . I now find it is come to be some kind of novel body governed by the British Broadcasting Corp . and by two archbishops , Canterbury and York . I do not like it . " As soon as news of Vicar Jardine 's bold gesture became known , however , the bold Bishop of Durham insisted that he had had nothing to do with it , would have strongly disapproved had he been consulted . But he pointed out that British clergymen on the Continent are outside their normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglican clergymen in France is Right Rev. Basil Staunton Batty , Bishop of Fulham .
