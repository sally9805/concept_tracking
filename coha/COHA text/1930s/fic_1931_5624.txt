Illustration : Pistol in hand , the two men watched the oncoming lights . The Solar Magnet By Capt . S. P. Meek Another episode in Dr. Bird 's long scientific duel with his country 's arch-enemy , Saranoff . The milling crowd in front of the Capitol suddenly grew quiet . A tall portly figure came out onto the porch of the building and stepped before a microphone erected on the steps . A battery of press cameras clicked . A newsreel photographer ground away on his machine . Wild cheers rent the air . The President held up his hand for silence . As the cheering died away he spoke into the microphone . " My countrymen , " he said , " the Congress of the United States has met in extraordinary session and is ready to cope with the condition with which we are confronted . While they deliberate as to the steps to be taken , it is essential that you meet this danger , if it be a danger , with the bravery and the calm front which has always characterized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger . You may rest assured  --  " A slightly built , inconspicuous man who had followed the President out onto the porch was surveying the crowd intently . He turned and spoke in an undertone to a second man who mysteriously appeared from nowhere as the first man spoke . He listened for a moment , nodded , and edged closer to the President . The first man slipped unobtrusively down the Capitol steps and mingled with the crowd . "  --  that no steps will be neglected which may prove of value , " went on the President . " The greatest scientists of the country have gathered in this city in conference and they undoubtedly will soon find a simple and natural explanation for what is happening . In the meantime  --  " * * * * * The President paused . From the crowd in front of him came a sudden disturbance . A man sprang free of the crowd and broke through the restraining cordon of police . In his hand gleamed an ugly blue steel automatic pistol . Quickly he leveled it and fired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet had landed a few inches from one of the lower windows , fifty feet from where the President stood . He raised his weapon for a second shot but it was never fired . The man who had come down the Capitol steps sprang forward like a cat and grasped the weapon . For a moment the two men struggled , but only for a moment . From the crowd , stunned for a moment by the sheer audacity of the attack , came a roar of rage . The police closed in about the struggling men but the crowd rolled over them like a wave . The captor shouted his identity and tried to display the gold badge of the secret service but the mob was in no state of mind to listen . The police were trampled underfoot and the would-be assassin torn from the hands of the secret service operative . Every man in reach tried to strike a blow . The secret service man was buffeted and thrown aside . Realizing that the affair had been taken out of his hands , he made his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ready passage through the cordon of police . He entered the building and reappeared in a few moments by the side of the President . * * * * * Two hours later he leaned forward in his chair in Dr. Bird 's private laboratory in the Bureau of Standards and spoke earnestly . " Dr. Bird , " he said , " that bullet was never meant for the President . That man was after bigger game . " The famous scientist nodded thoughtfully . " Even a very rotten pistol shot should have come closer to him , " he replied . " He must have missed by a good forty feet . " " He missed by a matter of inches . Doctor , that bullet struck the Capitol only two inches from a window . In that window was standing a man . The bullet was intended for the occupant of that window . I was directly behind him when he raised his weapon for a second shot and I am sure of his aim . He deliberately ignored the President and aimed again at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who was standing there , Carnes ? " " You were , Doctor . " Dr. Bird whistled . " Then you think that bullet was intended for me ? " " I am sure of it , Doctor . That fact proves one thing to me . You are right in your idea that this whole affair is man-made and not an accident of nature . The guiding intelligence back of it fears you more than he fears anyone else and he took this means to get rid of you unobtrusively . Attention was focused on the President . Your death would have been laid to accident . It was a clever thought . " " It does look that way , Carnes , " said the doctor slowly . " If you are right , this incident confirms my opinion . There is only one man in the world clever enough to have disturbed the orderly course of the seasons , and such a plan for my assassination would appeal to his love of the dramatic . " " You mean  --  " " Ivan Saranoff , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't got back to the United States , Doctor . " " You may be right but I am sure of nothing where that man is concerned . However , that fact has no bearing . He may be operating from anywhere . His organization is still in the United States . " * * * * * A knock sounded at the door . In response to the doctor 's command a messenger entered and presented a letter . Dr. Bird read it and dropped it in a waste basket . " Tell them that I am otherwise engaged just now , " he said curtly . The messenger withdrew . " It was just a summons to another meeting of the council of scientists , " he said to Carnes . " They 'll have to get along without me . All they 'll do anyway will be to read a lot of dispatches and wrangle about data and the relative accuracy of their observations . Herriott will lecture for hours on celestial mechanics and propound some fool theory about a hidden body , which does n't exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the inclination of the earth 's axis . After wasting four hours without a single constructive idea being put forward , they will gravely conclude that the sun rose fifty-three seconds earlier at the fortieth north parallel than it did yesterday and correspondingly later at the fortieth south parallel . I know that without wasting time . " " Was it fifty-three seconds to-day , Doctor ? " " Yes . This is the twentieth of July . The sun should have risen at 4:52 , sixteen minutes later than it rose on June twentieth and fifty-three seconds later than it rose yesterday . Instead it rose at 4:20 , sixteen minutes earlier than it did on June twentieth and fifty-three seconds earlier than yesterday . " " I do n't understand what is causing it , Doctor . I have tried to follow your published explanations , but they are a little too deep for me. " * * * * * " As to the real underlying cause , I am in grave doubts , Carnes , although I can make a pretty shrewd guess . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the explanation is simplicity itself . As you doubtless know , the earth revolves daily on its axis . At the same time , it is moving in a great ellipse about the sun , an ellipse which it takes it a year to cover . If the axis of rotation of the earth were at right angles to the plane of its orbit ; in other words , if the earth 's equator lay in the plane of the earth 's movement about the sun , each day would be of the same length and there would be no seasons . Instead of this being the case , the axis of rotation of the earth is tipped so that the angle between the equator and the elliptic is 23-1/2 deg . " " I seem to remember something of the sort from my school days . " " This angle of tilt may be assumed to be constant , for I wo n't bother with the precessions , nutations and other minor movements considered in accurate computations . As the earth moves around the sun , this tilt gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can readily see that at one time in the year , the north pole will be at its nearest point to the sun , speaking in terms of tilt and not in miles , while at another point on the elliptic , it will be farthest from the sun and the south pole nearest . There are two midway points when the two poles are practically equidistant . " " Then the days and nights should be of equal length . " " They are . These are the periods of the equinoxes . The point at which the sun is nearest to the south pole we call the winter solstice , and the opposite point , the summer solstice . The summer solstice is on June twenty-first . At that time the declination of the sun is 23-1/2 deg. north of the equatorial line . It starts to decrease until , six months later , it reaches a minus declination of 23-1/2 deg. and is that far south of the line . The longest day in the northern hemisphere is naturally June twenty-first . " " And the shortest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * * " Precisely , at the winter solstice . Now to explain what is happening . The year went normally until June twenty-first . That day was of the correct length , about fourteen hours and fifty minutes long . The twenty-second should have been shorter . Instead , it was longer than the twenty-first . Each day , instead of getting shorter as it should at this time of year , is getting longer . We have already gained some thirty-two minutes of sunlight at this latitude . The explanation is that the angle between the equator and the elliptic is no longer 23-1/2 deg. as it has been from time immemorial , but it is greater . If the continuing tilt keeps up long enough , the obliquity will be 90 deg . When that happens , there will be perpetual midday at the north pole and perpetual night at the south pole . The whole northern hemisphere will be bathed in a continuous flood of sunlight while the southern hemisphere will be a region of cold and dark . The condition of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet is continually facing the sun . " " I understand that all right , but I am still in the dark as to what is causing this increase of tilt . " " No more than I am , old dear . Herriott keeps babbling about a hidden body which is drawing the earth from its normal axial rotation , but the fool ignores the fact that a body of a size sufficient to disturb the earth would throw every motion of the solar system into a state of chaos . Nothing of the sort has happened . Ergo , no external force is causing it . I am positive that the force which is doing the work is located on the earth itself . Furthermore , unless my calculations are badly off , this force is located on or very near the surface of the earth at approximately the sixty-fifth degree of north latitude . " " How can you tell that , Doctor ? " " It would take me too long to explain , Carnes . I will , however , qualify my statement a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant force located where I have said . The sixty-fifth parallel is a long line . The exact location and the nature of that force , we have to find . If it be man-made , and I 'll bet my bottom dollar that it is , we will also have to destroy it . If we fail , we 'll see this world plunged into such a riot of war and bloodshed as has never before been known . It will be literally a fight of mankind for a place in the sun . Due to its favorable location in the new position of the earth , it is more than probable that Russia would emerge as the dominant power . " " Undertaking to destroy a thing that you do n't know the location of and of whose existence you are n't even sure is a pretty big contract . " * * * * * " We 've tackled bigger ones , old dear . We have the President behind us . I have n't made much headway selling my idea to that gang of old fossils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did to his nibs . Just before that attempt at assassination , I had a chin-chin with him . The fastest battle cruiser in the Navy , the Denver , is to be placed at my service . It will carry a big amphibian plane , so be equipped to assemble and launch it . Bolton will relieve you from the Presidential guard to-day . We sail in the morning . " " Where for , Doctor ? " " I feel sure that the force is caused and controlled by men and I know of but one man who has the genius and the will to do such a thing . That man is Saranoff . Because he must be concealed and work free from interruption , I fancy he is working in his own country . Does that answer your question ? " " It does . We sail for Russia . " " Carnesy , old dear , at times you have flashes of such scintillating brilliance that I have hopes for the future of the secret service . In time they may even show human intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright lights of Washington . Meet me at the Pennsy station at six . We 'll sail from New York in the morning . " * * * * * With the famous scientist and his assistant as passengers , the Denver steamed at her best speed across the Atlantic . As soon as New York harbor was cleared , Dr. Bird charted the course . Captain Evans raised his eyebrows when he saw the course laid out , but his orders had been positive . Had Dr. Bird ordered him to steam at full speed against the shore , he would have obeyed without question . The Denver avoided the usual lanes of traffic and bore to the north of the summer lane . Not a vessel was sighted in the eight days which elapsed before the Faroe Islands came in sight on the starboard bow . The Denver bore still more to the north and skirted around North Cape five days later . At Cape Kanin she headed south into the White Sea . Surprisingly little ice was encountered . When Captain Evans mentioned this , Dr. Bird pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days were still lengthening . Once in the White Sea , the Denver was made ready for instant action . A huge amphibian plane was hoisted in sections from the hold and mechanics started to assemble it . Dr. Bird spent most of his time working on some instruments he had assembled in the radio room . " This is an ultra-short wave detector , " he explained to Carnes . " It will receive vibrations to the lowest limit of waves that we have ever been able to measure . The X-ray is high on the scale and even the cosmic ray is far above its lower limit of detection . We are hunting for an electro-magnet , the largest and strangest electro-magnet that has ever been constructed . Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that we are seeking for a generator of magnetic force . It does not generate the ordinary magnetism which attracts iron and steel , nor the special type of magnetism which we call gravity , but something between the two . It attracts the sun enough to disturb the tilt of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of its orbit . Such a device should give out a wave that can be detected , if we get a receiver delicate enough and operating on the right wave length . " * * * * * He spent hours improving and refining the apparatus , but in the end he confessed himself beaten . " It 's no use , Carnes , " he said the day after Cape Kanin faded from view to the north . " Either the apparatus we are seeking gives out no wave that we can detect or my apparatus is faulty . Luckily we have other things to guide us . " " What are they , Doctor ? " " The facts that Saranoff must have easy transportation and a source of power . The first precludes him from locating his station far from the sea-coast and the second indicates that it will be near a river or other source of power . The only Russian points on the sixty-fifth parallel that are open to water transport are the Gulf of Anadyr , north of Kamchatka , and the vicinity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long a haul through unfriendly waters from Leningrad and because there is not much water power . Archangel is easy of access at this time of the year and it has the Dwina river for power . That will be our first line of search . " " We will explore by plane , of course ? " " Certainly . We would n't get far on foot , especially as neither of us speaks Russian . We 'll head south for another day and then  --  What 's that ? " * * * * * He paused and listened . From the distance came a dull drone of sound which brought him to his feet with a start . He raced out onto deck with Carnes at his heels . Far overhead in the blue , a tiny speck of black hovered . " We 're on the right trail , Carnes , " he said grimly . The plane passed over them . In huge circles it sank toward the ground . Dr. Bird turned to Captain Evans . Orders flew from the bridge and a detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-aircraft rifles . " I dislike to fire on that craft before it makes a hostile demonstration , Dr. Bird , " demurred Captain Evans . " We are at peace with Russia . My action in firing might precipitate a war , or in any event , serious diplomatic misunderstandings . " " Allow me to correct you , Captain Evans , we are at war with Russia . The whole world is at war with the man who has pulled the earth out of her course . In any event , your orders are positive and the responsibility is mine . Wait until that plane gets within easy range and then shoot it down . Do not fail to get it ; it must not get back to shore with word of our approach . " Captain Evans bowed gravely . Shells came up from the magazines and were piled by the guns . From the fire control stations came a monotonous calling of firing data . The guns slowly changed direction as the plane descended . Nearer and nearer it came , intent on positive identification of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than five thousand feet up . As it passed it swung off to one side and began to climb sharply . Dr. Bird glanced at the fighting top of the cruiser and swore softly . From the top the stars and stripes had been broken to the breeze . " Fire at once ! " he cried , " and then court-martial the fool who broke out that flag ! " * * * * * The two three-inch rifles barked their message of death into the sky . For agonizing seconds nothing happened . The guns roared again . Below and behind the fleeing plane , two puffs of white smoke appeared in the sky . The staccato calls of the observers came from the control station and the guns roared again and again . Now above and now below the Russian plane appeared the white puffs that told of bursting shells , but the plane droned on , unharmed . " It 's away safely , " groaned the doctor . " Now the fat is in the fire . Saranoff will know in an hour that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take off , we might catch him , but we have n't . Oh , well , there 's no use in crying over spilt milk . How soon will that amphibian be ready to take off ? " " In twenty minutes . Doctor , " replied the Engineering Officer . " As soon as we finish filling the tanks and test the motor , she 'll be ready to ramble . " " Hurry all you can . Hang a half dozen hundred-pound bombs and a few twenty-fives on the racks . Lower her over the side as soon as she 's ready . Where 's Lieutenant McCready ? " " Below , getting into his flying togs , Doctor . " " Good enough . Come on , Carnes , we 'll go below and put on our fur-lined panties , too . We 'll probably need them . " * * * * * In half an hour the amphibian rose from the water . Lieutenant McCready was at the controls , with Carnes and the doctor at the bomb racks . The plane rose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pilot straightened it out toward the south . The plane was alone in the sky . For two hours it flew south and then veered to the east , following the line of the Gulf of Archangel . The town came in sight at last . " Better drop down a couple of thousand , Lieutenant , " said Dr. Bird into the speaking tube . " We ca n't see much from this altitude . " The plane swung around in a wide circle , gradually losing altitude . Carnes and the doctor hung over the side watching the ground below them . As they watched a puff of smoke came from a low building a mile from the edge of the town . Dr. Bird grabbed the speaking tube . " Bank , McCready ! " he barked , " They 're firing at us . " The plane lurched sharply to one side . From a point a few yards below them and almost directly along their former line of flight , a burst of flame appeared in the air . The plane lurched and reeled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points on the ground came other puffs . " Get out of here , " shouted Dr. Bird . " There must be a dozen guns firing at us . One of them will have the range directly . " From all around them came flashes and the roar of explosions . The plane lurched and yawed in a sickening fashion . Lieutenant McCready fought heroically with the controls , trying to prevent the sideslips which were costing him altitude . Gradually the plane came under control and started to climb . The shells burst nearer as the plane took a straighter course and strove to fly out of the danger zone . Dr. Bird looked at the air-speed meter . " A hundred and eighty , " he shouted to Carnes . " We 'll be safely out of range in a minute . " * * * * * The bursts were mostly behind them now . Suddenly a blast of air struck them with terrific force . Half a dozen holes appeared in the fabric of the wings . A bit of high explosive shell plowed a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In another moment they were out of range . Lieutenant McCready turned the nose of his plane toward the north . " We came out of that well , " cried Carnes . Dr. Bird dropped the speaking tube which he had held pressed to his ear and smiled grimly at the detective . " I wish we had , " he replied . " Our main gas tank is punctured . " An expression of alarm crossed the detective 's face . " Is it injured badly ? " he asked . " I do n't know yet . McCready says that the gauge is dropping pretty rapidly . I 'm going to go out and see what I can do . " " Ca n't I go , Doctor ? I 'm a good deal lighter than you are . " " You 're not as strong or as agile , Carnes , and you have n't the mechanical ability to make the repair . Hand me that line . " He fastened one end of a coil of manila rope which Carnes handed him to his waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the safety belt hooks . With a word of farewell , he climbed out of the cockpit and onto a wing . In the pocket of his flying suit he carried a tool kit and repair material . Carnes shuddered as the doctor 's figure disappeared under the plane . He snubbed the rope about a seat bracket and held it taut . For ten minutes the strain continued . It slackened at last , and the figure of the doctor reappeared on the wing . Slowly he climbed into the cockpit . " I 've made a temporary repair , Lieutenant , " he called into the speaking tube , " and the leakage has stopped . How much gas have we left ? " " Enough for about an hour of flying , including the emergency tank . " " Thunder ! No chance to get back to the Denver . Better head inland and follow the course of the Dwina . If we can locate the place we are looking for we may be able to drop a few eggs on it before we are washed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down on land than on water . " * * * * * McCready headed the plane south and followed the winding ribbon below him which marked the channel of the Dwina . He kept his altitude well over eight thousand feet . For a few minutes the plane roared along . Without warning the motor sputtered once or twice and died . " Gas finished ? " asked Dr. Bird into the speaking tube . " No , there is plenty of gas for another forty-five minutes . It acted like a short in the wiring . Maybe another fragment got us that we did n't know about . I can glide to a safe landing , Doctor . Which direction shall I go ? " " It does n't matter , " replied Dr. Bird as he looked over the side . " Wait a minute , it does matter . See that long low building down there with the projection like a tower on top ? I 'll bet a month 's pay that that is the very place we 're looking for . Glide over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am convinced of it , I 'll drop a few eggs on it . " " Right ! " McCready glided on a long slope toward the suspected building . Dr. Bird kept his eye glued to the bomb sight . " It 's suspicious enough for me to act , " he cried . " Drop one ! " Carnes pulled a lever and a hundred-pound high explosive bomb detached itself from the plane and fell toward the ground . " Another ! " cried the doctor . A second messenger of death followed the first . " Bank around and back over while we give them the rest . " " Right ! " The plane swung around in a wide circle . " Volley ! " cried the doctor . Carnes pulled the master lever and the rest of the bombs fell earthward . " Now glide to the east , McCready , until you are forced down . " * * * * * McCready banked the plane and started on a long glide toward the east . Carnes and the doctor watched the falling bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bomb released struck the building squarely while the other landed only a few feet away . Instead of the puffs of smoke which they had expected , the bombs had no effect . The volley which Carnes had discharged fell full on the building as harmlessly as had the two pilot shots . " Were these bombs armed , Lieutenant ? " demanded the doctor . " Yes , sir . I inspected them myself before we took off and they were fused and armed . They had always fused and should have gone off , no matter in what position they landed . " " Well , they did n't . That building is our goal all right . Saranoff would naturally expect an air raid and he has perfected some device which renders a bomb impotent before it lands . How far from the building will you land ? " " A couple of miles , Doctor . " " Get as far as you can . If you can make that line of thicket ahead , we 'll take to our heels and hope to hide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much luck , Doctor , " said Carnes . " Why not ? " " Look behind . " Dr. Bird looked back toward the building they had tried to bomb . Across the country , a truck loaded with armed men followed the course of the plane . The plane was gaining slightly on the truck but it was evident that the plane 's occupants would have little chance of escaping on foot . Dr. Bird gave a grim laugh . " We 're cornered all right , " he said . " If we did elude the men in that truck , we would have a plane after us in no time . You might as well turn back , McCready , and land fairly near the building . We are sure to be captured and our best chance is to have the plane near us . They 'll probably patch it up and if we get a chance to escape later , it may be a lifesaver . At any rate , we 've lost for the present . " * * * * * McCready turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their new maneuver . As the plane passed over , it turned and again followed them . The ground was approaching rapidly . With a final dip , McCready leveled off and made a landing . The machine rolled to a stop about a mile from the building . The truck was less than three hundred yards away . It came up rapidly and disgorged a dozen men armed with rifles who hurried forward . In the lead was a tall , slight figure who carried no gun . Dr. Bird stepped forward to meet them . " Do you understand English ? " he asked . An incomprehensible jargon of Russian answered him . The men raised their rifles threateningly . Dr. Bird turned back to his companions . " Resistance is hopeless , " he said . " Surrender gracefully and we 'll see what comes of it . " He faced the Russians and held one hand high above his head . The Russian leader stepped forward and confiscated the doctor 's pistol . He repeated the process with Carnes and McCready , frisking them thoroughly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians stepped forward . The Americans took their place in the midst of the guard and were marched to the truck . The balance of the Russians moved over to the American 's plane . The truck rolled forward and approached the low building . The projection which Dr. Bird had noticed from the air proved to be a metal tube projection from the roof , fully twenty feet in diameter and fifty feet long . " A projection tube of some sort , " said the doctor , pointing . An excited command came from the Russian in command . A rifle was leveled threateningly at the doctor . He took the hint and maintained silence while they climbed down from the truck and approached the door of the building . It swung open as they approached . As they entered a strong garlic-like smell was evident . The hum of heavy machinery smote their ears . * * * * * They were led down a corridor to a flight of steps . On the floor below they went along another corridor to a heavy iron-studded door . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . With a shrug of his shoulders , Dr. Bird led the way into the cell . The door closed behind them and they were left alone . Dr. Bird turned to his companions . " Be careful what you say , " he whispered . " I am not at all convinced that there is no one here who knows English and we are probably spied upon . There is almost sure to be a dictaphone somewhere in this room . We do n't want to give them any more information than we have to . " Carnes and McCready nodded . Dr. Bird spoke aloud of inconsequential matters while they explored the cell . It was a room some twenty feet square , fitted with three bunks on one side , built into the wall like the berths on shipboard . The room was lighted by a single electric light overhead . A door opened into a lavatory equipped with running water . " We 're comfortable here , at any rate , " said the doctor cheerfully . " They evidently do n't mean to make us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble to capture us , anyway . It would seem to be more in line with their usual policy to have shot us on sight . It must be that they want some sort of information from us . " Neither of his companions had a better reason to offer and conversation languished . For an hour they sat almost without speech . A sound at the door brought them to their feet . It opened and a Russian girl pushed in a cart laden with food . She made no reply to the remarks which Dr. Bird addressed to her but quickly and silently put their food on the table . When she had completed her task , she left the room without having spoken a word . " Beautiful , but dumb , " Dr. Bird remarked . " Let 's eat . " " Do you suppose that it 's safe to eat this food , Doctor ? " asked Carnes in a whisper . " I do n't know , and I do n't care . If we 've got to go out , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , they can poison us through our water . We could n't refuse that for any length of time . I 'm hungry and I 'm going to make a good meal . What 's this stuff , bortsch ? " * * * * * They soon received proof that they were under observation . Hardly had they pushed back their chairs at the completion of the meal than the door opened and the Russian girl who had brought their food removed the empty dishes . Silence settled down over the cell . For another hour they waited before the door opened again . A tall bearded Russian entered with a younger man at his heels . The bearded man dropped into a chair while his companion sat at the table and opened a notebook . " Stand up ! " barked the Russian sternly . Carnes and McCready rose to their feet but Dr. Bird remained stretched out on a bed . " What for ? " he demanded languidly . The Russian bristled with rage . " When I speak to you , you shall obey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be the worse for you . Would you rather be questioned while in the strelska than while standing ? " " Not by a long shot , " replied Dr. Bird promptly as he rose to his feet . " Fire away , old fellow . I 'll talk . " " What are your names ? " " I am Addison Sims of Seattle , " replied Dr. Bird gravely , " and my friends are Mr. Earle Liedermann and Mr. Bernarr Macfadden . You may have read of us in the American magazines . " " Their names , " said the Russian to his clerk , " are Dr. Bird , of the Bureau of Standards ; Operative Carnes , of the United States Secret Service ; and Lieutenant McCready , of the United States Navy . Dr. Bird , you will save yourself trouble if you will answer my future questions truthfully . " " Then ask questions to which I am not sure that you know the answer , " replied the doctor dryly . " What vessel brought you here ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Consult the Navy list . You will doubtless find a copy in your files . It may be purchased from the Superintendent of Public Documents at Washington . " * * * * * " What is your errand here ? " " To consult with Ivan Saranoff and learn his future plans . If he means merely to bestow on the northern hemisphere additional sunshine and warmth , it is possible that the United States will not oppose him . We would benefit equally with Russia , you know . Possibly the northern countries could form some sort of an alliance against the southern hemisphere which is already threatening war . " " You chose a peculiar way of showing your peaceable intentions . You shot down our plane without warning and you dropped bombs on us at first sight . " " But they did n't explode . " " No , thanks to our ray operators . Dr. Bird , I have no time to waste . Either you will answer my questions fully and truthfully or I will resort to torture . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned the strelska . If you tortured us , you would have to answer to Ivan Saranoff on his return . " " How did you know that he is  --  " The Russian paused and bit his lip . " Shall I tell him that you refuse to talk ? " " When he returns , you may tell him that I will be glad to talk frankly with him . I came to Russia for that purpose , but I will not talk with one of his underlings . In the meanwhile , we are having lovely weather for this time of year , are n't we ? " With a muttered curse the Russian rose and left the room . Carnes turned to Dr. Bird . " How did you know that Saranoff was away ? " he demanded . " I did n't , " replied Dr. Bird with a chuckle , " it was merely a shrewd guess . We have twisted his tail so often that I figured he could not resist the temptation to come here and gloat a few gloats over us if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with his subordinates and I knew that they would never dare to resort to torture in his absence . No , old dear , we are safe until he returns . I hope he stays away a long time . " * * * * * Four days passed monotonously . Three times a day the Russian girl appeared with ample meals . Despite their attempts to engage her in conversation , not a word would she reply or give any indication that she either heard or understood their remarks . The bearded Russian appeared daily and tried to question them , but Dr. Bird laughed at his threats and reaffirmed his intention of talking to no one but Saranoff . " Your chance will soon come , " replied the Russian with an evil leer on the fourth day . " He will be here the day after to-morrow . He will be able to make you talk . " " If he 's telling the truth , the jig 's about up , " said Dr. Bird when the Russian had left . " I do n't fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what we 've attempted to do . " " How would it be to overpower our waitress and make a break ? " asked McCready in a guarded whisper . " No good at all , " replied the doctor decisively . " We would n't have a Chinaman 's chance . Our best bet is to talk turkey to Saranoff . He may spare us if I can make him believe that I am willing to work for him . What a man he is ! If we could turn his genius into the right channels , he would be a blessing to the world . " * * * * * He paused as the door swung open and the Russian girl appeared with their food . She placed the cart against the wall and suddenly turned and faced them . " Dr. Bird , " she said in excellent English , " I am Feodrovna Androvitch . " " I 'm glad to know you , " said Dr. Bird with a bow . " Do you recognize my name ? " " I 'm very sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you remember Stefan Androvitch ? " A sudden light came into Dr. Bird 's face . " Yes , " he exclaimed , " I do . He used to work for me in the Bureau some time ago . I had to let him go under peculiar circumstances . Is he related to you ? " " He was my twin brother . The peculiar circumstances you refer to were that you caught him stealing platinum . Instead of turning him over to the police , you asked him why he stole . He told you his wife was dying for lack of things that money would buy and he stole for her . You allowed him to quit his position honorably and you gave him money for his immediate needs . For that act of mercy , I am here to reward you . " " Bread cast upon the waters , " murmured Carnes . The Russian girl turned on him like a wildcat . " Unless you wish to deprive yourself and your companions of my help , you will not quote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves , to me , " she said venomously . " I am a woman of the proletariat ! " " Respect the lady 's anti-religious prejudices , Carnesy , old dear , " said the doctor with a smile . " How do you propose to aid us , Miss Androvitch ? " " I will give you exactly what you gave my brother , your freedom and money for your immediate needs . " " Thanks . But , er  --  have n't you considered what your position here will be if you aid us to escape ? Saranoff does n't deal kindly with traitors , I fancy . " The girl spat on the floor . " That swine ! " she hissed , " I would like to kill him . I would have done so long ago had not the hope of the people rested on his genius . When the people finally triumph , I will feed his heart to my cat . " " Nice , gentle , loving disposition , " murmured the doctor . " All right , my dear , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " * * * * * The girl whisked the covers from the food cart and displayed three pistols and belts of ammunition . " Put these on , " she said , " and take this food with you . I will take you to a hiding place outside the walls where you may safely stay for a few days . I will bring you fresh supplies of food . As quickly as possible I will arrange for you to escape from Russia . When you have left Russia safely , my debt is paid and you are again my enemies . " " But , listen here , " said Dr. Bird persuasively , " why do n't you come with us ? You know the object of our coming here . We aim to destroy this plant and let the earth take its normal tilt . You hate Saranoff , although I do n't know why . If you 'll help us to destroy him , we 'll guarantee you a welcome in the United States and you can join your brother . I 'll take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , " she said bitterly . " After he left you , he fell into more evil times . His wife died and he swore revenge upon the society which had murdered her . An opportunity came to him to join Saranoff , and he did so . Saranoff hated him and distrusted him , although he was the soul of loyalty . As a reward for his genius and aid to Saranoff in constructing the black lamp , Saranoff abandoned him to you . It was your men who killed him when you blew into nothingness the helicopter he was piloting in your state of Maryland , near Washington . " " All the more reason why you should revenge yourself upon Saranoff , " replied the doctor . " We will give you a chance to do so and aid you . We also give you an opportunity to be received in a free country with honor . " An expression of rage distorted the girl 's features . " I am a woman of the proletariat ! " she cried . " I hate Ivan Saranoff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He alone will force the bourgeoisie to their knees and establish the rule of the people . I hate your country and your government ; yes , and I hate you . I aid you because I must pay my just debts . Come , the way is clear for your escape . Do n't ask how I cleared it . " " Come on , " said Dr. Bird with a shrug of his shoulders . " There is no arguing with convictions . She must act according to her lights , even as we must act according to ours . Grab your guns and let 's go . " * * * * * The three buckled on the weapons and belts of ammunition and followed the girl from the cell . Once outside she touched her lips for silence . A door barred their way but she opened it with a key which she withdrew from her dress . Outside the door , a guard slumbered noisily . At a motion from the girl , Carnes rolled him over on his face to quiet his snoring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few feet from the door the girl paused and faced the wall . She manipulated a hidden lever and a panel swung open in the wall . She led the way silently into the dark . As the panel closed behind her , a beam of light from an electric torch stabbed the darkness . Down a sloping tunnel they followed her for half a mile . The tunnel turned at right angles and led upward . At length they paused before another door . The girl opened it and they stepped out into the night . As they did so , a dull booming struck their ears . The girl paused . " The ship ! " she cried . " Your ship ! It is attacking Fort Novadwinskaja . The factory will be awake in a moment ! Run for your lives ! " Even as she spoke a pair of twinkling lights appeared far down the tunnel through which they had come . She turned as if to return down the tunnel . Dr. Bird caught her about the waist and clapped his hand over her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried . " Tie her up . She meant to go down that tunnel and give her life to delay them while we escaped . We 'll save her in spite of herself . " Carnes and McCready quickly bound the struggling girl with their belts . They laid her on the ground beside the door and watched the oncoming lights . " You two hold them back for the present , " said the doctor . " I 'm going to take Feodrovna away a bit and argue gently with her . If I can make her see the light , we may accomplish our mission yet . If I ca n't , I 'll come back and help you . " * * * * * He picked up the girl in his arms and disappeared into the darkness . Pistol in hand , the two men watched the oncoming lights . The men behind the lights could not be seen , but from the sound of their footsteps it was evident that there were quite a few of them . " Had we better let them emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carnes . " No . These heavy guns will drive a bullet through three men at short range . Level your gun down the tunnel and fire when I give the word . Remember , every one is apt to shoot high in the dark . " The lights approached slowly . When they were twenty-five yards away , Lieutenant McCready spoke . The quiet was shattered by the roar of two Luger pistols . Again and again the guns barked . A volley of fire came from the tunnel , but Carnes and the lieutenant were standing well away from the opening and they escaped unharmed . Their deadly fire poured into the shambles until they were rewarded by the sound of retreating feet . " So ends round one , " said Carnes with a laugh . " I think we win on points . " " They wo n't try a direct attack again , " replied the lieutenant . " Look out for a flank attack or from some new weapon . I do n't like the way those bombs failed to explode the other day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said in a voice vibrant with excitement , " we 're in luck . We have come out less than a hundred yards from the point where our plane came down . It is still there . If the Denver has approached within shooting range , we will have enough gas to make it . Try to get your motor going . " " If it is n't completely washed out I 'll have it going in a few minutes , Doctor , " cried the pilot . " I 'm going down the tunnel and get those flash-lights those birds dropped when they pulled out . Where 's the girl ? " " She 's back by the plane , " said the doctor with a chuckle . " She is a spit-fire , all right . I took her gag off and she tried to bite me . I could n't get a word of anything but abuse out of her . Go ahead and get the lights and I 'll show you the plane . " * * * * * In a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the spark was dead . Carnes went back to the tunnel mouth to guard against surprise while Dr. Bird and McCready labored over the motor . Despite the best of both of them , no spark could be coaxed from the coil . As a last resort , Dr. Bird short-circuited the cells with a screwdriver blade . No answering spark came from the terminals . " Dead as a mackerel , " he remarked . " I guess that ends that hope . Let 's get the machine guns out of her . Well have another attack soon and they 'll be more effective than our pistols . " It was the work of a few minutes to dismount the two Brownings from the plane . Carrying the two guns , Dr. Bird joined Carnes while McCready staggered along laden down with belts of ammunition . " Do you remember that rocky knoll we passed just before we landed ? " asked the lieutenant . " If we can get this stuff there before we are attacked , we 'll have a much better chance than we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carnes , connect yourself to one of these guns . I 'll fasten the other on my back and carry Feodrovna . We ca n't leave her here to Saranoff 's tender mercies . " Through the night the little cavalcade made its way . The thunder of guns from Fort Novadwinskaja kept up and the sky to the north was lighted by their flashes . McCready 's bump of direction proved to be a good one for the sought-for retreat was soon located . As they deposited their burdens and looked back , the lights of two trucks could be seen approaching across the plain from the factory . Hurriedly they mounted the machine gun . Dr. Bird straightened up and listened carefully . " The guns are sounding less frequently , " he said . " Possibly the Denver has had enough and is pulling out . " " If I know Captain Evans as well as I think I do , the Denver is not retreating , " replied McCready grimly . " I hope she 's hammering the fort out of existence , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the land front . Gunners to the fore . Carnes , you are n't so good at this , better let McCready and me handle them . " * * * * * The trucks approached slowly . Presently the American plane loomed up in the glare of their headlights . A powerful searchlight mounted on the leading truck swept the country . Discovery was a matter of moments . Lieutenant McCready trained his gun carefully and pressed the trigger . A rattle of fire came from the Browning . A crash was heard from the truck and the searchlight winked out . " Bull's-eye ! " cried Carnes exultantly . " Down , you fool ! " cried the doctor as he swept the detective from his feet and threw him down behind a rock . His action was none too soon . A burst of machine gun fire came from the trucks and a hail of bullets splattered on the rocks a few yards from them . McCready crawled back to his gun . " Wait a minute , Lieutenant , " counseled the doctor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location and probably do them little damage . Wait until they try to rush us . " They did not have long to wait . A guttural shout came from a point a few yards away and the sound of running feet came to their ears . The rush was directed toward a point a few yards to the left of where they crouched . Dr. Bird swung his gun around . As the rush passed them , he released his trigger . A volley of screams and oaths from the plain answered the crackle of the Browning . McCready 's gun joined in with a staccato burst of fire . The attack could not live before that rain of death . A few running feet were heard from the darkness and a few groans . Presently the roar of a motor came from the direction of the parked trucks . It retreated into the distance and all was quiet . " Round two goes to us on a knock-down , " said Carnes jubilantly . " What will they do next , Doctor ? " " Probably nothing until daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish that we could make that thicket , but it 's too far to try . It 'll be daylight in an hour or so . " The night was normally short in Archangel at that season of the year and the unnatural lengthening of the day which Saranoff had accomplished made it shorter still . In an hour red streamers in the east announced the approach of daylight . Hardly had they appeared than a dull drone of truck motors came from the direction of the factory . " Round three is about to commence , " announced Carnes . " I wish that I could do something . " " You can as soon as our ammunition runs out , which wo n't be long , " replied McCready . " It will be a matter of pistols at close quarters . " * * * * * The trucks approached to within a half mile and stopped . The distance was too great to warrant wasting any of their scanty store of ammunition at such long range . In the dim light they would see the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain . A whining sound filled the air . With a crash a three-inch shell broke behind them . " No fun , " remarked the doctor . " We 'll have to get better cover than this . " A second shell whined through the air and burst over their heads . A third burst a few yards in front of them . " They have us bracketed now , " said McCready . " We 'd better slide back a piece before they start rapid fire . " Dragging their prisoner with them , the three men made their way to the reverse side of the knoll . A short search revealed an overhanging ledge under which they crouched in comparative safety from anything but a direct hit above them . " We 're all right here except for the fact that they may rush us under cover of the fire , " said the doctor . " One man will have to keep watch all the time and it will be a dangerous detail . I 'll take the first hitch . " " You will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing so far and I am the least important member of the party . I 'll do the watching . " " Let 's draw straws , " suggested McCready . " I 'm willing to do that , but if it 's a matter of volunteering , I refuse to yield to the civilian branches of the government . The Navy has traditions to uphold , you know . " " McCready 's right , " replied the doctor . " Get straws , Lieutenant , and we 'll draw . " McCready picked up three bits of grass and held them out . " The shortest goes on watch , " he said . Carnes and the doctor drew , McCready exhibited the remaining bit of grass . It was the shortest of the three . He waited until the next shell burst above them and then stepped out from the shelter . " I 'll relieve you in fifteen minutes , " said Carnes as he left . " Right . " * * * * * When the lieutenant had left , Dr. Bird removed the gag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Russian girl only glared her hatred and refused to talk other than to abuse him . With a sigh , the doctor gave over his efforts and talked to Carnes . The time passed slowly with a constant rain of shells on the knoll . " It 's time for my relief , " said Carnes at length . As he spoke the hail of shells on the knoll ceased . " What the dickens ? " cried the doctor . He and Carnes jumped from their shelter and ran over the knoll . On the plain a few hundred yards from them , a straggling line of Russians were advancing with fixed bayonets . McCready was nowhere in sight . " Where the devil is McCready ? " cried the doctor . " He must have been killed . Hello , one of the guns is gone , too . There 's only a belt and a half of ammunition left . I 'll try to break that attack up . " He advanced to the gun and trained it carefully . When he pressed the trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he cried . He drew back the bolt and inserted a fresh cartridge . Again the gun clicked harmlessly . Dr. Bird ejected the shell and examined it . A deep indentation appeared on the primer . Hurriedly he tried a half dozen more cartridges but they refused to explode . He turned a keen gaze toward the trucks . On the ground was set a tube-like projector pointing toward them . Dr. Bird swore softly and jerked his pistol from its holster . The hammer clicked futilely on a cartridge . " Stymied ! " he exclaimed . " They have that portable ray mechanism , with them , which disabled our bombs . It 's hand to hand , Carnesy , old dear . I wonder where McCready is. " * * * * * The Russians approached slowly , keeping their lines straight . They were within two hundred yards of the knoll . Suddenly from a point a hundred yards to the left of the end of the land came a rattle of fire . The attacking line dropped in a pile of grotesque heaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little ravine ran from the knoll toward the trucks . Sitting in the ravine was the lieutenant , playing a Browning machine gun on the line of attackers . When there were no more of them on their feet , he turned his gun on the trucks . Panic seized the Russians and they made a rush for their truck . Their leader leaped among them , yelling furiously . They paused and turned to the projector tube . Slowly they swung it around . The lieutenant 's gun ceased firing . As the Russians rushed the now silent gun , Dr. Bird stepped to the gun on the knoll . He trained it and pressed the trigger . A rattle of fire came from it and two of the rushing figures fell . The attack paused for an instant . McCready had risen to his feet and was running up the ravine with his gun under his arm . " Good head ! " cried Dr. Bird , " Clever work ! Watch the fun now . " He ceased firing his gun . The Russians wavered and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant allowed them to get to within a short distance and then crumpled the attack with another burst of fire from the flank . With cries of alarm , the Russians turned and fled toward their trucks . McCready ran along the ravine until he was within fifty yards of the standing machines . As the Russians approached , one of them stepped to the truck crank . McCready 's pistol spoke and he dropped . A second shared his fate . With cries of despair , the Russians climbed into the remaining truck whose motor was running . Rapidly it drove away across the plain . McCready rose from the ravine and ran toward the standing truck . He started the motor and headed for the knoll . " He 's got a truck , " cried Carnes . " We can get away in it . " " Where to ? " demanded Dr. Bird . " Archangel is between us and the Denver . " The truck came up . " Come on , Doctor , " cried McCready . " Hurry up . We 'll take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , clever ! " cried Dr. Bird admiringly . " Load that gun while I get Feodrovna , Carnesy . We 'll get away safely yet . " * * * * * The truck rolled up to the plane and stopped . While Carnes transferred the prisoner and the guns to the plane , the lieutenant and Dr. Bird ripped up the floor boards of the truck and exposed the battery . It was a matter of moments to detach it and carry it to the plane . It would not fit in place but they anchored it in place with wire . " You 'd better hurry , " cried Carnes . " Here come a couple more trucks over the plain . " " That 'll do , Doctor , " said McCready . " Get on the prop and we 'll see if the old puddle jumper will take off . " Dr. Bird ran to the propeller . " Ready ! " he cried . " Contact ! " snapped McCready . The plane motor roared into life . The ship moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oncoming trucks they rushed across the plain . A crash seemed imminent . In the nick of time McCready pulled back on his joystick and the plane rose gracefully into the air , clearing the leading truck by inches . The truck halted and hastily mounted a machine gun . " Too late ! " laughed the lieutenant . " Now it 's our turn for some fun . " He tapped the key of his radio transmitter . In a few seconds he received an answer . " They have reduced Fort Novadwinskaja , " he reported to the rear cockpit , " but they do n't know what to fire at next . Their largest guns will reach the factory easily . Shall I start some fireworks ? " " You may fire when ready , Gridly , " chuckled Dr. Bird . Again the lieutenant depressed his key . From their altitude of four thousand feet , they could see the Denver . From its forward turret came a puff of smoke . There were a few moments of pause and then a cloud of black rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factory . McCready reported the position of the burst to the ship . A second shell burst beyond the factory and the third just in front of it . " It 's a clear bracket , " said McCready . " Now watch the gun . I 'll give them a salvo. " * * * * * From the side of the Denver came a cloud of black smoke as all of her turret guns fired in unison . The aim was perfect . For a few moments all was quiet and then the factory disappeared in a smother of bursting high explosive shells . Hardly had the shells landed than a terrific sheet of lightning ripped across the sky . The thunderclap which seemed to come simultaneously , rocked the plane like a feather . Sheet after sheet of lightning illuminated the sky while the roar of thunder was continuous . Rain fell in solid sheets . Even as they watched , it began to turn into snow . The air grew bitterly cold . " The solar magnet is wrecked , " shouted the doctor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normal . " " If they get any worse , we 're doomed . " " But in a good cause . " Through the storm the plane raced . Suddenly the motor died with sickening suddenness . " Our haywire battery connections are gone , " shouted McCready . " Say your prayers . " The wind tossed the plane about like a feather . Rapidly it lost altitude . A building loomed up before them . As a crash seemed imminent , a gust of wind caught the plane and tossed it up into the air again . For several minutes the ground could not be seen through the rain . Suddenly the plane hit an airpocket and dropped like a stone . With a splash it fell into the sea . A rift came for a moment in the curtain of rain . " Look ! " cried Carnes . A hundred yards away , the Denver rode at anchor . " I 'm only sorry about one thing , " said Carnes ten minutes later as they changed to dry clothes aboard the battle cruiser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory when that salvo fell on it . " " I 'm glad he was away , " replied Dr. Bird . " With him absent , we succeeded in destroying it . If he had been there , our task would have been more difficult and perhaps impossible . I am an enemy of Saranoff 's , but I do n't underrate his colossal genius . "
