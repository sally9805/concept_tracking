PURYEAR 'S HORNPIPE A STORY BY LESLIE DYKSTRA J UDY could hear the doves calling , and on a sudden the sound was Granpy 's fiddle . She darted round the house and on to the porch , stopping in front of him with eager demand . " Scotched me a new jig-step by accident , outen the bean patch ! " Roused from his memories , he was pointedly surprised . She made a heartsome picture for his faded eyes to study . Her hair was smoothed back into twin shoulder braids that held the gold light of sun on a brown leaf . Her eyes were gray-hazel , deep-set , and pleasant , and her mouth seemed , like his , only wanting excuse to smile . " Hit 's a pippin ; want to see ? " " Sure-certain , " he said with fond interest . " I reaches straight up , hopperin ' high , and comes down twisty . Thisaway , " she chirruped and made a sudden leap , appeared to fall , but then righted herself with a glib movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to faIl off any minute . " Aim to weave it three spots in the hornpipe figure . " " Hit 's foretold kai n't no other youngun out-step my bantling , " he said proudly . " Uncle Steuben wonders him ifn I did n't win fame , come festival time tomorrow , " she owned . " Gin judges and Sutherland 's so minded . Case-happen a medal , III pin it on your put-away suit , or a green-back dollar , mammy can spend . " " Now ai n't that handsome ! . . . and has Melia fixed victuals plentiful to last ? " " Victuals plentiful to stuff an army , " answered the crisp voice of Judy 's mother from behind her . She stood on the sunken sill , drying her hands on a starch-wilted apron . " Ifn two fried rooster-birds , ham-meat , boiled eggs , strained greens , white bread , and new honey kai n't spread far enough ? " and she broke off tartly , fretted by cooking , " to keep four folks alive over two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peter 's only son . She was a tali , comely person , with work-worn hands , but still unbowed , standing like some town lady in black silk . The weather-browned face might have been called sharp from its steadfast mien but for the eyes , deep-set and dark , that could sparkle with enjoyment of being . " Do for a regiment ! " She leaned over and smoothed the old man 's long white locks that the breeze had riffled and took up his fiddle . " Seems like my conscious tells me Granpy 's strength might fall short of the journey . " " Who you talkin ' about  --  me ? " Peter rose from his chair bridling . " Never felt more able-bodied , " he declared , drawing himself up like an old soldier ; but Judy pulled him down again . " Rest yourself , Granpy ; take ye plenty of rest . Would be nary a reason for travel did you fail to see me win Puryear fame . " And she turned to Melia with anxious eyes . " Reckon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ? " Peter snorted at such a notion . " ' T was no hardship . But I hope they brought you good barter ? " " Fowls earned fair exchange , " Melia said , " but eggs  --  not powerful . Mr. Bon-wick , he says , ' Hope these eggs air fresh . ' A-lookin'em over dubious-like , and three times hopin ' they air fresh . ' Fresh ! ' I tells him . ' Why , Judy has been hand-pickin ' these yer fresh eggs from under our hens every single blessed day for nigh on three months ' time ! ' " " Got me a blue store dress and watered silk hair ribbons to match , " Judy said and paused with her lips earnestly parted , showing even white teeth that had just finished crowding out the baby set . " And blue socks , boy-style , and black sateen for dancin ' drawers . " " Seems like that last item air a luxury , " Melia told her . " But your white cotton ones bein ' patched to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kai n't have people scandalized . " " And no new brogues ? " Peter asked . " Kin dance a heap easier in old leather anyhow , " Judy declared , and went in a whirl of cartwheels across the porch , stirring a drift of leaves at the far end . " Come , both , " Melia said . " Contrive sleep now so to be up and ready for Steuben in the morning . " Steuben was Melia 's brother . He lived over in the Garden settlement and worked as a trucker , building roads . But he was faithful to plow and help her plant corn in the cleared patch and give seasonal advice . Stars were paling when he drove his small truck up " Four-foot Road " and on to the narrow cattle trail that in old times was The Pike leading to Tennessee . There was a lemon-yellow light flushing the mountain rim , and by the fence where he stopped locust and aspen leaves drew silver from dawn . Fresh hay was packed in the truck body and over it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest on with a bolster for his back against the driver 's high seat where Melia climbed . White mists bordered thickets of blackberry and sumac when the car got under way . Judy , facing the wide log cabin that was overtopped by giant sugar maples , felt the pang of great enterprise at leaving home . Beyond rose the slanting meadows , lush with bluegrass , where Jill and her colt and the feeder-steers grazed . The house , its rock chimneys , the encircling trees , the secret blue-green meadows , together formed a strategic defense , cupped lovely and remote , which she dimly felt and could find no words for . At the first ravine crossing Steuben halted the car and filled two jugs at his favorite spring . The water came gushing from a rocky fissure , sparkled for a little way across a clearing , and mysteriously re-entered the dark earth . " Wo n't find water God-freshened as this anywheres down yonder , " he declared , and the sweep of his arm took in the world , with Burke 's Garden valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quilt spread for an airing . As they joggled on again Judy could hear Melia telling him how the fine green dress she wore had been come by . " And the relief Lady entered whilst I bargained with that old smoothie  --  Bonwick . Came close , smiling kindly-handsome , a-lookin ' on and a-listenin ' in as if I might be her special business like the Coon Hollow folks . Made old Government-dawzzled Bonwick give half a yard more than measured . . .. Then she went rummagin ' and outen a barrel of clothes , contributed me this , ' Here 's a knitted suit , a bit too large for you maybe , but little worn . Would you like it ? ' Took me by surprise . Was near knocked speechless . But I held tip the skirt , lookin ' at it thisaway and that , and thinkin ' , ' Ai n't no Puryear begged yet even from Government after wartimes . ' But I took further thought : ' Ifn my old garments air so seedy a stranger pities , woe-me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Festival . ' Waited , clearin ' my mind , ' twell Bonwick pushed forward . ' Well , do you want it ' he pressed , ' or do n't you want it ? , Tell the Lady . ' . .. So I said , ' Hit 's mighty rump-sprung , ma 'm , but I thank you just the same . ' " Judy had never seen beyond the green bowl of Burke 's Garden . Now she found herself passing over its farther rim , only to meet with another valley and still another mountain and towns with names like early history . Ridin ' fast , time kai n't be measured , she thought . No sooner leave one strange sight than another smacks you in the eye and fades before its shape is known . When they had dropped Chilhowie behind , Granpy stretched out flat and went to sleep , and Judy closed her eyes too , and only came awake when she heard Steuben saying " Konnarock ! " Saying " Konnarock " as if ' twer a battle won . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come out on White Top , journey 's end . Just ahead an unwieldy truck rattled , careless of Kingdom Come . Its wide bed grazed banks of shale on the one side and on the other overlapped sheer nothing . In it young women and men stood packed close together , laughing and swaying with every fearsome lurch . Trailing Steuben was a shiny automobile that held fine town ladies who hid their faces in gay fluttering handkerchiefs against the churned-up dust . Their driver wore a special cap and yet looked worried ; unlike Uncle , Judy thought , who could close-curve a downgone place at road 's edge withouten qualms . Then they were at road head , and a sentinel waved Steuben to a stop . There was a sound of Ioud voices and commotion . " I 'll pay you no dollar , " Steuben told him . " I got to collect a dollar for every car passed , " the man said . " Been invited and aim to fiddle . " " Show your ticket then and get goin ' . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't handed a ticket . " " In that case pay me a dollar and go get a refund from Sutherland , " the man ordered and cussed Steuben good and plenty . " See you in hell first ! " And Uncle , fightin ' mad , braked the car and began to climb down . " Aw , keep your hickory shirt on , friend , " the stranger said , changin ' his tune just in time , and made out to laugh , passing them on ; though whur else they could a passed to was a question , Judy pondered . Steuben drove by a mort of cars drawn close together at a level place , paying other sentinels no mind , and took a grass-slippy track to summit , a short journey on , there to strike camp . All was happy excitement . " Sis honey , redd yourself up now , " Melia said , sweeping them all free of dust and then filled a tin basin with jug water . " Wash face and hands . . . . Hi ! Granpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fiddle , new-strung . " " Here , swallow this drop o ' pick-me-up , and I hope it wo n't knock you off'n a cliff backward . ... Steuben , light into the victuals now and eat hearty . " Steuben was grumbling , half boastfully , " You heered me tell him ! ' Unused mountain-tops air free for all . ' " " Steub , he 's too quick on the trigger , " Melia said laughing . But a dollar a car ? gracious ! Who-all gets the money ? " And Granpy said , " Man whut owns the mountain , likely , and no wonder he failed to put a fence around it ! " And Steuben laughed fit to bust . Then he stood Judy on a high rock where five States could be seen on a clear day . " But we 'd best brogue it down to the doin 's now , " he said . " Might-nigh time for the music . I 'll guide Granpy whilst you-all tag clost . " It did n't take long to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people in and out of the entrances and going back and forth from the refreshment shelter . After much pushing they found themselves on one side of the platform with other mountain talent , but the four rows of benches were already taken , and they had to stand alongside ; authorities and music judges sat in a row of chairs opposite . Jim Sutherland , red-faced and breathing hard , rushed up to check Steuben 's name on a paper , together with Judy 's who would dance to his fiddling . Though mountain-born , Jim had the dress and manners of town , and it was said he had got himself in a spraddle  --  fix , with one foot set on a mountain and t' other in a city , and him not knowin ' which way to jump . He played a tricky banjo himself , and to-day served well as linkster , coupling mountain and city understanding , for the music promoters . But he was a good showman , and now he started off the preliminary contests in banjo , ballad-singing , and fiddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quick and devilish : When a man falls in love with a little turtle dove , He will linger all around her under jaw ; He will kiss her for her mother and sister and brother Until her daddy comes and kicks him from the door , Draws the pistol from his pocket , Pulls the hammer back to cock it , And vows he will blow away his giddy brains ; Oh , his ducky says he must n't ' Tis n't loaded , and he does n't , And they 're kissing one another once again . Everybody applauded , even those jammed in the walkways below where no breeze could wend through . Next came an infare song , then a sorrowful strain that gave way in turn to a wistful air of love . Judy knew many of them and joyfully called each by name to Granpy . " That 's ' Leather Britches , ' " and " that 's ' Cripple Creek , ' " and " that 's ' Herald 's Murder ' " ; and even town folks , who had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barbara Ellen , " a courting song that began gayly enough , and ended in heartbreak . Songs followed one after another so fast it left no time betwixt to think on a one . There were quick tunes made you feel upsy-daisy , and others like the crack o ' doom ; verses fast as skip-the-rope , and songs with many stanzas weary as freight cars  --  empties foldin ' back on theirselves ; but Granpy clapped his hands for each singer till he was tuckered , and a fat woman gave him her part of a bench with room for Judy too . Jim Sutherland , in a nimble bearrn , prodded singers forward , one by one , only to hold the watch on each , bound to finish and make way for the next , even though applause was lavish , and compliments plentiful . But now to the central chair of honor came a strong yet gaunt mountain man that would not be hurried . The very sight of his kind homeliness smoothed Judy 's spirit . He took a firm position , squared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hound that sits in pale sunlight sniffing at spring . Two long ginger-colored locks of hair covered his cars and his eyes , that were mild and brown , drooped at the outward corners . Beneath them hung dewlaps of paunchy skin . He hummed no note before . His mouth opened and began the tune on a midway pitch . With the timeless air of a large soul he sat , and his voice gathered full volume to the vibrant chord of his guitar , and then quieted down to the end of each stanza . He was no more conscious of listening people than distant waters of a creek 's flowing ; and as the ballad glided to its due crest , Judy glided with it , carried away by the melancholy twang whose repetition was the secret of spellbinding , felt only by those with minds easy enough to give over . The words were not so important as the feeling invoked , with colors of fantastic pioneer romance and all that darkling mountain memory held . Judy saw two lovers by a graveside . The air seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing clouds and orange-lighted a glimmery tombstone . Slowly the lovers em-braced beside it , and slowly moved away . Smiling  --  sad , then happy , they took a leafy crested Pike beyond  --  The Wilderness Road . In mind 's eye , she saw them walking steadily through misty woodland and purple glen amid the wayside flowers and rare bird-twitter . Two lovers , lovely forevermore , haunting The Wilderness Road . . . . The rapt child was one with the singer . . . . But suddenly the spell was broken . Jim Sutherland had stepped forth , and stood whispering in one majestic ear ; and the people out front restlessed on their bench seats , and those standing in walkways were wilting . But the singer would not be hindered . Another verse began and traveled on , though the lovers were lost now and the colors faded . Judy felt indignant at Sutherland for shummacking with papers in his hand , and Granpy whispered , " That singer holds to his spoiled song , clamped resolute as a hound to a wild shoat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper ending did the man leave off and bow himself away . Hardly any but home folks clapped their pleasure , and Granpy 's hands were the last to quit , because he felt sorry for the big man . " That Sutherland 's an unmannerly cuss , " he said , and his neighbor answered , " Might better kick him offen ' n outthrust rock as pointedly stop a singer plumb in the midst . " But now a fiddler with a rakish air came and struck up a lusty tune . ? Way Up On Clinch Mountain ' , " Judy named , her eyes dancing , and Granpy unkinked himself and stood up . " Hit 's like a gift from home , " he said , and everywhere feet began to tap the ground . I 'll tune up my fiddle , I 'll rosin my bow I 'll make myself welcome where ever I go . And folks yelled , " Yip-eel " and joined in the refrain . Lay down boys and take a little nap , Lay down boys and take a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , They 're raisin ' hell in Cumberland Cap . Hic-cupl Oh , Lor  --  dy , how sloe-py I feel Hic-cupl Oh , Lor-dy , how sleep-y I feel ! And Judy swayed with the others . Cumberland Gap is a noted place There 's three kinds of water to wash your face . " Wow ! " voices called . " Yip-eel " Cumberland Gap with its cliffs and rocks , Home of the panther , bear , and fox And again the people joined in , singing the refrain . Hic-cup ! Oh , Lor-dy , how slee-py I feel Hic-cup ! Oh , Lor-dy , how sleep-y I feel ! But at last Jim Sutherland filled the platform with his ownself , full of eager talk , giving and taking thanks , " Until after dinner . . . . More talent than time for . . . " And folks streamed outside making out to hiccup , " How slee-py I feel ! " " No sense in Granpy broguin ' all the way to summit and back , " Melia told Judy . " Steub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay by him and mind he takes a nap o ' sleep . " And Granpy stretched out under a tree and Judy rested by turns , between practice of hornpipe steps , so to be ready when called . The sun was hot but the air stayed cool , and she felt terribly hungry , and the meat and bread and Steuben 's bought pop-water tasted better than any victuals known . After his sleep Peter was up-and-coming , and he got him a special chair with a back so to keep rested while the tent was filling . Soon it had overflowed , and common folks kept sitting down in chairs opposite the mountain talent , and were asked to get up again ; but none bothered Granpy till two men began to push , making way for music-judges to pass in . Then , at row 's end , a lady in a sleazy-silky dress , yellow as a daffodil , stood behind him with her red lips puckered , and her suitor-man laid impatient hands on the chairback . " You 'll have to get up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned around , and the fellow took firm hold and lifted him to his feet so the lady could have her place . And Steuben , with his face colored by a certain fierceness of blood , rushed up and warned him , " Hiyoul " in a smolder . " Take keer how you quick rough-handle a grandsir , mister , happen you prize to-morrow 's grace ! " But the man only smiled and turned his back on Steuben and begged pardon of the lady as if he asked pardon for Steuben . And she smiled back at him and sat down . And Jim Sutherland rushed up in another bearm , telling Uncle , " Cross over . " So Steuben took Granpy 's arm and drew him to his old place with other mountain folks , and a girl gave him her bench-seat and excitement died down . Yet there was muttering , and some spoke their minds out loud with downright displeasure . " No ablebodied young woman , however fine , need bid an aged man stand . " Judy felt downcast till a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white canvas shoes . The music made her toes tingle , and Granpy perked up happily . Other tunes and dances followed , and she stood like a race-colt straining at the rope barrier , hardly able to hold back . be next , " she thought each time a dancer was called . A small girl with a red . cotton dress danced buck-and-wing ; her shiny black shoes had cut-out places in front and they stepped it proud , and it seemed the tent would split open to rid itself of sound when people clapped their compliments . Judy 's heart pumped and swelled with pride for the stranger . " Now ! " she told herself , bubbling over . " My time , certain . " But still another was called , and Judy had never seen anything like her outside an almanac . Surely a dolly cherished for her beauty . A city creature strayed to the mountains by mischance . Dress and drawers were a short smother of pink ruffles matching the pink of plump bare legs ending in pink leather . Her eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The small feet tapped out a simple story , but their meaning was less clever than the wide silken bow that poised like a butterfly on her head and made a flutter-dance all its own . " Such loveliness would shame a flower-thing jigging on its roots , " she thought , adoring even as her heart sank recalling her own dark looks . That this small dolly would win the medal was not a matter of doubt . Yet polite noise that followed was less than prodigious . Wave after wave of banjo and fiddle music fared forth , and Peter sat with his eyes closed and a happy smile on his face . " Pore Granpy . A-Iovin ' music so and disabled to play more . . . . Yet just happy to be and not in a swivet to do , " she tried to whisper to Uncle who paid her no attention . And even while figuring thus , she saw Granpy 's fingers begin to twitch and he cupped an ear forward , as if doubting a rumor heard , and his eyes strained hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar landmark . Then it came to Judy that the tune begun the moment past was none other than the Puryear Hornpipe  --  Granpy 's owl-Li  --  the tune woven inside his own head when he was young and the same later taught to Steuben , who meant to play it here for her to dance . A handsome young man was fiddling it with passion , and as Granpy 's glory of youth was unravelled the ground began to quake with heel-stomping and the platform quivered . Granpy got up from the bench liken a man gone agley , and Uncle Steuben came and whispered and got hold of Jim Sutherland and whispered , and the music stopped on a sudden , and people clapped the tent upside down . The fiddler bowed and stepped quickly hack , and the noise went on , louder than before , while Sutherland and Steuben brought him over to Granpy . And the old man 's gray eyes peered into the young man 's face , and he stammered , " Be you Christopher Buchan ? " " Christopher 's grandson , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddler took Granpy 's hand in a tight clasp , saying , " Can it be true that Peter Puryear , the man my grandsir loved above all other men , is found at last ? " " ' T is a miracle . " Peter said , and his eyes went misty and the two stood there still clasping hands whilst people called and whistled . Then Sutherland prodded Charles Buchan out to the front , and again the Hornpipe sounded , and people swayed to its magic rhythm as before , and all of Judy 's body was just one crave to dance . " I wish , I wish , " tap-tapping in her heart to the music 's beat . Uncle Steuben , good player though he was , would never fiddle the same piece after this master , she knew , and a bold thought struck her . Should I leap right out in face of reason , could not a soul stop my heel-and-toe . And her feet , near past control , would have done that sin of brazenness directly had not the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upraised hand , put a stop to clamor . And the tent grew quiet as a church . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he said in a voice held-back and dream-struck . " I wish to give you thanks for heartening praise . The music you seem to favor is a piece called ' Puryear 's Hornpipe , ' and it was composed by a man of that name . Now Peter Puryear was the greatest fiddler of his day , and my grandsir 's beloved friend of long ago . They traveled far together , shared many strange adventures , till my kinsman married and settled down , and Peter shogged off on another road and lost himself to sight ; but my grandsir kept his memory green , and taught me the famous Hornpipe when I was still a youngun . . . . " Friends , they-two will ne'er meet again on any mountain road of earth , though here at this Folk Festival to-day I feel them near united . But ? " And the people waited in deep quiet as Charles stepped swiftly backward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and brought him slowly forward . " Friends , I want you to meet that famous man  --  Peter Puryear , right now . " There was a moment of hushed surprise , then such a thunder of approval as made old Peter sway . Men threw up their hats , careless of how their property fell , and women waved bright pocket handkerchiefs . " Hurrahl Hurrah for Peter Puryear ! " they called , and Judy was dizzy with pride . Granpy touched his eyes with the clean blue handkerchief Melia had given him three years ago come Christmas ; then , mistily smiling , he made them a low bow of ancient manners , and let Charles guide him back to his platform place . " Now for me , " Judy thought excitedly . " I 'll do Granpy so proud he 'll ne'er again have cause to mourn havin ' no son with talent of a sort . I kai n't fiddle but I kin dance good as any yet seen ' spite o ' my looks . " Applause that had died down started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own invention , slow yet pleasantly determined not to give over until Charles would come back to play the Puryear Hornpipe . Sutherland and Uncle were whispering together . Undoubtedly they were planning for Judy to dance while Charles pleasured the folks . She smoothed her dress , quivering like a leggy high-breed before it leaps in pasture . But close on the heels of this happening , all fiddlers were judged , and the people 's choice , easily giving Charles Buchan first prize ; he pinned the medal on Granpy 's coat without ado , declaring he himself owned medals enough for any man , and this one was earned by the Hornpipe more than the fiddling . Judy could hardly believe there was nothing more to come until she found herself lagging behind Melia , in a daze , as they went toward summit . " Come , baby , " Melia was saying , " we 'll hurry ahead and lay out victuals for the men folks . " But there were little spiders weaving webs in Judy 's heart , dosing out sunlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow as if blinded . Then they were at the truck , where Charles Buchan drank many toddicks of pure home-brew with Uncle and Granpy , celebrating inherited friendship , till Melia called them to sup , and she told how Judy 's dance had got lost in the shuffle . And the visitor said it was a shame , and she would have to dance to his playing when he came soon to visit with Granpy and talk family history . But she felt empty as a skeleton leaf that can make no whisper of song ; and before she could gather breath for a word of politeness , he was gone , and Uncle Steuben said Charles was a popular man and company awaited him . Later Melia fixed blankets and pillows , and Granpy was hoisted into the truck bed , with Melia and Judy on either side , and Steuben went off in search of cronies . It was cold on this high peak , and she pulled up the quilts saying , " Now I lay me down to sleep , I pray the Lord ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't love me any more , " yet sleep came soon as head touched pillow , and dreams : " Your turn next , " said the lady-judge , dressed in dove-gray , and next thing Judy was dancing ; but her leather shoes that curled up slightly at the toes began to grow longer and tripped her up at last . Quivering , Judy sat up on the straw bed in the truck and came wide awake . The sky was a silver meadow , yet brimmed with sadness , and a sorrow hammered on her heart to be loosed . The prime reason for her folks coming here had been to see her dance . But afterward , foreign thoughts seemed to crowd her out of their minds much as she had been forgotten by the program makers . Melia and Uncle had scarcely named her disappointment to her , and even Granpy was like a stranger , and she was lost in misery , wishing herself safe home on her own mountain . Thin ribbons of cloud drifted across the moon , yet it lighted the dark shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncaring to shelter a body like home maples ; trees that made themselves small , wary as men on a height , marked for target . And the mountain itself was unfriendly , standing apart from fellow-peaks . Small wonder if common-sweet posies feared to grow a-top , and flowing water kept hid . ' T would be a poor place for a morning ramble in the dew . " Here be I  --  Judy Puryear , traveled to the tallest summit , only to get me a hurt . . . . Grandling of a famous man , and me only a one to laugh at . " Then she saw that Peter 's eyes were wide , staring up at the violet-silver sky . " Granpy , you see yon flying moon ? " she asked , choking back a sob . And when he answered her with , " Three moons I been seein ' , come moon time , this long while , ' count o ' short-sightedness , " she said , " Must be a star for each and every gathered on this yer Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow together in my sight ; but ifn you glimpse one fairer than all others , ' twell bear the name of Nancy Wynne  --  her that chose my best friend , Christopher Buchan , for a bridegroom . " " Now ai n't that a sompin ' , " Judy thought , recalling how Granpy 's own truewife-woman was birth-named Martha Stone . And she said , " Granpy , was that why you shogged off on another road ? " " Reckon , " lie said , closing his eyes peacefully . " Sheep 's in meadow , and cows in corn . " Two weeks had passed in special quiet since the journey , and Granpy still counted on Christopher Buchan 's grandson , now a day overdue . But a cattle-buyer who combines business with fiddling can not be expected to toe a calendar mark . The mountainside flourished with green and hot suns drank up heavy fogs , for nights were cool , with much rain fallen . Melia had put off the green store-suit , and with it bundled out of sight all dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented herself with braiding a rug . Judy could see how she rejoiced in each new round of sameness . Granpy vegetated in the shade for such long hours unmoving . " Hit would n't surprise me none were his head to send up silver sprouts , " she told Judy . " I misdoubt me he 's ailing some . A body 'd never devise for all he 'd tell , unwishful to cause me trouble . " Peter came to life on a sudden , and his mouth puckered into a denial ; but after a puff or two of smuke he put the pipe down . " Batty distastes me somehow . " So Melia went to the spring-shelter , chose a dew-rimmed jug small as a syrup pitcher , and plucked a sprig of mint . " Might 's well get the good of this now as ever , " she said , offering his glass with the manner of politeness that had always held between them , and sat down for a gossip . He took a sip . " Whoo-eel M-m . .. . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steuben . " " Steub 's in love , " she said , and Peter stared . " Hit beats all . Here was he , a counted-on bachelor , payin ' him no mind to home girls . Standin ' word-haltered and lackluster frontin ' the prettiest . Had to go climb the highest mount to come on romance . " Granpy tilted back , suddenly jubilant at this news . " Mankind ! What like ? " " A stylish one from over near Baptist Valley . No whit better-favored than ary a home girl . First claps eyes on her , whispers me , ' There 's my woman ! ' Courtship traveled faster'n a March hare . Tips her a ' howdy ' at noontime , and the same night bespeaks her to wed . " " That 's courtin ' ! . what I mean : courtin ' . . . ' T was the starlight .. . music . " " Aims to go see after her next week . " Peter 's eyes glowed with interest . " Well have another party . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the bride-and-groom a happy wedding-infare ? " And broke off to laugh with childish delight . " Granpy , my gracious ! You 're a scandal , " she said smiling and brought him his fiddle . " Then my old age ai n't wasted , " he made boast , immensely pleased . " Melia-girl , I been a-studyin ' over Government news-tales Steub told us and wove words to fit , steppin ' up an old ballad to match new times . Seems as though our songs air too behind . Heark now . " And he swept the bow across strings with unwonted ease and sang to the tune of Cumberland Gap : Wake up boys , you been too long a nappin ' , Ai n't a thing in Cumberland likely now to happen . " Would n't wonder me you could fight yore weight in wildcats this minute , " Melia said laughing . And Peter paused and took another sip , and his voice got strong and he sawed right on through sixto-a-dozen stanzas : Rise up boys , big times are gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourselves welcome to Roos-e-velt With a coonskin cap and a panther-pelt . Fetch along a fiddle , a Clinch Mountain fox , Horn full o ' powder with your old flintlocks And three kinds of water to wash your face When you arrive at the President-place ! Hic-cup ! Oh , Lor-dy , how slee-py I feel Hic-cup ! Oh , Lordy , how sleep-y I feel . Melia was bent over with laughter when he put down his fiddle , scant of breath . " Whur at 's Judy ? " " Settin ' right behind ye . " " What makes her so quiet ? " " I 'm unknowin ' . That child no longer contents herself . She 's a worry . Past starvation , yet withouten room for good cornbread . Seems like we all got benefited by the Music Festival except my lambkin . I sells my rug  --  ai n't nobody pin ' to climb these yere back hills a-searchin ' out my handiwork , Steub finds himself a wife-woman , and you get bestowed a medal . " Judy rose from the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hantle of chickens roamed , separately gawking . The close dappled shadows of branches turned gray , and the sun moved over toward Tazewell , making a fozy smear in the distant sky . But Melia called , " Jude " in a tone that best be obeyed . " Come stay by Granpy . " So she moseyed back and stood leaning against the old man 's chair . " I 'm a tunin ' up fer a hornpipe , " he warcd her invitingly . But she was heedless of music . " Heark now to the voice of my fiddle ; guess what like is this ? " and Peter drew his bow again and the strings answered with a lilting lament : " Whipl  --  whipI whip  --  whip-ee-r-will , " and the sound was so blithesome-lonely it made her heart skip a beat . " Hit 's the long-lost askin ' why , " she said . " ' Tai n't so , " and his smile twinkled . " Baby , sposen you cut me a caper ? Remember the jiggin ' step you scotched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kai n't recall . Anyways I aim to sew me a seam and get grown , leavin ' off dancin ' . " " Leave off dancin ' ! " The old man stared in unbelief . Then he drew her head down to rest on his shoulder . " Why , you got a lifefull o ' dancin ' before you . ' Course by courtin ' time you 'll leave off hornpipe antics , and 'll swing yore partner ; and later join in play-games with the olduns . But a bonnie lass , light-footed and glad-hearted by nature , air bound to reel it ' twell she 's trembly . " And he began a shaking movement with his foot like a jiggery ancient , and Judy was obliged to laugh ; but she held onto downgonc feelings that could no more be named than the name of straw-flowers in general . " Kai n't dance theseadays . Do I try , my feet get tangled . Old ankle bones wo n't rock me clever . " " Ifn you would dance , yore spirit would case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving him a quick hug . " Guess I 'll go fix a mash-feed for Jill . " The sun came back , and Granpy stared downward at the Garden valley as if his thoughts had turned wandery ; but when Judy was half-way up the slant meadowshe could hear his fiddle speaking lonesomely ; calling , " Whip ! whipi  --  whipee-r-will ? " The dusk was like every other , with birds here and there in the trees and a dewy perfume of roses stirred by a faint wind . But when Judy went to the porch to say supper was ready she found he was asleep . He sat in his chair , propped by the fiddle , with his chin resting on the smooth wood , as if ready to pitch a new tune . So she tiptoed away ; and when Melia came , she knew he would never wake more . " Withouten a sound , or a chime o ' warnin ' , " she whispered , " more than the ghostly call o ' a whippoorwill . " The nearest settlement preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Steuben to carry the funeral service bravely forward . Near-boundary neighbors were seated on chairs and boxes in the long front room , waiting while he studied what , for a sermon . The day was beautiful with sun and lively chirping and the whir of a lone katydid , but inside gloom crept over Judy . Steuben , failing of words to begin , the company saw his trouble , and some one pitched a tune , and all lornly voices raised a doleful hymn . And when the dreary notes had sighed themselves to a close , silence grew , with the mourners staring straight ahead as if they , too , failed of thinking . Then another melancholy tune was be gun . It bade all wicked sinners heed and offered lasting torment . And when it seemed he would speak at last , a widow-cumberworld in sable weeds put up her frousty veil and picked her a ballad to suit her mind 's condition ; she stretched her neck and quavered a note , and neighbors took the pitch and carried it forward . The words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best left be , and the long-drawn chant made Judy sob , and Steuben frowned like a thunderstorm . He loomed by the wiudowside , both hands thrust into britches pockets , as might a man wrestling in outer darkness . Then he stepped free on a sudden , and his face cleared and the wailing was cut off . " Friends , " he said simply , " hit 's hard to speak private feelings in public , and I 'm fair puzzled to choose a text &ten; for Uncle Peter . But my religion tells me there 's no call for high palamity of grief . Seems how such a gladsome spirit owns far less need of prayer than our own frecket souls . . . . You 'll bear me out , remembering his golden rule : ' Be happy ? case bein ' so runs up no bill for other men to foot . ' .. . " I got no fear he 'll fail o ' heaven . I 'm bold to believe he gat a call from there . . . . Must be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cravin ' a change from hymns , might petition the Lord for Peter Puryear , with his mountain-fetched fiddle that he hand-rived from the heart o ' a maple . . . cronies , and folks what ' balanced all , ' dancin ' when here , to his tune times unnumbered . " .. . The mourners were not scandalized at this , but listened solemnly , as if considering how well the words might be taken . And Steuben was suddenly drawn up into something finer than his own roughhewn self . His voice , by nature harsh and contentious , now richened , full of persuasion , and grew deep with feeling . " What I aim to say : hit 's certain-sure St. Peter wo n't leave his namesake standin ' outen whilst he gives him wordo ' - a- sort . No All is  --  when Peter , fiddler and happy spinner of tales , stands before Peter , serious Saint , he 'll hear , ' Enter withingates . ' And might even call , ' Choose yore partners ; we 'll run a set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " Likely-undoubtedly , " was answered . " Folks  --  say we give Uncle Peter a happy outfare ? . . . Ifn his spirit lingers close , regretful of leavin ' his home-place , say we fiddle him close to the pearly gates with music that matched him ? " And the company gathered Steuben 's meaning wholesomely and only waited to rejoice with him . Straight-off he settled himself and started a galloping ballad-song commonly known and enjoyed . And with this change of music , the room 's funereal darkness became festal ; grief brightening into gladness , and fear into hope  --  all growing together as if to show how like are gay things and sorrowful . Judy 's tears had stopped , yet her own heart was still lavish with grief , recalling how she had denied Granpy when he bade her cut a caper but two days gone . And not till Uncle Steuben shogged off into a lively jig-tune did the hurt give over . Feet softly tapped the floor in a wide half-circle , and her own black leather brogues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a latecomer entered quietly . He paused for a moment beside the smooth-boarded box that rested at the farther hearth , then turned to Steuben , who took his hand in a fervent grasp . Judy 's eyes blinked in amaze at seeing Charles Buchan once again . " I come too late , " he said regretfully . " Happen not , " Steuben said , offering the fiddle to Charles . " I 'd be proud , " Charles answered , and directly the strings sang with a melody of woodland sounds . And every stroke of the bow conjured something new : treetops in a gale , music of bubbling rain , waterfalls rushing , myriad voices of birds . Then , as if this Forest Medley had served him only to test the instrument , he waded point-blank into the Puryear Hornpipe ; and as Charles Buchan played , the tone of Peter 's beloved fiddle grew proud and full . The box quivered and came fully alive and gave out everything it had to master hand . Company 's heels were set afire keeping time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sudden diLziness , light as a leaf in a puff of wind . " Oh ! I crave to pleasure my Granpy too , " she cried , and Uncle nodded . Next thing , radiant , she leaped to front and went whirling east and west across the floor like the flicker of a dancing sunbeam . ft was almost as if Granpy had laid his summons on her spirit ; for she danced religiously , obeying harmony 's pure demand . And as the rhythmic waves of hilarious sound pulsated through her being , Judy could feel a holiness above her . Each sportive leap in the Hornpipe figures was begun with her arms wide as if they were broad fans of a fairy angel opening for flight . The mourners ' faces shone with reverence for the child 's unconscious act of grace and simplicity  --  their healthy mountain senses rejoicing in the natural . They watched , whispering , two and two ? of Charles and Judy : " Fiddlin ' and dancin ' Peter 's spirit up to the pearly gates . " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's character . " " And she , spry as a hopper a-scissorin ' air . Leaped so high , feared me she 'd get herself hung from the rafter  --  time that string o ' herbs wropped her round . " " Could no angel tap out sweeter hallelujahs though did they come down to earth and try . " ? " Unless inspired by that one 's music . " " ' T would make a gouty oak tree hobble . " ? " Way she ankles it cautions me go limber up my ownself before life 's fire quenches . " And when , at last , the Hornpipe bade her reel in a magic rope , all the little spiders that had enshrouded Judy 's heart wound up their silken threads and were blown away .
