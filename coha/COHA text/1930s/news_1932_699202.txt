txt A recommendation by the Emergency Work and Relief Administration that the city plan to spend $30 , - 000,000 on home and work relief in the six months beginning Nov. 1 , almost doubling the amount it has spent for relief in the last six months , was submitted to the Board of Estimate yesterday by Controller Charles W. Berry . The board will consider the report next Tuesday in committee of the whole . In the last few months , according to the report , the city has spent about $1,000,000 a month for home relief and $1,600,000 a month for work relief . The administration asks that the city plan to spend $5,000,000 I a month beginning Nov. 1 for both home and work relief , and to this would be added $1,000,000 a month for both forms of relief to be contributed by private agencies . The plan is for the city to provide each month for home relief $3,200,000 a month , $2,200,000 more than It has been allowing . This amount would be augmented by $400.000 for the same purpose from private-agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's monthly I $5,000,000 , as proposed , for work re ' lief . To the latter fund would be I added $600,000 from private agencies . Smith in Recommending Group . In laying the relief report before the board Mr. Berry explained that it had been handed to him at his office on Thursday afternoon by a committee which included former Governor Alfred E. Smith , Lawson Purdy , chairman of the Emergency Work and Relief Administration ; Frank L. Polk and Frank J. Taylor , Welfare Commissioner . " These men told me they wanted to know as soon as possible what the city intended to do about administering relief this Winter , " Mr. Berry I said . " I think we should give them a decision as soon as we can . " Of the $36,000,000 relief program mapped for the coming six months , pending approval by the Board of Estimate , the city 's share of $30,000 , - 000 would be divided into $19,200,000 for home relief and $10,800,000 for work relief . The $6,000,000 contribution of the private relief agencies 1 would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for home relief and $3,600,000 for work relief . Anticipating the passage of the State bond issue amendment in November , the Emergency Work and Relief Administration reports that the city probably will have refunded to it by the State one-half of the amount it puts into relief work . The money for this refund , it is argued , would be available not only from the bond issue , which will provide only about 40 per cent of the city 's expenditure , 11 but also from other State unemployment relief funds . Recommendations for coordinating home relief and work relief efforts are included in the report . It is revealed in. the fieport that I the Emergency Work and Relief Ad- ministration favors putting more of the emergency workers on public projects if the city would pave the ; way for such a policy . At present ' about 60 per cent of the emergency relief work , it is disclosed , is done on maintenance work under the various city departments , with only 40 per cent left for public improvements . The administration would reduce the maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work done . " There are 46,500 families now under the care of the Home Relief Bureau , " the report points out . " We believe that approximately 46,000 additional families as a minimum will have to be provided for by home relief . These 46,000 families include 15,000 families who are now applicants at the Home Relief Bureau , probably in need of relief , but not receiving it . In addition to these , there are a minimum of 31,000 families who will be eligible for relief upon making an application . According to the report , the $3,200 , - 000 recommended to be spent by the city monthly for home relief would care for about 92,000 families at an average expenditure of about135 a month , somewhat more than the present rate . In doubling the number of families to be taken care of , it is explained , provision must be made for more investigators and more supervisors of the Home Relief Bureau , The State relief administration , it is reported , has agreed to make provision for some of the additional trained personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anticipated refund from the State , the Relief Administration estimated that the city would have turned back to it from the State $1,600,000 a month for home relief and $900,000 a month for work relief . This would mean that the city could expect to get back from the State $15,000,000 of the $30,000 , - 000 which the relief group asks it to spend in six months . " The responsibility of the Emergency Work and Relief Administration for work relief has been definitely determined , " the report declared . " It has no responsibility for home relief other than advisory . The Temporary Emergency Relief Administration , the State relief group , urgently recommends a consolidation of administration of both work and home relief under the Emergency Work and Relief Administration , the local group . The ' suggestion was first advanced last May by Mr. Taylor . " Our administration has consistently refrained from asking for any additional powers , and its position has been that it would assume further responsibility ply if requested by the city administration . Coordinated authority can be given under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State , provided the Board of Estimate wants to take the steps necessary to bring it about . " We believe that such action should be taken by the Board of Estimate because . it is clear that home relief and work relief are so interrelated that it is essential in the interests of efficiency that the administration of the two forms of relief should be consolidated . ' The report also reveals that for the last four months the payroll of persons employed out of work relief funds has borne about 36,000 names . Although there have been a few changes and replacements , it is pointed out , the number has remained fairly constant . In addition , however , about 2,000 veterans soon are to be added to the payroll . which accounts , according to the estimates of the relief group , for the necessity of increasing city funds assigned to work relief from the present $1,600 , - 000 a month to the recommended $1 , - 800,000 a month . " The law seems to contemplate that work relief expenditures shall be on construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance and upkeep of public departments and institutions , " the report holds . " One - reason why so large a percentage of the work relief at present goes to maintenance work and so small a percentage to improvements is that so long as appropriations for work relief have been made on a month-to-month basis , it has been and will be practically impossible to plan far enough ahead . We recommend that the city give assurance of proper appropriations over a period to permit the development and execution of constructive public works . " There are many projects under discussion which might absorb many of the workmen now engaged in maintenance . To use the workmen for them might well provide valuable public improvements tor the city . It is recommended that those projects be put into definite shape at once so that they may be presented to the relief administration for consideration . "
