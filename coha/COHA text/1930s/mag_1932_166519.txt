Across St. Louis 's twisty Free Bridge last week went a rag-tag troupe of some 300 men clad in odds &; ends of martial raiment-an old overseas cap here , a dirty olive drab tunic there . A few carried pails in which to make coffee and stews , a few carried clubs . The latter served as " military police . " They were supposed to suppress vandalism , prevent radical speechmaking , see that none of the company begged or got drunk . One man carried clippings to show that before the Depression he was an Omaha broker who was ordered to pay $45,000 alimony . All were War veterans with honorable discharge papers , all were jobless . By appropriating rides on freight trains most of them had come from as far as Portland , Ore . They hoped to get to Washington and demand an immediate cash settlement of the Bonus . <P> First important set-back of the pilgrimage occurred when the veterans stepped off the Free Bridge in East St. Louis , Ill. , and started to climb on an eastbound Baltimore &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lest the men wreck the train or kill themselves , ordered the train not to leave the yards . Then the marchers tried strategy . They deployed to Caseyville , eight miles away , waited until a string of 30 cars started to climb a steep grade there . Soaped rails and a cut air hose stalled the train , of which the marchers took informal possession . Ice melted from valuable perishable freight while railroad and county police argued with the determined mob . After 24 hours during which the railroad not only did not move ' its stranded cars but virtually ceased freight operations eastward over the line , the militia was called out . Ugliness and perhaps bloodshed were avoided by East St. Louis merchants and ex-service men who provided 200 Ib. of sausage meat and free truck transportation to Washington , Ind. , thus shifting an unpleasant situation into the lap of a neighbor State . <P> Forewarned , Governor Harry Guyer Leslie of Indiana ordered 24 militia lorries to carry the men speedily across his territory , admonishing them not to come back his way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their leader , one Walter W. Waters , had again threatened that they " would ride the B. &; 0 . and make them like it . " The Governors of Ohio , West Virginia , Pennsylvania and Maryland followed Governor Leslie 's suit , shipped the contingent on to Washington , D. C. <P> Meantime General Pelham Glassford , superintendent of the District of Columbia 's police , was concerned as to how he was to handle an invasion of jobless veterans . From San Francisco , Sacramento , Cincinnati , New Orleans , Evansville , Ind . came reports that independent contingents had set out for the capital . A detachment of 30 passed through Chicago from Utah . General Glassford had heard that from 70,000 to a million veterans would be in Washington by June 6 . Together with Daniel Willard Jr. , son of B. &; O. 's kindly president , General Glassford called on Secretary of War Hurley to decide how the city and railroad were to be protected , how the marchers could be sheltered out of the dwindling D. C. community chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vacant department store .
