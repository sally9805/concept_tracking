txt The discovery of a new surgical method for curing Raynaud 's disease and other disorders of the blood vessels was announced to the International Neurological Congress today by Professor Alfred Adson of the Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minn . Dr. Adson said that by a spinal operation , cutting the sympathetic nerves that lead to the affected parts of the body , he had been able not only to relieve the condition but to clear it up altogether . Famous specialists from many countries listened with the keenest interest to Dr. Adson 's decription of his operation , which was new to medical science . Every year , thousands of children and young adults , especially girls , suffer from the early stages of Raynaud 's disease , in which the fingers and other extremities become blanched from some impediment to the circulation of the blood . In its early stages it is not serious , but in its later phase the affected areas become black and gangrenous and the sufferers sometimes lose the use of their hands and feet entirely . " It has occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Mayo Clinic , that interruption of the various pathways conducting the central nervous stimuli may be effective in altering the course of or curing the disease , " said Dr. Adson . " Although the cause of the abnormal ' constriction of the blood vessels has not been settled , observations following the cutting of the sympathetic ganglions strongly suggest a central control . " Dilation Was Observed . With the help of delicate instruments , Dr. Adson reported , he has been able to watch the dilation of the blood vessels that followed " properly planned and executed operations on the sympathetic nervous system . " The results , he said , convinced him that constriction of the blood vessels as in Raynaud 's disease could be cured . Two London investigators , Drs . Laurence O'Shaughnessy and D. Slome , reported that by deadening the nerves prior to serious operations they had been able to lessen the effects of surgical shock , which claims so many hundreds of victims every year . They asserted that the collapse of circulation that follows severe injury could be attributed largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock . " Complete denervation of the limbs prior to operation or exclusion of nerve impulses by continuous spinal anesthesia will modify the onset of shock , " they reported . This was the concluding day of the congress , and the delegates devoted part of it to discussing the functions of two important parts of the brain  --  the thalamus , or tiny mid-brain , and the frontal lobe . It was generally agreed that the thalamus sends pain impulses to the body and also causes the flush of anger and the paleness of fright and similar emotions , while the frontal lobe is the headquarters of the intellect . Dr. Richard Brickner of New York reported what he described as a unique case . A patient 44 years old had both frontal lobes of the brain removed for meningioma . Functions Are Deduced . " It was possible , " said Dr. Brickner , " to deduce the functions of the missing parts in this man by comparing his condition after the operation and before . The changes in short were of two kinds ? firstly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impairment of control over his emotional drives , presumably because he had lost the knowledge that there was a social gain in such control . " In this respect , he was like a child who has not yet learned that there is a world in which it is necessary to meet people and situations and become adapted to them . " What the patient had lost , according to Dr. Brickner , was his capacity to synthesize his mental functions . " Possibly the word ' ingenuity ' sums up the situation , " said Dr. Briekner . " The staggering ingenuity that has made radio possible is an example of the full flower of the frontal lobe function . " Dr. Laignel Levastine of Paris had a skeptical audience when he claimed to have treated 10,000 cases of various maladies by injecting minute quantities of cobra venom . " Cobra venom possesses action against pain , " he reported , " and can be employed successfully in treatment of the pain of cancer , lightning pains of sciatica and all pains resistant to the usual treatment , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also acts on the blood vessels and produces a fall of the general blood pressure , which lasts as long as the treatment is continued . At the same time it produces a rise in pressure in the arteries of the retina and can be used successfully in the treatment of certain conditions at the back of the eye . " Two New York doctors , Maurice Brodie and S. Bernard Wortis , told the congress that immunity to infantile paralysis could be induced by inoculating children with monkey virus that had been treated with formalin . By this method , they asserted , " active immunity has been obtained , which has persisted at least five months . " The concluding dinner of the congress was held last night , with Lord Dawson of Penn , the King 's physician , and Dr. Bernard Sachs of New York , former president of the New York Academy of Medicine , among the speakers . It was decided today to hold the next congress at Copenhagen in 1939 as a tribute to the excellent work in neurology now being done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
