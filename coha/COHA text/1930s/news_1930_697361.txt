txt OUR THEORY OF TAXATION HELD TO BE CLUMSY AND UNECONOMIC System Makes It Possible to Keep Land Out of Use and Penalize Progress To the Editor of The Neu ; York Timex : May I express full endorsement of the views of Edmund C. Evans , whose letter in THE Times of Aug. 19 outlined what many political economists regard as the correct explanation of the succession of business booms and depressions which seem to mark periodically the industrial and material progress in the development of the United States . Francis Ralston Welch , in his letter of emphatic dissent , incorrectly outlined Mr. Evans 's objective as one calculated to bring about a policy of equal division of property and savings . The statement with regard to the economic system of privilege and land monopoly was but stating a simple truth , obvious to any close student of present-day conditions . The holder of land , urban or suburban , has a decided advantage and privilege over that of his fellow-citizens not so situated , as he will gain by the labor of others and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his part or appli ? cation of his own labor to the land . The presence of the people in any locality is what makes the value of the land . Laws Create Land Scarcity . Our present loose land tax laws make it possible for a landholder to keep his land out of use and create , with the aid of others similarly , situated , a genuine scarcity of usable land . It was land speculation which brought about the great collapse of the Florida boom , ruining many thousands , whereas no such boom and crash would have been possible had the State or community been able , under wise tax laws , to take for the benefit of the community the full annual rental value of the land . A tax on land values is the one thing that can not be shifted to some one else , but a tax on any commodity or product that is subject to barter and exhange is invariably added to the price of such article . All our great cities are hideous examples of this crudity of taxation methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , but which so soon as they are erected have a huge penalty slapped on the owners In the shape of a building valuation tax . In the next square , however , may be a half-dozen ancient , unsightly and tumble-down buildings which may have been erected a half hundred years ago , resting on land ten to one hundred times the value of the structures upon them and which land may be held back by the owner ' or owners in the expectation that it will inevitably command a high price . This can be done because of the comparatively light tax rate upon the land value . Penalty on Thrift . The taxation theory pursued by the makers of our tax laws is apparently based on the fact that because the land brings the owner little or no revenue , the tax should be held low and little or no increase imposed until a building which will bring in a large revenue is erected . This theory is a false one , as it imposes a penalty on thrift and on capital in-. vested in the improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land out of use for a speculative rise . If all the land values in Greater New York were turned into the city treasury and not , as now , into the pockets of the landholders , the revenues derived would be so enormous as to provide social advantages such as new parks , subways , recreation centres , free bathing beaches , public buildings  --  in such abundance as to markedly change the economic tus of the people for the better and encourage the greater use of capital without fear of onerous and crushing taxes . Not the least of the benefits which would flow from such a change in our present clumsy tax system would be the disappearance of the Communist and Socialist agitator , both of whom regard capital as the archenemy of society , whereas the real evil lies in special privilege and a wrong system of private property in land . Mariners Harbor an Example . Some time in the early part of the last century a Captain Randall bought a farm of 130 to 140 acres in the territory which is now included in Astor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the revenues from the land , which was not to be sold , should he used to maintain aged mariners during their last days . The value of that land grew and grew , and Mariners Harbor , S. 1. , is now a great institution , with an income of I do not know how many hundreds of thousands annually , all derived from the old Randall farm , now valued at millions . and producing big rentals . The pres ence of the people and growth of the community produce the increasing annual revenues and values , and this is but one illustration of what revenues the city would derive were taxes obtained solely from land values . Jefferson said : " The land belongs in usufruct to the living ; the dead . have no right in it , " and an Old Testament prophet states : " The land is mine , saith the Lord . " EDWIN J. JONES .
