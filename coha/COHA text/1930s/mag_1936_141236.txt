In U. S. potato markets last week there was as merry a flurry as any speculator could desire . For weeks potato prices have been skyrocketing on news of the greatest potato shortage since 1919 . Not only are potatoes scarce but yellow turnips , the usual substitute , are practically impossible to buy either in the U. S. or Canada . A year ago old-crop potatoes retailed as low as 75 per 100-lb. bag and new potatoes were $2 and $3 per bbl . At the beginning of last week , 100-lb. bags of old potatoes were selling for more than $4.25 and prime tubers of the new crop were up to $7.50 or more per bbl. * <P> To poverty-stricken farmers in all 48 States , this boom meant undreamed of profits . A barrel of potatoes costs about $2 to grow , another 75 to dig , pack , ship . Prices were so low on the Eastern Shore last year that desperate farmers hijacked and destroyed truckloads of other growers ' potatoes going to market . In Maine , No. 1 U. S. potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warehouse for as little as 10 , some 10,000 carloads were dumped into swamps . This was the situation that led Congress to pass the famed Warren Potato Control Act . <P> Not the New Deal but economics and weather saved the potato farmers ' shirts . Having taken it on the chin so badly in 1935 , growers naturally planted fewer potatoes for 1936 . On top of curtailed planting came late killing frosts in the North . In the Southeast a two-month drought has done more than legislation could ever do . Fortnight ago , potato conditions in Georgia were so bad that Governor Eugene Talmadge , a sizable potato grower himself , commanded : " Tell all the preachers to have meetings Sunday afternoon at three o'clock to pray for rain . " <P> In Virginia first diggings fortnight ago showed the tubers to be so small that the Department of Agriculture was asked to reduce minimum Government standards for No. 1 grade potatoes from 1 ? in. in diameter to 1 in. , which would make No.1 grade equivalent to what Nos. 2 &; 3 were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipments , which began in March , from the usual two months to five weeks . The flow from South Carolina stopped fortnight ago after moving only half as long as usual . The Department of Agriculture has not yet estimated this year 's crop but last week it predicted that the early crop would be 12% below 1935. 27% below the average for the last five years . <P> For the first time in the memory of West Coast produce dealers , spring potatoes are moving as far east as Manhattan . Farmers of California 's famed Shafter area , which is producing virtually all new Western potatoes at the moment , will gross some $8,000,000 from 9,000 acres- more than the entire California crop from 45,000 acres brought last year . <P> As prices climbed last week , potatoes began to appear from unsuspected quarters . In Manhattan heavy shipments from North Carolina helped send old crop quotations crashing from $4.40 per bag to $3.50 . New potatoes tumbled from $7.75 per bbl. to $5.50 . Speculating in potatoes is ticklish business because there is no potato futures market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . In last week 's flurry a number of speculators were caught with their hands full of hot potatoes . And cool week-end rains in the East did not add to their comfort .
