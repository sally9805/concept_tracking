While Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's Government last week had its hands full defending Britain 's domestic air defenses , from another quarter it was questioned on the security of nothing less than " The Rock ' ' itself . Was the Prime Minister aware , asked Her Grace the Duchess of Atholl , Conservative M. P. , that Spanish Rightist Generalissimo Franco , with Italian and German aid , has so fortified the Spanish seacoast overlooking Gibraltar as to make this keystone of empire practically worthless ? <P> The Duchess ' disclosure had an air of authenticity because she is an M. P. who gets around , keeps her ears and eyes open . Since 1923 she has been a member from the backward Scottish agricultural constituency of West Perth and Kinross . At the outbreak of the two-year-old war in Spain , she refused to take sides . Year later she became publicly pro-Leftist , accepted the chairmanship of Britain 's National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief and inaugurated the scheme which brought 4,000 Leftist moppets as refugees to England . Last April she resigned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independent Conservative . In the last year she has bustled down to Leftist territory , gleaned enough material to write a book , * with a few items left over to toss last week at the harried Prime Minister . <P> According to the 64-year-old Duchess , the Rightists have planted more than 20 large guns of German make in the hills around Algeciras , commanding Gibraltar ; a number of long-range 5.9-inch weapons have been installed along the coast " so placed that they could drop shells in Gibraltar but yet are invisible from the highest point on the rock " : nine naval-type guns are located on Punta Carnero , on the west side of Gibraltar bay , and at least one 15-inch weapon on a high peak near Alcla de los Gazules , some 40 miles inland ; 45 more guns , ranging in size from six to 15 inches , have been set up in Spanish Morocco , on the African coastline directly across from the fortress . <P> In any but so trying a week as last the Duchess ' charges , which she phrased as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer from the Prime Minister , but by next day the Sandys storm had swept over the House , burying the Duchess ' question beneath it . <P> *SEARCHLIGHT on SPAIN-Penguin Books Limited , Middlesex , England .
