When William Randolph Hearst sold the little Fort Worth Record in 1925 , it was the exception that proved the rule that he would never , so long as Hearst was HEARST , sell or disband a newspaper . But last week all rules were off in the Hearst empire of 26 newspapers , 13 magazines and assorted enterprises . The famed , New York American was dead , dropped like a cold potato . The queen-pin of his domain , * the paper that was called his journalistic " love child , " on which he lavished money and affection and talent , was killed after a five-day conference . <P> Killing the New York American had been a logical move for Mr. Hearst for a long time , and a succession of business advisers had urged him to do it . Last year it capped its historic record of operations in the red with an all-time high deficit of around $1,000,000 . What finally precipitated the obsequies , outsiders were not told , but shutting off this one big drain on Hearst resources could have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst was planning to sell . Delayed in passage for weeks by successive amendments had been his registrations with the Securities &; Exchange Commission of $35,500,000 of debentures- $22,500,000 for Hearst Publications , Inc. , $13,000,000 for Hearst Magazines , Inc . ( TIME , April 26 ) . <P> In an open letter to Editor &; Publisher , Publisher Hearst explained : " The newspapers that are favorites with me are the newspapers that are favorites with the public . . . . Unsuccessful newspapers are a luxury which can not be afforded and which one has no RIGHT to afford in-definitely . " <P> If newspaper publishing has a championship class , certainly it is the Manhattan morning field . In sophistication as well as numbers that public is a U. S. news publisher 's greatest challenge . The young man from California who , 42 years ago , took up that challenge , was courageous as well as rich . He bargained the late John Roll McLean down from $360,000 to $180,000 for his wobbly Morning Journal and then proceeded to spend $7,500,000 combatting fiery Joseph Pulitzer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pulitzer 's ablest men , including Arthur Brisbane and Morrill Goddard , the genius who gave him the American Weekly . He made the Spanish-American War his personal affair for the Journal ' ? , sake . The transition of the old Journal into the American , effected in three steps between 1901 and 1903 , followed an excess of boldness which nearly earned Hearst the blame for President McKinley 's assassination . <P> But as times changed , the flamboyant Hearst-Pulitzer technique was outgrown by the Manhattan morning public . The more sedate and reliable Times , Herald and Tribune crowded the World and the American down upon the subway trade . <P> Then came the tabloid News to take away that trade . Hearst started the tabloid Mirror in answer , but he was really competing with himself . That the American outlived the World by six years may have been some satisfaction , however expensive , but Mr. Hearst 's deepest publishing sensibilities must have been involved by the thought of his cheap Mirror outliving the pride of his glorious youth .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
