U. S. readers hear more about concentration camps than they do about literary life in Hitler 's Naziland . Nazi publishing facts at first glance look startling indeed . The Third Reich publishes 25,000 books annually ( U. S. total is 11,000 ; Britain 's 16,000 ) . Scores of new writers , unheard-of before Hitler , have popped into the best-seller class . U. S. Writers Thomas Wolfe and William Faulkner are favorites of the Nazi Napoleons . <P> Nazis call their literary brand " steel romanticism " to distinguish it from the foggy fervors of the traditional German romantics . Pet bugbear of Nazi writers is " Jewish realism and intellectualism . " Their pet ideal is an Aryan hero who does not yet exist . On paper he is : 1 ) an individual only in the sense that he is one of a blood community ; 2 ) close to the soil , because his blood community has lived close to it for generations ; 3 ) perfectly poised between these poles of blood and soil , so that his actions are always determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the actions of a healthy animal . When Nazi theoreticians sound off about the German folk-soul , they mean to refer to this somewhat vague balance of blood , soil , race . <P> But Nazi writers have succeeded little better than Nazi drill sergeants in filling rush orders for the model Nazi hero . In real life he might be a nuisance ; in a book he is a bore . <P> Leading literary pluggers for the Nazi folk-soul are : Harms Johst , Germany 's foremost dramatist by default , and since 1935 head of the Reich Chamber of Literature . His Schlageter was for years almost the only presentable Nazi drama . In 1934 Johst 's play Prophets was so violently anti-Semitic that it frightened even Field Marshal Goring into banning it . Johst is author of the Nazi crack : " Whenever I hear the word Culture , I reach for my revolver ! " <P> Hans Friederich Blunck 's ice-age novel , Power Over Fire , shows Nordic man as he emerged from the primitive state . In Struggle of the Constellations ( Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Age ) , Blunck advanced the Nordics by archeological progression toward the Third Reich . His heroes " get their strength from the soil in which they are rooted , and from their ancestors ' blood which flows in their veins . " <P> Herman Stehr , a kind of German Knut Hamsun , writes about peasants . Hans Grimm is the author of a novel whose enormous length ( 1,300 pages ) belies its title : People Without Room . A Nazi classic , it is often contrasted with Thomas Mann 's The Magic Mountain , to Mann 's disadvantage . <P> Hans Fallada ( Little Man , What Now ? ) , though not a Nazi , is still popular in Germany . But his Iron Gustav has been quietly blacklisted . Joseph Ponten 's seven-volume historical novel will trace the emigrations of German minorities abroad , especially in Russia . Edwin Erich Dwinger 's The Last Horsemen describes the futile attempt of a gang of German frontier soldiers to invade Courland and make it a German province . <P> Friedrich Ekkehard is the author of Storm-Breed , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , splendid words . " Gottfried Rothacker 's Frontier Village told of the pre-Munich yearnings of a Sudeten German to be reunited with the Reich . The book sold 60,000 copies in 1936.
