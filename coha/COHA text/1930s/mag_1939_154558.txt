Plump Mrs. Anthony Geraci , goodwife of The Bronx , N. Y. , limped to St. Lucy 's Roman Catholic Church one evening last week , leaning on a cane . Her dragging left foot was supported in a steel brace . After services in the church , Mrs. Geraci and some 500 other worshippers followed Father Pasquale T. Lombardo to St. Lucy 's new , $10,000 outdoor shrine , a replica of the famed grotto at Lourdes . Mrs. Geraci went to the shrine 's pool , fed by city water trickling over big rocks below a statue of the Virgin . <P> Paying small heed to those about her , the goodwife sipped the water , prayed quietly . Suddenly she felt " the pricking of needles " all over her . Slipping off her shoe and brace , Mrs. Geraci stepped into the pool . She clambered out , jumped up &; down , flexed her muscles , exhibited a healthy left foot . Everyone shouted . <P> Mrs. Geraci almost ran the ten blocks back home , to show her foot to her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago when an earthquake in Italy wiped out his family . " I believe ! I believe ! " cried Anthony Geraci , and rushed back to St. Lucy 's with his wife . Soon there was such a press round the Geracis at the shrine that police had to be called . As the crowds continued to grow , Father Lombardo , who had heard of small " favors " ( minor cures ) at the shrine , said of Mrs. Geraci 's healing : " It is a miracle of faith . I will report it to the Chancery Office . " <P> A Bronx doctor who said he had examined Mrs. Geraci seven years ago declared she had been afflicted with " flip walk , " result of flaccid paralysis . At week 's end no physician had publicly attested her foot healed .
