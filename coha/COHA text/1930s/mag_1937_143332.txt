Ever since childhood trips to the U. S. acquainted him with the cakewalk and minstrel shows , German-born Choreographer Eugene von Grona has wanted to bring Harlem and the ballet together . While dancing and directing ballets at Roxy 's Theatre in 1935 , he explored upper Manhattan , dived into nightclubs . He found their dancers all too light , too sophisticated . " I want them black , black , all Negro , " said von Grona . Samuel ( " Roxy " ) Rothafel agreed , said " the blacker the better . " Von Grona advertised , offering scholarships , and got hundreds of applications . He picked 20 of the blackest applicants and started to rehearse his ballet . The neighbors complained . Hollywood tried to lure him away . But von Grona stuck . <P> Last week in Harlem 's dingy Lafayette Theatre , while a sophisticated audience squinted and chattered about esthetics , the von Grona blacks were officially presented as Art . In the pit an all-Negro " symphony " orchestra , sporting a single saxophone as a concession to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bach 's Air for the G String . The evening 's most pretentious item , Stravinsky 's Firebird Suite , was played on a phonograph . <P> Unexpectedly , the 100% black Africans did their best cavorting in Stravinsky 's 100% Slavic opus . In the Bacchanalian Children of the Earth ( music by Negro " Composer Reginald Forsythe ) the attempted emulsion of ballet technique and hot-cha failed to mix . St. Louis Women ( music by famed W. C. Handy ) was straight hot-cha , and might have been done better at the Cotton Club . Encouraged by first-nighters ' applause , softspoken , boyish-faced von Grona and his blonde wife Leni decided that their Negro ballet had a great future .
