THE BETROTHED A STORY BY ELIZABETH MADOX ROBERTS T HE fine things that were put away were brought out to be aired , and Rhody 's mother told her that the Rose of Sharon quilt would be hers when she married . Spread out in the sunlight , the quilt showed beautiful fine stitchery and patterns of stiff , formal flowers and leaves . Julie , the mother , had made it during the first year of her married life , and Homer , the father , had cut the patterns for her . Rhody could not imagine her father cutting patterns of flowers in bright calicoes but she did not speak of her surprise at this . She had often seen the quilt . It was the most beautiful piece of handiwork the house contained . One could scarcely see the minute stitches that quilted it , that bound it together into a finely crinkled crepe . It had always been prized , too good for common use , and brought out only for elegant company . Rhody was slightly abashed at the gift of the quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had of equal value to give Ruby or to Lilly , her small sisters . The gift stood in some relation to herself and Kirk Brown . In the gift her mother confirmed her liking and gave dignity to her playfulness . Her mother had thus confirmed something more , had assured her of it . " We might make another , " Julie said , looking at Ruby and Lilly . Theyanswered her , speaking together , or now one and then the other : " There 'll be plenty of time . For me a plenty . " They were ten and eleven years old and they seemed of but one age , as if they shared equally even the years they had . Their arms were entwined and they pulled and twisted each other about as one creature . " We have n't even got steady company . " Rhody did not at any moment forget Kirk Brown . Her mother 's present had honored her feeling for him , but it had stated some further requirement , as if something further were demanded of her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quilt set her apart , and for this she was proud , for it was the supreme gift her mother had to offer . She turned it about with Lilly and Ruby to look at it , being slightly drunk with pride and pleasure . The leaves of the decorations stitched onto the quilt were made of pale-green cloth sewed flat . The full-blown roses were open like poppies and the buds were hard and formal  --  a phantasy in flower . The Rose of Sharon was the name of the pattern , and such a quilt had been in the family for five generations , for Julie had copied it from one inherited . In one corner there lay a design which was not repeated elsewhere  --  three iron-brown stains like three small brown berries . " What are these ? " Rhody asked . " I recollect , " her mother said ; " That 's where I plucked my finger with my needle while I sewed to bind the border . I recall the day very well . I plucked my finger with the needle and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my seat . I tried hard to sponge it off the quilt afterward , but I could n't take it out withouten I faded the color . " " It 's like three grapes in a little bunch , " Rhody said . Ruby and Lilly each tried to say what it was like . " Like apples , crab-apples . " " It 's like three little dog tracks , the little dog in a hurry . " " It 's like three drops of blood on the Rose of Sharon quilt , " Lilly said at last . " It 's three drops of a woman 's blood on the Rose of Sharon , the best quilt in the family . " " Hush , " Julie said , " hush the nonsense . " The quilt was admired again and searched for its beauties . It was spread out to adorn Rhody 's bed now because it was hers . Rhody had been to spend a night with a neighbor girl . Coming from the house of her friend , walking down the driveway through the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so planned his going along the road that it fell with her passing homeward . Walking with her along the way , Kirk led his horse behind him . The feet of the horse stepped near to her feet as she walked on the hard roadway , and Kirk held her hand in his large fist . Life seemed very simple to her when Kirk was near , as if only those things of which he took account had reason or being . Now value was thus focused at the point where his hand closed upon her own , and as he walked he looked at her continually . He smiled or he knotted his forehead now and then to check or to set bounds upon his expressed pleasure , his puckered brow a sign of his inner delight . He wasspeaking , using the speech of the country , exaggerating his accustomed speech with the speech of the fields . " I 'm a-goen to rent a piece of the Cooksey land next year . " lie had told her this as a plan , telling her now of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll live in the little red house on the branch . We 'll have a whole mess of chickens and a pa'sel of hogs and some cows . And I 'll raise corn and backer till I fair split my sides . I 'll do hit . And next year or year after I 'll fair buy a piece of land , and you and me , we 'll be fixed for fife . " She looked at him quickly and away , making thus her reply . He was a romantic lover . He liked to bum or to sing a line from a song . In summer he was ruddy from the sun , but in winter he was only browned by the winds . Sometimes he would kiss her fingers when she gave him a cup of water . She was dark , looking up at him slyly , her brown hair blowing dark in the wind . A slim girl , but she was deep and broad in the shoulders . Her slim hips were buttoned into a close sweater of dark wine-red wool , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , out of step with his stride . He told again of his plan for their keep . " February we 'll go there , " he said . The small red house was in their thought . " I 've already signed a paper with Mr. Cooksey . He says corn on the bottom field this time and backer on the little field beside the barn , and that suits me first-rate . That 's how it ought to be , Rhody . And a cow in his big pasture , milk for you and me . Milk and honey blessed . " Knowing that he looked foolish saying this , he flung up his voice in a brief song . " And that 's all there is to do , Rhody , " he said . " And it 's easy to do , easy to go . . . . " The step of the horse walked unpleasantly near and the thud of the hoof beats pressed unevenly on her sense of herself as much prized and much desired . " A little while we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agreed to all she asked . " After we tell there 'll be a big noise all around and everybody will try to get into it . People like to get as close as they can to a wedden . " " As close as they can without climben right inside it . " " They like to stay close up to it and to touch it and handle it . They think they can have their own over again by touchen yours . " The horse came forward , its nose close to their heels , and she felt as if she were being followed , as if she were being driven or crowded forward . Kirk 's large frank face was everywhere present , in the strength of his hand , in his happy oath as he blessed himself , saying gaily , " God knows ! " or " God-almighty ! " " What do you say ? " asking but never waiting for a reply . He bent forward to look at her again . He had always been about her , a large boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had been rough , and she had run away from him , but after he was grown he had become gentle . He would come to fish in the creek and he would dig the bait . He would be baiting their hooks and setting the little girls safely across the creek or carrying them over the pools . All that he said now gathered about one plan . He was going away to stay three weeks with his brother far down in the southwest of the State . He was going to help his brother build a barn . Christmas would come . He would be making a Christmas visit in his brother 's house . He would have a look , he said , at married life close at hand before he entered into it . His brother had been married ten years . A house full of little children , he said , and he named four , holding up a finger foreach child . He was a big , simple man then , direct and kind , a lover of women and of little children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruby and Lilly and remembered the three clubs bidden away behind the tool house . She did not want him to go to visit his brother . She held his hand lightly and smiled with him while he told of what their life would be in the little house near the stream . Through all that he told she remembered continually the horse as pushing her forward , as walking so near that she could feel the warmth of his great body and the uneven probing of his great nose . His large shoulder was raised above her head and his bulk seemed to be thrusting upon her to push her along the road . She could see at the edge of her dress as she looked downward , his thrusting knee that bent and straightened and bent again as he walked almost upon her . Kirk held the bridle drawn over his arm and he seemed unaware of the horse . She came down the road thus crowded forward and led lightly along . " We 'll do thus , " he said , contriving their life together . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would be gone two weeks or three , he said , the time depending on what time was required to build the barn . When he came back they would be openly engaged for a short time and then they would be married . She would glance up at him as he walked steadily beside her and drew the horse along . He seemed beautiful in his liking for her and in his gentle planning  --  the small house by the creek , the craps in the field . They would go there , he said . First he would help his brother build a barn . This would give him some ready cash . Then he would come back . It would be easy to do , he said . His smile came easily and he walked with a light swinging step . Pressed forward , unpleasantly and not unpleasantly , by the horse , and drawn lightly by the faintly prancing step beside her , she came to the lane that went between her father 's fields . When she left him she went quickly up the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a tangle of dark winter color . Through a wide gate then to the door-yard , and she entered the house . The noon dinner was set on the table in the dining room and the family was assembled there . When her father had murmured a grace she set herself absently to serve herself with food . Abstracted by the walk homeward , she knew presently that Ruby and Lilly were whispering over what she did . They habitually acted together as one creature , each being secret and careful until she had consulted the other . Rhody waked from her musing to know again that the small girls were watching her closely . Her mother was warm from her work in the kitchen where she had helped the black maid prepare the food . When Homer had finished the food on his plate she began to cut a large hot cherry pie and to serve it to the small plates at her elbow . The grandmother sat at her daughter 's right hand . She ate mincingly of the foods , a large woman who fed on but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the father asked . Rhody knew that Nat 's reply would be sufficient , whatever it might be , for he was full of industry and he was her father 's partner in the farm . She gave no attention to the reply nor to the suggestions that followed it . When she attended again Nat was speaking : " And what are you a-doen to-day , Grannie ? " The question was meant for pleasantry , as if her task were lightly held , were thought of as something worth a delicate ridicule . " I 'm a-piecen a quilt , that 's what , " the reply . " Handy enough it 'll be when you marry . " She was a plump old lady with many crumpled wrinkles on her face . A hairy mole on her chin made an emphasis in her talk , for it quivered with her speech , being gay when her speech was gay or standing stiffly out when she pursed her lips in protest or anger . " It 'll come in handy enough when you marry , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house and to half the county . The little girls laid their heads together and whispered over this reply , and Nat was speaking further . All the women over the whole country were piecing together quilts , were making coverlets against some time of bearing . A slack-bearing time , the birth-rate lowered , and they pieced quilts for a generation . The grandmother interrupted him , crying out : " You do n't think so much of it now , young man , but when you marry you 'll be right glad to have a quilt to cover you . I say you 'll be right glad to have a quilt to cover your nakedness . " " Let Rhody have it , " Nat said . " She 'll need the marryen quilt long before I will . Give it to Rhody . " " Is Rhody a-goen to marry right off ? Nobody told me . " She looked from Julie to Rhody , asking again and again . The little girls made their secret comment and Nat said his grandmother would hear something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grandmother kept repeating . Rhody looked toward her mother , wanting assistance . Julie seemed comfortable as she sat back in her place , having served all with the pie which was now well eaten . It seemed a simple thing for her to be married and to be the mother of five children . Herself and the office she held seemed to be one , and Rhody wondered if she would ever be like her mother and if she would ever want to be thus , if she would ever want to be large and placid , coarse and comfortable and hearty . Remembering Kirk as he had ridden away down the road at their parting , it was difficult to see herself as wanting to be any other or as being willing to be as her mother now was . One glance toward her grandmother was met by one brief thought of herself as being like the elder one , and she shrank from this image , rejecting it entirely . Forever is now , she concluded , and never is eternal ; she would not , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cunning and prying , shut out of knowing , crying out now , " Nobody told me ! " " Nobody told me , " a complaint , and Nat looked at Rhody , a direct gaze that ran down a fixed way , as would say to her , " I know what you know . " " Nobody told me , " the old one said again . Rhody turned from both of them . Her mother stood between her and the grandmother , and she had not yet consented to be as her mother . She went from the table feeling slightly bereft when Nat withdrew his secret interest from her . Since Nat had made his surmise and Ruby and Lilly seemed to know something over which they whispered , Rhody told her mother of her plan . It was late afternoon , and they were caring for the milk in the dooryard behind the kitchen . Julie had poured a bit of milk into a pan for the cats , and Rhody , remembering the slow beating of the horse 's feet , timed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it took the milk , speaking quickly to have done quickly : " Kirk is a-goen to rent a piece of the Cooksey land next year . " Her story was well begun , half done , when she had disclosed this interest in what he did . " And we 're a-goen to live in the little red house on the branch . " She went forward quickly . The owner ofthe farm would repair the house and he might , Kirk thought , build another room . " February , and we aim to go there . . . . " She had finished speaking , having asked thus for consent and approval . Each of them carried three crocks of the milk to the cellar before Julie spoke , and then she said : " Tell Nat to carry out now the sour milk . It 's ready for the pigs now in the big jar . " The milk and the swine were little to her , therefore she spoke of them freely . She would speak more carefully of the disclosure after a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the farm . Rhody set the table for supper , walking back and forth from the kitchen . Nat was coming from the stables with the dogs at his heels and Grannie Cummings was thumping about in the dark of the inner room . The little girls were coming from their play in the yard and her father was smoking a pipe by the dining room fire . They were gathering nearer and no comment had yet been made on the secret she had disclosed ; they were gathering near to it to make it solid , to dissect it , to tear it apart , to hold it fast , to shape it or to hate it or to make it into something not yet dreamed of , to take the fact from her and make it thereafter somehow their own . While she waited suspended thus , her mother came near to her , bringing a platter to the table , and she said : " You can take the suit of furniture in your room , Rhody , and I 'll get you up another feather bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I always said . I did n't give it to Vic because she ran off to marry . We 'd better get some extra meat put by  --  hams and bacon for you . Iffen times were not so hard I 'd manage to give you a hundred dollars to buy with , but it 's no use to think . . . " Her voice trailed away into a whisper and she hurried away to bring more food . Rhody 's disclosure had passed rapidly about . All had now come near to it . They were speaking of it while they took their supper . " He 'll make a good , honest , lawahiden man , " Homer said . " It 's more ' n you can say of Joe , Vie 's choice . " " They love each other queer ways , " Ruby said , asking Julie 's consent to speak further , but this was somehow denied . Nat spoke , taking forward the matter . " Whenever I hear them in a rage together fit to knock down and drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear soon after there 'll be another young one . " " Hush , Nat . " " It 's God 's truth . " " When I married , " Julie began . She told of how little she had to begin housekeeping . " It was n't until after Nat came I had a cradle to rock ' em in . I laid Vie at first in a clothes basket . " " I knew what I 'd need when I came and I brought the cradle along , " Nat began . The little girls were confused at these reports , were embarrassed at these accounts of infants and furniture . Their mother had got the cherry table when Rhody came . They could not make a joke of these matters . They shrank together , withdrawn from the comment . Rhody stood at the point of division , on one side of her the small girls , on the other Nat who made a further joke of his mother 's furnishings . Kirk 's absence continued . The frost came on slowly day by day until at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season for butchering the swine . There was a day of preparation . The great scalding kettle was set up in the barnlot and the knives were made sharp . On the following morning the cries of the swine blew up in the still frosty air . Each beast was shot in the fore-head . The cries of the living mingled with the blasts from the gun and made a fearful turmoil which was , nevertheless , soon over . Eight beasts were killed . Then the men were busy scalding the great bodies and cutting open the carcasses . The work went on all day . A part of the meat was being prepared as Rhody 's dower , as food for her in her married life . The work must be finished while the cold lasted and all must be put away to cure before the warmer rains should begin . When Ruby and Lilly were not at school they would look at the work from beyond the fence , for they were not allowed to come near to it . They would look daintily through the bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mouth of the lane , they brought Rhody a letter from Kirk . It was a labored note which told of the work on his brother 's building which had been delayed . He wrote freely of the delays and he feared that he would be gone six weeks because of them . In the end a few lines of romantic endearments and hearty understandings , labored but unembarrassed , and the letter came to an end with a line from a song . Out of these last reports Rhody drew subtle excitements , and she held fast to the words of the song and built into the letter the whole song structure with all its melody and all its lines , and she took thereafter a delighted comfort from the first part of the note when , rereading it , the suggestion of the song lapped back from the end to the beginning . She wrote two letters in reply , each as restrained as Kirk 's had been and each as full of daily labors and delays , of pleasant accounts of what her family did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of preparing the food went forward , hurried now , for the cold might at any day give way to a warm rain . Rhody and the grand-mother were asked to perform together a light part of the labor . They were to search out the dainty bits , sweetbreads and other glands . Two large tubs holding the entrails of the hogs stood outside , near the kitchen door . They worked apart from the others , sitting together beside the tubs . The grandmother would bring the small dainties out of the mass and hold them up so that Rhody might cut them free . The grandmother was pleased at the task . She made at the beginning a frolic of it and settled later to a quiet enjoyment , thrusting her hands deeply into the wet mass to bring up another morsel . She tore the inner portions about in the tub and passed kinds to Rhody who took away the dainty with her sharp knife . She seemed to be hovering on the brink of some revelation . She would look at Rhody quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can go in the house , Grannie , " Rhody said . " I 'll do all by myself , and you can go rest . " The odor of blood had drifted about in the still cold air all day . It arose anew from the tubs into which the hands went . The grandmother did not go from the task . She spread the entrails about , looking for some choice bit or for some wanted tissue . She seemed to be approaching some matter , to be willing to devise relations between themselves and the hog . She would hold parts up to the light . " See , Rhody , " she would say . " Let it go , Grannie . " " I recollect . . . " She would begin a story . Other butcherings were told . And by a swift transition , the bearing of life , the originals of flesh . Blood and life , themselves , stood about in the vats , and their hands were dipped continually into the running mass of flowing entrails . Rhody became sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands food to eat and she talked of cooking it , of serving it on a dish with this or that relish . Pepper and sage would make food of it . Spices from the garden would destroy the animal life and pain , would turn it to food . Mint and sage , sweet savory , on a hot dish , and she told the processes , lingering on the pleasant flavors that would here mingle . But the grandmother prevailed and her relations continued . She would try Rhody 's fortune with the entrails of the hog , she said . She prodded into the wet and bloody mass , muttering . It would be thus and thus , she said . The beast , turned wrongside-out , danced still his life dance , blood having run into pans on the ground . Life sat , as a dismembered bird , in the vat of the entrails , still throbbing within itself . You are thus and thus , the grandmother said . " See , " she said again . " Here ' t is . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform . " Life begins here , " she said , squeezing a clot of blood with her fingers and holding up a small white cell . " It 's not worth half the fuss folks make over it . Here ' t is , here . You can take it between your fingers and squeeze it up in your fist . " " I recollect . . " She would begin a story of mortality , of bloody bearings , the origin of life acting thus alone in a tub of entrails . She leaned over the mass muttering , the mole on her chin beating lightly with the working of her mouth , it uttering jaunty prophecies of blood . For a moment Rhody wanted to push the old one into the tub of quivering intestines , to thrust her forward and downward into the medium of blood and fat . " I 'll tell your fortune , " the voice over the tub muttering . " I do n't want any fortune , " Rhody said . " Young people are fools . " Laughter from the bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " ' It 's so-and-so and so-and-so , ' they say , pretty words and dove-talk . I reckon you think Kirk Brown made the moon . I can show you Kirk in this tub here , right under my fist . " " I do n't want any fortune told , " Rhody began to say . " I 'll show you a fortune , your fortune . " The old hands were slow in the offal but they were quick to find . " I 'll find Kirk for you , here in the tub . See , here . You 'll hear ' im sing and talk sweet right outen this tub . I had my hand on ' im just a little while ago . I 'll show ' im to Rhody , ' I said to myself . " Rhody left the work , sickened as if the meat of the vats had got into her throat . She went away from the yard altogether and when , in her drifting , she came to her room , she stayed there throughout the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard and the house , her step hearty and strong , her voice calling quick replies to the men in the barnlot . Standing disconsolate in her room , looking from the window into the falling twilight , Rhody could not arrange her mother in the world of the vats . Her sickened thought turned away from Kirk . She gathered up the things that pertained to the proposed wedding and thrust them into a chest . The rose quilt had been spread on her bed . She folded it quickly and put it in hiding , hating it and hating the exertion of folding it . The brown spots , drops of blood on the border , lay as three small fruits against the mellowed cloth . Later , when she turned again from the window , she found that she had removed every sign of the wedding from her sight . Sickened anew , she lay in the bed and , lying thus she thought , in jargon , of the quilt which did not now cover her . Her mother had made the quilt in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful and the stitchery was now well blended . Looking now at the remembered quilt , her eyes closed , she saw into the interior of animal flesh and , seeing there , the quilt seemed overnice , unreal , and unnecessary . Her grandmother had opened some shut place and had half revealed some real substance . She was afraid of what she had seen . She wondered if her mother knew and if , knowing , she could still call heartily over her tasks as she went , as now , through the rooms below to make the house ready for the night . Sinking farther into distress , she wondered what it was that troubled her and tried to discover what had become of her former cast of thought and why she no longer wished to remember Kirk . She could not think of him apart from all that her grandmother had said . She began to shake in a chill , and through the quivering of her flesh ran a constant decision . She would not marry in February or at any other time . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lungs . She would be rid of animal life forever . She became more sick and Kirk receded , losing physical actuality and becoming but a pleasantness , a flow of kindness and mirth , put in some remote place . Julie found her and brought a warm blanket to her bed and gave her a hot drink . She had worked out in the cold too long , her mother said , and had caught a chill . She was talking out of her head , her mother told her further , when she cried out her decision . A hand on her brow was feeling for fever , but a voice said that she had none . The flow of her thought seemed entangled with the firm hand on her brow . She shook the hand away and tried to press back the memory of other fingers that went in and out among the severed parts of a beast . The next day the chill had left and she had no influenza . She was pale and tired but no longer ill . She told her mother that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust toward her but she left it unopened . Julie looked blankly at space for a moment after her announcement but she made no argument . " Well , " she said . After a little she spoke again . " We 'll begin to-morrow to cut out the cotton cloth , to make the sheets and towels . The feathers must be aired , and we 'll . . . " Her voice trailed away into faint asthmatic breathings . The order of preparation went forward slowly , Rhody being now without it . She was to herself , apart , in some rude structure which her grandmother had built for her . Looking out as from a narrow doorway she saw pain which must be carried alone , no other wanting it . Obscene pain found a way to go through soft flesh . The year ran slowly toward the dark season when the evening closed early and the nights were longest . " We 'll cut two bolts of the cloth , " Julie said , " the hems to go in by hand on the towels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they talk . . . . Run get me the scissors . After Christmas we 'll begin to put in the hems . " Two miles away , across the farm and over other land , beyond a creek and up again on a rise of rolling ground , her sister Vic lived . Their father had given Vic the land , and the husband , Joe , had built a small house . Rhody wrapped herself in a warm cloak and tied a dull scarf over her head . In her arms she carried a bundle of clothing . She was going to stay with Vic for a few days , and she thought vaguely that if Vic would allow it she might stay for a long while , that she might not go home again . She went out through the gray winterhills , a small dull spot moving through the winter fields . She crossed the creek at a watergap and climbed the rise on the farther side . It was January now . Christmas had come with a high delirium of gifts and feasting and unaccustomed ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days the feast was gone and they were eating the last dry remnants of the turkey that had been carved at first in illusion and passed ceremoniously along the table . The gifts had been accepted and put to use . The days were dark and the evenings long . No sleep could outlast the night . She walked across the fields at midday . Four children played about the floor of Vie 's house or ran a little way into the outside cold . In her eagerness to come , Rhody had forgotten Vic 's way . Now her sister took her bundle kindly and made her welcome , drawing her to the fire . " I reckon you 're about ready to marry , " she said to her . They sat by the open fire until Rhody was warmed and then a drowsiness fell upon her . She did not speak of her decision or of the unopened letter . They talked of Christmas . Under her drowsiness Rhody watched her sister and she looked at her household . The whole of Vic 's maternal affection had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just when the others made known their wants , and she gave what was wanted with a hard justice and pushed the child gently aside . Three small unloved children ran about the floor , having names , wants , cries , laughter . They seemed hearty and self-contained . Rhody remembered what Nat had said of Vic and Joe . " Do you hate Joe ? " Rhody asked . " It 's nobody 's business whe'r I hate or not . " " I notice you cook for him what he mostly likes to eat . " It seemed to her then that the un-loved children had sprung out of the vat , out of the clot of blood squeezed up by her grandmother 's fingers . The children did not quarrel together . They seemed to be of little account or use in the house , mere named creatures wanting food and sleep and play . Their small heads were almost level when they ran about the floor , the baby fending for itself and scarcely knowing the shape of its mother 's lap . Looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you leave Joe ? " " I do n't want to leave . " " Why wo n't he leave you then ? " " He wo n't leave me . Not even when I flirted with George did he leave me . I gave him cause to leave me but he would n't go . " " Did you want him to go ? " " No , I did n't want . But he would n't go just the same . " The air was cold and the children kept indoors . Vic combed her hair neatly and bound it back with a small red ribbon that made her mouth into a scarlet line . When she had put on a neat dress she went to the kitchen to prepare the food . It was always thus . If Joe stayed for a moment to talk with Rhody Vie called him to come to some task . " You are a loafer , ready to blab all day , " she said to him . " Your tongue has got caustic under it . " 1 Vic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knotted brows . Rhody slept in an inner room with the three small children . She would put them to bed at nightfall and they would go immediately to sleep , their dark heads and weather-reddened faces lying in repose against the quilts of the bed as if they were some small inoffensive animals , tamed creatures , that had crept indoors to steal a brief security . There was no security in the place from which they had come . Rhody would lie down beside them . She fitted into the labors of the farm and did her share , and this routine made the time run fast . Joe cut feed for the animals and he cured his dressed meat . He built a small stretch of fence , working all day at the posts . One day he passed near her as she sat on a stile to shell corn for the fowls . She sat high on the stile in the cold air tearing away the grains with quick thumbs . He stopped near to her and he said : " You have n't got the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear what I say ? You come here with your little-girl ways , pretty this and pretty so-and-so . Vic has got a body on her you never saw . You never saw Vic in all your born life . You hear what I say , now . Get down offen the stile and go on inside the house where a woman belongs . Do your work , but keep away from where I am and keep around where Vie is . You 're a pretty enough girl , and I reckon Kirk , he 'll find you out and turn you into a woman . " She did not know what to say to him . He began to talk about Vie 's beauty . She had more style in one finger than many women had altogether , he said . He spoke in anger , as if he would thrust her from the step-block , for he made swift rough gestures . " Get down off there , " he said . " Go on inside the house . " He was quarreling with himself . He told again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find her in the Bible , he said . There was no blemish upon her . " ' How beautiful are thy feet . . The joints of thy thighs are like jewels . . . ' " He quoted the Song imperfectly and he started away toward his fencing . But he came back and thrust an angry hand toward the house , pointing her away . One night she was awakened . It seemed to her that Joe had been locked out of the house . He demanded that Vic should open , but she would not . He labored at one of the windows and finally made his way inside . When Rhody waked again the voices were speaking again in anger . They were crying out something about a gun . Their threats and cries rolled through the small house and , sitting huddled under her blanket , Rhody had begun to think that her presence had given a greater intensity to their troubled interchange . Report of herself as a bride had somehow put a red ribbon on Vie 's hair . There was a jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause for jealous feeling . Vic was insatiable in her demands . Report of herself as a bride had more than adorned Vic 's hair . She could not discover all that was amiss or all that was involved . She locked her door and later she tried to wake one of the children to keep her company , but it would not yield its drowsiness . When the house was quiet she became entirely awake . She resolved swiftly that she would not stay there , that she could not let the morning find her among them . Day would come and Vic would be sullen . She would walk in and out , her lips in one thin red line drawn down scornfully at the corners . Rhody got up from the bed and dressed herself quickly . She unlocked the door , but she did not pass out through it . She climbed through her window and closed the window after her to save the children from the cold . She went through Vie 's farm toward the neighboring fields and crossed these , laboring slowly . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . When the angry cries had called some threat of a gun she had wanted to defend the small children , but after the house had become still she had been intent only on running away , heract having been as sudden as the blast of the gun might have been . She was weeping now . The children were in hazard from some careless gunshot , but she could no longer care for them beyond her pity of them . In a little while after she had crossed the creek she lost her way . She had been thinking again of the storm in Vic 's house . She could not remember on which side the creek lay . Stumbling through rutted ground where hogs had torn up the turf , she walked into dense bushes and fought her way through tangles of low hackberry and thorn . She seemed to be in a jungle of bushes . There was nothing that she could recognize and no step that she could predict or plan . There was no moon , and clouds lay dense overhead . She stood still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had done since she left Vie 's house . For a time she could not remember the creek , but after a while she had a memory of groping slowly along the top of the watergap . The bushes seemed to extend far beyond any briar patch in her father 's pasture . She walked cautiously , afraid now to set her foot forward until she had felt her way . The time seemed very long . A long while had passed now since she had groped over the watergap . She walked slowly about , stooping to feel her way , and she became very tired and very cold . She had ceased to weep , seeing how useless was self-pity , becoming indifferent of trouble and pain in this excess of anguish . She could not clearly restore to mind the image of her mother 's face or reproduce her father 's care and strength . These seemed to be things which were but dimly known , were never otherwise sensed . They were a part of the prettiness of existence , the need now being for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being thus lost , she heard a sudden rough sound which seemed to come from no great distance . She was afraid with a new fear and she crouched low among the bushes . There was a step somewhere not far off and a sound came again , a roughly breathed sound as having some searching or some questioning , or some demand . She placed the sound as on her right , and she turned and crept , bending low among the bushes , going toward the left . She was afraid that the creature of the sound was searching her out , that it moved over the ground with security , that it was coming nearer . After a length of time that seemed of a great duration , while she moved slowly in the direction that would take her away from the noise , her body chilled with cold and her flesh quivering , she heard the snort of a beast not far away , as if a horse had responded to her presence . She went in the direction of the sound , feeling the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the bushes . Presently she came to the beast , so near that she could feel his warmth although she had not yet touched it . She called the name of one of the farm horses , calling , " Sam , woah , Sam , " and she put out her hand to touch . Her fingers fell on his mane and followed the flow of the heavy matted hair , and she found that the animal 's head was bent to crop grass . She took his forelock into her hands and held it fast , and thus she led him a little way into open pasture . In the faint luminosity that came now from the sky she could see his head and his shoulders . The stretch of briary land had come to an end . She held fast to the horse although he seemed intent on the bits of withered turf which he was able to crop and his head was continually bent . Aftera little , as they walked slowly about , she came to a low stump and standing on this she climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden seemed to suggest a duty to the horse , and when she pulled gently at his mane  --  for she had no bridle  --  he left the grass and walked slowly away . He went carefully down through the bushes until he came to an open place which she knew to be a farm road and he turned here and went up the ridge toward the barn . She entered by the kitchen door , which was never locked , and she passed quietly through the lower rooms to mount the stairs in the hall , coming at last to her own bed . The frost was heavy on her cloak and her feet were wet and cold . She was glad to be at home again . The room had been made neat and the Rose of Sharon quilt had been spread on her bed . She undressed herself quickly and entered the warm blankets , letting the quilt cover her . She could hear her mother 's remembered voice as she fell into a dream , a voice speaking of the hemming of the cotton and the linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entering into sleep she knew something for one moment , some bright saying , some wise or true speech , clear and sharp , said briefly and fully . She made one last effort to listen when this speech was uttered , to hear it said in some plain and fully remembered way , but the struggle to have it brought a brief pain of unrest and she let it go , holding nothing , letting all find its own place . At morning , while she still slept , Ruby came to her room and cried out at the sight of her . When she was half awake again Ruby and Lilly were standing over her , and her mother came . She would know that they were there and she would hear some account of herself as if it came a long while after . " When did she come ? " was asked , and " How did she get here ? " " When in all creation did she come ? How ? " She lay in a deep slumber after these questions , hearing nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like I told you , over at Vic 's , " he said . He was not unkind saying it , and she fell into a more deep sleep . Steps came and went beside her bed . They were there or they were gone . " Let her sleep , " they said . " Let her sleep her fill . " Once she heard a slow , pained tread coming nearer , coming down the hallway and through the door , over the carpet . She knew that her grandmother was standing over her bed . She opened her eyes and looked up into her grandmother 's face . " Go on away , Grannie , " she said . She saw a smile come to her grandmother 's mouth and she saw that her lips were ready for speech . She closed her eyes and let sleep shut over her . When she arose , her mind being washed clean by sleep , her body cleansed by rest , the late morning had come . " She 's back now , " they said , but none questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh and play while she dressed herself . They made hidden speeches that were meant to convey half-meanings and they seemed to be secreting some bit , to be holding between them some information which they wished her to suspect . In this behavior they teased her to put on a becoming dress and to pin back her short dark locks . " If you do n't aim to marry , " Lilly said , " you have to be particular about how you go . It 's mostly the not-married that dress up more . " Ruby would cry out , " Why , how-dy-do ! " as if somebody had come . A greeting would be enacted and kisses exchanged . They brought her thedress and teased her to put it on . As if they were maids attiring her for some approach , they laughed over their task and they made her hair neat with a comb and bound it again with the ribbon . Nat had killed a turkey in the barn-lot and when he had made it ready for roasting he brought it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the oven . All laughed over the preparation of the fowl and they would look at Rhody with kind laughter . Ruby and Lilly would sit together on a chair and enact endearments or they would tease Rhody into knowing that they had something hidden between them . After a while she knew that they were hiding Kirk 's letter and that they had opened it and read it . " I would n't put it far apast you two to open a letter writ for somebody else , " she said . She could not be angry , for her body was rested and she was full of pleasantness and good humor . She shared with Ruby and Lilly , keeping apace with their teasing . " I would n't put it far apast . " " I says to Lilly , ' Somebody ought to read it . It 's a love letter , ' I said . " " A girl gets a letter from her beau and nobody reads it . What way is that to keep house ? " Lilly asked . Rhody had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her hands , to claim it , to take it from Ruby 's pocket , to get it from Lilly 's fingers . She was stronger than they but they were two and they were more swift . While she bent Lilly about to seize the letter , it was passed quickly to the other child who had a moment of cruelty come to her out of the brief struggle . She thrust the letter into the kitchen fire . Rhody saw the flames curl slowly about the folded corners of the paper . She made a quick movement to snatch back the letter but it was gone . The turkey was roasting now in the oven and the small girls had run away to play . They were getting the crooked sticks which they used as hockey clubs or they were running swiftly about following the ball over the winter-dried grass . They would call greetings now and then , and Rhody knew that Kirk would come , that he must be near at hand . The third club , the one he used for play , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body gets a letter and wo n't read what 's inside it for three weeks and over , " Lilly said . " Painted white , it is , the little red house , and got a new room alongside the old ones . All sprigged up inside fit for a bride . " " ? Me and you , Rhody , ' that 's what it says in the letter . " Her mother was at the front door . They were standing about in the bright , mild , January sun . " She wants to know when he will come , and never one towel or sheet has she hemmed . She 's befrittered away her time , " Ruby said . Julie looked past her , out over the bright , wan fields , saying : " She 's just like the time when she was a little tinsy tad . The old way is a good way , I always said . Against a girl hems the sheets and seams upthe slips , why then she 's ready to marry . I told her so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vie 's to get ready . " Rhody saw that the household was preparing swiftly now for some coming , but none would tell her of it , and she would not ask further . Her heart seemed to beat pleasantly in her throat and her hands were moist and warm . Julie did not ask any duty of her and so she wandered about among the things that were being prepared . There was no anger in her and the teasing did not bite at her self-love or her pride . in the late afternoon the savors of fresh coffee floated through the house mingled with the richness of roasted fowl and vegetable sauces . The dining table was spread with eight places , they being seven , and the fine nappery had been brought out for use . Seeing how near at hand the feast had come , she put on her cloak and bound her head in a bright scarf , the sun now being near to setting . She went out toward the front of the farm and walked down the lane to the highroad . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
