txt Threatening to follow irresistibly in the wake of its three previous productions , the 1930 edition of the world 's series , which almost from the outset has found the National League moving in swift retreat , developed into something of a complete rout here this afternoon as the Athletics again rolled back the Cardinals to sweep to their second successive triumph . The score was 6 to 1 , the series now stands two games to nothing , and about the only comfort . the Cardinals seemed able to derive from the situation was the fact that for the present , at least , their , torment in Philadelphia has come to an end , for tonight the show with its entire cast moved West for the third game , which will be played in St. Louis on Saturday . There is even a possibility that the Cardinals may be spared the further trouble of returning to Philadelphia inasmuch as the Athletics need only two more victories to bag their second successive world 's championship , the fourth game and the fifth , if necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mississippi . Again Make Good Use of Hits . Combining the wondrrs of their own achievement with the blunders of their bewildered adversaries , the young men whom the 67-yearold Connie Mack so frantically manoeuvres about with a huge scorecard from the depths of his dugout , performed almost as flawlessly on the attack today as they did yesterday . They made only seven hits , but they converted these into six runs and those half-dozen tallies were more than sufficient for the towering George Earnshaw , who pitched his way ' to such a comparatively simple victory that the gathering of 33,000 found it difficult to stifle a yawn . As on the first day , the paid attendance again totaled 32,295 and the receipts again aggregated $152,735 , but unlike the opener , there was scarcely anything of the dramatic about today 's encounter . Stripped of all embellishments , such as the presence of the . President , the spectacle presented little beyond a demonstration in which nine young men displayed such infinite superiority over their opponents that they left the issue settled before the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dour day for Sergeant Gabby Street of the Argonne , who so magnificently piloted his Cardinals into a world 's series , only to find he had plunged himself into a hornet 's nest . When he ordered his men to flank the enemy , the enemy unceremoniously plowed through the middle . And when he charged his men down the centre , the enemy assaulted him on the flank . Gabby 's very first manoeuvre went wrong , when he started Flint Rhem on the mound . Flint entered the fray with high hopes of performing the role of another prodigal returned . Flint used to be the bad boy in the class with the Cardinals , but later mended his ways , though not so very long ago he did absent himself from school for a period of twenty-four hours , to return with an imaginative tale of having been kidnapped . This afternoon it is not at all unlikely that the good Gabby Street would not have minded it a bit had some one kindly " kidnapped " Rhem again , for inside of four innings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A home run that whistled off the bat of Mickey Cochrane started the Mack charge in the very first inning and then by scoring two runs in the first , two in the third and two in the fourth , they contrived to put themselves so far in the lead that it was almost impossible to make out what the Cardinals were trying to do . Curiously enough , the Cardinals also opened their day 's attack with a home run , a fine blast by George Watkins that sailed over the right field wall in the second inning , but it turned out to be the only St. Louis blast of the day . All Runs Scored Off Rhem . Still another curious feature of the encounter , and one that caused the good Gabby some painful reflections ? tonight , was the fact that the Athletics made all of their seven hits and six runs during the interval that Rhem occupied the mound . For after - Rhem the good Gabby made two more pitching selections and both proved excellent . The first of these was Jimmy Lindsey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth and pitched right on through the sixth to hold the Mackmen hitless and runless . Then , with the removal of Lindsey for a pinch hitter in the seventh , who , incidentally , struck out , Sylvester Johnson came on the scene to hurl two more hitless and runless innings . Of course , this all may have been a part of the sagacious Connie Mack 's general scheme of highly developed efficiency . In the first game , it will be recalled , the Athletics made five hits to score five runs . Today they used seven hits to drive in six runs , and as these proved more than sufficient it is quite possible that the conserving habits of Mr. Mack demanded that no more hits need be wasted . Pitching Efforts Are Wasted . At all events , the Athletics got no more hits or runs after the disappearance of Mr. Rhem . But the superb efforts of Lindsey and Johnson were wasted . As for the crowd , It sat through most of this in a profound silence , which might have been inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or simply nduced by an overpowering feeling of drowsiness . It was bright and sunny and considerably warmer than yesterday , which was further conducive to sleep , which most of the gathering unmistakably seemed to do after Jimmy Dykes had larruped the Mackmen 's final two tallies across the Plate with a blistering double that brought about the immediate retirement of Rhem . Along about the seventh inning the crowd bestirred itself long enough to rise for the traditional seventh-inning stretch and a uniformed group of musicians further enlivened matters by popping out of a runway In the upper tier and rending the air with the doleful notes of " The St. Louis Blues . " This produced no end of merry laughter in the stands . but out on the field the luckless Cardinals fairly boiled in a rage . /them Retires Two Men . For a few fleeting moments Rhem promised to make an auspicious start . He retired Bishop , the first batter , on an easy fly to centre field and Sparky Adams lent him a helping hand by making a sparkling stop and throw on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third base . But then came Mickey Cochrane and trouble for Rhem . Mickey , it will be remembered . had finished off the Mack attack the day before by thumping a home run over the rightfield fence . The sensation evidently pleased him immensely , for he . at once - smashed another one over the barrier ; on his first time up today-to produce another great scramble - for the ball in the street bordering the park . The blow also seemed to scramble Rhem rather severely . for Simmons drove a single to centre and a few seconds later Jimmy Foxx pounded a double to left centre and Simmons raced over the plate with the second tally of the inning . And so it went  --  Cochrane , Simmons and Foxx . Stop these three , some able critic recently remarked , and you can stop the Athletics . It is an ingenious idea , but still in a decidedly embryonic stage . Certain it is that Rhem never came even close to solving the problem . Came a brief pause as Ahem made his way with satisfactory results through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the third , Flint encountered further difficulty when the Cardinals ' shining star and field captain , Frank Frisch , committed an error . Frisch Fumbles Grounder . Frisch fumbled Cochrane 's grounder that should have provided the third out . Instead , it merely put Mickey on first base and again Rhem had Simmons to deal with . Simmons propelled a two-base hit into right that drove in Cochrane and after Foxx had been cautiously passed by Rhem , as the better part of valor , Bing Miller sent a single into left field that scored Simmons . Then came the fourth and the swift and certain finish of Rhem . Boley took a turn at opening this particular Mack drive by bouncing a single off Gelbert , and after Earnshaw had , politely struck out , Bishop walked . In the Cardinal dugout there again appeared to be considerable uneasiness and even more indecision . It is quite possible that at this moment the good Gabby was muttering to himself , " Will I take him out , or let him stay a while ? " Dykes settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all by lacing a two-bagger off the left : field wall , and even before both Boley and Bishop had crossed the plate Rhem already was on his way to the cooling showers . Real Pitching Too Late . Then , at this very late hour , the Cardinale suddenly produced some real pitching as first Lindsey and later Johnson came on the hill . Lindsey brought the Mack drive is the fourth to an abrupt end as Cochrane banged into a double play and then went on to efface the next six Mackmen to face him . Johnson did almost as well . But for the Athletics there was a man pitching with a powerful right arm and a stout heart who seemed certain of his ground the moment his comrades had sent him away to a two-run lead in the opening inning . Earnshaw , in fact , seemed to move along with scarcely an effort as he held the Cardinals to six hits , fanned eight and passed only one . ith two out in the first inning , Frisch , the indomitable , crashed a two-bagger to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , which blow , incidentally , put the erstwhile Fordham Flash in possession of a new world 's series record for total hits . But it brought no immediate relief to the Cardinals for ) 3ottomley , destined to have another thoroughly impotent day with . the bat , ended the inning with a soft fly to Haas in centre . In the second Inning Watkins momentarily put the Cards in the running with a prodigious slam over the right field barrier after Hafey had been retired for the first out . The Cardinals for a few fleeting- moments even threatened to carry the attack further , for Mancuso bounced a single to short and Gelbert drove another one-baser into centre field to advance Mancuso to third . Earnshaw Settles Down . But here the stalwart right arm of Earnshaw brought the matter to an impasse . He fanned Rhem and retired Douthit on an infield pop fly that Bishop caught without the slightest exertion . And so ended the final thrust against Earnshaw , who , even when the Mackmen interrupted their otherwise flawless play by committing two errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poise . These two oversights came in the third inning . The first came as Frisch , with Adams already out of the way , got to first base when Boley fumbled his sharp grounder . Then , while Bottomley was swinging with great fervor but eventually striking out , Frisch , lumbago and all , stole second and whirled on to third when Cochrane 's throw , went wide of its mark and sailed into the outfield , but there the Flash . remained while . Hafey allowed himself to be called out on strikes . After that came only two more hits , both singles , off Earnshaw . The surprising Mr. Lindsey got one of these in the fifth , though this somehow did not inspire , sufficient confidence in Manager Street to permit Mr. Lindsey to bat for himself again in the seventh . Instead , he sent George Fisher to the bat and George properly struck out . Frisch Bobbed of Hit . The concluding hit flew off Sparky Adams 's bat in the eighth . Frisch almost followed it with another as he lined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , snared the ball and then , with a snap throw across the diamond to Foxx , doubled the astonished Adams off first base . From then on Earnshaw moved rapidly on to the end of his task , finishing with a grand flourish to fan Watkins and Mancuso for the final two outs . /Yin ** , " 1 P So ended another chapter - Ora form of competition that is ' turning into a procession of victories- for the American League . Since the - Cardinals of 1926 conquered the Yankees that year fifteen world 's series games have been played , and of that number the National League thus far has contrived to win exactly one .
