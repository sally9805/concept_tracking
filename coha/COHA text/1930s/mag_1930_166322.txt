" I believe I am the creator of the sobriquet ' Tiger ' with a capital ' T ' as applied to M. Clmenceau. " said Editor Emile Bur of the Paris daily L'Avenor last week . " I am proud of the achievement ! It will perhaps furnish the only chisel ever likely to cut my name in the granite of History . " <P> Pressed for details , Editor Bur reminisced : " As far as I can recall , the incident took place in 1904 . Clemenceau was then director of L'Aurore , and I was one of his editors . The caustic political sheet Le Gil Bias , which Mortier directed , published one day a very sarcastic attack on Clmenceau in which his character was described as being ' fierce as that of a tiger . ' <P> " Mortier wrote ' tiger ' with a small ' t , ' and he used it simply as a comparison , not as a nickname . He wanted to be abusive , just as if you had called someone a pig or a toad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some days after that whenever M. Clmenceau would arrive in the morning , I would say : ' Here comes the " Tiger . " ' It gradually became a nickname to those of us who loved him , and little by little we always spoke of le patron ( ' the boss ' ) as Le Tigre . <P> " Soon the name spread beyond our editorial room and Dollfuss inserted a brief item in the Cri de Paris . It was soon adopted universally . It was a fit name . It indicated the delight M. Clmenceau took in getting his claws into an enemy and holding on while the other writhed in pain .
