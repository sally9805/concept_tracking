txt GIVING PUBLIC WHAT IT WANTS AtLLED A FALLACIOUS POLICY A recent correspondent in your columns made severe , and deserved , strictures upon the prevalent abuse of broadcasting by advertisers . This criticism is more widespread than the radio authorities seem to realize . I was interested to hear a vote taken , a few evenings ago , in a company of intelligent adults , when it developed that every person present had assured himself that he would never . under any circumstances , buy the dentifice that overloads a certain popular entertainment feature with its sales talks . More important vet is the slump in the quality of features put on the air by advertisers . On this point your readers may be interested in some recent remarks by Sir John 1 , C. W. Reith , the director of the British Broadcasting Company . As is. generally known , British broadcasting is controlled by the govern- , msnt and sustained by a yearly tax of ten shillings on every receiving set . Sir John and his associates are left with full discretion as to programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , and listened to the radio , will agree that the level of entertainment and information is far above that to be heard in any other part of the world . Said Sir John  --  who , by the way , made for himself an enviable reputation , as a personality and as a public speaker , during the war years when he served his government in America in munitions work , after having been wounded in France  --  in a recent ad-dress : . " Broadcasting should be conducted as a public service and nothing else . I do not admit that it is necessary to have personal gain as an incentive to endeavor , and I regard the ? presence of commercial motive in any form as most undesirable . " My second point is that service should be under central unified control , . and in this connection I do not *admit that it is necessary to have the element of competition as an incentive to endeavor either . Third , the service should be established under the auspices of the State but certainly not be conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this country are , I consider . exactly what is required , and incidentally they are applicable to many other forms of public utility . services . A fourth point which must be mentioned is the necessity for adequate finance , either through a licensing system or in some other way , so that the authority . may not need to have recourse to methods of raising the necessary revenue which must inevitably compromise more.or less the principle of public service . I allude , of course , to the inclusion of ad'vertis'ing matter , whatever form it may take . If the service is to be run for the benefit of the people it can not be at the mercy of those who are in a position to provide programs for their own particular purposes , and without whose money the service can not be maintained . The ether should not be put at the power of money . * * * I am as certain of this as of anything , that to set out to " give the public what it wants , " as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving almost always an underestimate of the public 's intelligence and a continual lowering of standard . Thus , paradoxically , it turns out to be not the monopoly system but the competitive system that is obliged to play for safety . On the contrary , it is not insistent autocracy but wisdom that suggests the policy of prosecuting carefully and persistently a basis of giving people what you believe they should like and will come to like , granting , of course , discretion and human understanding on the part of those who carry out the policy  --  and resolution . In order to eliminate any conceivable excuse for misunderstanding in any quarter , let me put it more plainly thus : The best way to give the public what it wants is to reject the express policy of giving the public what it wants . Or simpler still , if you set out to give the public what it wants you wo n't do it . WILLIAM T. ELLIS . Swathmore , Pa. , April 1 , 1931.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
