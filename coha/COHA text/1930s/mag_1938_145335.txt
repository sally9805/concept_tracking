Encyclopedia Britannica of the music world is the late Sir George Grove 's five-volume Dictionary of Music and Musicians . Every 20 years or so the learned editors of Sir George 's brain child rack their teeming brains and bring forth a new edition . Between these monumental foalings there is spawned a smaller fry of musical dictionaries and encyclopedias , offering fresher if skimpier information at more modest prices . For these , the 1938 birth rate has been the highest in years . <P> In the past two months , three one-volume music dictionaries have seen the light . First to be delivered , the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians* was proudly fathered by Albert E. Wier with the collaboration of a 14-man editorial staff . A bouncing , 8-lb. infant , Wier 's Encyclopedia made a few natural messes ( misplaced Composer Robert Schumann , killed off very-much-alive Soprano Claire Dux ) , but otherwise bawled informatively along through 2,089 pages . In any ordinary year Editor Wier 's weighty off spring might have taken first prize . But this week another lusty 8-lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + was brought forth by portly Oscar Thompson . Editor Thompson , who had groaned for two and a half gravid years under the weight of his lexicographic burden , had been helped over the bumps by nearly a hundred of today 's leading musical experts , all of whom wrote special articles for it . With check lists of the works of every important composer , condensed plots of 213 operas , more than 50,000 biographies and definitions , Editor Thompson 's Cyclopedia proved one of the most fact-stuffed volumes of its kind ever to appear in English . <P> Niftiest and most readable of the new dictionaries* was produced by grey-haired Percy Alfred Scholes , onetime London critic and most prolific of all contemporary English writers on music . Unlike Editors Wier and Thompson , Author Scholes wanted no help with his dictionary , hid himself away in the Swiss Alps , where he labored for more than six years in an isolated house crammed with books and files . There , working from 8 a. m. to 10 p. m. , day after day , intrepid Lexicographer Scholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he had finished , he had covered 132 acres of paper weighing ten tons . Scholarly Scholes 's one-man Companion had one ingredient that made it unique among music dictionaries : charm . Only half the size of the two U. S. dictionaries , it is a masterpiece of condensation and cross-referencing , is beautifully illustrated . <P> *Macmillan ( $10 ) . <P> + Dodd , Mead &; Co.
