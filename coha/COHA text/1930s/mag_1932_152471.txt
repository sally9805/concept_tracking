" <P> While the Government toyed with Windmiller Honnef 's proposition , nearly six million Germans were drawing a dole of $13 per week . At Waltershausen , when efforts were made to apply a recent dole reduction of 10% , furious dole-drawers rioted , wounded seven policemen . Police fired on the mob , killed two , wounded twelve , restored order .
