Scandals of New York ( Cont 'd ) <P> After a year of skunk-flushing in New York City 's political woods , Counsel Samuel Seabury of the Legislature 's investigation into municipal corruption last week bayed resoundingly on the trail of a fox . Never before had the chase come so close to slick little Mayor James John ( " Jimmy " ) Walker . <P> Inquisitor Seabury first gave tongue last fortnight by revealing that the Mayor had been given $26,535 worth of bonds by a broker whom he had seen only once before but for whom it was in the Mayor 's power to do a potent favor . The broker 's name was Joseph A. Sisto . His firm issued the securities of Parmelee Transportation Co. which owns the city 's biggest taxi fleet ( 2,300 cars ) . Broker Sisto met the Mayor at Atlantic City in the summer of 1929 . The following autumn he sent his gift , made " in admiration , " around to the City Hall . Later he spoke to the Mayor of the need of municipal taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next April Mayor Walker ordered an investigation , the next year pushed through legislation creating a Board of Taxicab Control . <P> The Sisto revelation brought no immediate surge of public indignation against foxy Mayor Walker . The news of his bonds was juxtaposed with news of his Beer Parade , and pure chance sent also the discovery of the Lindbergh baby 's corpse . Besides , the New York public had waited months for the Mayor 's turn to come in an inquiry of which everyone realized the prosecution was as political as the defense . The public seemed interested not so much in what Mayor Walker had done-$26,535 seemed small potatoes indeed for a man of his parts-as in if and how he would elude punishment . After Inquisitor Seabury had further showed last week that the promoters of a bus company had bought Mayor Walker a $10,000 letter of credit , later extended by $3,000 , for his junket to Europe in 1927 , the chase approached its most exciting stage-Mayor Walker on the stand in his own defense . <P> In preparation for the Mayor 's testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator John A. Hastings , a well-fed , acquisitive young Brocklynite who fought a losing battle all the way to the Court of Appeals to escape testifying . Seven years ago , aged 25 , John A. Hastings was in the New York Senate when James J. Walker resolved to spring from that body into the New York mayoralty , " third biggest job in the U. S. " Clever and obliging , Senator Hastings made himself indispensable to Senator Walker , has stayed close to him ever since . As public men must if they are going to do private business on the side , Mayor Walker retained a financial agent , one Russell T. Sherwood , who left Manhattan early in the Seabury investigation . In his absence , and in the absence of the Mayor 's business records , the doings and dealings of Senator Hastings seemed the next best clues to what fun-loving Mayor Walker might have been doing for a living .
