 | he Rediscovery of Man Condensed from the book of the same title by Henry C. Link , Ph.D . Director of the Psychological Service Center , New York City ; author of " The Return to Religion " AMERICANS today are in danger of accepting a philosophy defeat . It is widely believed that the individual is a victim of forces beyond his control ; that his makeup and abilities are determined by heredity ; that his happiness is dependent upon conditions outside himself ; in short , that he is anything but the master of his fate or the captain of his soul . The sciences have contributed toward this defeatism . Biology has described man as an organism whose behavior is determined by heredity and the functioning of glands . Evolution portrays him as little more than a monkey . The psychoanalysts maintain that he is controlled by his unconscious mind . This concept of man as the puppet of circumstance reaches its climax in contemporary social science , which portrays men and women as the victims of their environrnent , helpless in the clutches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by some wholesale mechanistic device such as substituting a planned economy for a free economy , or socialism for democracy , or communism for capitalism , can the majority of men achieve the abundant life . Thus we have created a complex system of ideas which , instead of helping mankind , threatens to kill the very civilization which has produced it . Pseudo-scientific the- ' j ories have filled our vocabulary with recipes for defeat . Constantly we hear such statements as , " Personality is something you either have or do n't have , " or " I suffer from an inferiority complex . " These and similar common remarks reflect the prevailing view that the individual is a helpless creature controlled by outside forces . Yet psychologists are finding that this theory is fundamentally untrue . To me , the most interesting thing about recent psychological studies is the rediscovery of man and the powers of which he is capable when his mind has been freed from fallacies about himself . We need to distinguish between social security and personal security . Social security represents some-thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is some-  | thing the individual does for himself . Social security consists largely of things and money given to the individual . Personal security consists of habits and skills which the individual develops for himself and which enable him to be self-sufficient and independent under almost any conditions . Man is still the potential creator rather than the victim of his creations . He is a creature of free will and untold possibilities , not the slave of environment . His capabilities are limited not so much by heredity or poverty as by his own vision of himself . Personality , for example - so important an element in making friends , getting and holding a job , and other aspects of successful living - is not an accidental gift but an achievement. * We may define personality as the extent to which the individual has developed habits and skills which interest and serve other people . For example , nation-wide studies which we have made show that children who receive an allowance from their parents as a matter of course tend to have weaker personalities than do children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace , making beds , and other family chores . Young people who sell magazines or who obtain jobs from the neighbors , or who work to earn money ( luring summer vacations , we find , tend to have stronger personalities than those who do not . The importance of such activities lies not in the rewards or money received but in the habits and attitudes which they develop . These habits are such as to transform the character of an individual from that of a sponge to that of a giver , from being only a consumer to being also a producer . In short , they develop personality . " What shall America do for its youth ? " was the subject for discussion in one of New York City 's famous forums not long ago . After some discussion in which speakers had urged provisions for a free college education , subsidies to make possible earlier marriage , the guarantee of interesting jobs with self-supporting wages , and similar arrangements , one young woman remarked : " It seems to me that our subject What shall America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What shall our youth do for America and for themselves ? ' America is already doing more for its youth than any nation in the world , probably far too much . Is n't it time for the youth of America to rebel against the gim me idea and consider instead ways of giving ? " From the point of view of developing personalities , that criticism was entirely sound . As for the inferiority complex , I often wish that the term had never been coined , because then there would be one less manufactured idea for people to fear . A sense of inferiority is not a disease which  | mysteriously overtakes a person and renders him helpless . On the contrary , it can be of real value , for the person who recognizes his inferiority , and then does something about it , develops superiority . The dynamics of acquiring superiority in any field may be illus -- trated by the process of learning how to dive . The individual gets himself beautifully poised , leans forward , and at the last moment hesitates and draws back in fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in angry desperation , he plunges in with a terrible flop . He comes up chagrined and embarrassed . The comments of the spectators make him feel even worse . If , at this point , his fears prevent him from making further attempts , he never learns to dive and his fear becomes insurmountable . If , however , he persists and continues to make awkward and painful dives , he will finally go in smoothly and come up feeling pleased . His friends will compliment his form and he will have made one more conquest of himself and his environment . Whether in diving or in any other phase of life , this is the basic psychology in the development of personality and superiority . Again and again the individual must plunge into the stream of life , at this point and at that , in order to develop effective skills . The person who does only what he likes to do , who avoids embarrassing or painful situations , develops the habits of inferiority rather than those of superiority . Here we see the difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand are those who are inferior and either refuse to recognize their faults or believe there is nothing they can do about them . Since these people will not take steps to im prove themselves , they often want to reform the entire social system . They can not see that in any scheme of life whatever , they would probably be misfits unless they changed themselves . On the other hand are those people who believe they can develop their personalities and achieve competence and superiority . These are the people who , after the shouting and shooting are over , sustain any form of society , whether it be democracy or communism . The tragedy is that for several years our civilization has permitted people to believe in their own helplessness and , worse still , encour aged the avoidance of personal responsibility in public affairs . Individuals say : " Let the city and state take care of social evils . " Or , " Let the federal government guarantee jobs for all . " The belief that people can achieve social security by voting for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jobs do not exist by right or by principle , but only as effective personalities create them . They can not be made artificially by business at large no ,  | guaranteed by labor unions . Not even a government can create jobs for long except under certain conditions . In a dictatorship or under fascism , jobs can be given to every worker . But then the workers become the slaves of the state . They must take the jobs assigned them , together , with the hours , conditions , and wages which go with them . In a democracy of free individuals , this freedom also involves the responsibility of creating jobs . Every individual must contribute to this process . A nation which encourages its citizens to wait for jobs to which they have a right will find its population increasingly unfit either to get or to hold jobs . The true concept of man as an individual capable of triumph over himself and his environment has survived in religion , in the discoveries of psychology , and in fiction . Probably ten million people have read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained forever the master of her world rather than its victim . Neither war , nor disappointment in love , nor scandal , nor starvation could daunt her spirit . She emerged with courage unimpaired . To millions suffering the comparative luxuries of a depression today , she exemplified a personal triumph over social insecurity . Psychologists know that most people are potentially as self-reliant as Scarlett O'Hara . Before it is too late , Americans must realize the psychological truth that the difference between success and failure is essentially a matter of philosophies . A philosophy of defeat makes failure inevitable even with the most richly endowed person ; a philosophy of success , a determination to make the most of oneself , can do miracles even with one poorly endowed . A great astronomer once remarked to a friend : " To the astronomer , man is an infinitesimal dot in an infinite universe . " " Ah ! " said his friend , " but man is still the astronomer . " That reply illustrates a great truth : the individual is the only foundation on which any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
