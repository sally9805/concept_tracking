txt That many countries in Europe are almost willing to accept the 40-hour working week is now apparent ; but it is necessary to take note of the Inconveniences of stepping out ahead of the chief producing countries . The United States is somewhat a law unto itself ; but France , In Its enthusiasm for social progress , did not wait for general accord at the International Labor Office in Geneva , with the result that its producing costs have risen in spite of devaluation . The problem of adjustment has now to be faced . There is no intention of going back on the legislation of the Front Populaire ; but merely of adapting it to circumstances . The 40-hour week was not originally meant to mean a five-day week ; and the question of whether there should be a total stoppage of work for two full days every week has come up for reconsideration .

The decision results from the demand made nearly a month ago by the Civil Service Union demanding a special bonus of 150 francs monthly for each worker to compensate for the abnormally rapid increase in living costs in France since January , 1938. when the Popular Front Government took office and instituted a series of costly social reforms , followed by the devaluation of the franc . The official index on the cost of living for a typical French family of the laboring class which stood at 461 in Juno a year ago reached 6421 In September this year and now has I considerably surpassed that figure . State employees and millions of holders o ? war pensions have been the hardest hit by the rising prices since they were not included in salary increases which followed widespread sit-down strikes in the summer of 1938 .

There has since been a further increase of 11 per cent . whereas there is a general fall in world pi ices . The weaknesS of the franc  --  now synth about one-tenth of the prewar franc  --  is largely due to the adverse commercial balance . France is buying too much from abroad , and selling too little . In other words , France Is not producing enough . That is the crucial problem , and it is perceived by all responsible French politicians . Blum Sees Need of Change M.

It is natural that there should be suspicion of the reactionary designs of the employers , and that reluctance should be shown to accept even the conclusions of a commission of inquiry But the problem which faces France has Indeed been correctly put for the first time . The Front Populaire set out to Improve the lot of the French worker . It should be applauded . But it must be evident that no class can be prosperous unless there is general prosperity . The task is to provide the necessary economia basis for reforms . It is useless to increase wages if . there is to be devaluation and an increase of prices in consequence of underproduction , at a cost which is too high . This is not peculiarly a French subject .

Strike Danger Averted The sum of 1,380,000,000 francs which the Government has now decided to devote to raising the pay of state functionaries and pensioners is insufficient to cover the 150 francs monthly bonus demanded by the unions . Since , however , it represents almost the entire paper surplus of next year 's budget , it is not likely to be increased and officials hope that union leaders would accept the compromise and thus avert the threat of a general strike by all public service employees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rer cent jump in a little more than a year has given rise to renewed demands on the part of labor for a " sliding scale " system of pay which already exists in some French industries , such as the press .
