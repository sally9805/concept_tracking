On Aug. 1 , 1838 , young Queen Victoria , having ruled England for a year , stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with a proclamation . " Because the slaves of Jamaica are impatient for freedom , " she read in a thin young voice , " we proclaim them free ; and 100 years from this day the plantations of Jamaica shall be divided into small pieces , and each descendant of these freedmen shall be given a small piece . " The crowd cheered ; the more enthusiastic abolitionists threw their hats in the air . <P> So , at any rate , believe the plantation Negroes of Jamaica . British officials in Kingston last month had posters put up throughout the island saying that Queen Victoria never did anything of the kind , but the Negroes went on buying barbed wire to put round their little pieces of land . Last week the British colony , faced with the job of explaining that no plantations were going to be divided , were ready for trouble . <P> There have been nearly as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1831 the slaves revolted ; in 1865 , finding serfdom no better than slavery , they revolted again . Both revolts were put down , with hanging and shooting . Life has not improved much since 1865 for the 1,000.000 Jamaica Negroes . Lately they have not been able to get work in other islands of the West Indies . A good weekly wage for a field hand on a banana plantation is $3 . Year ago there was a boatmen 's strike in Montego Bay . Since then , Jamaica has been simmering like coffee in a percolator . Last winter cane-cutters on the sugar plantations at the east end of the island refused to work . The strike spread down the railroad to Kingston . Longshoremen , street cleaners , tobacco workers , bus drivers , lamp-lighters struck at once . Police were jittery , fired on crowds in the streets . The strikes were won , but some dozen Negroes were killed . For five months there were quick daily strikes on plantations . <P> One day last week the British cruiser Orion was anchored in Kingston Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner with riot guns and tear gas . At the end of the day 52 people had been killed , some 70 more badly injured-but not in fighting . The front engine of a five-car , two-engine train on the Jamaica Central Railway , packed with Kingston citizens going to the country for the Liberation Day weekend , left the rails going up a steep grade outside Balaclava . The rear engine kept going , pushed the front engine over an embankment , piled four of the five coaches up on each other in a splintered , twisted mass like a smashed accordion . The coaches lay crumpled for hours in a river bed till cranes could be got into the mountains . Most of the injured were expected to die . It was the deadliest train wreck in West Indies ' history . <P> First thing that occurred to the British was sabotage . But the theory was too easy : no Negro was likely to kill a hundred other Negroes to get a train wrecked . At week 's end , as investigations started , it appeared that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Liberation Day passed peacefully , without a rising .
