In the past 16 years , 50 new saints-a record-have been canonized by Pope Pius XI , who has notably speeded up the process , which formerly took from 25 years to several centuries . One candidacy for sainthood which has moved rapidly is that of Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini , an Italian-born U. S. citizen who founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus , died in Chicago in 1917 ( TIME , Nov. 8 , et ante- ) . Last month the Sacred Congregation of Rites decreed that Mother Cabrini be beatified and called " Blessed " in St. Peter 's in Rome next November-the last step before full sainthood . Two miracles , performed since her death and by her intervention , have already been attested . If subsequently two more miracles are performed , Mother Cabrini may well become the first U. S. citizen-saint . <P> In every beatification there is a " Devil 's Advocate . " Last week the Devil 's Advocate in Mother Cabrini 's case arrived in Manhattan . He was Monsignor Salvatore Natucci of the Sacred Congregation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scrutinize evidence with pious skepticism , advance every possible argument against beatification or canonization . <P> Last week Devil 's Advocate Natucci journeyed to a Manhattan Catholic high school named for Mother Cabrini . In a coffin in the chapel-crypt lay her body , removed there from a cemetery five years ago after being identified and reported " well-preserved " - an aid but not an essential to beatification . Last week Monsignor Natucci , his entourage and a few necessary witnesses beheld a second exhumation of Mother Cabrini . At some secret later time , the Devil 's Advocate was to sever from the body a limb ( which limb would not be revealed ) - a " first-class " relic which he would take to Rome for use in the beatification ceremonies. * <P> *First-class relics are parts of the body ; second-class , clothing which the saint wore ; third-class , anything the saint used or touched . Where relics are known to exist , any church , religious community or pious person may apply for one , usually obtaining a second-class relic .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
