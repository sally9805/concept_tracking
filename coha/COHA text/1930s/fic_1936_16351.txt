1 . FADE IN : LE COUVENT DE STE . CECILE MAIN TITLES On the facade , the name of the convent in French is plainly seen . ( NOTE : The entire prologue should be grey and almost colorless as to sets and costumes , for contrast when we get into the desert . Really , the only touch of color is the cheap painting on the wall which in itself should be more the picture-postcard type of color. ) 2 . INT . RECREATION ROOM OF CONVENT It is a grey , dark day , with rain seen through the windows . Several girls are playing in the center of the room , one or two are seated quietly in nooks in the large wall reading , and there are one or two groups talking very seriously over the day 's work . Two Sisters of the convent move quietly amongst the pupils .

( calling smartly ) Hadj ! 29 The dull-faced Hadj comes into the scene - begins to pick up the bags - Domini pointing out which are hers - and during the following speech Batouch accents each point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumbly nodding agreement to every insult , imagining they are compliments . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( with calm superiority and fun - to Domini ) This is my cousin , Hadj . He 's no poet . He 's a very stupid fellow . He ca n't speak English . He does n't know north from south . . . he gets lost in broad daylight . Furthermore , Madame - he 's a swine . At this point Domini starts to reach down to move Boris ' green bag out of her way . &nbsp; DOMINI ( to Batouch ) This is not mine . 29A RETAKE : INT . TRAIN CARRIAGE ( at station Beni-Mora ) CLOSEUP BORIS As he rises from his seat and looks around the compartment for his bag . He looks off scene at Domini on the platform - his bag resting beside her , and is covered with confusion - not knowing what to do . CUT TO L.S. his exit from train , as shot . 30 .

She smiles then in amusement .  --  27  --  32 . BACK TO SCENE Boris , embarrassed , turns abruptly and strides off with his bag . Domini looks after him , then turns to Batouch. 33 &nbsp; DOMINIWhat an extraordinary man ! Is he mad ? &nbsp; BATOUCHYes , he 's undoubtedly English . Domini flashes him a look . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( dissembling quickly ) Oh , no , no , Madame ! Do n't misunderstand  --  I love the English . The English are very rich , very generous . &nbsp; DOMINI ( with calm amusement at his cupidity ) I 'm not English . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( quickly - with large unction ) Oh , but of course not ! Madame is too attractive ! ( takes a step to move off ) Shall we go to the hotel ? 34 As Domini starts to walk off with him , she tilts her eyes upward in tolerant amusement , and we DISSOLVE TO : Section Details 35 . EXTERIOR SQUARE AT END @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is moving from the little church and coming to the entrance of the mimosa tunnel , as Domini , Batouch and Hadj emerge . 36 Domini halts Batouch and Hadj with a look - hands Batouch her small bag , so as to be rid of it , goes to the priest . Father Roubier welcomes her kindly &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIERMadame - welcome to Beni-Mora . &nbsp; DOMINIThank you , Father . 37 . CLOSE SHOT BATOUCH AND HADJ Batouch turns with the handbag and piles it on the already over-burdened Hadj. 38 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI AND FATHER ROUBIER &nbsp; DOMINIMother Josephine says I must write her exactly how you are .  --  28  --  &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIER ( with an amused twinkle ) She has demanded that I do the same about you . 39 The priest 's little dog nuzzles at Domini 's feet , looking up at her expectantly . 40 &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIER ( smiling ) My companion , Bous-Bous . He , too , has his faith . Alas , it is only in me . ( NOTE : The final s'es are pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drawn to the priest ) I am sure his trust is n't misplaced , Father . &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIER ( simply , pleased ) Thank you , child . Batouch and Hadj are crossing the back of the scene . 41 &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIER ( genially - kiddingly ) Batouch ! ( as Batouch comes forward smiling ) There was a great disturbance in the street of the Ouleds last night . Someone was carried away by the police . Was it you ? &nbsp; BATOUCH ( protestingly )  --  Carried away by the police ? Oh , no , no ! It must have been Hadj here . Wherever there 's trouble  --  there 's Hadj in the midst of it . He 's not only a swine , Madame , he 's also a fool  --  Is n't it so , Hadj ? ( Hadj nods dumbly in agreement ) You see ! ( He darts a look at Domini and goes on ) Father Roubier and Domini are both amused . He has lightened her mood - which was his aim . 42 &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIERMy church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure you would n't exchange it for a great cathedral . &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIER ( smiles and shakes hands with her ) I 'm afraid I would n't . DISSOLVE TO :  --  29  --  43 . THE STREET AND SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL Across the square from the hotel is the little church and not far from it is the Minaret . It should be beautiful and at the same time peaceful , the sounds of the Square blending in with the surroundings . A PAN SHOT of the people ; and the color in the square reveals silhouetted against a lighted window a young blind Arabian beggar led by a negro girl slave . A love song sung off-scene nearby , by an Arab , grows in volume - becomes clear and magic . 44 THE CAMERA SWINGS UP TO THE VERANDAH OF THE HOTEL . Domini stands there looking out at the African evening . Her face expresses her hunger and yearning and more hope than we have seen - and she is lost in the beauty of the evening and the song . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . He is carrying a flower basket , and his arms are full of colorful flowers from the garden . He goes along without stopping until Domini turns to him : 45 &nbsp; DOMINIThat song  --  what does it say ? &nbsp; OLD ARABIt is the song of the freed slaves - " No one but God and I knows what is in my heart . " He shuffles off . 46 . CLOSEUP - DOMINI Her face shows her inner strange reaction to this . &nbsp; DOMINI ( repeats ) " No one but God and I knows what is in my heart . " In the distance there comes the call of the Mueddin to prayer . 47 The effect on Domini is immediate . The situation and her own need make her grip the rail of the balcony . She trembles a little with the force of the prayer she  --  30  --  is uttering  --  we should barely hear the words : &nbsp; DOMINI ( looking upward at the sky )  --  Oh , God  --  give me the power to feel  --  keenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living thing ! ( NOTE : Please make alternate take with Domini reading above line as follows : " Give me the power to feel . Let me be a living thing , even though I suffer ! " ) The love song rises again , thin and sweet . CUT TO : 48 . BORIS ON BALCONY Coming toward Domini slowly is Boris . He is humble , contrite . He is not awkward but rather like a man of strong feeling who desires to humble himself and apologize , but has no knowledge of what form of expression to use . CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM TO DOMINI &nbsp; BORISPardon , Madame  --  for today . The simplicity of it is like that of a little child . It touches her in that it is so child-like , and so submissive . &nbsp; DOMINII 'm sure it was an accident . Please do n't think of it . Now that he has said this he does n't know how to get away . Awkwardly he puts his hands on the parapet . Domini looks at him , sees his awkwardness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentary tension ) We seem to be the only travellers here . &nbsp; BORIS ( echoing her as a man without words of his own ) Yes , Madame . There are not many here . &nbsp; DOMINIIs n't it wonderful here ? &nbsp; BORISVery wonderful , Madame . &nbsp; DOMINIThe desert seems to speak . ( softly - almost to herself )  --  31  --  49 &nbsp; DOMINI ( Cont 'd ) The sound of palms moving . The footsteps of animals in the sand . And that song . ( Boris begins to listen - but is troubled and silent ) The desert is filled with life . &nbsp; BORIS ( sincerely ) I hope you find it so , Madame . The mood between them is delicately intimate . Suddenly the Angelus from the tower of the little church rings out . Domini smiles as if to welcome it . CUT TO : 50-53 CROSS ON CHURCH TOWER against the sky . THE CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see Father Roubier standing in front of his little church - pulling at the bell rope . His little dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roubier . ( NOTE : Please have no " cute " business from the dog beyond this . ) BACK TO : 54 . DOMINI AND BORIS ON BALCONY The effect of the Angelus on Boris is exactly the opposite from the effect on Domini . Domini is still staring out . &nbsp; DOMINI ( whimsically ) Surely the cross must be lonely here  --  raised above men to whom it means nothing . &nbsp; BORISI - I do n't know . Pardon  --  He backs away , bows a little awkwardly and is gone . Domini looks after him in amazement . But we see that something in her is stirred by the sight of this great awkward blundering man who seems to be unhappy and in anguish . At this moment Batouch 's voice calls to her from below . &nbsp; BATOUCH 'S VOICE ( from below ) Madame ! Madame ! Domini looks down . 55 . SHOT OF BATOUCH STANDING BELOW &nbsp; BATOUCH ( calling eagerly ) You wish to see the village ? I 'll show you the dancers ! You should see the beautiful Irena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sullen pool ! BACK TO :  --  32  --  56 . DOMINI ON THE BALCONY &nbsp; DOMINI ( eagerly ) ( calling down ) Yes , I want to see everything ! DISSOLVE TO : Section Details 57 . FADE IN : INT . DANCING HALL It is hot , crowded , colorful . Five girls are dancing a native dance . ( NOTE : Please exercise caution in costumes , action , atmosphere , etc. - to be sure nothing is censorable. ) 58-60 INT . ENTRANCE Domini enters with Batouch and Hadj . She stands framed in the doorway , surveying the room . Hadj is trying to sneak away . Batouch stops him , Hadj exclaiming in Arabic , " Let me go ! I do n't like it here ! " &nbsp; DOMINIWhat is he afraid of ? &nbsp; BATOUCHIrena  --  the dancing girl . She is the most terrible girl in all the Sahara ! She wants to kill Hadj . &nbsp; DOMINIWhy ? &nbsp; BATOUCH ( as if it were the perfectly natural thing ) She loves him . Domini makes a little " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few Arabs out of the way and finds them a place to sit . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( in Arabic to Hadj ) Irena is not dancing tonight . Hadj grins with relief , lifts his face happily and boldly from his burnous in which it has been buried .  --  33  --  &nbsp; DOMINII did n't know Hadj could smile . Whatever did you say to him ? &nbsp; BATOUCH ( with a mischievous look ) I told him Irena was n't dancing tonight . &nbsp; DOMINIBut you told me she was . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( grinning at his joke ) And she is ! During this a huge negro woman has been doing her dance . Domini suddenly looks on the other side of the room and starts with surprise . CUT TO : 61 SHOT OF BORIS - from Domini 's angle . We see Boris sitting on the other side of the room . On the wall immediately behind him is a brilliantly coloured drawing of a fat dancer leering at a French soldier . This makes an unconventional background to his lean figure and sunburnt face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saint Anthony . As he watches the dancers , in his face is the legendary battle of the human heart . CUT TO : 62 . LONG SHOT INTERIOR Suddenly we see the proprietor run into the back area of the dance hall . There are sounds of expostulation , and then the floor is cleared as if for some special turn . There is some stir amongst the spectators . 63 . BATOUCH , HADJ AND DOMINI We see Batouch smile importantly at Domini , amused at what is coming .  --  34  --  64 . AT PLATFORM The stout Kabyle proprietor opens a small door behind the platform and appears , followed by Irena , who is robed in gold tissue and decorated with cascades of gold coins . 65 . CLOSE SHOT BATOUCH AND HADJ Instinctively Batouch turns and looks at Hadj . Hadj looks back at him , furiously hisses a couple of Arabic words and sinks into his burnous. 66 IRENA - with spectators in b.g . Then follows the scene of the dance of Irena . There is a hushed moment as she comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her direction . She moves slowly and languidly , with a heavy and cross expression , and painted white with scarlet lips and darkened eyes and eyebrows . 67 . BATOUCH AND HADJ Batouch nudges Hadj . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( in English ) Look , Hadj - daggers ! Hadj cowers in his hood . 68-70 PLATFORM An Arab boy with a beautiful face and dark skin slips onto the platform with two long pointed knives in his hand . He raises them before Irena between the bouquets of orange blossoms , and goes away . The hautboy players blow a blast and then swell the note until it seems as if they would burst themselves , and then the instruments swing into a magnificent tune - a tune tingling with barbarism.  --  35  --  71 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI We see the effect on Domini . She is excited . It pours fire into her veins. 72 . CLOSE SHOT BORIS We see the effect on Boris . He leans forward and glares at Irena. 73 . IRENA Irena looks wearily at the knives . When the passionate roll of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly shoots out her tiny arms , bringing her hands down on the knives , seizes them and springs to her feet . She passes from lassitude to vivid energy with an abruptness that is almost demoniacal . The hautboys scream out the tune once more . Irena holds the knives above her head and dances . CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she works her way across to Boris in the dance and as she comes to him , Boris suddenly realizes that he is her bourne . 74 . CLOSEUP BORIS Whereas before he has been leaning forward with all the picture of the great battle going on between good and evil in his face , he now leans back frightened . He has been all desire before , but now he dislikes the attention being drawn to him . He looks as if he expected the spectators to condemn his presence here . 75 . CLOSE SHOT BORIS AND IRENA Irena lifts her arms above her head , half closes her eyes and assumes an expression of languid ecstasy . Then ,  --  36  --  bending backwards , she nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare throat to Boris . 76 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI She clutches the arm of Batouch . Her eyes are riveted on the scene . 77 . BORIS AND IRENA The musicians beat the hautboys and beat their tom-toms more violently . All the eyes in the room are bent upon this sight . Boris ' face is scarlet and his shining eyes are staring down at the dancer 's throat and breast with a mingling of eagerness and horror . 78 DOMINI AND BATOUCH - with Hadj cowering in the b.g . &nbsp; BATOUCHShe wants money  --  why does n't he give it to her ? &nbsp; DOMINI ( looking straight ahead ) He does n't understand  --  Go and tell him quickly ! 79 . BORIS AND IRENA Irena , annoyed and angry at Boris ' inability to understand , repeats her last phase of the dance - and she falls back with her head leant right over and staring up at him . Boris is in an agony of apprehension . Batouch comes into shot and whispers to him . He takes out a coin and places it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  37  --  The spell in the room is broken . With Boris ' action a strain seems to have been removed . 80 . DOMINI Rather overcome by the tension , she sinks back . Suddenly she looks up and sees : 81 . IRENA Irena resumes her dance - coming around the tables toward Domini and Batouch. 82 . CLOSEUP HADJ - staring off at Irena . He is simply becoming a bundle of rags at the sight of this woman approaching . He pulls his hood closer about his face . 83 CLOSEUP BATOUCH - watching Hadj , delighted . 84-86 . CLOSE SHOT BATOUCH , DOMINI , IRENA AND THE BUNDLE WHICH IS HADJ Irena is now performing her dance perfunctorily before Domini . Domini smiles graciously , starts to reach for her purse . At this moment Hadj makes a movement and Irena is attracted by it . &nbsp; IRENA ( hisses at Batouch - indicating toward Hadj ) Who is that ? Batouch , is that your pig of a cousin Hadj ? Domini stops foraging in her purse to watch the scene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugs his shoulders as if to say " I do n't know , " but at the same moment reaches behind Hadj 's back and pulls the hood from his face . 87 CLOSEUP HADJ 'S FACE . He is frozen with horror . 88 . BACK TO SCENE Irena screams out in a fury and attacks Hadj with the knives . &nbsp; IRENAYou jackal ! You swine ! You pig ! I will kill you . 89 . LONG SHOT At once the whole place is in an uproar , and grows dark as the lights to out . 90-98 . SERIES OF QUICK MONTAGE CUTS in the melee that follows : HADJ IS STABBED DOMINI IN TERROR BATOUCH BEING PUSHED AWAY FROM HER DIRECTION BY THE MOB HEADS OF WICKED LOOKING ARABS DOMINI FRIGHTENED BY THEIR EVIL FACES BORIS SEEING DOMINI 'S TERROR DOMINI MOVING HER HEAD IN FRANTIC TERROR BORIS MAKING HIS WAY TOWARD HER - pushing the crowd aside and showing his great physical strength . 99 .

OUTSIDE THE DANCE HALL The scrimmage is continuing - soldiers come and go trying to clear the crowd . Boris shoulders his way out . He brings Domini safely through the mob . Irena and Hadj are marched off by the soldiers . Irena screaming : &nbsp; IRENAThis time I kill him .  --  Next time I kill him dead ! pp. 1-21 &nbsp; pp. 40-60 101 . CLOSE SHOT - BORIS AND DOMINI Boris notices that he has hold of her arm . His hand is holding the bare flesh . Instinctively he draws back his hand as if he had been stung . &nbsp; DOMINIThank you for helping me . ( Boris does not know how to answer - just stands there awkwardly ) Good night . &nbsp; BORIS ( emabarrassed ) Good night . Boris says no more , so Domini starts to move on . 102 . LONGER SHOT As Domini starts to walk on , Boris follows a few steps behind her . She sees him and stops , slightly amused - turns to face him as he comes up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; BORISI 'll go with you , Madame . &nbsp; DOMINII 'm not afraid . &nbsp; BORIS ( stubbornly ) I 'll go with you .  --  40  --  &nbsp; DOMINIBut if I prefer to be alone ? &nbsp; BORISThen I 'll follow you , Madame . &nbsp; DOMINIWell  --  come with me , then . As they move off , CUT TO : 103 . THE LATTICED TUNNEL Boris and Domini enter the latticed tunnel and walk in silence for a few minutes . Beyond the lattice work , in the night , can be seen moving shapes and bazaars with flares. 104 &nbsp; DOMINI --  She loves him  --  so she tried to kill him . It does n't seem reasonable , does it ? &nbsp; BORIS ( with a queer look ) I know nothing of such things . &nbsp; DOMINI ( looking at him obliquely and curiously ) Women are hard to fathom . ( amused )  --  some men , also . At this moment they pass the Sand Diviner 's tent . 105. - 108 . STREET - SAND DIVINER We see the spectral figure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his carpet house . The carpet house is lined from floor to ceiling with red embroideries and is dim with the fumes of the incense brazier . The moment he sees them he comes forward - beckoning with his long hands and calling softly through the lattice work . 109 . LATTICED TUNNEL The face of the Sand Diviner peers at Boris and Domini.  --  41  --  &nbsp; SAND DIVINER ( in a half-chuckling , yet authoritative voice ) Come , Madame , come ! The life of Madame is in the sands ! I see it  --  I see it clear ! &nbsp; DOMINI ( smiling ) I know the past . &nbsp; SAND DIVINERI read the future  --  the future of Madame  --  He turns his gaze onto Boris as if to include him in the future of Madame . 110 . CLOSE SHOT - BORIS AND THE SAND DIVINER The Sand Diviner 's gaze becomes more intent , as if he were reading something in Boris ' eyes . &nbsp; SAND DIVINERThe life of Monsieur  --  I begin to see it  --  A look of resentment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 111 . MED . SHOT - DOMINI , BORIS AND SAND DIVINER &nbsp; DOMINI ( to Boris ) Shall we hear what he has to tell us ? &nbsp; BORIS ( almost roughly ) No , No ! Domini looks at him , puzzled by his unwarranted vehemence . Then with a shrug she moves on and Boris follows her . 112 . CLOSEUP THE SAND DIVINER He watches them , deeply interested , queer and ominous - black bars of shadow weirdly across his face . 113 . THE DOORWAY OF THE HOTEL - CLOSE SHOT - BORIS AND DOMINI Boris is confused , desperately awkward . &nbsp; BORISI tried to explain today  --  it 's hard for mo  --  I 'm not accustomed to  --   --  42  --  &nbsp; DOMINIIt was nothing . &nbsp; BORISMadame  --  Please ! Whatever I have done  --  it was not done out of rudeness  --  that 's all I can say . It was not done out of rudeness ! &nbsp; DOMINII shall forget it  --  from this moment . She smiles - holds out her hand . He takes it , holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She withdraws her hand , turns , leaves him . She turns back . &nbsp; DOMINII am Domini Enfilden . &nbsp; BORIS ( after a second of silence ) My name is Boris - Boris Androvsky . &nbsp; DOMINIRussian ? &nbsp; BORISMy mother was French , my father a Russian . That is my name . ( his voice sounds like one insisting on something not readily to be believed ) &nbsp; DOMINI ( with warm genuineness ) Perhaps we 'll meet again . &nbsp; BORIS ( awkwardly ) I hope so . ( he seems troubled , even by this ) &nbsp; DOMINI ( encouraging him ) I 'm riding tomorrow to the oasis of Sidi-Zerzour . She waits for him to take advantage of this remark , but Boris only stares down at the ground , not knowing what to say . Domini finally looks at him tolerantly . &nbsp; DOMINIGood night . She goes . 115 He turns , still a little upset and harrassed and strides away . FADE OUT :  --  43  --  116 . FADE IN : THE DESERT - DAY In a LONG SHOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps far in the distance there is the suggestion of the oasis  --  a few palm trees against the sky . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details 117 . A RESTING PLACE BY A STREAM AT SIDI-ZERZOUR - CLOSE UP DOMINI She is seated close to a stream , on a rude seat of some sort , watching in the background some children ( about five or six between the ages of four and eight ) splashing about , pushing each other and giggling and laughing . She hears a voice off scene addressing her . &nbsp; MUSTAPHA 'S VOICE ( off scene ) I am the guide  --  I am the guide . Look ! My certificates . Domini looks up annoyed . 118 . TWO SHOT Mustapha , an excited middle-aged Arab , is trying to make her attend him . &nbsp; MUSTAPHA ( continued ) Read what the English Lord says of me . I am the only honest man here . I am honest Mustapha . I am honest Mustapha ! Domini , more annoyed , moves slightly away . The noise of the children , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crescendo . &nbsp; MUSTAPHAThe children annoy Madame ? Honest Mustapha will send them away . &nbsp; DOMININo  --  leave the children alone and take honest Mustapha away . &nbsp; MUSTAPHA ( surlily ) As Madame wishes . Disgruntled , Mustapha goes away , grumbling disconsolately.  --  44  --  119 . CLOSE SHOT BATOUCH He has been listening to this and as Mustapha goes away , he hastily pulls his tie awry , opens his shirt at the neck , musses his hair and assumes a heavy breathing to give the whole effect of having run very hard a long way . He goes quickly toward Domini. 120 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI as Batouch comes into the scene . &nbsp; BATOUCHMadame ! Domini turns to face him . She is really annoyed with him for last night . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( words pouring out of his mouth ) Madame ! You should n't ride in the desert alone ! I saw you  --  I was so upset . I followed you . I 've run all the way . During this outburst Domini looks at him suspiciously - obviously not believing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how could you do that to Hadj last night ? I wonder you dare come near me . &nbsp; BATOUCHBut , Madame , I can not stay away ! I have been in agony to think that Madame is offended with me . &nbsp; DOMINIYou in agony ? What about - poor Hadj ? Was he very badly hurt ? &nbsp; BATOUCH ( with a glimmer of hope that he may still have a chance ) Oh , no - he 's married . &nbsp; DOMINI ( puzzled , but with a flicker of amusement ) Married ? 121 &nbsp; BATOUCH ( in a rush - gaily ) Yes , Madame , women are extraordinary . Irena had to have him , dead or alive . So Hadj married her . I suppose he thought it would be safer . &nbsp; DOMINIBatouch , you are a poet , a philosopher - and a rascal . Now go and get some coffee . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( overjoyed ) Madame ! Madame will forgive ?  --  45  --  &nbsp; DOMINI ( with a smile ) No.  --  Forget . Batouch rushes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the children . She takes a coin from her pocket , holds it forward temptingly . &nbsp; DOMINICome here ! Look ! Do you want it ? 122 . CLOSE SHOT THE CHILDREN They giggle shyly and hide their faces with their hands . One of them , however , a little brown , practically naked baby who can hardly walk , toddles out of the group and goes toward Domini 123 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI As the baby toddles up and stands staring at the astonishing vision . &nbsp; DOMINIWhat 's your name ? The baby makes unintelligible Arabic sounds . Domini laughs , gives him the coin . He turns quickly and scoots back to the group , gurgling in Arabic . Domini is entranced. 124 . NEAR THE LITTLE GARDEN As Boris , who has dismounted from his horse and is tying it , sees Domini , and goes toward her . 125 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI As she hears someone offscene , turns and sees him coming into scene . A flicker of amusement comes over her face that he is here although he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; BORIS ( stammering an explanation , awkwardly ) I hope I 'm not intruding , but I did n't know whether you meant me to ride with you or not .  --  46  --  &nbsp; DOMINI ( gently - charmed at his awkwardness and apology ) I practically asked you to . &nbsp; BORISOh , I did n't understand that  --  I could n't believe it . I 've lived so long out of the world - I do n't know the right things to do . &nbsp; DOMINI ( graciously ) Those things are unimportant , anyway . Really they are . He looks at her with gratefulness and a little wonder , sits beside her . The little urchin who has received the coin previously , scoots into the scene again holding out a hand . The Arab love song we have heard in previous scenes begins quietly somewhere offscene . Domini is amused at the child . &nbsp; DOMINIWhat ! You want another ? Let me see if I - 126-127 She fishes in her pocket for a coin , finds one . &nbsp; DOMINIHere 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dashes out lickety-split as fast as he can go . Domini laughs merrily . Boris even smiles . 128 Domini listens to the song a minute in silence - then : &nbsp; DOMINI ( rather dreamily ) Listen . That song again . Wherever you go . The slaves sang it when they were set free . They listen a moment as the sound becomes fuller and clearer . Then she speaks , almost to herself . &nbsp; DOMINI ( a little more serious ) Maybe that 's why I like it so well . Some day I shall be free , too . He looks at her curiously , a little incredulous that she is n't perfectly free . &nbsp; BORISYou , Madame ? &nbsp; DOMINI ( quietly , explaining ) I 've been in prison myself - a kind of prison .  --  47  --  RETAKE : SIDI-ZERZOUR - AT STREAM CLOSEUP BORIS ( INDIVIDUAL ) &nbsp; BORIS ( looking at Domini off scene , lifting his hat ) You do n't  --  I hope I 'm not intruding , but I did n't know whether you meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( cue ) I practically asked you to . &nbsp; BORISOh !

They really are . &nbsp; BORISYou are very kind , Madame . Thank you . ( AND alternate line : ) Thank you for being so kind .  --  48  --  &nbsp; BORIS ( looks at her in wonder ) But you , Madame  --  surely you have n't found the world a prison ? &nbsp; DOMINIFor me it was . I did n't find happiness there . &nbsp; BORIS ( involuntarily - his own emotions released ) Nor I ! We 're together in that ! Where is it to be found  --  where ? Does it exist ? 129 . CLOSE UP DOMINI A sense of her deep yearning , her deep need , is in her face . &nbsp; DOMINI ( softly ) Perhaps here . The desert . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLOSE UP BORIS As he looks at her , almost sharing her mood of hope for a moment . Then his head goes down . The haunted look comes over his face again . &nbsp; BORIS ( his voice low and pained ) Not for me , Madame . Never for me. 131 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI AND BORIS She looks at him quietly , touched by his revelation . His hands spread out tensely , revealing an attempt to keep hold of himself , coming to rest again on his knees . &nbsp; DOMINI ( quickly - trying to help him ) You must n't believe that . Really you must n't . She puts her hand on his wrist . &nbsp; BORIS ( looking down and conscious of her hand on his arm ) Thank you for trying to help me . Domini is slightly embarrassed . &nbsp; BATOUCH 'S VOICE ( offscene ) Madame ! Monsieur ! The mood is broken . They look up .  --  49  --  132 .

An Arab Chief ? &nbsp; BATOUCHOh , no , no ! Count Anteoni ! An amazing man , Madame  --  twice a year he dashes away into the desert on a pilgrinage . He rides like the wind ripping through the Sahara ! And then , Madame , there are times , would you believe it ? - when he sits in his garden  --  just sits there like a stone statue , sits there and thinks . 134A . FOUR SHOT - FROM BEHIND DOMINI , BORIS AND BATOUCH In the background , among the trees , Anteoni is dismounting from his horse . He sees Batouch , calls out : &nbsp; ANTEONIBatouch ! They turn to look . He comes forward . Batouch goes quickly toward him . 135 . CLOSE SHOT - ANTEONI AND BATOUCH Batouch runs up to him . &nbsp; BATOUCHCount Anteoni !

That is - I have been serving  --  By this time they are with Boris and Domini , who look up as Anteoni and Batouch come in . Batouch introduces them . &nbsp; BATOUCHMadame . Madame Enfilden , this is Count Anteoni . ( Domini nods , Anteoni bows ) - and M. Androvsky . The two men bow . &nbsp; ANTEONII 'm happy to meet you . I trust I have n't disturbed you , but one heads toward an oasis as toward Heaven . &nbsp; DOMINIWo n't you join us for coffee ? &nbsp; ANTEONIThank you .

There is a sound offscene of three or four girls laughing and calling in Arabic . . . Anteoni turns , indicates , smiling . 137 . AT THE STREAM - CLOSE SHOT OF THE THREE OR FOUR GIRLS Beautiful and unveiled , dressed in lovely draperies , they have come down to the stream and are washing their many-colored handkerchiefs on the rocks - at the same time laughing and calling , looking at Domini with curiosity and trying to attract attention . 138 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI , BORIS AND ANTEONI &nbsp; ANTEONI ( charmingly , to Domini ) It 's you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom see one . &nbsp; DOMINI ( smiling ) I 'm curious about them . Anteoni turns , beckons to the girls and calls out in Arabic : " Come here . " 139 . CLOSE SHOT OF THE GIRLS They giggle and start over . Catching up their draperies into a bunch , exposing their slim legs , they wade into the water . One of them has a number of handkerchiefs of different colors in her hands tied together .  --  52  --  As the water catches them they stream out in a line . They come across the stream and out of the picture . 139A . MEDIUM SHOT THE GIGGLING GIRLS as they come up to Domini , Boris and Anteoni . They are still laughing among themselves , rather shyly but with a curious animal self-confidence . Domini smiles at them . 140 CLOSE SHOT BORIS - the others in the b.g . The girls crowd around  --  Possibly one of them leans over and touches Boris ' boots with great curiosity . Boris tries to remain oblivious , but is greatly embarrassed . 141 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from some trinket she is examining on one of the girls off scene . 142 . BORIS AND THE NATIVE GIRL The girl , straightening up , is attracted by the glitter of a chain round Boris ' neck  --  Her hands steal out to his breast . She catches at the silver chain and jerks out of its hiding place a little wooden cross . 143 Boris almost angrily jerks the cross from his neck - snapping the chain in two . Then , terribly embarrassed , he stands hesitating for a moment , looking around , with the cross in his hand . Then he speaks somewhat casually , fighting to hide his disturbed emotions .  --  53  --  &nbsp; BORIS ( to the girl ) You want it ? Here , take it . It 's yours ! He throws it away from him . 144 Domini and Anteoni looking on in amazement . 145 . MEDIUM SHOT THE GIRLS AND BORIS as the cross sails past them into the little stream .

He turns and goes away out of scene . Domini and Anteoni turn from watching Boris out , to look at each other . Then their attention is called to the cries of the girls who are searching for the cross in the water . 147 . CLOSE SHOT - IN THE STREAM A girl in magenta picks up the cross with some of the silver chain in her dripping fingers and cries out in triumph .  --  54  --  148 .

Domini takes the cross and looks at it and puts it in her dress . Anteoni comes to her . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( indicating Boris o.s . ) Curious man , Mr. Androvsky . Who is he ? &nbsp; DOMINIA fellow-traveller . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( harking back to his earlier comment ) And a friend ? &nbsp; DOMINI ( wonderingly ) I do n't quite know . &nbsp; ANTEONIA man who fears to acknowledge his God is unwise to set foot in the desert . She looks at him questioningly . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( continuing ) The Arabs have a saying  --  " The desert is the Garden of Allah . " He looks at her . She is watching him , concerned . His head turns toward the desert off scene . Her gaze follows his . 149 . ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TWO with the desert in the background . They are irised out . The desert remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55  --  150 FADE IN : INSERT NOTE - on crested paper . " My dear Miss Enfilden - Last week you expressed a desire to see something of the village by night . Would you do me the honor of dining with me and seeing the bazaars this evening ? Most sincerely , Ferdinand Anteoni . " DISSOLVE TO : Section Details 151 . THE BAZAAR AT BENI-MORA - NIGHT IN A LONG SHOT , PAN with Domini and Anteoni , in evening clothes , as they move through the bazaar , with Batouch following them . They are besieged by Arabs selling rugs and perfumes , etc. , and as they pass through the street we hear the street cries of the vendors . 152 They come to an obstruction in the street . It is a burro that refuses to move in spite of remonstrances from Arabs who scream at it . 153 CLOSE SHOT - at burro The Arabs pull the burro , push it and make a terrific row  --  without doing any good at all . 154 . THREE SHOT - DOMINI , ANTEONI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the stupidity of his countrymen . &nbsp; BATOUCHYou must excuse my fellow Arabs , Madame . They 're a kindly people - simple , honest  --  but they understand nothing  --  not even the mood of a burro . . . . Batouch will clear the way ! He bows with a flourish and goes off . 155 . MEDIUM SHOT With perfect confidence , Batouch waves back the Arabs and jumps on the burro 's back with the intention of riding away .  --  56  --  But the moment the burro feels Batouch on his back , it streaks away down the street with him . There is a great deal of laughter from some of the Arabs , except the owners of the burro , who run screaming down the street after the retreating figure of Batouch and the burro . Domini and Anteoni laugh . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( laughing ) Batouch has cleared the way ! DISSOLVE TO : 156 . THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE SAND DIVINER 'S HOUSE Anteoni and Domini near the Sand Diviner 's shop . The Sand Diviner appears in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He makes a striking figure under the yellow light of the hanging lantern of his carpet house . &nbsp; SAND DIVINER ( calling to Domini ) Madame  --  the life of Madame is in the sand tonight  --  I show you all  --  As he approaches , Domini shrinks back at first . Anteoni motions to the Sand Diviner to go back . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( to Domini ) Do n't let him frighten you . Under the gesture of Anteoni the Sand Diviner shrinks back into the doorway of his shop . 157 . ANTEONI AND DOMINI &nbsp; DOMINITell me about him . I have seen him before . &nbsp; ANTEONIHe 's a desert man  --  one would suppose such beings were bred by the marriage of the sand grains . The sand tells him secrets . &nbsp; DOMINIHas he ever looked in the sand for you ?  --  57  --  &nbsp; ANTEONIOnce . A long time ago . &nbsp; DOMINIWere the things he found there true ? &nbsp; ANTEONIHe found nothing for the years that were past . &nbsp; DOMINIAnd for the years that were still to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes - he found what was still to come . ( continues more lightly ) Would you care to hear him ? Domini looks up at him and suddenly decides that she will . &nbsp; DOMINI ( nods ) Yes . They move into the interior of the carpet house . 158 . INTERIOR THE SAND DIVINER 'S HOUSE The carpet house is lined from floor to ceiling with red embroideries and is dim with the fumes of the incense brazier . 159 The Sand Diviner is crouched on the floor as Anteoni and Domini come in. 160 In close view we see the Sand Diviner peer at Domini and then his eyes go to the floor and he begins to sift the sand through his fingers . 161 In the center of the room on the ground is the symmetrical pyramid of sand . &nbsp; SAND DIVINERThe life of Madame  --  I see it in the sand  --  The Sand Diviner drops his fingers onto the pyramid , bringing the sand downward and outward . On his face is a tortured expression . He scatters the sand on the flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern .  --  58  --  His emaciated hands , stretched out , rest upon the sand like carven things . His whole body is absolutely breathless in its absolute immobility . Anteoni stands looking down . The Sand Diviner begins in a low murmur and then begins to work rapidly . He breaks up the patterns in the sand with his fingers . They form spirals , circles and snakelike lines . So swiftly does he move that it seems as if the sand is endowed with life . Domini , hardly taking her eyes off the sight , beckons with her hand to Anteoni , who comes close to her . 162. - 163 The Sand Diviner breaks off his mutterings and throws words in English in staccato fashion to Domini . &nbsp; SAND DIVINERCaravan  --  camels  --  waiting by a church  --  165 Domini smiles at Anteoni . The Sand Diviner continues mumbling to himself . We see surprise on Anteoni 's face . Domini looks at him as if asking him to translate . ( The Sand Diviner 's Arabic through this is equivalent to Anteoni 's translation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . &nbsp; DOMINIMy life ? &nbsp; ANTEONIYour real life . We see that what has been merely amused interest in Domini 's eyes disappears and she becomes more serious . &nbsp; ANTEONIAs he describes it  --  " It is only then that you are fully born . " Domini catches her breath at this . The Sand Diviner 's voice is heard again . Again he turns and throws the words , in staccato fashion to Domini.  --  59  --  &nbsp; SAND DIVINERCamels  --  the church  --  the caravan moves into the desert  --  it is day  --  but not like other days . The Sand Diviner relapses into his monotone as he throws the sand and makes more patterns . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( translating ) The wind is rising . It drowns out the music of the church . The desert is angry . ( he pauses to listen again to the Sand Diviner ) There is a palanquin such as the great sheikhs use to carry their women , he says . 166. - 167 &nbsp; DOMINIAm I to be carried off ? &nbsp; ANTEONII do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you . &nbsp; DOMINIAnd the other ? There is a violent gesture from the Sand Diviner as if unable to see clearly . &nbsp; ANTEONIHe ca n't tell . &nbsp; DOMINIWhere is the caravan going  --  can he tell me ? &nbsp; ANTEONIIt is on the road to Bambara . Up to now Anteoni has been taking the prophecy rather more seriously than Domini , who has been slightly incredulous  --  but on this revelation she is pulled up with a start . &nbsp; DOMINIBut that 's the route I have planned for my pilgrimage ! The Sand Diviner peers more closely at the ground and then throws the words over his shoulder to Domini : &nbsp; SAND DIVINER --  A tent  --  far in the desert  --  close by a ruined tower  --  Then his whole being becomes full of some great feeling that he is unable to express in English and he mumbles more softly in his own tongue but with a kind of crooning note as if it were prophesying a kind of peace , of pleasure , of happiness . - A longer speech than the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ANTEONIThere is something glorious in store for you . It is as if all the trees of the desert bear fruit  --  and the sand is covered with millions of golden flowers - big as the flower of the aloe . &nbsp; DOMINIIt is joy ? It must be joy . &nbsp; ANTEONIYes . Great joy . Then as the Sand Diviner has made another pattern in the sand we see him suddenly stop and utter a cry . We see the Sand Diviner staring down at the sand . He has a look on his face as if the cry had been frozen there . 168 &nbsp; DOMINI ( clutches Anteoni 's arm and whispers ) What is it ? We see that Anteoni is now alarmed . All his ease and poise have left him . He leans down to the Sand Diviner and mutters a few words in Arabic . The Sand Diviner , without looking round replies in a monotone . Anteoni 's face is grave . He looks round at Domini . Domini suddenly puts out her hand and stops Anteoni . &nbsp; DOMINII wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 169 . CLOSE SHOT OF DOMINI We see that she is thinking of the future . On her face is the same expression we saw on the balcony when she expressed herself in the words : " Let me live - let me be a living thing . " 170 . BACK TO SCENE &nbsp; DOMINII do n't care . If this " great joy " comes to me  --  I do n't care what comes after . ( she looks up at Anteoni ) Please , let us go . Anteoni nods , takes out a coin and throws it toward the Sand Diviner . THE CAMERA PANS WITH THE COIN as it falls in the tray of sand  --  We see the sand patterns . The Sand Diviner 's head is motionless as he regards the patterns . The Sand Diviner 's hands go to the coin . With an enraged gesture he flings the money away and we hear the sound of the coin as it hits the ground . The Sand Diviner 's hands rapidly destroy the patterns in the sand . pp. 22-39 &nbsp; pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the distance Domini and Boris are galloping into the desert .

The very word " Islam " means " Surrender of the human will . " &nbsp; BORIS ( intensely ) And they surrender it  --  willingly ? &nbsp; ANTEONI ( deliberately , with an assumed lightness and innocence ) Completely .

I 've always thought that . I think so still . &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIER ( with some heat ) We servants of the Church can not subscribe to such a point of view . The tempo of the scene increases as the argument grows more heated . &nbsp; BORIS ( impatiently ) And why should the Priests imagine that they alone have the key to life ? &nbsp; DOMINI ( quickly ) No one has said that , Boris . They have rules  --  which they have to obey  --  which they want to obey . &nbsp; BORISI do n't see what right they have to assume that others must obey these rules .

But he does n't say what he did n't realize  --  he is just beginning to feel that Boris is definitely a very strange and unaccountable man . &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIER ( rising ) It was mostly my fault , I 'm afraid . I spoke too harshly . I should be getting on about my duties . You 'll understand if I go , wo n't you , Count Anteoni ? &nbsp; ANTEONII 'm sorry .

THE PORCH OUTSIDE THE CHURCH There is a scattered gathering of those characters we have seen connected with the garden , Count Anteoni and the hotel . They are waiting for the wedding . But in the half-light and under the pressure of an impending storm with the wind howling , there is no gaiety . Through them comes the Priest , Father Roubier , from his little house , bending forward against the wind . He moves towards the church . DISSOLVE TO : 256 . THE SACRISTY OF THE CHURCH In the little alcove we see Rather Roubier is puzzled and troubled . He is putting on his stole over his vestments . Outside the wind howls and gusts shake the windows .

The wind is heard again more furiously . 260 There is a startling crash and the crucifix has fallen to the floor . 261 Father Roubier starts forward to pick it up . He glances at the wall from where it has fallen . There is a perfectly natural explanation of the phenomenon  --  the hole has just worn away round the nail . Yet the Priest can not help feeling that it is a catastrophe . He picks up the Cross and puts it back on the wall . The boy , startled , cries out . &nbsp; BOYWhy did it do that ?

She is a woman , a woman who is love triumphant , and she is utterly fearless because she believes she is fulfilling her mission . By her side is Boris . In contrast to her radiance he appears as stone . He has a hatred of the priest and of being in this church . Only his great desire for Domini would have dragged him into the church at all .

THE TOWER - NIGHT It is a ruin of an old French or Arab fortification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects Boris . 313 Suddenly she is startled by a cry coming from the far distance and on the other side of her . She turns and with a torch goes down several paces and stares out into the dusk . Looking down from the tower there is apparently a group of four shadowy figures on burros and two or three pack mules . 314 IN CLOSER VIEW we see this group consists of de Trevignac , a young French officer , with one sergeant and two older French soldiers - Zouaves.  --  108  --  De Trevignac is a smart-looking , fair man of about thirty , but dirty now , and bearded . Both he and his men are all in. 315-318 They are staring up in amazement at the spectacle which they see on the hill , the figure with the torch . We should be near enough to show that these men are completely exhausted . They stare out as if they were seeing a mirage  --  something unreal , muttering : " It 's not possible ! " " It must be a light ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " etc . Even de Trevignac rubs his eyes and murmurs : " Are we crazy or is that a light ? " 319 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI &nbsp; DOMINI ( calling ) Who is it ? Who are you ? There is silence for a moment and then sounds of men in the semi-darkness , muttering indistinct lines such as : " What is it ? " " No - it ca n't be true ! " . " It is surely a woman ! " " How did she get there ? " " What is she doing here ? " etc . There is the plodding of mules or horses and the panting of men and the clattering of accoutrement . Then de Trevignac comes into the shot and stares up at her trying to focus , trying to see what he hardly believes is real . Finally his dulled senses tell him it is not a dream . Finally he gasps out : 320 &nbsp; DE TREVIGNACMadamo , it seemed impossible that anyone  --  pardon --  you must think us crazy  --  we  --  ( he dismounts ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert for three days . A look of great sympathy and distress for the men comes into Domini 's face . By this time the other soldiers have dismounted and are grouped round de Trevignac , looking unutterably haggard and worn and weary . They mutter to him indistinguishable lines , such as : " Ask Madame for  --  Please , sir  --  see if there is water for us  --  food . " etc . De Trevignac looks back up at Domini.  --  109  --  321 &nbsp; DE TREVIGNACMadame , forgive me  --  my men are hungry and exhausted . Have you water for us  --  a bite to eat ? &nbsp; DOMINIOf course ! Over there - in the camp . Everything you want . 322 She indicates the camp off in the other direction . There are murmurs from the exhausted men such as : " Did she say we are to be fed ? I ca n't believe it ! Water - food ! Where is it ? Which way is the camp ? etc . De Trevignac , his despair over , slumps a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he gives orders to his men , but still like a man to whom speech is difficult . 323 &nbsp; DE TREVIGNAC ( to the sergeant ) Get your men down to the camp at once . I 'll follow . They move away , one of them looking up at Domini with great and expressive gratitude on his face . Domini starts down the steps . De Trevignac goes as quickly as he can toward the foot of the stone steps where he meets her . &nbsp; DE TREVIGNACMadame , will you permit me  --  my name is de Trevignac. 324 &nbsp; DOMINII am Madame Androvsky . &nbsp; DE TREVIGNAC ( brightly ) Russian ! Vive la Russie ! &nbsp; DOMINI ( smiling at his boyish good spirits ) No , no  --  that 's my husband 's name . De Trevignac is sufficiently a Frenchman for the word " husband " to make his eyes flicker . ( NOTE : We would like to get the above reaction silently if possible - otherwise let de Trevignac speak the line : " Your husband  --  oh ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously - humble and grateful ) Madame , I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness . ( then more brightly - with a touch of irony ) Do you know , if we had n't seen your light on the tower  --  we were prepared tonight - for the great event .  --  110  --  &nbsp; DOMINIThe great event ? &nbsp; DE TREVIGNACThe last in a man 's life , Madame  --  death . &nbsp; DOMINIIt must be terrible to face death in such desolation . Did you feel utterly alone ? &nbsp; DE TREVIGNACNo , Madame . ( after a second 's pause , he adds : ) My mother was very devout . She taught me long ago that in any danger one is never  --  well , never quite alone . This is said in an extremely simple , charming and natural way . Domini is touched with this revelation . &nbsp; DOMINI ( drawn to him by this remark ) Yes  --  I know . One of the Zouaves returns with a drink of water for de Trevignac .

Domini looks at the two men , decides she should leave them together to seal the good fellowship which apparently has started . She moves across and kisses Boris lightly and whispers in his ear . &nbsp; DOMINII 'm so glad you are happy .

During above speech Batouch has placed the liqueur bottle on the table - which we see in a CLOSE UP .

The Zouave sergeant jumps up with alacrity . &nbsp; ZOUAVE SERGEANTOui , Madame , it will be a pleasure . They start off toward the main tent .  --  120  --  Suddenly a figure coming from the main tent appears , almost brushing Domini . We see that it is de Trevignac . He hesitates on seeing her , bows stiffly , says with very marked politeness : &nbsp; DE TREVIGNACGoodnight , Madame - ( then sharply barks to the Zouave ) Sergeant  --  get your men together  --  we march at dawn .

What has happened ? Why did Monsieur de Trevignac go away so suddenly ? &nbsp; BORISDomini , do you care whether he is here or gone ? Do you want anyone to break in upon our lives ?

You have given everything .

FADE OUT .  --  122  --  343 FADE IN : INTERIOR SLEEPING TENT - lit dimly by perhaps one light . Domini is lying in bed and as WE COME CLOSE TO HER we see that she is wide-eyed and disturbed . Outside the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down , and his silhouetted figure is seen through the canvas . ( This is to be effect . ) If the above is not practical , the figure of Boris is seen pacing up and down through the opening of the main tent . A further alternative might be the feet of Boris pacing up and down in the same manner as in the " Imitation of Christ " scene . FADE OUT : Section Details 344 . FADE IN : EXTERIOR TENT - EARLY MORNING Domini is coming out into the early morning . It is cold and there is a wind . Something of the life has gone out of Domini 's face . She looks off . 345 . ANOTHER ANGLE OF DOMINI As she looks in their direction we see in the distance de Trevignac and his men leaving . Domini runs after de Trevignac , calling : &nbsp; DOMINIMonsieur ! Monsieur de Trevignac ! He stops and turns as she approaches him . 346 . CLOSE SHOT DE TREVIGNAC AND DOMINI It almost appears as if de Trevignac is going to move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Domini runs into scene . &nbsp; DOMINIMonsieur ! De Trevignac 's look now is no longer that of the cheerful , cynical , pleasant Frenchman  --  there is another look - almost of horror .  --  123  --  &nbsp; DE TREVIGNAC ( cutting in on her - coldly ) Goodbye , Madame . There is a curious metallic sound in the words . She sees him glance at the tent from which she has come . The horror on his face deopens . &nbsp; DOMINI ( desperately trying to get to the bottom of the mystery ) But , Monsieur de Trevignac - ! What happened ? Please tell me ! &nbsp; DE TREVIGNAC ( in an agonized voice ) Madame - Madame  --  I  --  He checks his impulse to warn her , is about to move on when he stops .

They pull up sharply some distance away , looking about . 349 . CLOSE SHOT - COUNT ANTEONI AND SOME OF HIS ARAB RETINUE Anteoni 's face is grimmer and sterner than when we saw it last . He looks as if he were pursuing some undertaking . One of his men points off scene . 350 . EXTREME LONG SHOT OF THE TOWER OF MOGAR Nothing else is visible but the tower . The tents of the encampment are not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to Anteoni ) There 's the Tower of Mogar , Your Excellency , but I do n't see the encampment . &nbsp; ANTEONIMonsieur de Trevignac said we should find them near that tower . The Arab turns his head , shouts a few Arabic words such as " that way " and " left " , and they start to move . 352 . LONG SHOT THE CAVALCADE It turns aside from the well-travelled road and gallops into the desolate by-path. 353 . LONG SHOT THE CAMP OF BORIS AND DOMINI - EARLY AFTERNOON Anteoni 's troop is dashing down into the camp . Dogs , a baby camel , and other camp animals scatter out of the way . 354 . CLOSE SHOT OF COUNT ANTEONI - as he is dismounting . One of his retinue takes hold of his horse 's bridle . Arabs of the camp crowd in to help with the animals .  --  126  --  There are cries of greeting in Arabic among the men in the background . Anteoni looks off , his face is dark and stern - a strange mood for Anteoni @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him while he is getting off his horse . &nbsp; BATOUCHCount Anteoni ! For the first time in my unworthy life I am speechless ! You are as welcome as  --  &nbsp; ANTEONI ( interrupting ) ( curtly ) Where 's Madame ? Then he sees her off and moves quickly out of the scene . Batouch looks after him in surprise at his sternness. 355-360 . CLOSE SHOT BEFORE TENT - as Domini comes out , greeting Anteoni who comes swiftly into shot . &nbsp; DOMINI ( warmly - offering her hand ) Count Anteoni ! &nbsp; ANTEONIDomini ! &nbsp; DOMINIHow glad I am to see you ! ( he kisses her hand ) I hope your finding us here is n't accidental . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( with queer emphasis ) No . I intended to find you . ( with a strange watchfulness ) I was on the way to Amara. ( pause ) I met a young French officer . &nbsp; DOMINI ( suspiciously and wonderingly ) Monsieur de Trevignac ? Anteoni looks at Domini , searching her face . &nbsp; ANTEONIYes . A moment 's embarrassed pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with assumed brightness ) How well you look ! ( indicating ) Do you know  --  this spot is exactly as the Sand Diviner described it . &nbsp; DOMINIAll that the Sand Diviner said has come true . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( with a quick look at her - then remembering how much of the actual prophecy she had heard ) Are you happy then ? &nbsp; DOMINIOf course ! &nbsp; ANTEONI ( with a meaning look ) Completely ? &nbsp; DOMINI ( quietly ) Yes , completely . ( almost challengingly ) How could I fail to be ? &nbsp; ANTEONI ( lightly , but with meaning ) I thought I detected a small  --  oh , a very small shadow - across your face . ( then , turning it into a joke ) It must be the light . ( he brushes his hand across his eyes ) I have been so long in the sun today ! At this point Anteoni looks off scene , sees Boris there . &nbsp; ANTEONIMonsieur Androvsky ! CAMERA PANS OVER TO BORIS , as they walk to him . &nbsp; BORISCount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seeing Anteoni , and trying to cover , stammers out : ) It is a pleasure to see you . &nbsp; DOMINI ( to Anteoni ) ( trying to save the situation ) You 'll stay the night with us , of course . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( looking at Boris ) If I may . &nbsp; BORISBut - of course . The tension is broken . They start to move to the tent . DISSOLVE TO :  --  128  --  361 . L.S. INT . TENT . NIGHT . BORIS , DOMINI , ANTEONI They are sipping coffee at a low table near which is a lighted brazier which throws interesting shadows . Boris ' mood is dark and quietly sullen , almost . Domini has a forced lightness in her voice and a special and extra concern for Boris as if trying to protect him from disturbance . &nbsp; ANTEONIYes , I can not help but feel that the greatest act of man is renunciation . &nbsp; BORIS ( easily - covering fairly well ) That is easy for a man of the world to say  --  easy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight sharpness ) Still there are men who would not agree with us , Monsieur . &nbsp; BORIS ( not very friendly ) I do not know such men . Batouch has come in with a tray of liqueurs and glasses which he sets on the table . &nbsp; DOMINI ( to the rescue - to Anteoni : ) A liqueur ? What would you like ? &nbsp; ANTEONI ( with a curious alert look as if carefully and casually springing a trap ) Benedictine , thank you . ( he reaches to pour it ) ( casually ) You know there 's one liqueur I 'm very fond of  --  I have n't seen it for years . It 's called Lagarnine ! Boris seems slightly startled at the mention of this liqueur . &nbsp; DOMINII believe we have some in the camp . &nbsp; BORIS ( quickly ) No , no , Domini . We did have a bottle , but there 's none left . &nbsp; ANTEONIOh , it really does n't matter . &nbsp; DOMINIBut , Boris , I 'm sure there 's another bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  &nbsp; BATOUCHOh , certainly , Madame . I 'll bring it . He goes quickly out of the scene to get it as Boris looks after him in dismay . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( with a kind of steely determination and intention , which he conceals almost completely ) Extraordinary story  --  the story of Lagarnine . Have you heard it ? &nbsp; DOMINI ( shakes her head ) No . She looks at him expectantly as if waiting to hear the story - but Anteoni turns to Boris . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( to Boris , unctuously ) News travels so swiftly in the desert . I thought perhaps  --  it might have come even to Mogar . The fact is this liqueur is made at El-Lagarni . ADDED SCENE SHOT OF BATOUCH AT DOOR OF TENT ( Shooting from interior in sufficiently long angle to clearly establish the sky beyond Batouch , using the same backing as used in the " Confession Scene " - and establishing the time of day  --  also shooting from such an angle , if possible , to see that the interior of the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the flap of the tent carrying the tray bearing the bottle of Lagarnine . He stands there a moment  --  &nbsp; BATOUCH ( with a triumphant gesture ) Voila , Madame ! Lagarnine ! THE CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY TO A CLOSER SHOT FOCUSING ON THE LAGARNINE BOTTLE . Batouch hurries forward to the table . ( BACKTO SCENE 361 ALREADY SHOT - A C.U . REACTION FROM BORIS as Batouch walks into scene at table . ) At this moment Batouch arrives with the bottle of Lagarnine , uncorks it , and is about to pour it . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( with a triumphant gesture ) Voila , Madame ! Lagarnine ! &nbsp; ANTEONI ( taking the bottle from him , as if anxious to be rid of him ) Let me . &nbsp; BATOUCH ( surprised ) Certainly . ( He bows , puzzled , and leaves the scene . ) &nbsp; ANTEONI ( to Domini ) Have you ever tasted it ? He is pouring it . He is playing the scene with guile and cunning , toying with his own glass when it is filled . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inquiring gaze as at Boris ) And you , Monsieur Androvsky ? &nbsp; BORISI - why I  --   --  130  --  &nbsp; ANTEONI ( quickly interrupting ) It 's really unusual . The Trappist Monastery has every reason to be proud of it . &nbsp; DOMINIIt is made by the monks , then ? &nbsp; ANTEONIYes . It is the only product of the vineyards at El-Lagarni . Let us enjoy it while we may ! When all that they have now in stock at the monastery is exhausted , there will never be any more . &nbsp; DOMINI ( as she picks up her glass ) But why not ? &nbsp; ANTEONIIt 's a curious story . The secret of its manufacture belonged to one monk only . At his death he was to confide it to another whom he had chosen . &nbsp; DOMINIAnd he died suddenly without  --  &nbsp; ANTEONINo . He did n't die . The gravity has returned to Anteoni 's face and deeped there , transforming it . He puts down his glass without touching it . &nbsp; DOMINIThen  --  I do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean he left it  --  a Trappist monk ? &nbsp; ANTEONIYes . &nbsp; DOMINIAfter taking the final vows ? &nbsp; ANTEONIYes. 361 A CLOSEUP DOMINI There is terrible shock in her face . She looks at the glass of pale green liquid which she is holding in her hand - and sets it down abruptly . &nbsp; DOMINIHow horrible ! How could a man do such a thing ?  --  131  --  361 B CLOSEUP BORIS He is brought up with a shock by Bomini 's reaction to this . &nbsp; BORISWhy not ? 362 BACK TO THREE SHOT &nbsp; DOMINI ( with astonishment at Boris ' question ) But , Boris  --  ( with protest ) A man who had taken vows  --  a man who had made the most sacred of marriages  --  a marriage to the Church ? 362 A CLOSEUP BORIS He lowers his eyes from her gaze , miserable with the realization of what this means to her . 362 B BACK TO THREE SHOT &nbsp; ANTEONI ( carefully , with a steely , glint in his eye ) I am not a religious man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the world . What can he possibly find there  --  for him ? &nbsp; BORIS ( desperately - to Anteoni ) He can find happiness ! ( to Domini , almost pleadingly ) He can find joy ! 363 TWO SHOT DOMINI AND BORIS He looks off scene at Domini , pleadingly . Her expression is one of amazement . &nbsp; ANTEONI 'S VOICE ( o.s. ) ( sharply ) Not for long , Monsieur , not for long ! There must be anguish in him , there must be despair such as few men have known ! Boris turns sharply toward Anteoni . &nbsp; BORIS ( half rising - blurting out ) No ! Why should he be in despair ?  --  Why ? 363 A CLOSEUP ANTEONI &nbsp; ANTEONIBecause he knows inside himself he has no right to the delights of the world .  --  132  --  363 B BACK TO THREE SHOT &nbsp; BORIS ( with sharp and anguished remonstrance ) Why should n't he have ? How can you judge ? I tell you - he has a right to live - as other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men love ! During the above speech Boris has stood full up - now he stops abruptly and looks at Domini , suddenly conscious that his passion has given him away . Now Domini knows he is the escaped monk . She stands involuntarily . She is dazed and shocked as she stares at Boris . Slowly , Boris turns his face away from her and stumbles to the door of the tent . He stands there a moment with his back to the others , his arms outflung and grabbing at the flap of the tent almost as if for support . He drops his arms to his side and goes out into the desert . Domini has followed him with her eyes . Now she goes to the door herself , standing dazed , staring after him like one in a trance . After a moment , Anteoni gets up and goes toward her . RETAKE 364 365 366 CLOSE TWO SHOT DOMINI AND ANTEONI AT DOOR OF TENT ( NOTE : This retake to be shot in one angle only . ) Domini stands staring after Boris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face is partly in shadow , but Domini 's face we see clearly . There is compassion and distress in Anteoni 's face as he looks at Domini . She is watching after Boris . She is still dazed , but part of her own anguish is being forgotten a little as she considers the anguish of Boris . &nbsp; ANTEONIDe Trevignac thought he recognized him , told me the story . I had to find out if it were true . ( his voice is low and compassionate ) The truth is bitter , Domini . But I knew you would prefer the truth . &nbsp; DOMINI ( almost to herself - scarcely listening to him - dazed ) Yes . I prefer to know  --  the truth . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( sympathetically ) It is hard , Domini , to be the one to destroy a great love . &nbsp; DOMINI ( quietly , rather slowly , looking straight ahead , scarcely aware of Anteoni ) No . It has n't destroyed my love . I shall always love him . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( surprised and touched at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know such love existed . If I had known , I should have tried to spare you . Domini is still dazed , still looking toward Boris . Tears are in her eyes . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( continuing ) I 'm going deep into the desert - perhaps never to return . My garden - which you seem to love - is yours . Goodbye , Domini . ( NOTE : Please make an alternate take with Anteoni 's speech ending " I am going deep into the desert never to return . Goodbye , Domini . " This is to be used in case we should eliminate the tag in Anteoni 's garden in the final cutting of the picture . ) &nbsp; DOMINI ( hardly audible - her voice very far away and like a child who is wounded deeply and unable to think of anything else except that great hurt : ) Goodbye . Anteoni kisses the sleeve of Domini 's gown and goes . 364 . CLOSE SHOT DOMINI AND ANTEONI BY DOOR OF TENT Domini stands staring after Boris . Anteoni comes into the shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks at Domini 's face . Domini is watching after Boris . She is still dazed , but part of her own anguish is being forgotten a little as she considers the anguish of Boris . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( with tender compassion ) Domini  --  de Trevignac recognized him , told me the story . ( he pauses , finding it difficult to go on ) I knew you would hear it soon  --  from strangers , perhaps . I could n't let that happen  --  to you , Domini . He pauses again . Domini does n't reply . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( continues ) If it were any other woman - ( with great sympathy ) But I know your fineness , your abiding faith , your love of God  --  I could n't let it go on .  --  133  --  Domini still does not reply . She is still dazed , still concentrated on Boris , in a kind of suspended agony which has not reached full expression . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( as he looks from her face toward the object of her gaze - Boris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief . I pity him , Domini . &nbsp; DOMINI ( quietly , rather slowly , looking straight ahead , scarcely aware of Anteoni ) I do n't pity him . I love him . I shall always love him . I shall help him - help him to find the peace he needs . Anteoni is astonished , rather overwhelmed at her reaction to what has happened , at the depth of feeling about this man she has revealed - a depth of love incredible to a man of the world like himself . &nbsp; ANTEONI ( softly , almost awed ) I did n't know such love existed in the world . Forgive me. 364 A CLOSEUP OF ANTEONI &nbsp; ANTEONIAll my life I shall regret it was from me you learned the truth . I am going deep into the desert  --  perhaps never to return .

I was still very young when I went into the monastery . And when it came time to take the eternal vows I did not hesitate .

Domini , you know what I have to do , do n't you ? &nbsp; DOMINI ( her voice dim - as she begins to know how hard it will be to part  --  but knowing , too , that it could be no other way ) Yes .

At his look of surprise and wonder she says quietly , with a kind of radiance shining through the simple words : &nbsp; DOMINIOnce  --  long ago - you threw it away , Boris . Now it is yours again . He takes it , looks at it , a little awed . Then he looks back at her . &nbsp; BORIS ( quietly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Together they look out over the desert  --  a companion shot to that which we saw before . &nbsp; DOMINI ( quietly ) How far is it to the monastery ? &nbsp; BORISA few hours  --  &nbsp; DOMINI ( thinking of the very short time they will have together - repeats : ) A few hours  --  &nbsp; BORIS ( commanding with great difficulty the torture rising in him ) A lifetime .

Batouch is saying goodbye . Domini is just paying him . Batouch is grateful . But he has lost some of his usual perkiness and is quite genuinely sad . &nbsp; BATOUCHMadame is sad  --  but Madame will return one day . 378 . CLOSEUP BATOUCH &nbsp; BATOUCH ( continuing his speech ) The desert calls and its voice is always heard . Madame will come back to the land of the sun , to the land of forgetfulness. 379 . BACK TO 2-SHOT BATOUCH AND DOMINI &nbsp; DOMINIPerhaps so , Batouch. ( thanking him without saying it in so many words for all he has done for her ) Thank you . Batouch makes his little gesture of thanks and then says apologetically and simply , with deep and unaccustomed sincerity : &nbsp; BATOUCHForgive me , Madame . I have no poetry today . She looks at him , deeply touched . 380 . BACK TO FULL SHOT Batouch bows and as he moves , Father Roubier comes up . In the background there is the sound of people hurrying to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown . Father Roubier moves to Domini and Boris . He shakes hands with Domini . His manner is quiet and gentle . &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIERGoodbye , my child .  --  145  --  &nbsp; BATOUCH ( trying to lift her spirits ) Madame is leaving - but Madame will return one day . The desert calls , and its voice is always heard . ( loses himself in poetry in his accustomed fashion ) The desert is the land of forgetfulness , the land of - - ( he looks at her and sees her tears . His mood changes and he breaks slightly ) Forgive me , Madame . Batouch has no poetry today .  --  146  --  Then he turns to Boris and speaks simply as if he were a brother-priest again . &nbsp; FATHER ROUBIERMy son . He puts out his hand and Boris shakes it warmly . As the whistle is blown , Boris and Domini move towards the carriage .

Domini turns from looking out the window at the familiar gorge . &nbsp; DOMINI ( softly ) We met here , Boris . &nbsp; BORISYes - at the gate of the desert . ( his face darkens ) I shall never be here again . The pain of that knowledge is on both their faces . Suddenly the sunlight is sharply withdrawn from the carriage as it goes deeper into the gorge - and it seems almost symbolic as if the sunlight had gone out of their lives . DISSOLVE TO :  --  147  --  385 . OUTSIDE THE STATION-HOTEL AT TUNIS A few scattered people are passing on the platform . ( NOTE : Please avoid modern costumes - use mostly Arabs , soldiers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in . The passengers are departing . From the passengers Domini and Boris detach themselves and move towards the station hotel . 386 . FULL SHOT INSIDE THE HOTEL LOBBY It is a gloomy , sordid place . At one side , the hotel desk and tourist bureau of which a clerk , a Frenchman , is in charge . Domini and Boris go toward the desk , where a loud American and his plump and rather stupid wife are talking with the clerk . The American is probably dressed in an ill-fitting white linen suit - and his wife as a mid-Western frump. 387 . CLOSE SHOT AT THE DESK &nbsp; AMERICAN TOURIST ( in a loud , rapid and raucous voice ) We only got two weeks and we wanta see everything - and we wanta see it cheap . Domini and Boris come into the scene and stand waiting until the clerk is through with the Americans . 388 .

Come on , Mama . ( feeling in his pockets ) Where the heck are my glasses ?

Certainly , Monsieur ! ( calls boy off scene ) Pierre ! ( sees that Boris and Domini are obviously not the ordinary tourists - turns back to them : ) Would you care to wait in the private parlour ? He indicates toward a small arch leading into a private parlour . Boris nods slightly - and he and Domini move off in the direction indicated , still completely withdrawn within themselves . The clerk looks after them , then turns to Pierre who has come into shot . &nbsp; CLERK ( enviously , indicating Boris and Domini off ) Happy people ! Rich - free - able to do as they like , to go where they will ! ( he sighs profoundly , self-pityingly ) C'est la vie . CUT TO : Section Details 390 .

He is a pleasant , matter-of-fact , respectful country coachman . &nbsp; COACHMANThe carriage , Madame , Monsieur . 393 .

THE AVENUE OF TREES OVERLOOKING THE TRAPPIST MONASTERY The carriage is coming up the avenue . The coachman whistles to his horses gaily . We hear the bells on the horses ' necks ring out pleasantly . 395 . IN THE CARRIAGE Boris and Domini sit beside each other without speaking . &nbsp; COACHMANWhen we return from the Monastery , perhaps Madame and Monsieur would like to see the casinos . No ?

The coach slows down and stops before a cross raised on a pedestal - which marks the boundary of the domain of El-Lagarni . We see Domini look at Boris and his eyes answer her silent question . They look : 396 .

He leans forward to Domini with his arms in the carriage . &nbsp; BORISDomini . Domini . She turns to him and puts her hands on his shoulders and looks into his face for a long time . The inner radiance in them is supporting them both . At last she leans down and touches his forehead with her lips . 398 CLOSEUP OF DOMINI- - as she leans back from kissing him the forehead . &nbsp; DOMINI ( softly , thinking of her secret knowledge ) You will be with me - always . 399 . BACK TO TWO SHOT Her hands drop from his shoulders . After a last look at her , he turns and goes out of the scene . 400 . LONG SHOT ALONG THE AVENUE OF TREES - from Domini 's viewpoint , as we see Boris going with firm steps toward the monastery . 401 . CLOSEUP OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - music full of ecstasy . Domini is watching Boris . There are tears in her eyes . She is hanging on to what strength she can command . Now the pain rises up through what little triumph she has been able to feel in doing what she knows is right . She bites her lip . She half rises up in the seat , one arm extended as if to summon him back . Then she sinks back , turns her head toward the coachman . &nbsp; DOMINI ( in a hoarse whisper ) Drive back to Tunis ! &nbsp; COACHMAN 'S VOICE ( o.s . ) Madame ?  --  155  --  &nbsp; DOMINI ( almost with a sob ) Drive back !

CAMERA PANS IN DIRECTION IN WHICH DOMINI IS LOOKING and we pick up a small boy of about three . 403 Over the CLOSEUP OF THE BOY we hear Domini 's voice calling &nbsp; DOMINI ( softly - o.s . ) Boris , Boris . The little boy moves and comes up to his mother , climbs onto her knee and leans his face against her breast . An Arab passing below , is singing the song of the freed slaves . &nbsp; DOMINI ( whispering ) Listen , Boris  --  ( she repeats the words very softly to herself : ) " No one but God and I knows what is in my heart .
