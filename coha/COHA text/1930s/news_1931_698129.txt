txt This day set apart for thinking of labor , lightening its load , lessening its perils , finds by a strange paradox that it is the laborless who are inviting the world 's concern and symriathy . During all the centuries of the Christian era it has been repeating the line of VERGIL that labor overcomes all things . But it now discovers that labor has not succeeded in sharing its victories with all who wish to labor . The president of a great State university in the West has bethought himself . of the mythical figure of Tantalus , who though burning with thirst was denied the cool waters , and ravening with hunger could not touch the luscious fruit in sight . Our sympathy has generally been with Ixion , who was tied to a wheel  --  as if to a machine  --  which never ceased to turn except when Orpheus , by his enchanting music , gave it temporary pause . But today our thought is of the Tantalian unemployed . President BUTLER in his address for Labor Day presented a comprehensive view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He offered no new arguments ; made no new proposals . However , he gave the present plight its historical background ; pointed out the tragic blunder resulting in " the deplorable and lamentable dole , " which for every person that it " genuinely relieves . and assists de " moralizes ten others by giving them " the impression that they may in " definitely receive from the public " treasury a payment for unemploy " went " ; condemned our own " most vexatious tariff , " which can not claim to have assured high wages when some six millions are without wages at all ; and warned against the easygoing habit of drifting , the convenient habit adored by the office , holder and office-seeker of waiting to see , and the holding fast to what exists because of benefits to individuals or groups . Unemployment insurance seems the only permanent way out " if a " scientific basis for a plan can be " worked out " above what can and should be provided by the highly or ; ganized trades and industries . That the proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day would have " marked advantages , economic , psy " chological and moral , is highly " probable . " For the moment , one " very simple device " is suggested : that a family , a shop and an office should each take on one additional worker . Were a single enlightened community to put such a plan into operation , it would find a " thousand imitators , " and so make a great reduction in the army of the unemployed . /The moral of Dr. BUTLER 'S address is that these are international problems which we are facing , that they require international solutions , and that the sooner we adjust ourselves to this point of view the quicker will our situation be relieved . To harp upon old and worn-out formulas , most of which were never wholly true at any time , and to continue to beat the tom-toms of a crude and vulgar national vanity , miscalled patriotism , are only to prolong the national agony . It is in such times as these that we should learn at home a patriotism which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , " as ARISTOTLE defined the State , " in the quest the good life , " and learn abroad t interdependence not only of natio but of all human beings .
