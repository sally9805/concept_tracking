txt I met Otto Hillig for the first time in September , 1930 , at Liberty , in Sullivan County , a hundred miles from New York . Besides being a very fashionable photographer , Mr. Hillig was a deputy sheriff . At that time I was engaged as a pilot for passenger flights from an ordinary field . Of course the town was too small to have its own airfield , and my crier , who also sold tickets . came and told me that Mr. Hillig desired my acquaintance . He wanted me to take him for an hour in the air so he might take a number of photographs for his business . A short time afterward I asked Mr. Hillig to grant me an interview , and he invited me to his home . I had hardly entered his house when I asked him whether he would not like to finance a direct flight from New York to Copenhagen and join as a passenger . The idea of undertaking such a flight had occupied my mind for four years . ever since the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaving soap to fly for thirty-five hours without a break around their factory building . " Why not , " I asked the firm , " undertake a trip to Europe ? That would also take thirty-five hours . " Started Planning at Once . Mr. Hillig Immediately took on the idea , and the same night we started to make the necessary arrangements . We did n't make n1 ? - ch fuss about it . One step was taken as a natural consequence of another . There was no long pause between words and deeds . Mr. Hillig had on certain occasions been much spoken of and had been on the front pages of all United States papers . It was when he was refused admission to the Graf Zeppelin , about to start its voyage around the world , although he had bought and paid for his ticket and had it in his hand . He looked upon this incident as a great injustice and it made him still more desirous of making a trip across the Atlantic . Later on the money he paid for his ticket was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter . He took it to heart that he had been mentioned in big headlines without sufficient reason . He Idoes not care for ? advertisement more than other people , but all people do care for advertisement . He thinks that , if he is to be advertised , there must be some foundation for it , and it was this foundation he wanted to lay . " The first thing to do , " Mr. Hillig said , " is to try to raise $22,000 . A business man who has $22,000 in the bank without employing it is a fool . " Therefore Mr. Hillig had to make the sum available , and that took several months . On Jan. 1 the money was secured , and we went to New Castle , Pa. , to visit the Bellanca factory to order an airplane . This we did on the same day . However , the factory had no airplane suitable for an Atlantic flight . It had to be made first . and the time for delivery was fixed in the contract as March 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now so successfully accomplished its transatlantic trip , can store 600 gallons of gasoline in her three tanks . When we started we had 605 gallons of gasoline and 20 galle.is of oil , this giving the machine a weight of 7,200 American pounds . When empty it only weighed 2,450 pounds . Once back in America with our airplane and having removed the tanks and replaced them with seats , we will nevertheless only be able to accommodate six passengers . The weight of the oil and gasoline was equal to the weight of thirty-one passengers . This was the weight when we started on our trip . Would you risk traveling in an airplane conveying thirty-one passengers while it was actually designed for six ? The airplane was delivered to us in accordance with the contract , and we started the same day on a trip to Florida lasting a fortnight with the purpose thoroughly to test our machine . While Mr. Hillig returned to his business at Liberty , I undertook still more trial flights and installed the many instruments necessary for our trip across the Atlantic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty , our airplane , was in starting order . The inhabitants of Liberty , the town which had given its name to our machine , had from . he outset no great confidence in our plans . They were looked upon as a sort of innocent bluff . Most people did not believe in them until they actually saw the airplane , but then they were enthusiastic . Splendid Airfield Helped . We left our hotel at 7 A. M. for the airfield . However , we could n't start immediately , as there was no wind , and that was absolutely necessary in order to start such a heavily loaded airplane . At 8 o'clock we felt a. wonderful breeze , ten to fifteen miles . Harbor Grace has about the best airfield I have even seen . It is 4,000 feet long , sloping downward 5 per cent at the start of the run . the last part being quite level . No place could be better suited for taking off a heavily loaded machine  --  a most important factor on our trip as we contemplated our take-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure death . The moment when you feel the first air under your wings is full of indescribable excitement . We started at 8:15 , and we were off the ground before we were half way down . For the first six miles I kept a northerly course against the wind in order to get height to enable me to make a safe turning . Then we swung around and went right over the airfield . In a few minutes we had lost sight of land . It was extremely cold , the temperature being almost at zero . We put cotton and wool in our ears . I was piloting the airplane . Mr. Hillig made notes all the time . It is on the basis of these notes that I am writing this report . They were put down in his little pocket notebook with a shaking hand , the vibrations of the airplane being noticeable in them . In the course of twenty minutes we had attained a height of 2,500 feet . against us and therefore had to put on colored spectacles to withstand the strong glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 8:45 the mist grew more dense and a quarter of an hour later Mr. Hillig wrote , " Still fog overcast . " Then we went from 2,500 feet down to 1,500 feet . Thus far we had had no time to look at the ocean below us . Both of us concentrated on the airplane , and we found to our great joy that it was flying admirably . But fifteen minutes later we could not help rejoicing at the sunbeams , which were now and then penetrating through the clouds , creating a most wonderful effect . I reduced the number of revolutions to 800 in order to spare our motor . The wind was westerly and almost carried us before it . This was an excellent help , but the visibility was poor . At 9:30 the Liberty was again at a height of 2,500 feet . I looked down at the waves and observed there were no whitecaps . Consequently there could be no very violent wind . At 9:45 we were at a height of 3,000 feet , but now the wind grew in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were numbers of airpockets , and our progress as a consequence became somewhat irregular . It was getting colder , and we closed all the windows of the cabin . Filers Saw No Icebergs . At 10 o'clock the fog banked up toward the south , though there was a bright sky toward the north . We were nearing a fog bank of strange beauty . I did not want to fly through its woolly density and therefore went up to 5,000 feet in order to pass over it . The wind still increased and the caps of the waves became whiter every moment . At 10:15 we got into a shower . We therefore went still higher up . The constant vibration of our machine seemed to send electric currents through us . We soon left the shower behind us . We dropped into more air pockets and sometimes fell a hundred feet . The waters around the Grand Banks of Newfoundland are famous for their icebergs . We looked out for them , but could see none . On the ocean there was nothing in sight , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted , " wrote Mr. Hillig , " and a little while later I forced the airplane upward and reached an altitude of 7,000 feet . " Mr. Hillig had rather feared that the motor , owing to the great weight of the airplane , would run hot , but this fear proved unfounded . We now began to feel ourselves at home in the cabin and made life as pleasant as possible . Not too pleasant it was . I could net , during the whole flight , stretch out my legs . To fly in an enclosed airplane is almost the same as driving in a closed automobile . Wind Drove Plane to South . At 11:30 new fog banks came rolling in both from the north and the south . To fly over the Grand Banks is beautiful , indeed , so far as the view goes , but it affects the nerves on account of the strain . We were now flying between two layers of clouds , with a big , grim , gray fog bank about us . At noon the clouds seemed to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gulf Stream . The wind was now turning to the north . We could see it from the formation of the waves . Perhaps I did not pay sufficient attention to this , for this wind must have forced us too far toward the south . We realized that when we reached Europe . We were still so high that even if steamers had passed beneath us they would never have seen us nor we them . We were flying in a little world of our own . Again at 1 o'clock we were over fog at 7.000 feet , now in bright . sunshine . We climbed to 8,000 feet , and it was so cold that we could only let in sufficient air to breathe . The air flowing through the small opening seared our faces . At 2:30 we lunched , our first meal over the ocean , and in the nature of things it consisted of roast chicken and chocolate . I do n't think I ever felt such a craving for a slice of broad than just at that moment . We had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no plates , knives or forks . It was n't with the kindest feeling that we thought of the people in the Harbor Grace Hotel . They had packed the bread and condiments in a basket , which they had forgotten to put in the automobile . Mr. Hillig served up lunch , using as a tablecloth one of the rags used for cleaning the motor . He handed me the chicken . I grasped one leg , he the other , and in this way we parted the bird . Critical Stage of Flight . Through holes in the clouds below us we looked into an enormous abyss and far , far down were wind-lashed waves . Even if the Leviathan had been down there , it would have looked not even the size of a child 's toy . Now rain awaited us , and we whiled away the time passing messages to each other . So we came to the most critical time of our journey . We were completely enveloped in fog . Dr. Kimball , the meteorologist in New York , had warned us of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I went down to 2,000 feet , but could find no opening . The wind was now due north , a contributory cause of our great drift . At 4 : " We are now in the midst of a gale . The visibility is extremely poor , " wrote Mr. Hillig . Our general condition , our chances for getting some sleep , our food supply and our sanitary arrangements were not the best . We had ample opportunity to learn this . But our spirits were still excellent . By 4 o'clock we had climbed to 10 , - 000 feet and estimated we had covered 800 miles , with the Gulf Stream behind us . For several hours we flew between cloud strata , beautiful but monotonous . Clouds , clouds . clouds , until 7 o'clock , when Mr. Hillig calculated we were half way between the two continents . Noticed Frost on Wings . We began thinking of home for the first time . We dined off the same menu at 8 o'clock . Darkness began to fall at 9 . We were flying smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fog and climbed to 11,000 feet , and for the first time noticed white frost on the wings . That looked dangerous , but we could only rise and risk it . It was like fairland . Thus far everything Dr. Kimball had predicted had come true . At midnight we were still at 12,000 feet , and Mr. Hillig reported there was a coat of ice on the airplane 's wires . In the darkness one becomes a prey to all kinds of thoughts . I wondered why some one had not invented a cbncentrated form of gasoline so we might have carried our whole supply in a small tin . Mr. Hillig kept us awake by letting some cold air into the cabin . It literally scared us . Neither of us dared to drop off . But there was the anticipation of seeing land . at daybreak . The moon came out about 2 , and this led to our first conversation about the flight . At home in Liberty in Mr. Hillig 's enormous chairs we were always dreaming about this trip in the moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it distinctly saw the lights of a ship , and a half hour later another one . We signaled to both with a flash lamp , but got no answer . Day began to break at 4 o'clock . I urged Mr. Hillig to sleep , but he told me afterward he kept himself awake to make sure I did not fall asleep . Watched for Irish Coast . As soon as it was fully light we peered forward for a sight of the Irish coast , but to our disappointment we could see nothing . Around five I got Mr. Hillig to fill some gasoline from tins into the tank . He spilled some and could not stand the fumes . For some time it looked as if he was going to be really ill . When I threw one of the empty drums which Mr. Hillig had handed me through a window , it did n't fall through the clouds but into our rudder , where it stuck fast until we landed at K- . feld . That really alarmed me . Throughout the remainder of the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with the controls , and Mr. Hillig was feeling the same about it , he later confided to me . But both of us kept silent on our nervousness . We continued for hours . " Ireland ! " I cried into Mr. Hillig 's ear . " What in heaven 's name has become of Ireland ? " Mr. Hillig answered : " Ireland is n't so important . Just go on toward the east "  --  and he pointed forward . " Out there , " he added , " there must be land . " Far down below at 6 o'clock I saw a rent in the clouds and asked Mr. Hillig what he thought we should do . " How can I know that ? " he answered . We spiralled down , and I could see that Mr. Hillig did not like the sensation . " What will you do if , instead of land , there is water ? " he asked . " Oh , just climb again , " I replied . Sighted Land at 6:20 A. M. We proceeded thus until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , land , land ! " But what country ? We did not know . We decided it was England . Therefore I decided to keep on an easterly course to cross the country , which he knew was on the direct route to Copenhagen . For three hours we were flying over this country . It was a well-cultivated country , with rich fields and rows of fruit trees lining them . I was looking for water , expecting every moment to see the English Channel . But always it was the same beautiful country . Maybe , I thought , we had penetrated far into France . Perhaps after all we were in Spain . Still without any knowledge whatsoever as to our whereabouts , I headed northeast , hoping sooner or later to see some town or river or port I might recognize . We saw windmills , and I took it that we were perhaps over Holland . But a moment later we read on the roof of a house the word " Ostende , " and at last we were able to fix our position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon about 3 . We now felt absolutely at home . We knew we were on the right track , but we began to feel awfully tired . When we had left the coast line we were again uncertain of our position . I mentioned this to Mr. Hillig , who remarked , " Would n't it be better to land somewhere and find out where we really are ? " Maybe , I thought , our compass had run amuck . Maybe I had grown too tired to navigate properly . Landed to Ask Directions . Suddenly some big white rings below us indicated an air field . Although we had gasoline enough in our small drums for several hours ' flight , we determined to descend to ask our way and get a map which might show the exact route to Copenhagen . We landed . Around us Germans were cheering , but we were stone deaf from the drumming of our motor . We had crossed the Atlantic , we had crossed Europe and we were at Crefeld . We wanted to make an immediate restart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refill our big tank from our small tins . Instead we asked the Germans to give us fifty gallons of gasoline , but they could n't understand our English . They gave us only fifteen litres , and that was why we had to descend in Bremen . Today 's flight was only a pleasure trip over blue waters and green islands through a sunlit sky . A few hours ' flight and we met a Danish military squadron . Guided by this escort , we made a circuit of the towers of Copenhagen , and then the unforgettable moment ! Our flight was ended . Aides Preceded Them . Both of us have been met with the most touching kindness on the part of the population of Liberty . Especially Jack Beck and Frank Bridges have shown their friendship in the most tangible manner . Directly they understood the character of our plans , they offered immediately to precede us across the Atlantic in order to be on the airfield at Kastrup , Copenhagen , and they were . Much time was lost in awaiting favorable weather . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed in New York most of the time . I was there in close touch with weather reports . One evening at 11:30 I telephoned from New York to Mr. Hillig , who had already gone to bed . I told him he was to leave Liberty at 6 o'clock the next morning and to be at Floyd Bennett Field , Brooklyn . Mr. Hillig arrived there a few minutes after the appointed time and almost at the same time I landed with our airplane , which had just been submitted to a last test . Everything was to be 0 . K. This was to be our red letter day . We had ordered a lot of gasoline which was to be delivered at the airport . but owing to a mistake it arrived a day too early and was removed again . There were several movie camermen , and they delayed us for over two hours . Many of our personal friends had also appeared to take a final leave . We had tried to obtain gasoline but could not get any , and it was rather a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had just enough to reach another airport , at Teterboro , N. J. , where we took in 250 gallons . At 3 o'clock in the afternoon we were about ready to start . Could Not Find Airport . It was too late in the day to enable us to cover the whole distance to Newfoundland , and we stopped at St. John , N. B. I took a birdline to Boston and from there went across . We reached St. John , N. B. at dark after six hours ' flight and after having covered 600 miles . On our map the airdrome was shown as lying northeast of the town . However , we circled round St. John for half an hour without being able to locate it . At last we were forced to descend in a meadow where cows were grazing among small hills , the most unfavorable place imaginable , but we had no alternative . People below us were waving and pointing incessantly . They desired to show us where the airdrome was , for it was clear to everybody we were either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no sense in flying in circles . We were prepared for a rather rough landing , but all went smoothly . I am in the habit , in the face of danger , of squeezing my chum 's hand and saying , " Together we stand , together we fall . " Thus in this case our hands met . It was now quite dark . People in automobiles tames up , and a young man offered to show us the airdrome . It was not where our map showed it at all but northwest . When at last we reached the airfield it appeared we had not got the papers necessary for us to land in Canada , New Brunswick being Canadian territory . Therefore we were detained by the authorities for an hour for having infringed on the law governing flying in Canada . The next day we started ? for Harbor Grace , N. F. , our last hop before our ocean flight . On the airfield there our supply of gasoline was ready for us in ten steel containers with 600 gallons and twenty-five drums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This enormous quantity of gasoline to be loaded in our machine might well deter us . It is always difficult to take off with a full load . That Colonel Lindbergh knew . During the first part of his flight he had to go very low . We remained at Harbor Grace one day to submit our motor to a very full inspection . Harold Gatty and Wiley Post arrived the same afternoon . Their motor was fed and they started before dusk . They were able to start in the evening because they had a very fast machine . We had to wait till daybreak because the Liberty was slower and also because we had to calculate our time so we might be at Copenhagen before dark the following day . New York papers had sent photographers to Newfoundland , where they had been waiting for us and other Atlantic fliers for six weeks . For two months there had been a list of eight ocean fliers who were all to start . Mine and Mr. Hillig 's were the last names on the list . From us the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot . After us came Mr. Gatty and Mr. Post ; then followed Ruth Nichols , who suddenly crashed . We did not get much sleep that night . Morning came . It was June 24 . We got up before daybreak and had a good breakfast of corn flakes , bacon and eggs and coffee . Then we got our provisions ready  --  altogether six thermos bottles , three with hot coffee and three with water , and a roasted chicken . By mistake we left out bread , so all we ate across the Atlantic was roast chicken and chocolate .
