txt  | spread the new idea . This suggestion was rejected , however , when the actual difficulties were realized . The majority agreed that as teachers and preachers they were in a better position to make headway than by assuming an unnaturally romantic role . Since we are concerned here with a definite social attitude , let us have Clarke speak for the group he represents . It must be understood , of course , that since his group rejects standardization , his words merely indicate a certain state of mind . " The average American with money , " Clarke Thorndyke says , " considers the government an insurance agency for his private interests . His ideal is a supine President , who lets him get away with murder . The American without money , on the other hand , considers his government an inevitable evil , and pictures the representative of his country in the form of an inflated gentleman sitting on a pork barrel . " Special interests cry out against governmental interference with business every time the government attempts to do something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are like the medieval condottieri , who had their own laws and agencies to enforce them . The Pennsylvania Coal and Iron Police , for instance , are a private army of antisocial interests , usurping government functions . There is also a Pennsylvania Coal and Iron Judiciary ? not only in that State ? which metes out law in accordance with the wish-dreams of the coal and iron barons . " The Constitution of these sovereign interests knows no balance of power , and their responsibility is only to their pocketbooks . They are the President , Congress  | and Supreme Court of the United States rolled into one . Laws of the common mortal were not made for them . Nero was less immune from the laws he enacted than they are from the laws of the land . As the son of an industrialist I have met several of them , and found them charming people , who drink their cocktails like gentlemen . They also have a certain sense of humor , up to a point , beyond which they turn sour and make short shrift with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a compromise with their conscience and convince themselves of their social use . " Although some of them deal intelligently with their factory hands , they do so because they know the value of a well-oiled machine . They are intelligent enough to know that man , too , needs oiling . In my youthful innocence I once admired the humanitarian side of their work , and they thought I was joking . " Their apostles are Adam Smith and Ricardo , although they have never heard of them . These two Englishmen ? if they could come back to life ? might spend a few pleasant hours with them , although they would probably find them too conservative . These industrialists know of Marx and Lenin , but are not sure of the spellings of their names , and hate them as only people with money-obsessions can hate . One of them told me that those two anarchists should be clubbed to death like mad dogs . He was hurt when I informed him that they have long been dead . " They believe that this would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against a nicely whitewashed wall . They have a mystic respect for their own wisdom , which they measure with gold . They be- lieve that everything in nature would be well-balanced if left to its own devices . The crucial difference between them and us is that they are anarchists and we are the friends of order . We believe that mankind is stumbling from one chaos into another because of its failure to plan the very essence of its life-conduct . " You may recall the conversation of Voltaire 's Bachelor of Arts with the North American savage , which I re-read the other day . The man of science was trying to convince the Indian that this was the best of all possible worlds . He admitted that men ruined and murdered each other , but added that they all the while extolled equity and moderation . He quoted the famous calculator who had proved that from the War of Troy to the last war in North America there had been killed in pitched battles not less than five hundred and fiftyfive million six hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the ruins of cities and towns which had been set on fire . " After all has been said and done , this is our civilization . It is in order to avoid the continuation of this existence of catastrophes that we must inject some intelligent planning into our lives . This world of ours is inhabited by some two billion human beings ; blacks and whites , yellows and reds , head-hunters and Nobel Prize winners , sun-worshipers and Christians , murderers and saints . Each of them is a perfect little cosmos , with sovereign needs and ways of gratifying them . The lady on New York 's Fifth Avenue decorates her sagging flesh with thousands of dollars of silk and fur , while the  | Papuan girl wears a string of pearls and feels perfectly dressed . " Unceasing activity tries to satisfy these millions of demands . Explorers penetrate the jungles , comb Tibet , sweep the Arctic and survey the Antarctic from their flying machines . Countless people have sacrificed themselves in this gigantic search of new thrills for the palate and the eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in industrial accidents . " What holds these activities , joys and tragedies together ? My industrialist friends blandly say that the object of the world 's rotation is profit . They say that everything is perfectly balanced and , since they have a grocer 's mind , they point out that if a trader fails to find the buyer for his goods he stops carrying them and if the manufacturer finds no market for his produce he stops his machines . In theory all this is very simple , but in practice there is always a lag between supply and demand , whence the vicious circle of depressions , as we cheerfully call these plagues . " These money-obsessed individuals are the social parasites of our system . They are the ones who cause the various modern forms of plague , such as World Wars and World Economic Crises . Their fights for new markets and high-pressure hopes of stimulating the profit-making capacity of their plants are responsible for mankind 's great evils . They skim the cream , while the little fellow dies for his fatherland . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system in d factory machine they would junk it in no time . If all the hardships for which they are responsible were paid  | for by the big fellow we should have a brand-new system at once . " If our earth were an economic unit there might be some sense in suggesting that life 's natural forces are at work in balancing the economic factors . But the world of today consists of some eighty economic sovereignties , which have their own tariff policies , trade preferences , and export and import restrictions , not to speak of their grudges and hatreds . Europe is the schoolexample of this trade-criminality . There no merchandise can travel a few hundred miles without bumping against some tariff Mount McKinley . " Why do we stick to all these absurdities ? Simply because we are addicted to the interests of a handful of people against the two billion inhabitants of the earth . They are powerful ; they control our thoughts and speech . Our free speech is their free speech . Our greatness in the technical field takes our breath away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements we are centuries behind . In the pioneer days of industrialism the predecessors of these gentlemen needed encouragement . But they are no longer pioneers ? and still the public is at the mercy of their greed . Now they order government out of business , so that the place of business in government may be all the more secure . Our embassies and legations are the branch offices of their mammoth concerns , getting business for them , representing their interests abroad . Our navy is the strong-arm squad of the industrial magnates . " Clarke had worked himself into a white heat . Next he sought to show that the size of a group was not indicative of its power . He insisted that this time there  | was every chance of the battle between progress and propaganda being decided in favor of the former . In this connection , he objected to the current use of the word " radical , " which was perverted to mean something reprehensible and extreme . " The American people , " he continued , " are opposed to overseas terminology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of socialism , which seems to them alien to our soil . If this were true , he objected , the United States would be immune to the laws of human nature . Certain needs seem to have developed certain forms of social consciousness , in which some foreign countries anticipated us . Because of the privileged condition of this continent , such needs arose here at a later time . Now that they have become of prime importance , it would be foolhardy to scoff at one of the most constructive ways of dealing with social problems . It would be just as foolish as to try to exclude the sun from our country on the ground that it comes to us from the East . " At the same time , " he continued , " I have to admit that this dislike of things European has a certain justification , as that venerable old world has pulled certain tricks which it would be well for our land not to emulate . Since we like our own pet prejudices , when the time comes for us to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminology . No less an authority than Upton Sinclair maintains that as a Democratic candidate he polled at least ten times the votes he would have received as a Socialist candidate , even though his platform was no different . Socialism will come to America under a different name . " The influence of the so-called radicals is vastly  | superior to their voting strength . The older parties are gradually taking over many of our ideals , while using them as weapons against us . The New Deal has been attacked as a Socialist device , which it is not , although it has incorporated several social ideas into its program . " Some people say that our up-hill fight is hopeless , as Americans are habitually conservative . I maintain that they are no more conservative than their economic situation makes them . We are helped by the derelicts of depression , who are accumulating a vast amount of radical energy that is all the more explosive as hunger and humiliation drive them into fits of fury . Under the American system , before the record-breaking depression , everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man with little money and a large appetite considered himself a rightful aspirant to the good fortune of the millionaire . " Now , however , the social frontiers are becoming stabilized . Research has brought forth such startling facts as that about five per cent of our population controls nearly ninety-five per cent of the savings in this country . The depression-poor no longer hold the view that patience will breed miracles . Although the popular press tries to keep the new ideas from the people , feeding them with murder and family scandal , we know that not even Siberia and the knout of the Russian imperial policy could keep the new ideals from the people of Holy Russia . " Clarke 's wife , a young woman just out of college , where she studied social sciences , listened to her husband with evident approval and called attention to the  | rapid spread of radical ideas among the young people who have not as yet faced the problems of life . Mrs. Thorndyke expressed herself with the fluency of one who had a thorough training in discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am in touch , particularly young women of graduating age , are worried about the future . This is the depression generation , which has seen the economic structure of the country shattered for over six years . The parents of many of them have lost their livelihood . What are the prospects of the younger generation upon leaving college ? They are eligible to work in department stores as sales-girls at two-fifty a day , with Sundays and holidays off . Young physicians and lawyers are in actual want , and even though several months in arrears with their rents they have to act the part of prosperous professionals . All would be well if they could afford to live the way they do , but the truth is that they are heavily in debt to their relatives and their future . " Among the young people there are those , of course , who rally to any movement with an attractive name and a certain air of novelty , and who are attracted to socialism for that same reason . It seems to me , however , that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who , while not in need themselves , have the broadminded approach of unspoiled youth to these subjects and who feel that they can not stand aloof when humanity is faced with one of its great battles . " One may say of these people that they have discovered the need of a higher level of moral comfort . I mean to say that they are no longer satisfied with mere physical comforts , such as pink bathrooms and miracu- lous motor cars . These young people would like to feel the warming inner comfort that comes with the realization that one is doing one 's duty toward the community . " America being so much in love with youth , and youth being in love with progress , such a development was bound to result . This may be the younger people 's reaction to the brutalization of life . Materialism has been rampant in this country too long , and the time may be ripe for a moral awakening . Our younger generation is ready to teach its parents . Man always needs some ideal to worship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Social conscience is the only great force to save a decaying civilization . " Both Clarke Thorndyke and his wife were deadly in earnest about their belief in a new order . Before I left them , Clarke showed me a sentence in a book of Miguel de Unamuno , the Spanish philosopher , whom he was reading : " Our thought can not be divine thought , but creation and action are divine . The real God is not the God of contemplation but of deeds . " This is what makes Clarke a force to be reckoned with . Intellectuals are , after all , also enamored of action .  | NO COUNTRY has had more discoverers than France and no nation has been more highly praised , The Frenchman insists on attention and expects flattery even from the casual observer . Although France boasts of being an unstandardized country , she also likes to boast of her cardinal virtues . Many foreign observers have accepted the French view of her character . " The French mind is architectural , " said Harold Nicolson , an Englishman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Salvador de Madariaga , a Spaniard . " The French have order in their heads , but disorder in their railway stations , " wrote Friedrich Sieburg , a German . Michelet , the French historian , wrote : " England is an empire , Germany a race , and France a person . It is through personality and unity that man rates high among the living creatures . " Victor Hugo sang a paean to his country : " France is Athenian through the beautiful and Roman through the great . Besides , she is good . " We may accept the word of these authorities that the French mind is well ordered , but who can say that order reigns in the political life of France ? Since the Frenchman as a citizen indulges in an excess of personality , he lacks the faculty of putting his shoulder to the wheel  | with his fellow citizens . Hence the French political parties are loose groups preserving the individual 's independence of thought and action . The average Frenchman calls himself a radical because he dislikes the regimentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets , since the establishment of the republic more than three scores of years ago , has been less than six months . Witnesses of a chaotic session of the Chamber of Deputies in Paris are inclined to express their doubts about the architecture of the French mind . Is there any other civilized country in the political life of which the call of the moment and sudden whims carry so much weight as in France ? In less than a century France has staged half a dozen major revolutions and swung from the extreme reaction of the reign of Charles X to the extreme radicalism of the Paris Commune . The same century saw the growth of a French imperialism which is second to none , and of anti-imperialistic sentiment which looked askance even at the acquisition of the most profitable colonies . It saw the reactionary outbreak of the anti-Dreyfusards downed by the radical authors of the separation of Church and State . The little man of France was the first one in the world to ascend the throne of his country and become its autocrat . The carmagnola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution . But the same little man let himself be duped by Napoleon 's magnificent obsession , which glorified the fata morgana of his heroic strivings , while reality kept on mocking his hopes . He then let himself be trampled upon by the hoofs of the horses of Napoleon the Little , only to find  | himself the slave of the unscrupulous politicians of the early Third Republic . If there ever was inconsistency and disorder , France leads the band . Yet out of this chaos emerged the new order which gave Europe a new set of laws . The hundred years it took France to find herself have been well spent , since during that time she has acquired a new ideology . There is significance in the fact that the English and French reached democracy by divergent roads . The English took the highway of necessity , which they also found the line of least resistance . They did not argue about methods , nor try to convince themselves of the logic of their progress . They went their way , which seemed to them to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , attempted the system of trial and error in reaching their goal . Behind the barricades which the ragged inhabitants of the wretched faubourgs set up against the rule of Charles X , Louis Philippe and the army of Versailles there was , indeed , a logic and a sense of order . Instead of extemporizing with the useless , the French masses went to the very core of the problem with muskets and battle-axes . French history was the result of the effort to adjust a faulty social system to the immutable laws of nature . It was the consciousness of a better world order which stirred the tattered revolutionaries of the barricades to action . Incidentally , democracy ought to derive some comfort from the fact that two nations , whose ideals and ways of thinking are so much opposed to each other , have reached the same conclusion , the English with  | their intuitive method and the French with their rigid adherence to the law of logic . The French approach to government often leads into curious by-ways . The State is the tax collector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The State is the draft officer , and the French are not militaristic , though they are military in case of need . The State is bureaucracy , the third-degree methods of which the Frenchman loathes . The Frenchman considers the State his enemy , for which reason he wants to capture it , and he keeps on wanting to capture it even when he is in possession of it . On the other hand , the Frenchman is devoted to the idea of the nation , which is not a machine like the State , but a living body . La grande nation has the spiritual mission of shining in the darkness of the age . Although the Frenchman envies the American for his money and dislikes the Englishman for his self-assurance , he believes that as a nation he is on the very top . Nor is it possible to shake this belief , as the Frenchman has the quality of doubting his greatness only for the pleasure of rediscovering it with renewed vigor . The little Frenchman has not the self-assertiveness of the common American , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am as good as you are . " He does not need to say such things , as he knows he is as good as , if not better than , his betters . Nor is he conscious of the paradox , as his own paradoxical life makes him immune to self-deception . In no other State , therefore , is the little man as sovereign as in France . Hence the luxuriant political life of the country , which reflects the variety and color  | of the national character . Only a few of these specimens will be mentioned here to serve as examples of a larger assortment . First we shall see the man of the happy medium , who calls himself Radical and RadicalSocialist . Then we shall take a look at the conservative and bid the French dictators adieu by visiting the Left Wing soldiers in their lairs . " The nation is the territory , " said Maurice Barres .. These words should help to explain the political existence of our first Frenchman , Pierre Dupont . He would be unimaginable outside of his setting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Midi . A propos of him , a few general statements may be in place . The average Frenchman likes the romance of his home , and of the vaporous pathway leading down to the little brook . He also likes the romance of the sun and moon , not to speak of the stars , at which he looks with proprietary interest . But he likes all these things in France . Ronsard knew himself and his countrymen when he wrote that only the fish , birds and animals of the forests change their place of abode , mais l'homme bien rassis en sa terre demeure . For the same reason the bulk of Frenchmen never understand any other nation . " The world tour is not a French custom , " Paul Morand wrote . While other countries are parts of a continent , France is a closed vessel , a complete existence , in which Europe is interested , but which does not interest itself in Europe . " It was not until the year 1714 that a smuggler named Barbinais the Gentle , driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventured on a world tour , and his boat was called the Growler . " The Frenchman is so self-contained that he regards everything outside his country with suspicion , if not with dismay or outright hatred . He may be critical of himself or of his neighbor , he may call his government a bunch of profligates or crooks , and yet he will hold that the collectivity of all this , la France , is beyond reproach ? the quintessence of beauty , virtue and wisdom in a world of ugliness , sin and stupidity . Attachment to the soil makes him fundamentally conservative , but attachment to the past causes him to assume recklessly bold labels for his political loyalties . As a rule , the majority of France votes Radical and acts Conservative . Of the typical Frenchman it has been said that he is a Radical Socialist , cultivates love as an art , likes pommes frites , and saves his money for his old age . Pierre Dupont was just such a Frenchman . We are interested in him as a Radical Socialist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes . In his bearing nothing suggested his radicalism , as the term is understood in the English-speaking countries . But then he called himself a Radical Socialist because he was neither a Radical nor a Socialist , but merely a pensionnaire of the Golden South of France . M. Dupont was sixty-five , but when told that he did not look half his age ? since exaggeration is dear to the heart of the French South ? he took the compliment as his due . He had been an official of the sub-prefecture of the department of Bouches-du-Rhone . He was basking in the munificent sun on a bench of the public park of Arles , and his placid countenance was a fitting reflec- tion of his state of mind . He took a grave interest in the play of half a dozen well-dressed children , whose chirping voices sounded like the song of little birds . His eyes caressed lovingly the banks of riotous flowers which curtsied in the breeze coming from the Rhone . Apart from the subdued voices of the children and the honking of an impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread to the very limits of the universe . " Voila , monsieur , " Pierre Dupont said , " c'est la France , " and he extended his arm in a fond gesture . " Elle est belle , " he declared in a voice that brooked no contradiction , and threw a kiss at the outlines of the distant mountain , at the sky and the sun . To Pierre Dupont , Arles represented the very center of the world . We went for a quiet walk , visiting his favorite spots in the town . In the Musee Lapidaire he marveled at the sarcophagus of Cornelia Iacoena , as if he beheld it for the first time . He lost himself in the contemplation of the delicate stone flowers , the freshness of which defied time . Here , he said , the tremendous civilizing influence of classical Rome was still a potent force . Arles was Dupont 's petite patrie and he loved his grande patrie mainly because his native city was its part . He delighted in the harmonious living of the Midi . A tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughbred race written on her dark hair , her straight nose of classic amplitude and bold brows . In her , too , the beauty of the Roman race survived , but in the flash of her eyes and quiver of her calves there was the audacity and sensuality of the Vandals , Moors , Huns , Visigoths  | and early Gauls . She was dressed in rustling black and wore a white tulle neckerchief . " She is the picture of harmony , " Pierre Dupont commented with a glint in his eyes . He seemed to be ready to dwell at length on the subject of harmony , when his eyes fell on the Arlesienne 's swaying hips and he spoke no more . The bells of the Cathedral of St. Trophime struck twelve , reminding M. Dupont that this was the hour for the ritual of the dejeuner . With quiet expectation on his ruddy face , he took me to a small restaurant near the river , where he has had his lunch for the last twenty-five years . There he was received with the respectful familiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . He took his place with the solemnity befitting the occasion , facing the door . In honor of his guest , he ordered a small bottle of Sauterne , instead of the vin blanc which was his daily fare . The restaurateur , whom he called Paul , was a voluble fat man , whose great passions were Camembert and politics . Paul believed in frankness , and he made no secret of his great ambition to capture a seat in the Municipal Council of Arles . He liked and venerated M. Dupont , who represented the glamor of the official world , and he was eager to shine in the stranger 's presence . He began the conversation in the traditional vein , complaining about the policy of Paris , which , he thought , was ruining the country . Obviously , he would have been unhappy without the chance of complaining about something . Pierre Dupont listened to Paul 's eloquence with the supercilious air of a man who had once been an official  | of the sub-prefecture , and the glance he gave the inquisitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like France even a man of Paul 's social standing had a right to air his views . Around M. Dupont 's lips there hovered the complacent smile of the man who knew more than he cared to say . He began to voice his opinion with the glibness of the man who has repeated the same story scores of times . He proudly proclaimed himself a Radical Socialist of the 1789 brand , vrai republicain , impregnated with the spirit of the glorious revolution in which one of his ancestors was a citizen-executioner . The memories of the past filled him with pride , while the unheroic present brought the blush of shame to his cheeks . One of his favorite grievances was that an important street of Arles had been named after Andre Tardieu , a reactionary to the core ; and , to make things even worse , that street ran straight into the Place Voltaire . With this opening , which was both whimsical and light , he was in the very midst of the problem . What could one expect , he asked with dramatic intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Just to flaunt the capricious southern accents of his humor , he asked what one could expect of an Auvergnat ? Men of the real South would be well placed at the head of the government , as they were known for their solid republicanism and loyalty to the Revolution . But the dullards of Paris could be counted upon to miss the opportunity of looking for a political genius in a modest restaurant of Arles . At these words , Paul 's dark skin became suffused with a deeper hue , as he took this for a reference to his ambitions to qualify as a munici- pal councilor , while in reality Pierre Dupont simply meant himself . Dupont insisted that the country needed a new set of leaders , and he drained his glass of Sauterne with thoughtful grace , his innocent glance registering wonder that his audience did not burst into applause . Undaunted , he proceeded with his monologue . He feared that the age of giants was over for France and the country was falling into the mediocrity of everyday . Meanwhile the enemy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of peaceful penetration through her settlers in the French South , who will rise against their adopted country when Mussolini 's Fascist armies appear in their midst . As to the German ' itlere , he was the worst danger France has faced in her millennial history , since his poisonous political concoction appealed to a brainless and spineless generation , hypnotized by the promise of a spurious good life for all . Paul interrupted Dupont to say that , according to his information , half a million German bicyclists were massed near the frontiers of Alsace-Lorraine , waiting for the signal to invade France . Dupont silenced him with a reproving glance , indicating that when a man of prominence spoke the rest of mankind should keep quiet in dumb amazement . Several guests had ambled into the restaurant . A weather-beaten farmer of Maussane , who had come to town to sell a few head of cattle , felt impelled to say that the world was going to the dogs because industrial products were high-priced while farm products were low , and he wanted to know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away with their plot . He told the oft-told tale of the southern peasants , whom economic depression and the lure of the city were driving to ruin . One of his two sons , who had helped him in the fields , had already left for Lyons , where a silk factory offered an easy life . The other one has already begun to hint that for an ambitious young man Paris was the only fit place to live . Soon he will be left alone with his cows , forced to sell his land to an Italian . An older peasant , whom the others called Pere Jacques , joined the conversation with Southern gusto . Like his neighbors , he had a surprisingly rich vocabulary , polished in the course of numerous political talks with Monsieur le Depute in the village tavern . He had the articulate views of the man who not only talked politics but also read the editorials of the Petit Provencal . In other countries , peasants of his type would have repeated the counters of small talk , but Pere Jacques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where a clear air conduces to clear thinking and imagination is allowed to roam . " Yes , monsieur , " he began , and left time for his words to sink in , " there is dissatisfaction in France because we are a nation of individuals in a standardized world . " This sounded like good common sense , recognized as such by the approving glances of M. Dupont and Paul . " Our trouble is , " Pere Jacques continued , " that we want to have two incompatible things : to be left alone and to be helped by the government , and we are unhappy because the two can not be reconciled . Individualism is good for freedom , but standardization helps the  | pocketbook . We value both , and so the clash results . In a country where people like ourselves are used to think for themselves , it is difficult to apply the straitjacket of standardization . We are not a goosestepping nation and we prefer to muddle along with our inefficient and dishonest officials , rather than exchange them for honest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tavern talks . In France , where nearly everyone has his own taste and tries to live his own life , it is hard for standardization to assert itself . " We can not be like the rest of the world because our patriotism is an exclusive one . We consider France a privileged soil on which the type of national feeling thrives which makes us resist the internationalism of the capitalists and of the Fascists . Do n't forget that both of them are internationalists . Our own munitionmakers help Germany to arm while trying to stir us up against the Germans , so as to increase their profits . If you doubt that such a thing is possible , read the newspapers financed by the munitionnaires . Their designs are dark and their ways devious , but they know what they want and have no scruples . " As to the Fascists , they claim to worship the nation while in reality they worship their own intolerance , which knows no boundaries . The Germans of ' itlere , who say they are better patriots than any other Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal society of Germandom . Fascist Italy is trying to penetrate the East and extend its rule to other continents . It has inherited the universal idea from ancient Rome . " The lips of Pere Jacques were getting dry and he  | wetted them with a glass of cider . A young man in a redingote utilized this chance to take the spotlight from him . He was Maitre Cazes , a local lawyer , a member of the municipal council and a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies . " Pere Jacques is right , " he began with a polite bow to the old man who was wiping his lips . " Our great problem is how to harmonize our individualism with the collective spirit of the age . We French people occupy a special position as we live on an island of culture in the midst of a world that is struggling to acquire a barbarism of its own . We are the only independent nation on the Continent . Our isolation is due to the fact that we believe in progress . Since we think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix with them , for we believe they would drag us into the swamp in which they are floundering . " We are independent because the government is not our master , as it is even in such a democratic country as England , but our slave . We believe in keeping our public servants on the leash . This would result in chaos if we had not an innate sense of order . Our independence is an essential condition of our happiness . Despite the horror we saw in the World War , where else can you find so many smiling faces ? " " True enough , " Pere Jacques shouted with some heat , so as to attract attention , but the young lawyer was not ready to yield the floor . Obviously , talking was a sensual pleasure for both of them , which they enjoyed to the utmost . They found particular pleasure in their polished phrases , which could be transplanted bodily  | into print , and both of them derived inspiration from the attentive audience . " Look at the map of our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which there was no map . " You ca n't appreciate our position unless you look at the map . We are isolated from the world on all sides , except in the north and northeast . The ocean , the Mediterranean , the Alps , the Pyrenees and the Jura Mountains are the sentinels of our country . Our neighbor to the north is a friendly nation , Belgium , a large part of which is related to us by blood and language . But our great problem is the northeast ? Germany , which is a negation of all we stand for . Sometimes it seems to me as if the Germans had evolved their national character just to spite us , because they are the very reverse of what we are . Hence our obsession of l'Allemagne and their hatred of us . " The situation along our most vulnerable frontier has helped to accentuate our character and influenced our attitude toward the government . We are a rich and a thrifty nation ; the Germans are neither rich nor thrifty . Just to quote one example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money markets , borrowed extravagantly and built sumptuous swimming pools with the money , never for a moment worrying over how they would pay it back . " Obsessed with the idea that they are a nation without space , the Germans want to expand and we are in their way . They look upon our country as a paradise on earth ? which it is ? and are convinced that it is the height of impudence for us to be so rich while their lot is bankruptcy . Because of this constant threat , our  | frontiers are unsafe . Our reaction is a desire to depend upon ourselves as much as possible , and the result is that we are becoming even more isolated . " Besides , our nerves are none too good , as we are part of a shell-shocked civilization .

We are probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our great national game and we indulge in it in a way that is contrary to its nature as a freefor-all game . " What is the way out ? Some foreign and domestic observers think that we are headed for fascism . Are they right ? Will the excesses of politics force us to fall into the arms of a French Mussolini or Hitler ? And above all , can we remain a democracy even though our principal neighbors are Fascists ? " I believe that we would run counter to our own nature if we were to go Fascist . I also believe that a nation 's first duty is to remain itself . But we should not be ourselves if we were to join the goosestep parade , nor if we blew up our Chamber of Deputies . While many of our countrymen are angry with the Chamber , we can not part company with it , as it is the reflection of our own selves . Whatever else may be said against our Deputies , they are watching closely the shifts of public opinion . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nationalism , that is no reason why we too should want to run amok . Besides , we became a nation centuries ago .  | " I also discount the talk about our going Bolshevist in the near future . France will be the last country in Europe to go Communist . We are typical small-capitalists and even our Socialists would think twice before trying to put their theories into practice . I do n't speak about the French Communists , who are fanatic followers of Moscow . On the whole , we are holding up fairly well under the impact of the Right and Left collectivism . Our individualism may be the best instrument of twentieth-century civilization , and by adhering to it we may be recognized as the saviors of mankind 's superior values . " He ended his harangue with a flourish and the guests gave him a glance of approval . M. Dupont and I left the restaurant for a walk along the Rhone . Across the railway bridge an asthmatic locomotive was dragging a string of toy-like freight cars , and a small boat made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinquetailles , on the other side of the river . Peace was written all over the countryside ? on the ancient portal of St. Trophime and on the shining cannons in front of the Musee Arlatan . A couple of old men rose from their benches in the park and moved to the other side of the graveled path , in search of the sun , the rays of which gave the grass of vivid emerald a setting of pure gold . A big car of foreign make drove up to the nearby hotel and brought life into its elegant somnolence . A few Arlesiennes walked by , wearing the characteristic dress of the region . What a pity it would be if this country were regimented and its people were made to extend their arm in the Fascist salute ! The  | French are right to deplore the tendency toward standardization . Their country ought to be retained as a reservation for the last free men to live a life according to their own lights .  | MFOUCHERON 'S flat was a reliquary of the ancien regime . The moth-eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louis XV imitations . The fleur-de-lys of the curtain hangings loudly proclaimed the political religion of the tenant . The portrait of the Count of Paris decorated the wall between the bay window and the chimneypiece . His coquette barbichon and well-tailored cutaway were shown to best advantage on the colored print . The place of honor of the salon , facing the windows , was occupied by the life-size picture of the lamented King Charles X , sainted by the intransigence of his impeccably Bourbon temper . In M. Foucheron 's eyes he was the last anointed representative of legitimacy and the patron saint of the long-departed golden age . The open shelves were weighted with the ponderous volumes of Barras , Bainville , Daudet and Maurras , some of which were bound in aging white , ravaged by the dust and the sun 's playful rays , which flooded the room . The album on the table was divided into two parts , the first of which contained reproductions of the life at Versailles as seen by Watteau and his contemporaries and the other one contained pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain  | local notoriety under Louis XVI as the chief assistant to the tithe collector in the town of Orleans . It may have been no accident that this pride of the family died in 1831 , shortly after the accession of Louis Philippe to the throne . Even though a Bourbon , the bourgeois King was too democratic to suit the taste of the Foucherons . The air of the salon was saturated with the odor of patchouli , which the Foucherons held in great esteem as the official perfume of the late French monarchy . By using it in their rooms and on their persons they expressed their protest against the Third Republic . It will be seen that M. Francois Xavier Foucheron Sr. was a royalist , like many little men in France , who try to escape from the drab everyday into the glittering irreality of the past . His son was a member of the Croix de Feu , of which more will be said anon . Foucheron Pere was an appraiser in the municipal pawnshop , which had been in private hands before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the working of M. Foucheron 's mind . At the time the city acquired the pawnshop he seriously considered giving up his position . He explained to his wife that by remaining under the municipality he would tacitly recognize the legality of the Third Republic . It took Mme. Foucheron many evenings to demonstrate to her husband the inconsistency of being consistent , and she finally carried the day by assuring him in no uncertain accents that his resignation would make her leave his bed and board . M. Foucheron finally compromised with his conscience by declaring that , under the laws of the old kingdom , the purchase  | of the pawnshop was illegal , and therefore he would continue under the old management . Nevertheless , he drew his salary from the city without protest . Persons unfamiliar with M. Foucheron 's mentality might be misled into believing that something was wrong with him . Such a conclusion would be unfounded , as M. Foucheron 's mind was well balanced and the contrary impression was due merely to his patriotism . He was an old-fashioned Frenchman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anything he liked had a right to change . As he was not on speaking terms with the republic , he recognized the monarchy as the only legal power . To a non-political mind his interest in royalism may have appeared an obsession , while in reality it was nothing more than an atavistic loyalty . He had been brought up in the veneration of France 's erstwhile monarchs . One does not need to be an aristocrat to have such a background in the French Republic . His early days were spent in contemplation of the horrors of the Paris Commune , which he and his parents witnessed from the safe distance of Orleans . His father recollected having seen the balloon in which M. Gambetta made his escape from the besieged capital . Although M. Foucheron 's stories of the Commune were third-hand , they were nonetheless vivid , and as years went by they put on more color . He took delight in describing the details of the horror when the rabble of the Faubourg St. Antoine set the torch to the City Hall of Paris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuileries , the mob 's attack on the Invalides and on other treasures of old France . He gave  | praise to God that they were prevented from laying their hands on the glories of Versailles . As long as that monument of royalty stood in its magnificent aloofness he was convinced that it was destined to shelter the grandeur that had been Louis XIV 's . Foucheron Pere was old enough to remember the " disgraceful " acts of Jules Ferry , who worked against the old order with the Satanic force of a true republican . The separation of Church and State was the devil 's work , in M. Foucheron 's eyes , but it gave him some pleasure by confirming his worst opinion of the republic . He was glad to announce at the family table that , in his view , the masters of the republic had less intelligence than the simplest monsieur le cure . He added with a chuckle that French traditionalism was too strong for the faith-wreckers and that Catholicism was only biding its time . For the last thirty years he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the triumphant return of the Bourbons . He organized the royalists of the Quartier St. Euverte of his native Orleans in order to hasten the coming of the day . A retired sous-prefet added glory to the organization and Foucheron Pere was never tired of holding him up as the living symbol of French vitality . On the anniversaries of the raising of the siege of Orleans by the Virgin Joan , M. Foucheron headed the small group of his followers in the procession from the Cathedral to the Church of St. Paul . He venerated the Maid of Orleans not for what she had done for the country but for her role in saving the king . Like most good royalists , M. Foucheron derived his  | spiritual nourishment largely from L'Action Francaise , which he liked to quote in confirmation of his statements about the moral bankruptcy of the republic . From that paper he had learned that the country was in the hands of a gang of Freemasons , Communists and Jews , and he was proud of the fine distinction he made between good and bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalist party chest . He was also proud of his lack of prejudice against race , as long as the Senegalese or Indo-Chinese could be induced to help his cause . " Why do you think the republic has failed and royalism will succeed ? " I asked . " Because this is the republic of swindlers and embezzlers , " he answered . " L'Affaire Stavisky , voila la republique . Could such a scandal happen in a civilized country ? That man Stavisky was a Russian , a meteque " ? at this word M. Foucheron 's lips curled up with contempt ? " and yet the entire republic was at his feet . He entertained high police officials , ambassadors , even cabinet members . He hobnobbed with the judges who should have sent him to the gallows . . . " " Why to the gallows , cher monsieur ? He did n't kill ... " M. Foucheron had no patience with such technicalities . " He must surely have killed , in a republic like this . It is logical to assume that . You ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , monsieur ? We should have been powerless against him even if we had known about his machinations . They would have muzzled and exterminated us. "  | He repeated with emphasis : " Stavisky , c'est la France republicaine . " There our conversation rested , as M. Foucheron 's midday rest was over and he liked to have ample time to walk to his pawnshop with unhurried dignity . He had promised to introduce me to his son and I accompanied him to a corner cafe , where M. Foucheron Jr . was having his after-lunch siesta . On the way there , the father warned me that his son had a large collection of wrong ideas . " In other words , he is n't a monarchist , " I guessed . " I would n't go as far as that , " he countered with some hesitation . " He is young and wants to learn , but I warn you against his wrong ideas . " The younger Foucheron turned out to be a pleasant young man . A miniature skull in his buttonhole betrayed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a war veteran organization into a movement which its proponents exalted as the most potent instrument of French regeneration . Although young Foucheron had not been in the war , he joined the " Cross of Fire " because he believed in its aims . M. Foucheron Jr . was in the employment of a wine merchant . He had wanted to take a job with an automobile firm specializing in small cars , but later he changed his mind . His father was delighted with his son 's second thought , as he would have loathed the idea of a Foucheron selling a product that had been invented under the republic . Family tradition was strongly in favor of wine . While Foucheron Fils was not a monarchist , he could not disguise a certain sentimental attachment to the  | Bourbon cause . At the same time , he realized that the royalists were not strong enough to change the course of history . In many ways he was a typical exponent of the modern Right Wing in France . He had been stirred to action by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much admiration for Mussolini and Hitler , he had a certain respect for their movements . He praised them for being magnetic and keeping their nations from falling into lethargy . He considered inaction worse than death , and action the essence of life . In the course of our conversation he developed the idea that France was in danger of being swamped by more virile nations . The complacency of the small bourgeois dismayed him . This was a restless age , and those who failed to sense its rhythm could have no hope of getting ahead . Was this a movement for the sake of movement ? " Decidedly not , " Foucheron Fils answered . " People call us trouble-makers , reactionaries and Fascists . The truth of it is that our movement is revolutionary . People ask why we want to change the conditions of life . They say that France is not in the same position as Italy and Germany . Ours is not a frustrated country with inferiority complexes . We have won the war , our credit stands high and our national honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want and therefore we are told to keep quiet and be happy with the things we have . These critics tell us that a Frenchman should be a conservative . " This would be good advice if our world were static , which it is not . It is a dynamic world , one of endless  | fight . This is also the meaning of the post-war era , which we French must learn . In the good old days , work for the Frenchman used to be a teaser for leisure , which was supposed to be the object of life . If we worked well , it was not because we were industrious but because we were epicures . We learned that the attraction of leisure was its contrast , work . A man who gazes at flowers forever loses his sense of joy in them , and a man on a never-ending holiday has no holiday . " Besides , our nation is blessed with a certain amount of logical thinking , one aspect of which is harmony . Our delight in harmony gives us gusto for artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have never taken a fancy to factory labor , because of its lack of esthetic needs . " The idea of fight , instead of beauty , which monopolizes our life , was not a French idea . We did n't like the war and yet we won it . We do n't like this after-war World War , in which mankind is presently engaged , but we must win it . This means that in a way we must change our nature and give up our cherished ideals of esthetic supremacy , so that we may keep step with the world . Nay , we want more ? we want to lead the world . We who advocate this change are revolutionaries . " " Do you mean to say that the pugnacity of Italian fascism and German nazism is your aim ? " " I mean that the Germans will crush us if we are not on our guard , after they have cast off their republican lethargy and torn the Treaty of Versailles to pieces . I also mean that Il Duce can make his indolent Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . The Hitlerites think they have a legitimate grievance and  | try to remedy it by mass hysteria . While the Italians have no real grievance , they needed some one to cure them of their laziness , inefficiency and dishonesty ? if Signor Mussolini is right in saying that his countrymen had all these excellent qualities . " France needs no change of regime for these reasons , but she can not ignore the existence of Hitlerism and Mussolinism . We are notoriously individualistic and chaos is sacred to us , since it bears the imprint of liberty , but the Communists are about to exploit this national trait by organizing chaos , and this is one of the things the Croix de Feu wants to prevent . " True enough , our movement wants to deprive us of something which is recognized as typically French ? our easygoing life . It wants to instil heroic ambitions into us . This means regimentation to a certain extent , but it also serves the purpose of bringing us into line with the rest of the world and stealing the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Rocque , has never announced his program , " I objected . " He speaks vaguely about order , family and fatherland , and threatens parliament with a long vacation . Evidently he lacks the courage to tell his followers that he wants to rule without a parliament . Can you trust such a man to accomplish the French renaissance ? " " Many members of the Croix de Feu are no admirers of the Colonel , " the younger Foucheron answered , " although they like his idea of a closely-knit anti-chaos movement . This also shows that we are not Fascists , since we are not hero worshipers . " I admit that the Colonel has not invented a startling  | political formula , but we would have no use for it if he had . You must admit that the most successful political movements are based not on original thoughts but on primitive sentiments . The Croix de Feu stands simply for order and authority . The typical Frenchman considers both of them evils , and he loves anarchism . We think that we can take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our steps . But we must carry through this temporary adjustment if the French spirit is to live . " He said esprit francais , which means a multitude of things , depending upon one 's party allegiance . I asked him what he meant . " It is much easier to say what it does n't mean , " he answered . " It does n't mean , for instance , the French spirit as understood by the liberaux-cornmunisants- communistically inclined liberals like Herriot , who think that the French genius can be compressed into the one idea of revolution . I am just as much appalled by their conception of lawless revolution as my father is . Our revolution is law and order , harmony and symmetry . " I know that this sounds too vague , and I 'll elaborate the thought . Do you think for a moment that this world would be the same without the French ? Do you think that civilization would have reached its present stage without our active help ? First of all , try to visualize a world without the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the parliamentary system , but Iceland had a parliament long before England . It is true that the Germans accomplished prodigies of industry , but it is also true that they nullified the result by prodigies of arrogance . Taking a long-range view ,  | Germany merely perpetuated the savage instincts of the East , and is trying to give the world a Prussianized form of Slavic tyranny . As to the Italians , they gave the world dazzling performances of individual genius , but Italy gave the world chaos . Their inefficiency and corruption were proverbial . " And now what have we done for the world ? We are given credit for being gay and uninhibited , but that is n't our greatest virtue . Our great contribution to civilization is that we have taught the world how to live . All the world goes to Paris to enjoy life at its highest . Foreigners tell us that in their own countries they merely vegetate and slave , while in France they live . We have made blunders , and we could have done much better , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for France . This is my conception of the French esprit . " But France has contributed more than that to man 's common stock of spiritual treasures . It was our sense of order that inspired the world with the national idea which dominates our lives today . You have probably read Sieburg 's book , Is God a Frenchman , ? I do n't like it , because its author flaunts an acquired Gallic wit in a heavy-footed Teutonic way , but I admit that he is right in saying that our Joan of Arc was the first practical statesman to conceive the national idea and act according to its dictates . There is significance in the fact that such a tremendous idea should have been proclaimed by a simple peasant girl of seventeen . " I know enough of history to realize that in no other country could such a slip of a girl become the bearer of the greatest national contribution to history . Eng- land 's great breaks with the past originated in the brains of kings , and of those tyrants who modestly call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Prussian Junkers . Italy 's great thoughts were conceived in monasteries and in the shadow of princely courts . We in France date our conscious national life from the day when a strange vision came to a young girl in a peasant shack . Joan of Arc is a symbol of the French system of concentrated national life , made to order and individualized . " I was beginning to feel anxious for M. Foucheron 's time , but he considered it his duty to enlighten the seeker of knowledge and went on : " As you know , I dislike our so-called Great Revolution , and yet " ? lowering his voice to a whisper ? " I think it expressed our brand of order , although it did so in a baroquely distorted way . My father would disown me if I suggested to him that Robespierre represented a justified reaction to the violence which the system of Louis XIV had committed on the sense of order of the French nation . " The old order had been the guardian of a handful of people , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it did this in a sadistic way , it placed man in the center of the universe , and brought some order into the social chaos . After the rule of kings and feudal lords it was now the turn of the little man to show his mettle . " " But if you recognize the merits of the Great Revolution , " I asked , " why do you deny those of the Third Republic , which is its offspring ? " " Because , " he answered , " the republic has become  | the nursery of sybarites , faineants , good for-nothings , whose worthless leaders are usurping the power of a king . The politician of today is omnipotent , while the rest of France is merely voting cattle . " We are supposed to be strong . Our frontiers are well protected . On our 14th of July national holiday I was myself impressed by our air fleet . But presently some doubts began to disturb me . Fortifications , tanks and airplanes can not protect us from disaster . It is nature 's law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not measured by the amount of money you put into military defenses , but by a country 's morale . " Germany is a vast barrack with Prussian sergeants imposing their will upon millions of others who would like to become sergeants . Herr Hitler had tears in his eyes when he told the Reichstag of his love of peace , but his book tells an entirely different story . There he tells the world that France is the real enemy of Nazi Germany . " He plays a pastoral on his flute only until his country is ready , and then he will blow the bugles . Germany will attack us as soon as she makes up for lost time . The leader of the Croix de Feu wants to make France danger-conscious . This is the most important point of our foreign policy . " Can you expect a more explicit program ? For us it is sufficient . We are not Germans who are used to being ordered about . We do n't want to be ruled by monomaniac statesmen . Life is not an unchanging affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , of which the real statesman takes advan- tage according to the call of the moment . The only fundamental law is order , and it is this law that Colonel de la Rocque stresses , knowing that France faces ruin if it is left out of account . " Young Foucheron reached for his hat , let me pay his bill , smiled contentedly and indicated with a polite voila that the interview was over . He jumped on a street car which passed before the cafe . He did so in violation of a city ordinance , and the policeman at the corner whistled for him to get off . But M. Foucheron pretended not to hear the whistle and the policeman did not press the point .  | CAMARADE JACQUES had just quit work in the factory of the Rue Felix Faure of Saint Denis . His checkered linen cap was pulled over his right eye , leaving the front locks of his chestnut hair open to summer breezes . The fringed end of his shawl , which he wore in all seasons , was tucked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a la Russe to indicate his political faith and a crumpled issue of L'Hurnanite was peeping out of his left coat pocket . Toward the south , where the Eiffel Tower pointed a threatening finger at the sky , it was clearing , while the air of St. Denis was still thick with the odor of freshly fallen rain . The open-air market near the Basilica was a symphony of discordant sounds , the leitmotif of which was the piping tunes of the escargot hucksters . " Voyez donc , madame . . . " a fat street merchant invited a prospective buyer of carrots . " Mais , monsieur 1'agent , " a huckster expostulated with a policeman who insisted that she had exceeded her allotted space and threatened to draw up a procesverbal . An elderly man , who must have seen better days , stealthily counted his francs as he passed a butcher 's shop . He started on his way , then returned hesitatingly p 93 and disappeared into the store . A woman with a hat that may have been the height of fashion a decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snob , bought the cheapest fish and hurried away . Would Camarade Jacques give me the pleasure of his company for l'heure d'aperitif ? I asked . But he rejected the offer with a touch of resentment , his voice indicating his belief that he considered my invitation a disguised attempt of our corrupt capitalistic society to divert him from the path of communistic virtue . But he was willing to take me to the Maison du Travail , where he expected to meet some of his fellow-militants . At the Maison a round-table conference was improvised , with me in the role of the cross-examiner and devil 's advocate . I wanted to find out what the extreme Left wing of France thought about its relations with the government and State . " Are all of you Communists ? " I asked Jacques . His friends corrected me : " We are militant Communists . " Around a table covered with a cloth of peeling chintz about half a dozen of them sat . All but one of them were young . An elderly looking man half turned toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was comfortably warm , he wore a threadbare overcoat . Heavy lids shaded his bloodshot eyes , and fatigue was written on his face . The presence of an outsider put the young men on their guard and they eyed me with some suspicion . After brief preliminary courtesies they were ready for the verbal duel . " As militant Communists , " I asked , " what do you  | hope to accomplish in a country of small bourgeois ? " A touch of recrimination in my voice made them assume a hostile attitude . The elderly man feigned not to listen to our conversation . " Monsieur , " Jacques began with hardly concealed contempt for ignorance so colossal . The word " monsieur " was evidently meant as an insult . " Monsieur , " Jacques continued , " this world is full of fallacious cliches . One of them is that the English are born gentlemen , the Germans are born soldiers , and the French are small bourgeois even before they are born . Such cliches are given wide publicity by the press . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a country of small bourgeois . . . . But the word bourgeois ' was synonymous then with revolutionary , a man opposed to oppressive feudal aristocracy . " " Tu to trompes , " one of the young men , who had been lying in wait for a chance to speak , interrupted Jacques . He looked like a representative of the extreme Left in the group , and his aggressive attitude suggested that he considered the very presence of a bourgeoislooking inquirer an insult to the class-conscious proletariat . " You are mistaken , " he said , " then they were proletarians , but did not know it . The sans-culottes were real revolutionaries , proud of their poverty . They were . . . " " Tais-toi , " Jacques interrupted him sternly . " This monsieur is not interested in subtle nuances . He has come here with the common prejudice of all of them , thinking that France is the country of the small capitalists , which is not so .  | " People tell such wonderful stories about the Frenchman with the well-filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! This is propaganda . The Frenchmen are not like that . The average Frenchman is like us , a proletarian , who does n't know what may happen to him from one day to the other . " My comrade Lucien and I work in an automobile factory . That man over there is a furrier , and the others are mechanics . Until the crisis came they had work on and off ; they were terribly underpaid ? all of us were ? but at least we were not idle . Three of them were out of work for months ; I was idle for nearly a year , and now I am on part time . There are millions like us , sure only of the uncertainty of tomorrow . Do you call us bourgeois ? " " The French are thrifty , " Lucien continued , " because they have made a virtue out of necessity . They can manage to live on a pittance , and they know how to plan . If they get twenty francs a day they 'll set a part aside for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes with as little as 150 francs a month . We have always been exploited ; we are used to living on crusts . Are we therefore bourgeois ? " A third young man spoke up . He was chewing the butt end of an extinct cigarette and at the same time correcting a sheet of proof . He turned out to be the editor of a Communist factory paper , and he had a way of dropping into pompous French : " Outsiders believe our peasants are prosperous . They hear of thousands of litres of good wine being poured into the Loire and think that is a sign of prosperity . They do n't know that those wine-pouring peasants try  | to make both ends meet by living on their small savings . I know of a peasant family in the Cher-et-Loire department which makes two hundred francs a month , and every member of the family is at work . They live a primitive life . Food costs them little .

They are a little more clever , perhaps , in budgeting their needs , and that 's where they got their reputation as bourgeois . " The point settled , they lapsed into momentary silence . The next question was a thorny one , and I addressed it to Jacques : " What is your communism ? Is it a cooperative organization for the self-help of the needy , or has it a higher social aim in view ? " While Jacques meditated whether the question deserved to be answered , the elderly man in the threadbare coat began to speak : " Monsieur 's question is justified . Many so-called Communists do n't dare to face this fundamental fact . Many of them have joined the party out of intellectual snobbishness , as they are always on the trail of the latest idea . Not a few among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat rewards of membership in a young movement . But most of them are poor devils , ashamed to admit that they are trying to help themselves .  | " Most of us are hypocrites , who say that we only want to help humanity . We are supposed to be the leaven . . . We are the modern Prometheuses from whom the powers-that-be steal their thunders . But many of our comrades seem to have forgotten that they , too , are part of mankind which they profess to love . Did Lenin ever say that bolshevism is a charitable organization of spineless revolutionaries too timid to wish to help themselves ? Did Marx teach that communism was an anemic offspring of Christianity , a religion of goodwill and love to all ? " His eyes were red and his hands were in a nervous quiver . While he emptied his cup of coffee , Lucien whispered into my ear : " He got the chills in the tropics ... Working for the party . " The elderly man overheard Lucien 's remark and , turned on him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like an idiot on account of that . . . a martyr sacrificing his health and life for a noble cause . Suppose I 'd tell you that I wanted to get out of France . . . far from here . . . because of a love affair . . . now forgotten . Would you say that in that case I was not a good Communist ? Am I now a bourgeois ? " No , comrades , we are neither martyrs nor bourgeois . We are Communists because of the great injustice of the life we live . We are selfish and that 's what we should be . If everyone understood his own interests there would be no capitalistic exploitation . I tell you that this world will be a fit place for men only after it has been purged of brotherly-lovers and self  | sacrificers . Communism is the creed of healthy selfinterest ? it is real and therefore honest . " We also fool ourselves by professing internationalism . Are we really internationalists ? How many of the French Communists have ever gone outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money nor the leisure . How many of them would go abroad to see conditions for themselves if they had the choice between that and a glorious time on our own French Riviera ? " To most of us here , in the neighborhood of the capital , there is Paris and then there is France , followed by that vague la-bas , which means the rest of the world . " Do we get a training in becoming internationalists by looking at the foreigners who come to us ? There are many of them . . . hundreds of thousands each year . They are nice people , who get drunk and have their eyes on wicked things . They return home disappointed , since they know all our tricks and even more . " In short , our mentality is individualist and to a certain extent even capitalistic , with the difference that we do n't believe in a capitalism which gets fat on the sweat of the little fellow .

" Meanwhile our comrades are persecuted , while the  | governments emasculate our program and try to stay the inevitable by putting parts of it into practice . The time will come when the nations of the world wake up and realize that such half-hearted measures do no good and that the pure Marxian program offers the only way to a life worthy of human beings . " A coughing spell interrupted his talk , and the others looked at him with sympathy .

" " C'est entendu , " the two others answered . " Voila Charles , " Lucien exclaimed . " Come here , pal , and bring along your comrades . This monsieur wants to know all about our movement . By the way , where have you been all this time ? Is it true that you had been expelled ? " " It 's true , Comrade Lucien , " Charles answered with a triumphant smile . " They discovered that my poor mother was a Belgian and shipped me out of the country as a troublesome alien . Imaginez-vous , my father was a Frenchman , an Auvergnat , as dark as that great patriot , Pierre Laval , our not-so-beloved Premier . Since my father was a Frenchman , I am one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with my mother 's national- ity ? Then they tried to cast aspersions on her , and convince me that I was an illegitimate son and a Belgian . They sent me across the frontier , but I convinced the Belgians that I am a really dangerous Communist , which made them believe my word that I am not a Belgian . So they proved to the French that I am a Frenchman and ? one voila , here I am . " " Do you see , monsieur ? " Lucien turned to me . " These are democracy 's ways . If they ca n't kick you out legally , they do it illegally . " This set our conversation on the question of democracy versus fascism . " Is not the choice of France between the two ? " I asked . " No , monsieur , " Lucien answered , " the choice is between fascism and communism . The story of our Comrade Charles proves the point . France is already a Fascist country , otherwise they could not have done with him what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow slaves , but not so popular with his employers , who discovered that he was a thinking man and therefore potentially dangerous . He was dangerous indeed to them , as he is an old hand and knows how much the bosses make and how little the laborers get . He was not a man to keep this information to himself . . . . He had left the Socialists because he thought they were pussyfooting . " One of the men who had come with Charles interrupted Lucien : " He put up the question to us . I still remember when he asked us : What do you call the man who holds you up with a revolver and demands your money or takes  | your life ? The bosses are worse , because they take both . ' This was what he said . " Lucien listened to him with some impatience , as he considered convivial talk a sort of football , in which he wanted to play the star role . " What would Mussolini do with Charles ? " he asked in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a confino . And Hitler ? He would put him in a concentration camp . In our republic we do these things with a little more courtesy , but in the real Fascist spirit . We calmly declare that Charles is an illegitimate son and is therefore not entitled to breathe the air of our virtuous country . The idea of dealing with undesirables is the same and only the methods are different . " " Can you imagine France as a communistic country ? " I insisted , addressing myself to all of them . " Do you think that the people of Provence are ready to give up their olive groves to a French kolkhoz ? Do you suppose that the vignerons of Champagne and the Loire are ready to subordinate their will to a bureaucrat in a Paris government office ? Can you imagine the fishermen of Bretagne risking their lives in the interests of a soulless cooperative venture , of which they would be the paid employees ? What would happen to your French individualism ? " It was Jacques who took up the challenge : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he is logical , he can not help seeing the sensible side of life . France was the first great European nation to break the power of feudalism after it had degenerated into an organization of wholesale robbery for the benefit of titled gangsters . From the point of view of the  | lord this arrangement was logical , as he had everything , but from the point of view of the serf it was illogical , as he had nothing beyond the privilege of working himself to death . This absence of logic avenged itself in the French Revolution , where the final argument was expressed by the guillotine . Whatever its enemies may say about that charitable instrument , it did express a great thought with clear-cut emphasis , although sometimes with a deplorable lack of impartiality . The idea was that the social parasites must be exterminated . " After the passing of feudalism , France went through various stages of illogic , and settled down to a capitalistic democracy , which seemed to be a great improvement over the previous world order . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fellow-creatures . As it contained the theoretical possibility for everyone to bully and oppress his neighbor ? if he was stronger ? the system was hailed as just and equitable . " It was soon discovered , however , that too much justice of this kind was unjust , because the unscrupulous go-getters ensnared the people with their moral principles . The result was the chaos of today . Would any honest man dare to assert now that wealth is the reward of hard work , clean life and daily prayer to God ? I believe we may safely agree that it is the reward of a lack of social conscience . " Now , therefore , if it is true that the Frenchman is accursed with logic , then he must become a Communist , taking the power out of the hands of the few and entrusting it to the community . " Our peasants ought to know by this time what it  | means to live under a regime of utter chaos . It was not only the World War that devastated thousands of French homes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far back as man can remember , those homes have been devastated by feudalism and capitalism . Our peasants lost some four billion gold francs in Czarist Russia after they had let themselves be fooled into giving their money to the Little Father 's bottomless treasury , so as to help our bankers get rid of their bad securities and help our military people obtain the services of an unreliable ally . " Going back into more distant history , it was not the big fellows who lost their cows and houses in the gloriously criminal expeditions of Napoleon the Mass Murderer . Nor was it they who contributed the five billion gold francs which represented the tribute of the Third Republic to Germany at the end of the Franco-Prussian War . " If he is as logical as his reputation , the Frenchman must crave a regime under which no nation covets its neighbor 's wealth and no crooked banker steals his money . Under an international regime of communism France will not be periodically devastated , as she has been heretofore . " Using your capitalistic language to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant in the hands of a few unscrupulous pushers whose only qualifications are strong elbows and loud voices . Imagine further that in this lunatic factory there is a complete absence of coordination among the various departments , where every laborer does what he likes , attempting to outwit his fellow non-workers in an effort to make an easy  | living at their expense . You will realize that such a plant could not survive its follies . " Yet the case of our civilization is entirely similar . We are such a crazy plant and we do such mad things . I go a step further in asserting that this kind of capitalism defeats its own purpose . It perpetuates folly by keeping people from becoming real capitalists and exposing them to never-ending dangers . Under this system only a few people can become dictators of our economic life , while the bulk strives to reach the impossible . " Jacques put up an argument for force as a means to ultimate good . He showed himself an apt pupil of his favorite author , Anatole France , whose paradoxical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he almost lost himself in contradictions merely by chasing a happy phrase . The men at the table formed smaller groups , and the hubbub became general . Jacques ' eloquence stimulated them , and the cheap aperitif brought wan smiles to their careworn cheeks . The elderly man in the threadbare overcoat looked blankly into the smoke-filled air , pursuing his thoughts in silence . A taxi chauffeur ordered a demie-biere , saying " dark , of course , " with the air of a man who expected all the world to be acquainted with his tastes . Hardly had he begun to quaff the foaming brew when , at the sight of a prospective passenger , he quickly drained his glass and resumed his place at the wheel . " This , " the elderly man murmured hoarsely , " is our civilization . . . The chauffeur comrade is afraid to lose a franc of income and deprives himself of life 's  | pleasure because of fear . The glass of beer tells the story . " But the others were less inclined to take the incident on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alcohol began to work their magic on their brains . They were talking themselves out of a dejected mood , enjoying the flow of their oft-rehearsed arguments . Now that they had convinced themselves once more of the justice of their cause they looked at themselves as pioneers and martyrs , and enjoyed their plight . Life seemed to have achieved its broader purpose and the future no longer appeared so bleak . The Frenchman 's native optimism lit up the faces of these iconoclasts , who for the last hour had been trying to convince themselves that life was a hopeless muddle . The glow that suffused their cheeks made them look different . Jacques took Lucien by his arm and offered to take him to a club where young proletarian women did the honors . The elderly man drew his overcoat tighter around his angular figure and bade the company good evening with a bloodless smile . The small crowd dispersed ; one could hear the voice of Charles before he turned the corner : " The capitalists are making a great mistake ... " " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight in the company of Lucien , " where do you think the present regime is most vulnerable ? Where can you make your influence felt ? " And Jacques answered with the pleasant smile of a man in a slight daze : " On the barricades , monsieur , on the barricades ! "  | THE study of national characters is a study in shifting sand . Who could say what a Frenchman is , and what a German ? Every man is the reflection of his own idea of the Godhead , which is never the same . Who knows but that among the desert 's grains of sand there are boastful and pugnacious , modest and peaceful ones , having their own personalities , as nature moves them in its well-ordained caprice of infinite variety ? Napoleon did not affect the course of cosmos more than do the dust particles dancing in the sun . National character is something arbitrary , existing only in the imagination . But imagination may be instrumental in molding individual character so that the unreal becomes real ? more powerful , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is but what he thinks of himself , and he will act in accordance with the conventional idea of how he should act . A German is even more likely to act according to artificial formulae , as the urge for unity is stronger in him . Man can externalize his power only in the company or on the back of others . Julius Ceasar in tropical jungles , on the mountains of Asia , or as a lone figure on the great plains would be just one helpless individual against nature , and his chances of survival would be slim .  | In its noblest sense , nationality is personality placed at the disposal of a higher aim . But nationality , as it is currently used , is often the device of the unscrupulous to exploit the weak . The German is more apt to fall a victim to the nationality mania , as the nation-idea is new to him . The World War was the first great conflict in which all Germany fought on one side . The last great war previous to that was the Franco-Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Different ideas of nationality explain much of the difference on the two banks of the Rhine . The mother of French unity was Joan of Arc and the father of German unity was Bismarck . Between the lives of the two four centuries passed , fraught with momentous changes . Meanwhile Rome saw the rise of Wittenberg , and the western man 's mind broadened to include two new continents . The ideals of poverty , shining on the sky of St. Francis of Assisi , yielded to the Puritan ideals of prosperity as the reward of worthy life . The religious mentality of the medieval man yielded to the pragmatism of the trader , and the world , formerly the battlefield of ideologies , turned into a battlefield of trade rivalries . The profit motive took the place of the religious motive , and the passivity of an agricultural civilization yielded to the activity of an industrial one . The nationalism of the Maid was romantic and religious , while that of Bismarck was commercial and military . The former was defensive , against the desecration of the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a response to the call for trade expansion . The roles of the Maid of Orleans and of Prince Bis- marck are typical of the nationalisms of the two countries . Without these two historic figures ' help , much of the difference between the attitudes of the two peoples to their governments would remain unanswered . Although at her trial by the Holy Inquisition the Maid resented the prosecution 's references to her as a shepherd girl , she actually was a young peasant woman . How the girl of Domremy found the ancient sword of Charles Martel with which she hewed her way to victory , and how St. Michael , St. Catherine and St. Margaret conversed with her may forever remain mysteries , but there is neither mystery nor lack of meaning in her lowly origin , symbolizing the basic fact that French nationalism took roots in the deep . Richelieu , Mazarin and the other lights of the moribund ancien regime merely institutionalized the idea of the Maid of , Orleans . Prince Otto Eduard Leopold von Bismarck , later Duke of Lauenburg , father of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . Although the idea of national unity had been broached by the revolutionaries of 1848 and the Frankfurt Parliament had vainly tried to bring it to an issue , it was for the Prussian Junker aristocrat of Schonhausen to accomplish the great feat . Nationalism in Germany , unlike that of France , did not originate in its popular community-conscience , but in the will of the ruling class . History has , indeed , predisposed the German to wait for a clue from above , instead of generating it out of himself . His ancestors had to endure the rule of scores of petty princes .  | Und platzt ein Fass Petroleum , So stinkt das ganze Fiirstentum . The rule of these princes was regional , and the idea of nation was high treason to them . They represented authority in the form of the mailed fist of the strongest . There were only sporadic attempts to give the multitude its money 's worth in the form of protection . Even though they wore crowns and their retinue included scarlet-robed justices and hangmen , these rulers were nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal right to enforce loyalty to a criminal cause . In France such regional majesties had long before been absorbed in a united kingdom . In Germany , however , the process of absorption was prevented by geography and wars between the Empire and the Pope . Germany has open frontiers , lying athwart the transcontinental highway on which Asia swarmed into Europe . Constant raids of the East on the West kept the Teutonic lands in a state of chronic irritation and prevented the tribal units from coagulating . When the German kings decided to exchange the reality of power for its semblance by becoming Holy Roman Emperors , the fate of these northern parts was sealed . Throughout the centuries a state of chaos prevailed there because of the battle which the spiritual and secular arms of a supposedly universal power fought for hegemony . Rome would have been inconsistent with its own nature if she had admitted the supremacy of the sword over the cross . Although the diplomatic maneuvers of the age are largely unex- plored , enough is known to see that in this warfare neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the emperor took a strong course , his domestic troubles increased . The princes could count upon the reward of their insubordination to the supposedly supreme master of the secular arm of a world power . Germany had also the bad luck of being tied to the declining star of the House of Hapsburg , the members of which were Holy Roman Emperors for six centuries . This ambitious dynasty saw its rule better safeguarded by keeping down the individual German States and fomenting discord among them . This policy came to an end only when Prussia took the lead and ousted the House of Austria from its seat of might . Germany 's national awakening came with a vengeance , and , as is usual in such cases , the reaction was commensurate with the amount of lost opportunities . The Reich lacked the training-school of individualism which the French revolutions have provided . It fell from one regimented excess into another , always at a word of command from above . It would be erroneous to say that all Germany is addicted to the goosestep . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of individual freedom , which , however , was counteracted by Prussia 's dominating influence . Prussia grew powerful for two principal reasons : first , because her rulers were clever enough to benefit from the decay of the Hapsburg empire , and , second , because her uninhibited spirit of aggression was in harmony with the militaristic era into which she was born . A perfect specimen of the intolerant spirit of the age , Prussia became the object  | of the world 's hateful admiration . While fighting Potsdam 's spirit , nearly all Europe became Prussianized . The liberal republic of 1918 , known as the Weimar republic , was not in the line of spiritual succession with imperial traditions and so it had to fall a prey to reaction , whether it was the National-Socialism of Adolf Hitler or the Nationalism of Alfred Hugenberg . Within a decade Germany swung from Left to Right , and from a liberal democracy reverted to military autocracy . Which will be the Reich of the future ? Observers of the fluctuating values of history will not be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such cosmic upheavals the inconstancy of unstabilized nations has scarcely any bounds . They also realize that nations , like men , are composed of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , who alternately stamp their characters on the country . If nations consisted of individuals with definitely-made-up minds about party adherence , public opinions would be more stabilized . But individuals are vacillating even in matters of vital personal concern , not to speak of State matters , with which they are only slightly familiar . Besides , in days of stress and strain they are more easily amenable to outside influences , parading old formulae in the guise of new ones . A magnetic personality , a pleasant voice , stirring music , a new party flag or uniform are dear to German hearts . They also like to be wooed and give themselves with verve , transposing their desires into the traits of the Leader they want to adore . In this connection , the difference between the modern autocrat , such as Hitler , and that of olden times also deserves a moment 's reflection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useful to anyone but himself and his henchmen . His government was an incorporated robber gang with no responsibilities . The story of Spartacus and of the Gracchi shows how even so-called liberal Rome repelled outside interference with her tyrannical business imperialism . But it was only under the Empire that the ruthless nature of tyranny revealed itself . A Roman tyrant like Caligula spent the public 's money with monstrous lavishness , " drinking off and quaffing most precious and costly pearls dissolved in vinegar , " Suetonius writes , " setting upon the board at feasts loaves of bread and other viands . . . all of gold , saying commonly withal , that a man must either be frugal or Caesar . " The modern Caesar , on the other hand , plays up to the grandstand with his frugality . While he arranges blood purges not less hideous than those of the imperial madman , he will plead that they are for the common weal . A dictator who openly admits that he despises the crowd would be inconceivable in Europe . The fact that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an implied charge , but as long as he screens his real opinion the dictator-worshipers will abide in their faith in him . In Germany 's case the victory of National Socialist dictatorship implies a pathological phenomenon . Adolf Hitler came forth as the representative of the German Everyman , bent upon realizing his fondest wish-dreams in his own deeds . He was ready to reenact the legend of St. George and the dragon . Millions of little men without political schooling derived pleasure from performing a great deed through proxy . Many of these  | little men have not the political intelligence to realize that by investing one individual with arbitrary powers they are really dethroning themselves . The German who takes delight in being one of the herd merely follows the line of least resistance to fame , and admits his inability to care for himself . " I am a weakling , " he concedes , " and my fist is a figment of imagination . " It would be a mistake , however , to think that the Nazi regime is what Hitler and his backers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to the little man but also to the big fellow , and the industrialists of the Ruhr and Westphalia saw that he was a man they could rely upon . They saw that his socalled socialism was merely a bait to attract the New Deal-hungry masses . They knew that his movement could be used as a means to divert attention from the real issues , and they helped Hitler climb to the highest peaks . They were even more dishonest than he was . And yet what has happened ? In spite of his obligations to the industrial magnates Hitler has been forced toward the very kind of socialism he despises . He has been compelled to enact economic and financial legislation , which his Socialist predecessors never even tried to put through . Today the German Reich seconds Bolshevist Russia in a system of State-controlled production and distribution . The government has full charge not only of the flow of money , but also of imports and exports ; it controls factory outputs and agricultural work . It has the power to keep branches of industry closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close watch on the trend of trade . It was the masses who forced Hitlerism into this  | direction and gave National Socialism a different aim . This is one of the most telling instances of a dictator receiving dictation from his subjects . But Germany is not all-Nazi , and so the following chapters will deal with several aspects of public opinion in the Reich and even among the exiles . The Hitler regime can claim complete victory in muzzling the press and speech , but human thought sometimes refuses to obey the mailed fist . Johannes Fest was a National Socialist , who believed in the Third Reich with religious fervor . He was a member of the lost generation , born a few years before the war . His childhood in the German frontier town of Passau was spent in an atmosphere of hero worship and short potato rations . He was thrilled with the music that accompanied the battalions , which were to perish in Northern France , to the gaily-bedecked antechamber of their mass graves ? the railway station . Since he was too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival of music , uniforms and flags , until his father was wounded at Passchendaele , and sent home to await the end . His father 's presence at home ? a sad and broken man belied the beauties of war as told at school and in picture books . Being an unsophisticated boy , Johannes accepted life as it was , taking hardships for granted . Under normal conditions he would have been apprenticed to a haberdasher , become a shop assistant , married and died in due time , after having consumed an ocean of beer and mountains of good sausage . He was the kind that could  | be made happy with little things and his desires for romance would have been gratified by weekly visits to the neighborhood cinema . He would have perused the columns of his paper , headed " World Events , " with the mild interest of one who was not concerned . He would have fulfilled his civic duties by voting for the candidates of a middle party and would have remained a loyal subject to his Majesty the King , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of civic somnolence Johannes would never have grasped the meanings of such words as " inflation , " " devaluation , " " socialization " and " autochthonous . " But even though his vocabulary had not been enriched by such Latin and Greek words he would never have felt that his life was less abundant because of that . Such a life , however , was not the lot of Johannes Fest . He was yet in his teens when he became initiated into the mysteries of currencies in the most startling way . The hundred-mark bill , which in his childhood was a little fortune , had lost its value to such an extent that tens of thousands of its kind were scarcely sufficient to buy a loaf of bread . One day the red flag was hoisted on the Rathaus , and he was told that the Socialists were at the helm . For a few days the Communists held power , and the flag remained the same . One morning the red banner was found in the gutter , and upon the southern breeze fluttered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republic was hoisted , only to be replaced by the flag of the imperial Reich . The town was charged with excitement when Munich , the Bavarian capital , flashed word of a bloody rebellion ,  | in which the army of the republic mowed down the followers of a man called Adolf Hitler . This was in 1923 , and Johannes was not yet fifteen , an apprentice in the bootery of Franz Ramesdorf in the Rinderstrasse . Like many German boys of his age and station , he already had articulate views about politics and could even tell the difference between the programs of Socialists and Communists . At that time he thought Stresemann conservative and Hofrat Hugenberg a vicious reactionary . Although his ideas on politics did not shine with originality , he was voluble on Weltanschauung and the philosophy of life . He found as much excitement in the world events of the newspapers as he would have found in the books of Jules Verne before the war . He condemned Hitler for his abortive " Beer Hall Putsch " and was glad he had disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people then , to return to it again . At twenty ? a clerk in the same bootery ? Johannes joined a young men 's club of the Bavarian People 's Party , where he assumed a left-wing stand . At one time he even flirted with the thought of joining the Socialists , and he would have done so if their party organization had not fallen into decay in that part of Bavaria . He was old enough to vote at the Reichstag elections of 1930 , and his disappointment at the comeback of the Hitler party was keen . Then , one day , he lost his job ; and , while waiting for his dole-book to be stamped as part of the ritual of receiving his weekly pittance , something snapped in him and that night he visited a small group of Socialist young people . He was bitter ,  | his good-natured resignation gone , ready to mount the barricades in defense of a cause ? almost any cause ? that could fill his heart with glow . But the Socialist leaders told him to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate the Communists , despise Hitler 's Nazis , and believe in better days . Although Johannes found the leaders eloquent , he could not warm up to them . Johannes Fest might have been satisfied with the cool aloofness of the Socialist bigwigs if his desperate condition had not egged him on to try new political adventures . Like a good German , he expected collective relief for his troubles . Since the short-lived Communist rule , the party of the Third International could not operate under its own name in the city , and it had to lead a camouflaged existence . Nevertheless , Johannes found the most conveniently located cell and was hoping for miracles from his new allegiance . He liked the Communist speeches , which were peppered with the strong words he admired , and he was ready more than ever to perform great deeds , so that he might be spared the humiliation of the dole line . He soon found that the speeches were mostly about the woes of the proletariat in China and kindred subjects , inspired by Moscow 's preoccupations . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chinese worker and could scarcely restrain himself from declaring a private war on the Japanese , but soon his enthusiasm gave way to a new spell of despair . It was in that mood that he let himself be prevailed upon to attend a Hitler meeting , to which he went to jeer and not to cheer . The music was the kind he could not help liking , in spite of his association with So- cialists and Communists . While he derided the theatricality of the evening , he could not prevent his heart from beating faster when the gates of the auditorium were thrown open and in marched a detachment of wooden soldiers in the shape of the Hitlerite brown troops , carrying a forest of flags . The suspense that ensued preluded a climax that came with Hitler 's appearance on the stage . In Hitler 's words there was an emotional intensity that carried the audience away . He did not speak of China , but of their own troubles , as expressed in the plight of the fatherland . In an emotional outburst he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made them hate all who were not National Socialists , and with his words he raised them to the status of aristocrats of blood . Although he was not specific about the future beyond saying that it would see Germany shining with glory , his attacks on the past sounded like the bugle calls of a new age , in which all German-Aryans would live as heroes , free from the shackles of Versailles and personal privation . Johannes Fest went home from the meeting with the idea that he had heard a first-class demagogue who was familiar with all the tricks of the political backstage . He was ready to admit that the show was perfectly managed , and that every detail had been worked out by an unscrupulous genius pulling the wires on which the Chaplinesque Fuehrer performed . But he liked the spectacle so much that he went a second and a third time . By then the insidious propaganda had penetrated his pores , and he was beginning to argue his previous allegiance out of himself . He let himself be persuaded  | that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already convinced that the Treaty of Versailles was a monstrous injustice ? even before he had known what a treaty meant or where Versailles was . But now he began to fume with rage at the work of the peacemakers and felt a sense of personal humiliation because of them . Surely , he thought , the Socialists and Communists should not have allowed such things to pass . At the next meeting Adolf Hitler shouted that the Socialists and Communists were the real authors of the Treaty of Shame . Johannes Fest answered in thought that in that case the Socialists and Communists were traitors , and he no longer attended their rallies . From that time on , his patriotic grief over the Treaty of Versailles left Johannes no peace of mind . He discussed it with his comrades and lulled himself to sleep with the promise that all would be well after the great German awakening . Gradually , a great change took place in him . His personal despair was submerged in the despair over the affairs of the country . He became convinced that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , international finance , Socialists and Communists . His heart went out to Adolf Hitler in rapturous self-denial . The work of the genius of publicity who was pulling the wires of the demagogue began to make its effect felt in earnest . The pan of praise of millions turned into hysterics . The Nazi rallies , which had been revivalist meetings , became orgies of voodoo worshipers . The barrage of propaganda made Johannes Fest lose his senses and adore the Superman , unthinkingly , unfeelingly . He did not try to rebel against this obsession .  | Hitler became Chancellor of the German Reich and Johannes transferred to him all the unconsumed affection he had accumulated during his wanderings in the political wilderness . He wanted desperately to abandon himself to the thought of having a superior being watch over him ; one whom , in return , he could worship . He was told that such a worshipful attitude was a sign of strength . Being happy in his loyalty , he did not realize that it was a sign of weakness . He also got his job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wittelsbach of Passau . The public square before us was a picture of uniformed animation with storm troopers , black-uniformed special guards , aviators and members of the army , the Wehrinacht . A group of the Bund Deutscher Madel marched by , little Gretchens with plaited hair reaching down to their waists , wearing little brown jackets over white blouses . They were followed by a group of the National Socialist Frauenschaft , rosy-cheeked South-German women , slightly aghast at their own temerity in thus showing themselves to the world . Johannes was flabbergasted when confronted with the question as to why he admired Hitler so much . His honest features registered the incredulity of a man who doubts his ears . Could one help admiring the sun and the rushing mountain torrent ? " Adolf Hitler , " he said , " is our Fuehrer . . . you must know that he saved our country . From whom ? From the Jews , Communists , Socialists , pacifists . He gave us our army and " ? with the inspiration of a man who has just found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came we were Bavarians , Saxons ,  | Badeners , and now we are all one nation , following one Fuehrer . He wiped off the shame of Versailles . " The ice thus broken , he spoke about the Nazi movement as his personal property . He loved his uniform . He was a Sturmrnann of the 4th Standarte of the 11th Sturm . He pronounced the figures slowly , so that there should be no mistake about them . He was proud of those figures . A Truppfuehrer entered the cafe , a higher officer of the storm troopers , and Johannes jumped to his feet , clicked his heels , and his body became a stone statue for a moment . He was proud of his superior officer and of the privilege of obeying him . He would have loved to display his loyalty in some spectacular way , such as saving the life of the officer or ? even better ? of the Fuehrer himself . He talked fast , anxious to pour out all the enthusiasm that was in him . He spoke both of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more important . His devotion to Nazism was a personal one , expressed in unconditional surrender to a personal savior . The Fuehrer 's triumph was his triumph , the Leader 's greatness was his greatness . He spoke about the Jewish question , or else he would have been no Nazi . In a moment of frank confession he regretted that at one time he had misjudged the Jews because of the few specimens he had known . Now , however , he knew all about the real Jew ( he emphasized the word ) since he was a regular reader of Der Stuerntier and had also heard its editor , Julius Streicher . Did he realize how much German Jews have contributed to the greatness of the Reich ? At this question his face hardened and a glance of  | hostility stole into his eyes . He answered that the very term " German Jew " was a contradiction . A medieval monk could not have been more attached to a dogma than Johannes Fest was to the racial dogma of the Nazis . He could not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse . Nor could he let it go without giving up his much-cherished idea of racial superiority . Einstein 's so-called discoveries did not amount to anything , because he was a Jew . Johannes , an Aryan member of the Nordic race , was superior to any Semite . What was the essence of Hitlerism ? " Strength , " he answered , and he invested the word with a magic of its own . It was not a means but an aim , and in this subtle distinction the difference between heresy and true faith rested . Strength was hard , like flint ; the very reverse of love , which was the medium of religions . He had little use for Christianity after having heard Dr. Alfred Rosenberg , a high-priest of neo-paganism , who described Christ 's religion as a Jewish plot to make the love of the weakling the gage of merit , while force was outlawed from the arena of life . " What we need is will , will , will , " he repeated the Fuehrer 's words . " It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , the same as we execute his will . " He recognized that there was a hierarchy of will . The will of the Fuehrer was supreme , and it was also infallible . " The will of the multitude gained momentum only through Hitler 's sublimated will . " " Is mass-will the expression of a strong individuality ? "  | He did not grasp the sarcasm of the question . Will appeared to him an all-penetrating unity , effective only within the nation and for its benefit . The individual will exists only in the national will . " Common weal precedes private weal . " Obviously , Johannes Fest was ' - an apt student who knew his lesson by heart . " Through this uniform , " he said , and touched his brown tunic to make it appear more real . He meant by this gesture that , by putting on the uniform , Johannes Fest lost his identity and became part of a larger unit , a nation in arms , the strength of which he assumed . It was for the German what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his individuality and the acceptance of a higher morality . With his uniform on , he became part of a cosmic force which made his own private world live . Another young man in uniform ? a very tall one ? entered the cafe and went straight to Johannes . His lanky arms and legs were joined together in such a way as to make one fear they were going to fall apart . " My friend Hoefer , " Johannes introduced him and added proudly : " He is my superior officer . " " Heil Hitler , " Hoefer saluted . " Guten Tag , " I answered . Hoefer was a farmer 's son from somewhere near Passau . His father 's farm had been heavily mortgaged , so that he had to sell part of it , and there was not enough work for him and his son on the rest . The young man decided to try his luck in town . He had discovered the Nazis long before they came to power , which made him the envy of his comrades , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be  | a man of few words . Johannes lapsed into silence , so as to give me a chance to interrogate his friend . " Why are you a National Socialist ? " The same incredulous look appeared on Hoefer 's face I had seen before on Fest 's . A clumsy jerk of his uncouth body indicated that he was about to resent the question , but Johannes repeated it to him with emphasis , as if to show that foreigners were sometimes queer . " Why I am a National Socialist ? " Hoefer asked . " But every one must be a National Socialist . . . all Germans . I am one because I am a German . " What did it mean to him to be a member of the Hitler party ? He recalled the stock phrases of Nazidom from the innumerable addresses he had heard , and repeated them with the glee of the schoolboy who knew the day 's assignment by heart . It was a list of words denoting hatred in various forms . He was excellent at hating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . He poured his scorn on the Jews . Had he known many of them ? " There is a Jewish merchant in our village . " Was he a wicked person ? " He must be . . . he is a Jew . " Why did he hate the French ? Had he seen many of them ? Yes , he was in the trenches at the age of eighteen , in the last year of the World War . Then he told a story which he must have told many times . In the last great German offensive , not far from the Marne , he had fallen into a deep hole , so that he almost broke his leg . Next to him there were two Frenchmen , half buried  | in the mud and debris . They held up their arms , shouted " Kamerad " and wanted to surrender , but he killed them with his bayonet , and got a medal for his valor . He told this story in order to show how little use he had for the French . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstraction than as a reality , because they were involved in the conspiracy to damage the German fatherland . Like most Germans , Hoefer tried to have a Weltanschauung , and since he was a simple soul , his philosophy was also simple . " Pointcarrae . . . Pointcarrae , " he repeated , mispronouncing Poincare 's name . He was proud of his knowledge of the foreign statesman and a haughty look in his eyes revealed how much he thought of himself in that moment . That word made him feel like an expert in foreign affairs , a seer into the secrets of time . So ein Frevndwort ziert den ganzen Menschen . Trying to find the causes of his strong political reactions , I asked him about his previous party allegiance . Had he ever belonged to any other political party ? He answered with a decisive No . Had he ever admired a leader as much as Hitler ? His answer was a loud No . He had been the forgotten man in politics , about whom none of the former ruling parties cared , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lout . The Socialist party distrusted him because he was a peasant and the bourgeois parties did not want him , as he was not of good birth and had no social standing . He had been one of the millions waiting for a political Messiah to release them from their tongue-tied bondage to a religious vacuum and give them a string of catchphrases to ornament their empty lives . He had been one  | of the millions who could neither live nor die politically , and so the religion of nationalism and hatred fell on fertile soil . Once the idea dawned upon them , Hoefer and his fellow-converts performed miracles of brutality in the service of the Cause . Their simple-minded faith resented doubt , and considered disbelief high treason . Being Germans , they wanted to march in solid columns , and having lost their gods in the trenches they wanted a new belief . It was their faith to express the new religion with the goosestep and outbursts of hatred . When Hitler took power , dreams came back to these formerly forgotten millions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Frederick the Great , when Germans were looked upon as barbarians and their name was feared . They remembered the call to arms after the Napoleonic wars . It seemed to the more intelligent of them that even the German Second Empire of the Hohenzollerns had something to offer to racial pride in the form of a powerful army , which struck terror into alien hearts . The efficiency of the Prussian steam-roller had no match . Hoefer was not sufficiently articulate to know what a happy idea it was to link nationalism to Prussian socialism , but some of his comrades were . As they saw the future , no extremes of poverty or of wealth were to be tolerated in the coming Third Reich of the Prussian Utopia . The little man was to come into his own . The department-store Leviathans were to disappear . Industry was to serve not private aims but the higher ends of the nation . Agriculture was to be freed of the  | fetters of entailed properties and every pure-blooded shepherd was to come into the Teutonic heritage of noble Siegfried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of Schiller 's heroic dream : Seid umschlungen Millionen ... . Fest and Hoefer looked at each other with affection , and over two seidels of dark beer they renewed their bond of fraternal unity . As the brew began to make its effect felt they would have liked to rush into the street and kill ; kill , kill for the love of the fatherland and the great Fuehrer , Hitler . A group of Hitler Jugend passed by on its way to a Nazi festival , singing the Horst Wessel song . The color on the cheeks of Fest and Hoefer deepened as they took leave of the unbelieving stranger , and pounding the pavement with martial fire they disappeared behind stately Ludwigskirche.  | NOT all Germans are Nazis like Fest or Hoefer . Some of them do not recognize the National Socialist god , as they have other loyalties . Does this mean that they have no way whatever to make their influence felt on their country 's affairs ? We shall see . Germany is haunted by age-old problems . One of them started some nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor , king or prince to give investiture of bishoprics under pain of excommunication . " It reached its climax when Emperor Henry IV disregarded the decree and was excommunicated . Thus the War of Investitures began and the emperor made his penitence at Canossa . The Third Empire of Adolf Hitler is still at war with Rome , and therefore the next little man on our list of unknown heroes , Franz Schikedanz , looks around furtively before entering his home . Herr Schikedanz is our hero not because of any heroic deeds as they are understood today . Nor does he think of himself as a hero , since he has not been guilty of any spectacular achievement and his life story has not as yet been tainted by printers ' ink . He is our hero according to a higher standard , because he has remained true to his loyalties in spite of the danger of death . Nor is this a death of the common variety , consummated when  | the executioner severs the head from the body . No , it is of the more cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single blow . It is the death of countless mortal blows , of losing one 's bread and perishing morally every day . The reader will know by this time that Herr Schikedanz is not the real name of our hero , and that this chapter will deal with a German Catholic , of whom there are more than twenty millions in the Reich . The Hitler regime would like to exterminate them in order to be true to its nature . Catholicism is a religion , and so is Nazism , and if the former still defies Hitler it is because the Leader does not dare to take drastic action . Our Franz Schikedanz is one of the millions of dictators who are preventing the Nazis from exploiting their victory to the full . We had an appointment at the Heinzelmannchen Fountain of Cologne . When he emerged from Goldschmiedstrasse , the chimes of the Rathaus began to play the Horst Wessel Song and the bell of the Dom struck nine . We were headed for his favorite Bierhalle near the post-office . On the way we talked about beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wistful smile he confided to me that every night he looked with the same expectation to emptying his glass . He was a bookkeeper in the employ of Herren Habicht and Solwart , first-class gentlemen-tailors , according to their advertisements , and he was also an amateur pianist . He was congenitally poor and ambitious , yet not ambitious enough to make his way " through thick and thin . " The highlight of his life was the visit of a music critic to his house at the invitation  | of a friend . The critic told him that he had talent and that he would see to it that he should be heard . Since then Herr Schikedanz has been waiting for his chance . This is mentioned only parenthetically , in order to show that Herr Schikedanz is a man of dreams . He also has political ideas , which he gained by fortuitous circumstances , as most people do . In the early days of the republic he was swept into the ranks of the Socialists by forces over which neither he nor millions of others had control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that the Socialists were the only ones to get the country out of the rut . He reached heights of eloquence when informing his admiring neighbors that to be socialistic was synonymous with being patriotic , as the Allies would surely forgive the Kaiser 's sins for the sake of Karl Kautsky 's sterling virtues . The French march into the Ruhr coincided with his great awakening . It seems that the French had not forgiven the Kaiser , and the Socialists were impotent to pacify them or to organize resistance . It took Herr Schikedanz several weeks to make the distance between the Socialists and the National People 's Party , which should not be confused with the Bavarian People 's Party , of which the hero of the last chapter , Johannes Fest , had been a member . As Schikedanz liked the absolute and was not accustomed to see political life as an art in compromise , he felt a great affection for Gustav Stresemann , chancellor and godfather of the far-famed and now dead Locarno pacts . He believed that the millennial misunderstanding between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troubles and that the way  | to put an end to the reign of political terror was for the two countries to find a common platform . He felt relieved when the Locarno agreements were signed , convinced that the world was coming to its senses . Needless to say , the disappointment following upon this hasty conclusion was extremely keen . With Stresemann died an idea and also the hope of Herr Schikedanz for the birth of a new world . He discovered now , with the disillusioned eyes of the lover on the morning after , that the People 's Party represented merely private interests , and that he was out of place among its many factory magnates . Being German and therefore gregarous , he wanted a place where he could exchange his views with a group of like-minded persons . He had long been a member of the Deutzer Kegelklub , most of the members of which happened to be voters of the Catholic Center Party . The club was all right for its bowling-alleys ; but one also has to talk politics , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the Zentrum , a pillar of the republic and of peace . Its club was spacious and some members were always willing to listen to one in exchange for the chance to be listened to . Herr Schikedanz liked the quiet dignity of the Center Party 's political meetings , and the unctuous eloquence of their political speakers . When hearing them he felt that quiet bliss which comes from listening to smooth phrases neither original nor disturbing in any way . By attending party rallies he learned to tell the difference between the Right and Left wing . He found the Rightist leader , Herr Pralat Kaas , too circumspect to meet the need for quick action , while the Leftist  | leader , Herr Kanzler Wirt , was a man to his taste , cautiously radical , but not too precipitate . After having listened to a great number of speeches and weighed them , he decided that he was a member of the party 's progressive branch . All went more or less well until that late January day in 1933 when Adolf Hitler assumed power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month afterward a royal battle took place between Herr Franz Schikedanz and Herr Adolf Hitler , of which battle , however , the latter remained in ignorance . Each night Herr Schikedanz confronted his opponent in wakeful dream and told him his honest opinion . In these nocturnal phantom fights he asked Hitler why a leader of a socalled National Socialist Party dared to accept the helping hand of industrial reactionaries of the Emil Kirdorf and Fritz Thyssen type . He also challenged Hitler for his alliance with the die-hard Junkers , and told him to his face that he was the grave-digger of German progress . Then he visited his restaurant and had his glass of beer . Herr Schikedanz smiled bitterly when the wireless brought word that the Communists had burned down the Reichstag . He knew that Hitler needed just such an accident to stop the foe that could have stopped him . He watched the growth of terror with increasing alarm . At a meeting of the Center Party 's Bachelor Association , a group of brown shirts marched in and made the audience march out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several seconds he could hardly see ; and he believed that either a piercing yell or a ferocious  | knock at some hard skull would relieve his feelings . It was seldom that such impulses overwhelmed him , and he was glad when this one passed as quickly as it had come . He felt the urge to go among the people and make them fight for their rights , but such impulses were never translated into action . One night an imperious rap at his door woke him from his first sleep . In front of his door he found two men who identified themselves as members of the secret police , and who began to open his cupboards and chests of drawers without further ado . One of them had a hard look and continually murmured imprecations against the " black rabble . " They were disappointed with him for their failure to find incriminating evidence , and banged his door without saying good-bye . A few days later , a distant relative whispered the warning into his ear that he had better make himself scarce as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , however , turned out to be a false alarm . One morning Herr Schikedanz unfolded his Kolnische Zeituung on his favorite table at his favorite cafe , where he had breakfast , and he could not help rubbing his eyes in unbelieving amazement . Was he in his senses , or had the waiter played a trick on him ? Had he been given a rabid Nazi paper , instead of the old faithful journal , his best companion through life ? No , there could be no mistake ; the title , format , type and make-up were the same . But the soul of the Cologne Gazette was not the same . The editorial was a p can to the Leader , most perfect of all men , Germany 's reward for her sufferings . There could be no doubt that  | the great newspaper of the Rhineland had also been coordinated ? gleichgeschaltet . Herr Schikedanz sought refuge from the propaganda barrage in a Swiss daily paper . But the authorities seemed to be intent upon cutting him off from all outside information , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air was tainted with propaganda microbes , and the books repeated the eternal refrain : Hitler is infallible ; he is God , and Goebbels , Goering and Rosenberg are his prophets . Our hero now found it unsafe to get together with like-minded people . He sought solace in playing his piano , but his attention was called by a well-meaning neighbor to the fact that his favorite composer , Mendelssohn , was on the black-list because of his Semitic origin . Some of his friends had been taken to concentration camps or disappeared ? either in jail still or shot " while trying to escape . " In his nocturnal debates with Hitler , Herr Schikedanz was running short of points , for he could not replenish his ammunition of anti-Nazi arguments in a world ruled by propaganda . He began to feel lonely and to envy the enthusiasm of the men who donned their black or brown uniforms , sang Nazi songs , took part in romantic night maneuvers and had no need to worry about losing their jobs . As a born Kolner , he knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also knew that many of his ex-comrades had joined the Nazi movement . Some of them had done so because they could no longer resist the relentless pounding of the propaganda machine , others because they believed there was no means of  | realizing their ideas outside of the Hitler movement . These people were ready to compromise with their conscience , sacrificing what they thought was mere ornament so that the great work of national reconstruction could be realized . They took the assurances of the government at its face value , that the Third Reich was to perpetuate the Teutonic greatness of the First Reich of the Hohenstaufens and was to eclipse the short-lived greatness of the Second Reich of the Hohenzollerns . Schikedanz also knew that several former Center Party members had joined the Nazis in the hope that the taint of their previous allegiance might be removed , thinking it was their first duty to provide for their families . Many of them tried to establish a mental balance by persuading themselves that their new allegiance was not incompatible with the old one . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curbing Nazi excesses was to join the party and make it adopt their views . Where was Herr Schikedanz to find his place ? While visiting Berlin on a reduced-rate week-end trip he was surprised to find the city full of uniforms , and his German heart exulted at such a display . He attended a Nazi meeting and found it difficult to disapprove of the speakers ' dwelling so much on the shame of Versailles . He admitted that he felt personally humiliated at the way the Allies had treated his country , and was particularly resentful at the thought that , while infant countries were basking in the sun of unrestrained sovereignty , Germany had to put up with restrictions imposed from without . Wherever he went , whatever he read , whatever  | speech he heard , he was haunted by the deification of Hitler . All Germany was reading the Leader 's political testament and autobiography , Mein Kampf . Finally , he could not resist the temptation to read it , and the insane intensity of the book gripped him ? he read on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he agreed with much that Hitler said about the French . A moral tug-of-war was being staged in Herr Schikedanz , as his love of order confronted his love of liberty , and he began to wonder whether it was not best for his country to have a strong man leading it to battle against a hostile world . He tried to visualize a Reich from which political strife had been banished . Was not a nation better off without an excessive political individualism , resulting in divergent aims ? Was not Hitler better than many petty party tyrants ? The fight resulted in a victory for his love of freedom . He decided that life would end in civic apathy , if all citizens reposed their rights in the hands of a Leader whom they invested with the qualities of divine infallibility . Yet he was still worried at the thought of being out of step with what might be a majority , organized in the vast Nazi movement . The Hitlerite thesis that it was high treason to be different had made a strong impression upon him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the distance , the sky-storming strivings leaving blood and misfortune in their wake , the thoughts of Herr Schikedanz crystallized in a clearer conception of what the higher call of his nature was . He was repelled by the blood-purge , at which Nazis ,  | Catholics , Hitler 's friends and potential enemies alike fell . He became aware of the real significance of Hitler 's war on religion . The idea dawned upon him that this was the triumph of matter over spirit ; a religion of blood and iron , of vicious vindictiveness and antihumanitarian aims . The fate of the monks and nuns whom Hitlerite judges convicted of alleged currency smuggling made his heart bleed with grief . He heard more than what the newspapers were allowed to write about the persecution of the Catholic clergy , and of the unpremeditated reaction of unsophisticated village priests . He heard of cases where non-political Catholics had been crowded out of their jobs for no reason at all . He heard of Catholic villages being deprived of the State 's aid if they refused to pay obeisance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impression of them which was unlike the picture the Nazis painted . He knew of Jewish families which had lived in the Rhineland for centuries . How long had Hitler 's ancestors lived in Germany ? He heard of one of the former lights of Cologne , a Jewish lawyer with a distinguished World War record , with four sons in the trenches , who was hounded out of his native place as a pariah and outlaw . Herr Schikedanz also followed the Protestant clergy 's struggle against the Nazi regime with much sympathy , and often wondered whether their religion , too , was to be swamped by brutality . He cherished the idea of a united front of all religions for the protection of man 's spiritual values . All this came to light while we were seated at his  | favorite table in the Bierhalle . He was now definitely in the anti-Nazi fold after having resisted the temptation . In the familiar setting of the place he felt at home . While life beyond the revolving door was a mess of disappointments , uncertainties , betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second glass of beer in front of him , existence looked better balanced . In this friendly environment Herr Schikedanz spoke boldly : " We Germans can not be treated the way the Italians and Russians have been treated ? not in the long run , anyway . Am I a better German if I let them suppress my thoughts and accept the ready-made views of others ? They call us a nation of philosophers , which we are not , but we are , at any rate , a thinking people . " The Third Reich may be a good thing for certain people . It has accomplished certain things which had to be accomplished . Some of those things had to be done brutally . We are free from many onerous provisions of the Treaty of Versailles , which was our greatest grievance . The number of our unemployed has been reduced by some four million . That 's really fine and praiseworthy . New highways are being built and our labor service is draining marshes , doing reforestation work , ransacking the land for new natural resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is our self-confidence . How are we going to have it if we are treated like minors ? Wilhelmstrasse has the last word in everything , and if we fail to acclaim its decision , off we march to jail ! " Nowadays people talk about all kinds of complexes . The Prussians are supposed to have a superiority complex . That 's nonsense . Nearly all of us Germans are  | suffering from a sense of inferiority , which many of us attempt to camouflage by trying to appear superior . We can not help feeling that we were too late in arriving on the stage of the civilized world . " Our greatest king , Frederick II , felt so inferior as a German that he accepted his French tailor 's advice as to how to greet foreign ladies with outlandish grace . I know that I am not the only one wanting to impress Frenchmen with our culture on the rare occasions I come in touch with them . I mention the French , because we are supposed to hate them , although in reality we envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their diplomatic genius . We know that they were a powerful nation when we were a bunch of fighting duchies ; they were self-consciously strong when we did not even know the meaning of the word nation . ' " Many Germans talk boastingly about the old Germanic culture ; their Bible is Tacitus and their god is Wotan . This is only a second thought , because not more than a hundred and fifty years ago all that reminded us of our ancestors and of our old Germanic culture was something of which we were thoroughly ashamed . Since then we have made some progress , and at one time we were considered the marvels of the world because of our remarkable success in taking the lead in building up a machine civilization . It is my opinion that we were so good because of our burning desire to impress the world ; our will triumphed over our sense of inferiority . Hitlerism is another manifestation of this complex . It makes Germanism into a fetish , which may be a good thing for those who have no other incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all this will lead to , but I do know that certain forces are stronger than any dictator , on account of which the Nazis had to adopt many innovations they did n't like and had to go beyond their original program . They are trying to crush us , and yet I have the feeling " ? this he said in a whisper ? " that we are going to crush them ! We ca n't do much openly , but we can keep quiet , and our calm is eloquent . We can also think , and the force of millions of people thinking is a strong force . Although we may appear too optimistic about the future , I am confident that spirit will again prove to be stronger than matter . " He ended his sentence with an enigmatic smile , drained his glass , looked at his watch and stood up . It was past his time to stay up . I accompanied him on his way home , past the Dom , toward Goldschmiedstrasse . When we arrived at the Rathaus the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very minute the clock struck twelve , Herr Schikedanz said good-bye to me and politely asked me not to mention his name when reporting our conversation .  | I N THE late Autumn of 1933 , when the German polls were still free , about 13,000,000 men and women of the Reich voted for the Socialist and Communist candidates . At the so-called plebiscite in the late summer of 1934 , when the Reich was made to approve of the government 's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the General Disarmament Conference , only some 4,000,000 votes were cast against Hitler . What had happened to millions of former Marxists ? Did they go over to the foe , or are there mysterious forces at work to account for the lost millions ? Marxism is outlawed in the Reich , aid its suspected practitioners are treated as enemies of the State . Who will ever know the full number of those murdered for their devotion to socialism and communism ? Who can tell the number detained in jails and concentration camps ? The former probably run into thousands , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left or fled from the Reich . But , even so , there are millions of ex-Marxians in Germany , physically free even though not free to express their thoughts . Taking the example of the Socialists , their number remained surprisingly stable throughout the Weimar  | regime . Even when the Nazis scored their greatest triumphs they could make no inroads upon the Socialist phalanx . Have these Socialists succumbed now to Nazi propaganda , so that the Third Reich is really what it professes to be , a nation united in the worship of one Leader ? No , the German scene has not undergone the changes indicated by superficial observation . A powerful anti-Hitler underground movement is at work . Those millions who are standing on the sidelines are exerting a strong influence on the policies of their worst enemies , the proof of which is , as we have seen before , that the Nazis have enacted more Socialistic legislation than the Socialists did when they were at the helm . What does this indicate ? It shows that in the twentieth century there is a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can not put your finger on the source of this public opinion , since it is illegal and intangible . It shuns the light of day , and the executioner 's ax puts an end to the lives of those who profess heretic views . Yet they are powerful and scoff at Hitler 's threats , making him bow to their will . How does the underground movement work ? At first its leaders tried the " eruptive " method . At a given signal , the men who were ready to suffer the reward of martyrdom collected at a strategic point of some proletarian section , distributed revolutionary leaflets , sometimes even addressed a few words of encouragement to the improvised audience , and vanished before the arrival of the police . The engineers of the eruptive method experimented with showering anti-Nazi literature from mysterious airplanes , the places of departure of which could not be ascertained . They left party propaganda  | sheets on housetops and let the wind do the work of distribution . But this method had the drawback of risking the lives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be abandoned . Next the " catacomb " method was developed . A network of party branches was set up to launch the underground offensive against the mighties of the Nazi realm . Watchers stood guard , and signals were agreed upon to warn of impending danger . Underground party meetings took place in small groups and sometimes the organizers even ventured to call a joint meeting of several groups . As a rule , however , the leader of one " cell " was known only to members of his group , so that the chances of discovery were reduced . They built up a strong press , containing spot news and general exhortation . Some of these underground journals were printed , others mimeographed or typewritten . At the time of writing this method is still in favor . Hermann E was one of the printers of the Free Laborer , a Left-wing publication of a group of underground workers in the Wedding district of Berlin . He had become a printer because of his love of the printed word . He was not ashamed to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these illegal sheets , but came to realize that he lacked the qualifications of a good editor . So devoid was he of false modesty that he told at length about his fiasco . " What do you hope to accomplish by the underground opposition to an iron-clad regime ? " I asked . Although Hermann was a factory worker , or perhaps because of that , he liked to express himself in choice language . He also liked dramatic effects . His  | answer was like the ones I had heard from several other like-minded persons . " The only way we may become worthy of the freedom we want to enjoy is by fighting for it . The trouble with the Weimar Constitution was that we got it practically without any effort , so that we did n't realize its value and let it be wrested from us . This time we 'll pay for our liberty with suffering and blood . At present Germany is a prison with 63,000,000 inmates and 2,000,000 jailers . " " But have n't the Nazis reduced unemployment , and is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their success in that field ? " " There are people who can be fooled and others who resent being fooled , " he answered . " It 's only the former who believe what the Nazis shout from the housetops about their economic victory ; and they , too , believe it only until they die of hunger . " He saw the employment campaign of the Nazis merely as incidental to their high-pressure armament , and could not believe that such barren activity could produce economically fertile results . He believed that a nation which set its heart upon a destructive course could derive no lasting benefit from the incidental reawakening of the employment market . He tried to make it clear to me that a vicious end infected its means . Like most German laborers , Hermann was something of an amateur philosopher . Since his early youth he had been trained in Socialist ideology . In those days , he said , he spent an average of three nights a week at trade-union lectures and discussions . He liked nothing  | more than to listen to stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts of oratory . The very words " Marxism , " " surplus value , " " excess profit , " " historical materialism " made him thrill with almost physical pleasure , and he had a glorious time reading Bebel and Kautsky . The conversation turned to the socialistic ideals of the pre-Hitler era and to the downfall of the republic . He admitted that the Weimar regime was not well supplied with dynamic men , and that most of the leaders were content with resting their case upon the logic of history and the justice of their cause . He assented to the view that the republic had been dazed by its early successes and had not the pluck to follow them up with determined action . Hermann then unfolded his ideas about the end of the German republic . He believed Hitler could have been stopped . " The republic should have had the courage of its convictions . " Big business , which was counterrevolutionary , should have been given a dose of the Russian medicine . Tne die-hard capitalists appeared to him as the villains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it patriotism . Yes , it was the patriotism of munition makers to make money by working for their country and the enemy at the same time . " Big business always wins , " he added emphatically . Why did it win ? Because it had the raw material of public opinion at its finger-tips in the form of press , radio , platform and pulpit . After having contrived ingenious anti-Socialist devices , it found one day that socialism had become part of the worker 's life . So big  | bad business looked around for a spurious Socialist with a powerful voice and an elastic conscience , who could be depended upon not to carry out his program after having been helped into power . It picked Adolf Hitler , who seemed to be the ideal person . Many people did not realize that the kind of socialism Hitler preached was really anti-socialism .

Since the only people who could have stopped Hitler ? the rich industrial and land magnates ? were pushing him to the fore , and since the Socialists and Communists were fighting each other instead of the common enemy , the movement could sweep the political arena clean of opposition . Even so , Hermann contended , Nazism could have been stopped if the republic had not been betrayed by its President , that grand old woman of Tannenberg , Field Marshal von Hindenburg . The old warrior was senile , and he was also a typical East Prussian Junker who had taken fright at the thought that an honest administration might do something about the glaring injustices of the land-holding system in his part of the country . This conversation took place in one of those proletarian flats which look so innocent from the outside , with their potted geraniums on the window-sill . Inside  | it looked just as innocent , since the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as not to attract the attention of the Gestapo , the secret police ... There were three of us in the room , the third one being the young man who had introduced me to Hermann , and whom we shall call Albert . He was tall and blond , a young Aryan god with an insinuating manner . In his small circle he enjoyed a great prestige , and he had an interesting story to tell . A few weeks after Hitler 's assumption of power he was arrested by two brown soldiers for tearing down a Nazi election poster . Strangely enough , his captors did not treat him roughly and merely told him that such a nice boy should not do foolish things . The older one of the two brown soldiers then took him aside and promised to let him go if he , in turn , would take a liking to him . At first Albert did not know what he meant , and only when the brown soldier began to caress his cheek did he realize that he had fallen into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi ranks . He rejected these advances , which distressed his would-be friends . With a false smile of good-will they invited him to an extemporized trial , presided over by a friend of theirs , at which Albert was sentenced to fifty strokes on his back . During the ordeal he fainted several times , and when the beating was over he could not move . The brown soldiers advised him to breathe no word of his mistreatment or he would pay with his life . Then they took him into a concentration camp , where he was one of the targets for the brutalities of sadists , who made him clean the latrines and vented their cruel lust on him .  | One night a vicious-looking guard approached him with the suggestion that this was the best time to escape . He claimed that he had great sympathy for Albert . The young man was familiar with the tale of " shot while trying to escape " and he left the advice unheeded . Bad treatment and constant worry made him ill , and while he was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The commander turned out to be one of those Nazis who had joined the party because they believed in its aims . Ile started an investigation , relieved several guards of their duties , and gave Albert his freedom . After his release from the camp , Albert was obsessed with hatred of everything Nazi and plunged headlong into the underground movement . As a factory worker he spoke the language of the man in the street , and because of his good looks he was popular with women . No one was bolder in distributing anti-Nazi leaflets than he . Albert was a Socialist , and his party financed him to visit factories , collect data about discontent and write about his experiences in the Free Laborer . He asked for little , and the money he got was only for the prime necessities of life . Albert looked at contemporary events from a larger point of view and found that such trials as Germany was passing through were necessary for the growth of new ideas . He also believed that national socialism would be the instrument through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how could the Socialists gain real power ? " By breaking with the past ! The old strategy was based on the idea of legitimacy . He believed that the  | ideal of socialism was penetrating so deeply into German mentality that no amount of purging could remove it . Victory could be accelerated by creating a united front of Left-wing Nazi opposition . The trouble with old-fashioned Socialists and Communists was , Albert declared , that although they professed to be revolutionaries , they were really sticklers for form , subscribing to certain sets of dogmas , which they regarded with as much awe as primitives regarded their sacred cows . He admitted that the Socialists were not any better than the Communists . Although they called themselves revolutionaries , they were committed to a strict party line , which might as well be called party fetters . In the past they talked revolution and then , when challenged , were afraid to use it as an instrument of party policy . If they were as revolutionary in spirit as they professed to be , why did they not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazis themselves had done when fighting for power ? Albert was trying to induce his comrades in the Socialist and Communist underground movement to bury their hatchets and move with the times . This was a curious statement about parties which claimed each to be the spearhead of progress , but Albert was frank in deprecating the kind of progress which , he said , consisted largely in quoting the books of an author who was born a century before . He believed , in other words , that the Marxists would not be able to make real headway until they became revolutionaries not only in aspiration but in thought and action . He did not mean to say that they should throw bombs ? he turned  | to me in explanation ? but they must have sufficient courage to turn their backs on the sacred cows . " If you are always preoccupied with the thought of what Marx or Lenin may have done , you 'll paralyze your freedom of action . " In political warfare one has to be unscrupulous , Albert shouted , and Hermann had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own Marx and Lenin , and you must n't shirk responsibilities . Progress calls for sacrifices , and determined deviation from traditional party lines must be the first one of them . " We reached the point where a little philosophy was injected into the discussion of ideological problems . For argument 's sake Hermann took the part of the devil 's advocate and asked whether it was one 's duty to an ungrateful humanity to have one 's body beaten to pulp ? What was common welfare , anyway , and who were the people for whom one was sacrificing oneself ? Were not some of them the very people who yesterday voted Communist and today led the chant of the Leader 's worshipers ? Albert broke a moment 's silence : " Yes , it may not appear worthwhile to expose ourselves to danger , but are we not worse than animals if we are content with licking the whip of our master ? After all , man is a man because he has ideals . If he does nothing but eat , sleep , and propagate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Those who live in the future live more intensively and more like human beings than those who live in the past . It is , after all , progress which lives , even though reaction seems to have the monopoly of rule . The French  | Revolution lasted only half a dozen years , followed by almost a century of reaction , and yet even reaction became more progressive under its influence . The conservatism of Napoleon III was revolutionary in comparison with the progressive ' idealism of the reign of Louis XVI . Working for the future is the greatest reward of a life usefully spent . The fact that the Nazis are stealing our ideas is the greatest compliment they can pay us , even though they lack the honesty to carry out our ideals fully . This theft is more flattering than the persecutions to which we are subjected . " There was momentary silence in the room , interrupted only by the blasts of the siren of a police car on a hurry call with a score of policemen , racing into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third Reich .  | YOU must also look abroad , in search of Germany 's little dictators . Popular language calls the environs of the Champs-Elysees of Paris " The Little Reich . " Misery seemed to be out of place on this queen of all avenues on the early summer days when these observations were jotted down . The leaves of the young trees did not yet display the symptoms of gasoline poisoning . The fountains of the Rond-Point were spraying tiny diamonds into the crystalline air . Farther down the avenue , elegant children were riding on ponies led by children who were poorly dressed . The multicolored parasols of the cafes added a touch of frivolity to the dignified avenue . In front of the " Lido " there was the usual congestion of human traffic . Placid columns of men and women strolled down the avenue between the E toile and the Rond-Point . Ears attuned to French cadences were puzzled by throaty German sounds . At one of the cafes a phantom cabinet of ex-ministers of the Reich sipped their orangeades , its members exchanging casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , too , had at one time basked in the sunshine of power . In the moving Vanity Fair there were dark spots of  | exile misery . German emigre faces were contorted into grimaces meant to be smiles . Their bodies were racked by the fever of fear and by actual want . Some of them were ghosts haunting the Champs-Elysees day and night . Those who had no home sought shelter in the entrances of the Metro in the small hours . Some of them were hoping to chance upon fortune in the shape of philanthropy or a childhood friend . Pounding the pavement was the grand army of misfortune , composed of writers , artists , professionals , students ; of former factory workers , ex-petty officials , and little Jews whose only offense was their religion . This was the great cemetery of dreams , full of the tombstones of power , of quiet family life , of years spent in work . They had a surplus of time on their idle hands , and their German proclivity to brood , analyze , philosophize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . They were articulate and anxious to speak , since the Champs-Elysees stimulated the courage of their opinions . A man in his early thirties spoke . We shall call him Eugene . He was grateful for the papier-mache magnificence of the cafe and for his cup of chocolate . He reached for the pastry with slow dignity , as if wanting to convince the world that he was not hungry . The Germany of which he spoke was no longer a reflection of life but a vision . He took sensuous pleasure in talking about his school life at Frankfurt-am-Main , and of his precocious interest in social problems . Before the war his father was a tailor of uniforms , but after the peace treaty cut the German army to a small force of mercenaries he had to look for other work . His bitter- ness against the new order was intense , and he vented his spleen on the republic . Eugene thought differently of the new order , and he enjoyed the pleasure of searching for new ideals . He joined several youth organizations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The week-end trips to Taurus Mountain were delightful , and they indulged in the pleasures of climbing and peripatetic high-thinking . There was also joy in the novel experience of boys and girls hiking together in a newly found comradeship , thinking of life as a heroic adventure . They entertained lofty ideas of a Germany that should be the elder sister of smaller nations , united in a confederation . His lips trembled when he uttered the magic words " United States of Europe . " In those days they spoke of war as the atavistic barbarism of their murderous elders . With an indefatigable obsession they were installing modernistic furniture in the future dwelling of man , wondering how the nations would adjust themselves to the changed world outlook . How would they meet the challenge of the discredited past ? Although not Communists themselves , they looked to Russia with admiration . While they belonged to the Socialist Party , they were eclectic in their tastes . Eugene could no longer explain why he had not gone all the way Left . Was it because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or was it because the threat of violence was repellent to his democratic habits ? He remembered well how he lost himself in meditations on the affairs of the world . At the Lesezirkel , of  | which he was a member , he gave an account of what he had read at biweekly meetings . It did not occur to them then that the triumph of the new over the old might be short-lived , and the easiness of victory take its revenge . He was just out of school when Forest Councilor Kapp marched his soldiers into Berlin and the republican government fled . This gave Eugene a shock , but he was compensated by a thrilled moment in which he saw with what superior calm Labor 's passive resistance ousted the intruder . This served his small group as a lesson and they turned their attention to republican selfdefense . Eugene was offered a small position in the Frankfurt branch of the Socialist Party , which he accepted with qualms , as he wanted socialism to remain an ideal and not a source of income . His friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by assuring him that in his new position he would have a better chance to mate theory with practice . Eugene had the eloquence o f his strong conviction and was sufficiently a man of the people to speak their language . He liked to mingle with party comrades , find out their troubles and draw his conclusions , which confirmed his belief that capitalism was doomed . With all the zest of youth he went to work ? and got another shock when he found that , instead of helping him along , some of the older members tried to block his way . He soon learned that they did so out of jealousy , because they were afraid he would outdistance them . After his early successes at young people 's outdoor meetings , they gave him a routine inside job , and one of the office elders told him with  | condescension that he would have to learn a lot before he was allowed to use his wings . Eugene accepted these setbacks in a spirit of understanding , consoling himself with the thought that the ultimate aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his personal ambitions . What would become of the party , he reflected , if every one wanted to become a general ? He set himself to the task of pruning his ambitions , even taking some pleasure in his adversity . He was among the first to rally to the Republican Defense Corps , the Reichsbanner , which the threat of reaction brought into being . He was also among the first who rallied to the idea that these potential defenders of the republic should be given a semi-military training . The relation of the Socialists and Communists interested him greatly , and he tried to call attention to certain dangers in a confidential talk with some leaders , when he finally managed to get to Berlin as a delegate to a party conference . But the bigwigs smiled at the excited young man and patted him on the back . Was it not wrong , Eugene asked himself , for Socialists and Communists to fight each other instead of turning against the common enemy ? Were not the reactionaries going to take advantage of the cannibalistic mood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , he reflected . He took part in the organization of the local Eiserne Front , which appealed to the support of all anti-reactionaries , and he was pleased with the progress it made . But as the years passed and the republic ran into one rough squall after another he became more critical of the leaders . He was now convinced that most of them were chair-warmers ,  | who lacked the sacred fire of revolutionary will . Did they really think that the Socialist Party was to thrive forever without their doing anything to keep it afloat ? He observed Hitler 's rise with dismay , but , like the rest of the Socialists , at first refused to take the man seriously . He did not think the funny creature could fool the masses indefinitely or that he could transplant Italian institutions to German soil . In Nazism he saw merely the caricature of Mussolini 's theatrical performance . But the first meeting of Hitlerites he ever attended disturbed him greatly . The composition of the audience itself was disquieting . The huge auditorium was crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be men and women for whom a political talk was a new experience , and they were drawn from the formerly non-political parts of the realm , ex-middle-class people , seeking the fire they themselves lacked . They were ready to go wild while still retaining their dignity , and were cautiously eager to be made into revolutionaries in good standing . Hitler angered Eugene with his artificially ingenuous attitude . His speech appeared to him a queer concoction of shrewd politics and judicious madness . Although the oration lasted for nearly two hours , the audience lapped up every word and asked for more . Eugene was eager to fathom the deeper causes of Hitler 's success . He was not yet ready to concede the breakdown of the republic and of the Socialist Party . He persisted in the belief that the mass of undigested promises Hitler offered to the voters could not deceive the German people . In the Hitlerite Weltanschauung  | he saw merely the repetition of old platitudes dished up as new . After considerable meditation , he saw the key to the Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred to the masses . He found that such a common hatred was a connecting link between the divers interests meeting on the Nazi platform , but he also found that basically such a hatred was alien to the modern German , and that it was only high-pressure propaganda which made it a live issue . Working his way toward a clearer understanding of the change in the German temper , he found that the death of old allegiances and the birth of new were of great help to political buccaneers , and , realizing for the first time the deep impression Hitler made on the masses , he began to fear for the life of the German republic . After all , he pondered , the Nazis had the additional advantage of not being committed to set doctrines or to common decency , which must be of inestimable value in an age scorning both principles and morals . The republican parties , on the other hand , still owned that it was sacred dogma and honesty which qualified them for success . He followed the death struggle of the republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders . of the republic were not up to the mark , and that , therefore , neither Reichsbanner nor Eiserne Front would have the chance to perform its self-allotted task . He was thunderstruck when reading that Prussia 's republican government had surrendered to reaction without even attempting resistance . Would the leaders permit the Hitlerites to seize power in the national government ? Even before the republic went down to defeat , Eu- gene and a few of his Socialist friends had concluded a private pact of their own with a few Communist leaders of Frankfurt , which was to start them on the path of a republican united front against reaction . Then came January 30 , 1933 , when President von Hindenburg called Adolf Hitler to the chancellorship , and Eugene received the worst blow of his political life . Not long before he had himself spread propaganda for the Alte to be reelected for a presidential second term . At first he attached some hope to the fact that the key positions in the government were filled by Hindenburg 's confidential men , even though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government gave no indication that Hitler would so soon break his oath to the republic and the constitution . Eugene 's small underground movement fizzled out . It might have been of some use if the republicans had given the signal for resistance , but they did no such thing . The government consolidated its power , shunted the Nationalists aside , and the Hitlerites became the Reich 's real masters . When the police called at his home he had gone to visit some relatives in a village of the Black Forest . Several friends of his , who were members of the same group , were rounded up and jailed . One of them , a Jew , had to submit to special indignities . His jailers put a clown 's cap on his head and pinned a poster on his back with the words : " Kick me ! I am a dirty Jew . " His colleagues in misfortune had to kick him , and when he tried to implore his torturers to leave him in peace they turned against him , saying that if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so .  | There was nothing in Germany for a man with a price on his head , so Eugene decided to sneak out of the country . Tramping the woods by night , he emerged in France . Although the French frontier guards gave him no warm welcome , they made no fuss about his having no passport and shipped him to Paris with a consignment of refugees . In the French capital they were taken in tow by a charitable organization headed by a Rothschild . Months of unmitigated horror followed , when he had just enough to eat and sometimes not even that . Although he was not a Jew , he lived on Jewish charity . A robust man , his appetite was above normal , and he tried to still his hunger with cups of cheap coffee , and he made an arrangement with a sympathetic waiter to give him a restaurant 's stale bread . He called at Socialist headquarters , where he found comrades anxious to help him but barely able to help themselves . He offered to contribute to a Left-wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too faulty for a journalistic career . He joined a refugee class which was studying French , and after a few months undertook to give lessons to others . Although his knowledge of French was far from adequate , the fact that he charged only two francs an hour made his pupils forgive his linguistic shortcomings . Most of his pupils could not manage to pay even that trifle , and although he could now fill his stomach he could not pay his rent . One day he found the wooden box which contained all his belongings in front of the door of his room , and his landlady told him to try his luck in Allemagne . He spent that night in a Metro entrance , and he cried . He  | wanted no more charity . Greedily he accepted the offer of another refugee to share quarters and rent with him . It was an awful place , Eugene said , but it was better than the Metro . From time to time he was given temporary work as an unskilled laborer . Many of his French comrades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , who were Fascists , kicked the meteque out of their way , and one of them reported him to the police . The police official was kind and warned him not to be caught again . Eugene now set his heart on finding a little place somewhere in the world where he would not be a burden . His eyes lingered caressingly on the outlines of Uruguay , as shown on the map , but he would have been happier in South Africa . Unluckily the door was closed , and Eugene reflected bitterly that in a world of two billion people there was no place for a man who wanted nothing more than his daily bread . Sometimes a few comrades in arms would meet and exchange views on current events . One of them suggested that it was time to stop bewailing the past and do something about the future . The others were mildly interested , but nothing was done about the project , as their thoughts were concentrated on a plate of hot soup and a chance to emigrate . But they helped to copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few months of the Third Reich they scanned the European horizon for signs of a revolt against Hitler . It was Eugene 's opinion that the fate of the Nazi regime would be decided beyond the frontiers of the Reich . How could the former Allies recog- nize a rule which was in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles ? When Hitler had torn up the treaty and set his war machine afoot , he felt the time had come for the civilized nations to act . They did act , indeed , and Great Britain hastened to conclude a naval pact with the treaty-breaking Germans ! After that , Eugene no longer cherished the hope that foreign opinion could subdue the Hitler regime . Several other German exiles took chairs at the next table to us and began to talk in whispers , as if still in fear of the Nazi police . " What will be the end of all this ? " I asked Eugene . " No regime can long survive the loss of its economic basis , " he answered . " Hitler is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he can not give them a better living than the republic was able to do . They also believe that he is the hero who has given them their national self-confidence . " At that he could not suppress a sharp little laugh . " It is remarkable that a nation should be driven to believe in its greatness at the point of bayonets . Now that they have lost their right to select their own representatives , they suppose they are free . They are the glorious Nordics , the aristocrats of creation , in a Third Reich which denies them the right to think for themselves . " It is highly amusing to watch these Knights of the Holy Grail , these kings of creation , shout Heil at the word of command of a beastly sadist , the lowest of the low . " No wonder the Jews are so despised in the Third Reich , whether they are Nobel Prize winners or usurers !  | The Jew lacks the capacity of the Nordic nobleman to shriek his delight at having a master with a whip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eugene continued , and there was a strange glow in his eyes , " without visualizing the Reich as the hunting ground of a couple of millions of moral perverts , who have saddled their monstrous faith in the Strong Man upon tens of millions of honest Germans . " But Germany alone is not to be blamed . The French refused to help the republic past the worst eddies , on the ground that no German was worth saving . This was in contradiction , of course , with their war-time protestations that Germany was not the Kaiser . " We are now in a political age , and the greatest genius sinks on his knees in the presence of an allround ignoramus with political pull . What can you expect , then , of the herd-man ? " What will happen to Germany ? She will have to go through a hell of shame before reaching the purified atmosphere of real social democracy . The Hitlerites call parliamentarism the token of the slave-man , an alien product , a hideous offspring of the French revolution . Germany will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they say ? the clearest expression of man 's collective will . But it has to be fought for , not merely accepted . The English fought for it in two revolutions . The French began to fight for it long before their great Revolution , and they are fighting for it even today . The French know a good thing when they see it , and they are shrewd enough to know that democracy is the best thing for the little man , who does n't want to be the slave of political gangsters of the  | Hitler and Mussolini type . It takes the Germans a long time to appreciate what it means to be free . " The Nazis picture the republican regime as a whirlpool of dishonesty . They do n't know , or do n't want to know , that every institution has its drawbacks and that democracy also has its children 's diseases . It is no argument against life that sometimes we are afflicted with illness . Democracy must be given time to work out its destiny . Besides , what do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not free , as ours was . " " And the future ? " " At present it 's black . The Hitler government has probably lost the majority of its adherents , and yet it goes on living . A dictatorship can live longer than a democracy because of its use of force ; but even a dictatorship is subject to certain natural laws , which work in our favor . Public opinion can not be entirely suppressed , and in Germany it is still in existence . The absurdities of the Hitler rule are our best allies . The masses become restless if they do n't see the New Day . The factory pariahs are greedily swallowing the propaganda stuff we are smuggling to them . Farm-hands in Germany are disillusioned . The army is satisfied as long as it is fed with gold , but what will happen after Germany has exhausted her internal credit ? The chances are that this regime will get no foreign loans . " The ironmasters and coal barons also are distressed because the Hitlerites kept the country to themselves and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would kill the Communist monster and then clear out , leaving the big capitalists in full control . Instead of that , Hitler himself was forced by public  | opinion to adopt some of the communistic measures , although he did so against his inclinations . While he is an enemy of labor and friend of the rich , he could not have held himself at the top if he had not yielded to some popular demands . " Sooner or later the Nazi swindle will be clear even to the dullest Prussian . When Hitler is out , democracy may not yet be in , but the day of salvation will be closer . Some of our friends say that communism is inevitable after Hitler , while others say that a military dictatorship will provide the transition . What is essential today is that the people of Germany are waking up to the realization of the great betrayal that is being perpetrated upon them . We are doing our share , " he added with a sly smile , " to make them see what is going on in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene around him , perhaps thinking of his hunt for bread , of the grim faces which greet a man who is looking for a job . He drank his second cup of chocolate and nibbled at a piece of cake , carefully keeping up the pretense that he was not hungry . Is he one of the millions of dictators , now muzzled , who will regain the helm in the coming Reich ? " Come to dinner with me tonight ? " I invited him . His eyes flamed.  | T HE Russia of yesterday was not only the country of Tolstoy and Dostoievski , as many foreign observers are inclined to believe , but also of Ivan Ivanovitch , the mujik , multiplied a hundred and sixty million times . A glance at the Russia of day-beforeyesterday may be of help in explaining the temper of the Russia of yesterday and today . At the time of Charles II of England , Russia was not thought worthy of a full-fledged ambassador , so that the Earl of Carlisle , who was also vice-admiral of Northumberland , Cumberland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Denmark . He left for Moscow with great expectations of a gay time and considerable fear of lice , and bade good-bye to the capital with both hopes and fears confirmed . Not only were his impressions strong but he knew how to convey them with emphasis . " It would seem , " he said , " that laziness , the mother of all vices , is the heritage of the Russians . They are slothful , afraid of work , which they perform only by necessity , and frequently prefer being flogged to being occupied honestly . " Hence drunkenness is common among them , and so few persons are exempt from that vice that even the  | clergy is as much addicted to it as the laymen . Vodka , which is like Circe 's drink , is the fluid that makes them act like pigs . " The dinner which the Czar gave in honor of the ambassador lasted from two in the afternoon until eleven at night , and even though it was the time of the careme , when no meats were served , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Privy Councilor Baron von Meyerberg , whom Emperor Leopold of Austria dispatched in 1661 to the court of Alexis Mihailovich , Grand Duke of Muscovy , also carried away strong impressions from Russia : " The Muscovites are so much addicted to duplicity that there is no sincerity in their words . They display so much impudence in buttressing their lies with new ones that no matter how sure you are of their falsity , sometimes you are in doubt . If some incontrovertible evidence should expose them , they smile without blushing , as if they had been surprised in the performance of a noble deed . " About Russian superstition the Austrian ambassador recorded this choice custom : " Before burying the dead , the priest puts a certificate in his hand , written by the notary of the place in which he died , duly signed and paid for in gold , in which it is testified that the dead one had lived in the communion of the Greek Church , gained absolution and the Holy Eucharist by confessing the sins he may have committed , observed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saints , as he had to do , and that the certificate had been given to him to show  | it to St. Peter , so that he may open to him the gates of Paradise . . . " Meyerberg also gave an account of a Russian feast : " To all those seated at the table a piece of bread is given , but not always . Only persons of quality receive plates , napkins , forks and knives .... " Chappe d'Auteroche , a member of the French Royal Academy of Sciences , visited Russia in 1770 , and wrote about his trip in his Voyages en Siberie . He concluded his observations : " The force animating the entire nation is fear ... . Everybody distrusts everybody else .... Friendship has never been known in Russia . " Robert Johnson , an English traveler , published his Travels Through Part of the Russian Empire and the Country of Poland in 1815 , and confirmed several observations of his predecessors : " The Russian is perfidious and malevolent , leaning to theft and maraud , mendacity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one encounters many of them in a revolting state of drunkenness . " The Marquis Astolphe de Custine , grandson of General de Custine , guillotined during the Revolution , devoted his attention , among other things , to Russia 's government in his illuminating book , La Russie en 1839 : " In Russian administration , application to minute details does not exclude disorder . They go to great trouble in order to achieve an insignificant aim , and know no bounds in showing their zeal . . . . Although they are endowed with much grace , they are devoid of genius . Their esprit is an imitating one and , there- fore , more ironic than fecund . . . . The new imperial palace , rebuilt after the fire at the expense of so much life and money , is already full of vermin . One would say that the unfortunate laborers who killed themselves in ornamenting the imperial master 's house at such a speed , took revenge in advance by infesting those homicidal walls with their parasites .... " The following lines sum up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories , without Catholicism and knighthood behind them , without respect for one 's word . . . as meaninglessly polished as the Chinese , as coarse as the Kalmucks , as filthy as the Lapps , as beautiful as the angels , as ignorant as the savages , as subtle as the Jews , as intriguing as liberated slaves , as sweet and ponderous as the Orientals , as cruel as the barbarians ? such are the Russians . " Jules Legras , Professor at the Sorbonne , who likes old Russia and dislikes the new one , writes in his book , L'Are Russe , that even shortly before the World War the stories of the early travelers about the drunkenness , laziness and mendacity of the Russians held true . At the same time he gives them credit f or being good and gay . The essential difference between " Europe " and Russia , as he sees it , is found in the active or positive sentiment as the basis of the conception of life in the West , and the passive or negative sentiment in Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet it . " The same author mentions the following incident : " When the Russian people wanted to erect an ex- piatory church on the spot where Emperor Alexander II had been assassinated , the funds were entrusted to a grand duke . The church was built , but when the bills were presented , it was found that the grand duke had stolen the money . The church was paid for partly by the State and partly by His Majesty , probably after violent family quarrels . " In Gogol 's famous play , The Revizor , a higher official rebukes a minor bureaucrat : " You steal more than your rank permits . " Professor Legras attributes mendacity and dishonesty under the old regime to slave mentality . The only weapon of the tens of millions of oppressed was their wits , which they used as unscrupulously against their masters as their oppressors exploited them . Official corruption was facilitated by enormous distances , which made verification of statements extremely difficult .

" Professor Legras visited a sugar factory in the Tchernigof government , which the peasants had pillaged and partly burned during the revolutionary outbreak of 1905 . They told him : " This factory must disappear . We do n't need it . What we need is the land which these buildings cover . While the attachment of the Russian niujik to the soil is a general peasant characteristic , his slothfulness and other vices were typically Russian . It was for that  | reason that in Holy Russia there was practically no public opinion on the countryside . The climate has been blamed for molding Russian character . The forbidding cold of the sprawling steppes and of Siberia has been pictured as the enemy of work and the friend of apathy . But do the Scandinavian countries not march in the vanguard of civilization ? If it is answered that the climates even of the northernmost parts of Sweden and Norway are tempered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor , Finland , or to most of Canada , the climate of which is hardly more hospitable than Siberia 's . Nor would it be just to blame the Slavic race for the temperament of old Russia . The Czechs , for instance , are Slays , and it would be difficult to find a more industrious nation in all Europe . Or take the Bulgarians , who have a well-earned fame for sustained energy . The Yugoslays have also furnished inspiring examples of the workingman 's quiet heroism . The Russian temperament may be explained more easily on the ground that the steppes provided no barrier against eastern invasion , and that Russia was for centuries the highway of nomads in search of better land , affording little chance for a nation of many millions to settle down to a quiet life , as the endless movements of races and tribes resulted in a chronically unsettled state of affairs . When the Tartars of Genghis Khan overran the West early in the thirteenth century , Asia spilled over into Europe and the Russians had to suffer for centuries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong defensive reaction on the part of the oppressed . The state of eternal fight in which these regions floundered helped the native war lords , who found the ground prepared . Millions of helpless peasants were ready to accept their yoke out of habitude and necessity , since they believed that the native masters would show more mercy than the aliens , a hope in which they were deceived . The reign of domestic terror which ensued broke the resistance of the peasants to tyranny . Since rapacious landlords were never sated with serf work , the slaves of the soil fell into an apathetic state of mind , concerned merely with the necessities of life . Periodical famines , also , helped to make them fatalistic . When bolshevism came to Russia she was an Asiatic country , which means that she not only distrusted but hated progress . The Communist leaders found themselves confronted with the task of changing the entire mode of living of millions , who had no desire to see them changed . The result of Russia 's geographic position and of the traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was to take the lead in the pageant of great nations . Such a task would have staggered even the most intrepid leaders if they had not been imbued with a fanatic belief in their mission . In the following pages we shall see how new Russia is trying to strip off her heritage , become acquainted with community problems , and make the wheels of progress whirl . It was Ivan Malakoff 's turn to tell the story of his life to the purging commission .  | As a member of the Communist Party , he was subject to such periodical cross-examinations in the presence of a critical audience . A member of the party must shine in the armor of proletarian virtue , and even his common frailties are not easily condoned . Malakoff told his story without betraying the pride he felt in it . A Communist must have no personal pride , being merely a tool of powerful forces which transcend individual fates . He must see himself in the role of one of millions marching to higher destinies . He enjoyed the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his conscience clean . And so he began his story in a voice that could be heard in the farthest corner of the room . He was born on a farm near the city of Samara on the Volga . Although the city chimneys could be clearly seen from his native place , they might just as well have been hundreds of miles away for all they meant to it . The village was primitive , innocent of civilization , its only landmark the unseemly church squatting in the midst of the peasant huts like a mother chicken with her brood . At the edge of the village the monotony of the landscape was broken by a huge oak , its trunk rotting with age . The River Volga was a few versts away to the east , but it could not be seen from the Malakoff shack . On summer days the leaden sky was a tight cover over the boiling cauldron of the plains . The horizon was the limit of the small world in which Ivan 's youth was lived ; its only visible connection with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Samara Road , which was a fathomless sea of mud in  | rainy weather and the source of an endless supply of dust under the broiling sun . The purging commission settled down to hear the story , and so did the audience . There was no sign of impatience with the introduction and Ivan 's ready tongue helped him gain the good-will of his hearers , who promised themselves a good show . Ivan 's father was a bibulous inn jik and his mother was a superstitious pagan of the Greek Orthodox faith . Nicola , the father , was habitually lazy , which quality he inherited from a long line of ancestors . His love of vodka was notorious , and whenever he lacked the requisite number of kopeks to buy it he was satisfied with plain denatured alcohol . Nicola 's mouth was an open sore , and his stomach must have been as leathery as that of an ostrich . Besides drinking , he used his mouth for cursing , which he did remarkably well and with a verve that belied his fame for sloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a miser and a rich woman , and upon her death Nicola inherited her fortune , which turned out to be a few scores of rubles . He suspected the old witch of having buried the treasure , consulted the fortune-teller on the subject , and followed her advice to dig a hole seven feet deep at the spot where he had seen a rabbit run across the road on the night of the last full moon . The treasure , however , did not come to light . Although Nicola hated work more than the devil , he could not escape it . At three o'clock on summer mornings he was on his way to the fields , where he stayed until dusk , as he had to have money for vodka and the tax-collector . He did not know how much tax  | he must pay , but he did know that there was no end to it , and if the money did not await the collector in a pile , Nicola got a good beating and had to pay the money anyway . Just to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission that after he had come into his dead aunt 's money , he shut himself up in the church cellar and drank himself nearly to death with a big bottle of poisonous vodka . A neighbor heard his delirious moans and , suspecting the Evil One , aroused the villagers , who found Nicola unconscious . After having trampled and spat on him , they called the local surgeon-barber , who was a great healer . His only cure was blood-letting , which he did so well that Nicola recovered sufficiently to resume his work and drink . Ivan 's mother , Glava , was an old woman at the age of thirty because of piety and work . She worked at home and also in the surgeon-barber 's household , getting from him a few kopeks a day , for which she bought candles for her favorite ikons . The family shared quarters with a few animals . Originally there had been a partition between man and beast , but one cold winter 's day it burned down , and from then on the animals had the freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them : two pigs and half a dozen chickens . Ivan 's education consisted largely of more or less regular beatings , in which his father and mother shared almost equally . They beat him for cause and without it , since they felt they must have someone on whom to repay the beatings they themselves had received from life . His father also beat his mother , and she , in re- turn , kicked his father 's shins when he was sprawling on the floor in a drunken stupor . Otherwise she revered him , because the husband is the wife 's lord and master . Ivan 's brothers and sisters had died in infancy , except one brother who had been lost sight of long before . Although several coats of grime covered it , Ivan had a pleasant little face . The priest , who had taken a liking to him , suggested that he be taken to the city school , but the father hardly knew what the man of the church was talking about , as schools were unknown in those parts . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even their names . He knew , of course , about Fatherkin Czar , living in distant St. Petersburg , but he was part of religion and not of nation . The birthdays , name-days of Fatherkin and of his kinsfolk , were high holidays in the village . Ivan was not dissatisfied with life , as he was too small and insignificant to be dissatisfied with anything . If he thought anything at all about the future , he must have seen himself in his father 's place , working , sleeping , swearing , beating ; sweaty , grimy , angry except when drunk . At that early age , Ivan knew that drink could give joy and smiles . Then politics entered the Malakoff home , one day in 1905 , when word spread that a revolt was on against Fatherkin Czar . Mother Glava told a neighbor , sobbing , that this was a terrible thing , because the Czar was a sainted man , and she gave her favorite ikon an additional red candle . The sky above Samara was hemmed with red and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few days later it was learned that the  | revolutionaries had burned up the Samara barracks . A few more days elapsed , when a couple of mounted rural policemen , uryadniki , descended upon the village , beat up the peasants , and cleared out . The villagers hated them and called them kuryadniki , chicken thieves . This was Russia 's " terrible year , " when her defeat by the Japanese and the smoldering discontent against the ruling regime caused an explosion . The red sky and the policemen 's raid were nearly forgotten when a stranger appeared in the village , hired by the richest landowner of the district to keep the peasants from preying on his wheat . His heavy beard and bushy eyebrows lent him the appearance of a story-book ogre , which may have been the main reason for the landlord 's employing him . He kept himself apart , as was expected of him , since it was his duty to be suspicious of all peasants . One evening , however , when Ivan was on his way home , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Although Ivan felt like running away he obeyed , because the stranger 's voice was both imperious and kind . From that day on Ivan and the stranger often met after his father had drunk himself into a torpor and his mother had prayed herself to sleep . The things the watchman said were so strange that Ivan thought something must be wrong with his mind . He spoke of a future in which peasants would not take to vodka and their wives to ikons because of the need to escape the realities of life . He foresaw an age in which boys like Ivan would have a chance to learn and find out the truth for themselves . All this sounded very mysterious ,  | but Ivan had some native intelligence and the strange words stuck in his memory . " What is truth ? " Ivan asked innocently , and the stranger gave a bitter laugh . With his eyes boring into the empty distance he uttered queer words about every peasant 's right to have a piece of land . He also spoke about the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words Ivan had never heard . Boys who were older than Ivan began to frequent the stranger 's company , but always on the sly , and he addressed all of them as if in a trance . One of the boys said he understood what the stranger said , and told the others they must keep it to themselves , as a careless word might send the queer watchman to the gallows . One day the stranger was nowhere and Matushka , niece of the surgeon-barber , said she had seen him taken away by a couple of uryadniki . Catherine , wife of the bow-legged teamster , declared with great emphasis that it was a couple of hoofed devils who had chased the stranger away at midnight , and it was her the villagers believed . Ivan learned only later that the stranger was one of the revolutionary fanatics who scoured the countryside , apostles of progress and martyrs in the cause of tomorrow . This particular stranger seems to have been interested in shaping the thoughts of youth , building for the future , despising speedy results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . Had he really told them that the Czar was not God 's deputy on earth ? What had he meant by " private property " ? All this was very puzzling , even after Ivan had become a full-sized mujik and was about to come  | into his paternal heritage of cruelty and drink . But the stranger had also said that vodka was poison for body and mind , and Ivan wondered what he meant . As a matter of fact , he had no desire for drink , for which he earned the scorn of the red-blooded , wife-beating mujiks . When working on the family 's small plot of land , Ivan 's eyes encompassed the waving sea of wheat belonging to His High Excellency , the governor 's cousin , and he felt a bitter taste in his mouth . On such occasions his thoughts reverted to the stranger . Had he suggested , by any means , that the land of His High Excellency 's cousin should be distributed among the peasants ? But he cast this thought out of his mind as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had not been caught in the act of thinking rebellious thoughts . Then came the war . And when Lenin introduced bolshevism into Russia Ivan Malakoff , on the point of becoming an accomplished Communist , at last dared to finish his thoughts . The stranger had made a good selection in talking to him . The ideas he had planted were in full bloom . Ivan , a young man of twenty-two , astounded his comrades with his glib tongue . He was on the Red Front when the counter-revolutionary Admiral Kolchak penetrated nearly as far as Samara in his thrust against the heart of Russia , and he was appointed political commissary of a regiment whose duty it was to give the soldiers their fare of Communist talk . After the admiral 's army was repulsed , Ivan marched with the Red regiments toward the Urals , and from there on to Siberia . The villages burned and  | peasants massacred by the Whites aroused him to flights of furious eloquence . His regiment kept constantly on the move , occupying Omsk , Semipalatinsk , Tomsk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samara , where it took him a year to recover . He had left his village and become a mechanic , working diligently at the tasks assigned to him . The Five Year Plan found him at Magnitogorsk , hard at work , an uda nik or factory shock-trooper and chairman of the plant 's Communist Party Committee . He asked to be transferred to Moscow , and there he worked in an automobile factory . He met a young girl and married her . They lived in one of the new workmen 's apartment houses . They had a little daughter , whom they were training to become a class-conscious proletarian . The chairman of the purging commission asked for comments on the testimony of Tovarish Malakoff . Several persons spoke on his behalf , and nobody spoke against him , whereupon the commission commended Ivan for his work and loyalty to the party . After the " purge " we were to meet , Ivan and I , in the lobby of the Hotel Metropole . I saw him coming from Revolutionary Square , looking at the animated scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He seemed to be proud of the daring facade of the Grand Theater , of the Muscovite baroque of the House of Syndicates , and particularly of the gigantic Hotel of the Soviets , then under construction . This was Red Moscow , of which he was proud to be a part .  | Together we entered the restaurant , where groups of self-conscious Americans sampled caviar and champagne . The orchestra played an old Schlager of Germany 's musical stage , followed by the semi-classical standbys of the Second French Empire . A haughty waiter eyed Malakoff 's Russian clothes with suspicion , ready to tell him that in this restaurant valeta was the only means of payment . Ivan sought to conceal his momentary embarrassment behind a studied indifference . All was set for a grand talk , and he delighted in monologues . He felt himself irresistible and rolled out his words like so many tidbits , occasionally accentuating the rhythmic flow of his sentences with a slight tapping of his feet . In such moments he stood in awe before his own eloquence . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 2,300,000 who had a direct influence on the Soviet Union 's policies through the annual Party Congress , which , in turn , elects the Central Committee and the powerful Political Bureau . Once he spoke before the Congress and felt that he had made a good impression . As one of the elite he had the privilege of criticism . He had to use it with discretion , however , if he did not want to become known as a defeatist and counter-revolutionary . Among friends he liked to preface his strictures by calling them self-criticism , and usually avoided people who were not friends . He considered the person of Stalin and members of the Politbureau beyond the possibility of reproach . In protecting them from the shafts of his eloquence , Ivan exercised his human prerogative of setting up sacred taboos . While he would have rebelled against all at- tempts to foist upon him a Czaristic taboo , he was unaware of his doing violence to his revolutionary faith by burning incense at Stalin 's feet . In accepting certain dogmas , which he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was swayed by an unrealized consideration of the inconsistencies that are at the core of human nature . The first tenet of Ivan 's faith as a Communist was that party membership involved sacrifice . This was a period of transition and consolidation , when discipline took first place . It was all the more necessary because his picture of the non-Russian world was a burning disaster kept from the Soviet frontier by militant communism . He saw capitalism in the form it usually appeared in the parades on Moscow 's Red Square ; a money bag with leering eyes , greedy fingers and a vampire mouth . The only answer to such monsters was war-time preparedness , and Stalin was the generalissimo , whose word must be law . Ivan liked to dwell on the fundamentals of the Soviet rule : " Communism springs from the basic laws of nature and has nothing to do with man-made artifice . Boundary-stones are man 's creation , and nature has not set one nation against the other , as it is interested in humanity as a whole , not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks of the mighty edifice . Communism follows nature 's laws in affirming that , when the great end of mankind is concerned , the life of one man ? or , for that matter , of many men ? is of little account . " Some people insist that such a life is heroic , but  | Lenin has said already that the use of this word is inappropriate , since heroism implies the exceptional , while such human conduct must be the rule . To live a life that seeks mankind 's higher aims would have been heroism under the old order , but it must be made normal under the Communist regime . " As a young man , Lenin asked the question : What is life ? ' And he answered that it was a perpetuation of itself . It sounds queer , does n't it ? But it is n't ! It simply means that we do our duty by adjusting our life to the interests of humanity . Someone put it in a different way when he said that we live only if we live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortality . " Ivan 's wife , Natasha , entered the restaurant and stood staring around her with a surprised air . It had been agreed upon that she would join us after having seen her daughter in the nursery . She was one of those young Soviet women who have a constant supply of tremendous enthusiasm for something or other . Her smooth features were animated by a never-ending interest in her surroundings . The restaurant provided her with a new object of curiosity . We signaled to her , and she joined us . Treading on familiar ground , Ivan was now in full stride . He and his friends had discussed these very problems until the small hours , in committee-rooms filled with the smoke of cheap cigarets . Besides , he had become a voracious reader , and no important book on socialism was unknown to him . After a lively discussion of the aims of the Soviets , we decided to visit a cinema , where a picture of Russian country life was being shown . On Sverdlov Square  | we dodged a line of official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Theaters , and , rounding the new Post and Telegraph Building , turned into Gorkovo Street , which at that hour was beginning to fill with Muscovites bent on pleasure . A rustic in tattered garments gaped at the display window of a cooperative grocery store . A militiaman made an effort to explain to a country woman the mysteries of red and green traffic lights , telling her that she was not allowed to cross on red . Ivan watched me from the corner of his eyes , eager to catch a glimpse of admiration in the midst of so much splendor . Natasha 's enthusiasm burst forth with a glowing : " This is beautiful . " But she regretted her outburst and tried to make amends by helping a little boy across the street . We arrived at the cinema half an hour early and whiled away our time in the large social hall , full of people drinking tea , playing chess and chatting . From the next room issued the sound of a gramophone , to which young couples were dancing . While Ivan pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall-newspaper , all written by hand , recording some lurid acts of White Guard terror . One of the illustrations showed the massacre of praying Russians on Bloody Sunday in the revolutionary year of 1905 . The victims had petitioned the Czar to reduce their working day from fourteen hours . Stories of the laborers ' lot under Communism provided a vivid contrast . Ivan talked about the tens of millions of Russians enjoying the benefit of the Soviets . Were they conscious of their happy lot ? He admitted that some of them had not been enlightened . Many members of the  | older generation remembered only the glamour of their youth and forgot its terrors . Some of them were the scum of the earth ? kulaks and other sympathizers with wealth and privilege . Slave mentality could not be eradicated entirely in a bare fifteen years . He saw the enemy busy in various disguises , as Hitlerite agents in the Ukraine , the Crimea and on the German Volga , as Fascist agents trying to gain headway via Finland . He did not close his eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national trait under the old regime , took its last stand against the new Russian spirit of movement and work . The lazy ones blamed the Soviet rule for forcing them to break with the idle past , hoping that the golden days of vodka and knout were to return . In order to illustrate the fight between old and new , Ivan told the story of one of the laborers in his factory . The father of this worker had been a merchant under the New Economic Policy , the NEP , when private trading was allowed . He was a successful capitalist , who had accumulated a neat pile of gold which he buried under his house and did not mention until he felt death near . The son took possession of the money , but said nothing about it to the authorities , although meanwhile a decree had made it his duty to do so . He began to patronize the Torgsin stores , hoarded all he could lay his hands on , acquired a gramophone , a bicycle , a huge samovar , stylish shoes and expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living the life of the idle rich , spending his treasure , not working , spreading stories about the Soviet leaders . . . . Ivan did not finish his story , giving me a chance to imagine  | what happened to the misguided Russian . Although in a foreigner 's eyes the whole thing seems to lack point , Ivan found it revolting in the extreme . Such anti-social monsters still infest the Soviet Union , he continued , but their number is on the decline . It took years to change . the mind of the average man , who now realizes that there is no way back to the bourgeois positions . Who would have thought the Russians capable of such dynamic energy in saving and consolidating the proletarian country ? Could Russia 's plight have been more hopeless than it was during the advance of the Whites in the early days of the Soviet rule ? Not only their former enemies but also their exallies had declared war on them , and they were aided and abetted by the adherents of the old order at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South the hordes of Alexeiev , Denikin and Kornilov came rushing , bloodhounds of reaction , flogging and killing their way to the heart of the disunited country . Admiral Kolchak received the help of the powers of the East and West . Japan and the United States pursued the same aim in trying to oust the Communists . Ivan remembered the huge map posters set up , showing the advance of the White Terror . From the North came Yudenich , backed by British tanks . He was already in Krasnoe Selo and the next day might see him in Petrograd . St. Isaac 's Cathedral was within sight , and he clinked his glass of wine to the successful hanging party before the Winter Palace . And then the enemy began to retreat , routed by the Red Army . " It looked like a miracle , " Ivan continued , " but it was n't . " The White Terror was partly to blame , as it  | had learned and forgotten nothing . The counter-revolution started on its way to Petrograd and Moscow with revenge in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags . They were willing to give the Russian people the knout and aristocracy 's drunken orgies . But ? and this was the point Ivan wanted to make ? the Red Army 's stunning success could not have been achieved without the cooperation of the Russian masses themselves . That cooperation was sometimes passive and consisted in not hampering the march of the Red forces , but more often it was active . Such a " miracle " could not have happened without a majority rallying to the new government . This is how a newly articulated public opinion became responsible for the survival of the Soviet regime . Since then an even more remarkable victory has been won , and again in the face of overwhelming odds . This time the victory was won on the industrial and agricultural fronts in the two Five Year Plans . Here again Ivan had first-hand knowledge , as he had worked at Magnitogorsk . He admitted that certain extraneous factors contributed to the victory . The country had been drummed into a martial fervor with the cry to save the proletarian fatherland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformation of Russia from the most backward country into one of the most progressive industrial lands could not have been accomplished without the irrepressible will-power of millions who poured their enthusiasm into the great adventure . Without their devotion no amount of drumming could have won the industrial war .  | There was time only for one more question before the bell announced the beginning of the performance , and it was ticklish : " If there were a free plebiscite in Russia , would it be for or against the Communist regime ? " I asked . " Communism would have a majority , " Ivan answered . " You could never induce the younger generation to return to the old order . While there are some older people who grumble , there is a lot of grumbling under every government . That part of the population which is still hostile to us is about to be liquidated . The counter-revolutionaries beyond our borders are notoriously incompetent . Besides , they have never been able to compose their differences among themselves , so that they have been unsuccessful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ridiculous than dangerous . The future is for the Soviets ! " The dance in the next room came to an abrupt end and in the large social hall people made ready to go into the adjoining cinema . Natasha 's young cheeks were flushed with enthusiasm , as she had just read a glowing report on the progress of the creche that was particularly close to her heart . There was an anticipation of pleasure on the faces of the men and women who entered the darkened theater . Impulsive Natasha gave a furtive kiss to Ivan , who thanked her with a smile , and then both of them settled comfortably on their wooden chairs .  | THERE was a swarm of peasants around the railway station , trying to board the local train , while others were taking a rest at the foot of the monument of Lenin shaking his stone finger at an invisible foe in the distant sky . Flowers of acacia trees littered the pedestal like freshly fallen snow . The train pulled into the station and several of its passengers made a dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samovars . Others were peeling out filthy ruble bills for loaves of black bread and dried fish . Small boys with grimy fingers were hovering around the station waiting for an opportunity to steal . Some of them wore coats patched up fantastically . They appeared to be remnants of the army of stray children , pathetically ineffective in wanting to look " tough . " One of them pleaded plaintively with a guard to let him alone so that he could pick destitute peasant pockets . A couple of mujiks were heaving a plank to a shed with much theatrical display of work . An auto rattled up to the station , stirring up a screen of tan dust and barely missing a drunk , who waved a cheerful dosvidanie to its occupant . Our car was waiting in front of a rickety cinema which advertised a lurid American film , and presently  | we were on our way to the collective farm . The road was wide and bumpy , hemmed by squatty houses with thatched and slate roofs . Although spring was in the air , the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog sought to stop our car , barking madly , and the driver ran it down with fatalistic indifference . We stopped in front of the bureau of the collective farm , and , while waiting for its president 's return from the fields , took a look at the village . An elderly woman employee of the kolkhoz , the collective , showed us some of the sights . Despite her age she . had a self-assurance which Russians of the older type have learned from youth , having shed the servility which characterized the rnujik 's wife under the imperial regime . Smoking her mahorka cigaret , she passed comments on life around us in the spirit of orthodox Marxian philosophy , and looked deprecatingly at a former church , now used as a village club by the young people , the korazomols . Above its portal a crude portrait of Lenin was displayed , concealing the religious statuary , and below the portrait a huge streamer exhorted the inhabitants : " Proletarians of All Countries , Unite ! " Part of the church was used as an embryonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leningrad museums . Farther down the street we visited the village meeting room , combined with a cinema , which at one time had been headquarters of the local starosta , the headman . The room now used as the village office had been the turma , the lockup . The walls of the building were plastered with wallnewspapers that bespoke a catholic taste . One of their  | utilizing machines and fertilizers . Another strip of the wallgazette praised Comrade X for his efficient operation of the tool shop , while Comrade Y , a young woman whose comely features were shown , deserved well of the community because of her efficient handling of the chicken farm . In the grievance column a young contributor complained about the lack of adequate supply of books on Marxism , and another contributor suggested some changes in the irrigation system , so as to prevent underground leaks . A girl member described her experiences in another kolkhoz , where she found leisure better organized . She wrote that in the other place they had good travel films , useful lectures , better balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . This was an important way of expressing public opinion on everyday life . We entered the village general store , where peasants were waiting to be served . One of them raised his voice to tell the attendant that he intended to ask his kinsman in Moscow to complain to the authorities about the inferior soap . He was a class-conscious proletarian , he said , whose duty it was to wash himself , and how could he do it with the wretched soap he got ? Another mujik made amorous eyes at an ornate samovar , but gave up the idea of buying it when told by a neighbor that this was the kind of stuff the despised kulaks , rich peasants , used to buy . Leaving the store , we entered the house of one of the collective farmers . The " best room " was screened  | off as a family shrine on important occasions . In the ikon corner the Holy Trinity shared honors with a pugnacious picture of Lenin , his cap slipping in the most informal way from his powerful skull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd and the other stiffly solemn . An old number of the Pravda was lying on the table . Our guide called attention to its leading article about the worries of the capitalistic countries , gaily headed for doom . The article contrasted the troubles of Europe with the marvelous progress of the Soviet Union , marching in sevenleague boots . The peasant 's youngest son wanted to know if I was an engineer , and was disappointed with the negative answer . Next he wanted to know if there were wallnewspapers in America , and his lips curled into a mocking smile when told the truth . An elder son was hard at work on the model of a diminutive airplane , conscious of the fact that to the visitor he was " young Russia . " His fingers moving nimbly , he talked of his desire to become the champion parachute jumper of the district . Back to the office of the kolkhoz we went , to meet its president , Alexij Kluchovski , a youngish man of serious mien . He had the watchful alertness of the peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Communist Party . He had been called to this place because of his expert knowledge of farming , and perhaps also because of his gift of gab . His softly sibilating consonants bespoke a man of Russia 's western marches and not of the Don region , where we met.  | Certain things in Bolshevist Russia are seldom mentioned , and the great famine of 1923 is one of them . Alexij said no word about it , but the elderly woman had , after having run short of more suitable topics . She gave us an account of Alexij 's early life , in which famine played a part . During the World War , Alexij was still a child , living with his parents near the city of Minsk in White Russia . Although they were poor , unhappiness was not one of the permanent household guests , as they were too ignorant to be conscious of their misery . The animal pleasures of life compensated them for the monotony of animal toil . They had nearly always enough to eat , and felt almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world crumbled to pieces . Their village was evacuated in a hurry when the enemy was reported to be headed in that direction . The family moved to the banks of the Volga , where one of their kinsmen lived . Alexij lent a hand at farm work and despite his youth he was skilful in repairing tools . The army needed food , the peasants got good prices , and once more Alexij could fill his little stomach with cheap bread . Then came bolshevism , which was good , as the peasants took the land of the rich and divided it among themselves . At times the division was peaceful and sometimes it was not , in which case skulls were cracked and arteries were opened . Finally , all settled down to a happy life under communism , convinced that it meant long slumbers on the ledge of the warm stove and little work . But there was civil war in the country , the army needed bread , and the requisitions were strict , which  | peasants resented as an intrusion . Seed became scarce , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army or killed by the peasants to keep the army from taking them . The peasants of the Volga region were good people until aroused , when they went mad and became cruel toward everybody including themselves . Rather than let the State take a large slice of their bread , they decided not to work at all . In their efforts to commit mass-suicide , nature helped them with a devastating drought , and the famine was the end . At first the peasants did not know what it was , and then they knew . They cooked the leather of their boots , chewed straw , killed stray cats , and finally one another . The weaker ones lay down and died , but the tougher ones continued to fight against fate . They were too weak to rave and their minds were devoid of images of horror . Impelled by an animal instinct to live , they went in search of bread . Some of them were torn to pieces by packs of dogs , which had reverted to the savage state . Alexij 's mother died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was never heard of again . Alexij joined a gang of young people who reeled to the nearest railway station . The trains were already crowded with hunger refugees , hanging on to bumpers and to the tops of the cars . There was a fight for places , and Alexij found himself between two cars , his weak body resisting the maddened thrusts of earlier corners to get rid of him . At every station the fight broke out anew , and sometimes the train would take several days to make a score of miles . The engineer also was hungry ,  | and where was he to find food for his panting engine ? A locomotive is not like a human being who can commit murder for food , nor is it a human being who can march on an empty stomach . Young Alexij maintained his desperate foothold on the train . They were headed toward the South , and arriving at Astrakhan he roved the Kirghiz and Kalmuk steppes in search of life . He got some food , but not enough , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region around Tiflis , where his body was saved . But what about his soul ? Countless young people banded themselves into packs of human wolves , raiding misery for crumbs of mud-like bread . They not only robbed , but murdered on occasion , outcasts of a cruel world which had lapsed into chaos . The inherently honest nature of Alexij saved him from losing his moral foothold . After several attempts to reach home had failed , he secured admission to an agricultural school where his brightness gained him a scholarship . After graduation he went to work on a State farm , and a political leader of the district soon had his eyes on him . When the era of collectivization broke , Alexij was already an accomplished farmer , and after intermediary occupations of less importance he was sent to the kolkhoz in the Don region , where we met . Thus far the story was based on the narrative of the elderly woman . Now let us hear Alexij 's less dramatic version . He remembered the native soil tilled by unwashed peasants , whose only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wind-corroded cheeks red with exertion , moving like automatons , interrupting  | their work with uproarious laughter at some ribald jest when feeding time was near . Food was the main goal of their life , the essence of their ambitions , and their second goal was beastly love-making in the dim light of the oil lamp in the ikon corner , while the children looked on and did not even wonder . Alexij smiled at the Tolstoyan idea of innocent peasants leading a bucolic life in the abundant lap of nature . He knew that for the poor it was a life of animal exertion , while the rich had all the breaks in the world . The few well-to-do peasants of the old regime joined the exploiters who hired the sweat of the poor for a few pennies . A semi-nomadic band of floaters competed with the native population for crusts of stale bread and rotten potatoes . The floaters slept in the stables so long as they did not disturb the slumber of the cows . What could a peasant gain under the pre-Communist regime ? Alexij @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instrument of discontent , and schools were closed to most of the children of the village , many of whom roamed the countryside in search of a charitable teacher who would give them the elements of knowledge . The village priests dispensed a religion which Alexij described as paganism , and sold miracle-working charms for the hard-earned kopeks of the poor . He recalled the day when the Czar passed through their village on his way to the army maneuvers near the frontier district . The priest had told them the previous Sunday that Heaven would grant them ten more years of life if they witnessed the arrival of the sovereign . This was the government 's way of drum- ming up popular enthusiasm for the imperial family , so the foreign military attaches in the retinue of the august personage could report vivid stories of the Czar 's popularity which would help the Russian imperial regime to float foreign loans . The Czar passed through the village in splendor and the peasants cheered him as per instructions , when a little girl spoiled the festive spirit by throwing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb , or perhaps thought nothing at all , and merely followed an atavistic urge by crushing the head of the little girl . Alexij liked to contrast the old days with the present . " You entered the mujik 's house , " he said , " after the family had returned from the fields . They ate their kasha , which looked like a combination of mud and pebbles . Whenever a child dozed off , the grown-ups kicked him awake and made him bring water for the samovar . Although women worked in the field as hard as men , they did not only all the housework but also the wood-chopping . The weaker one was , the harder he or she had to work , as the stronger ones took advantage of weakness . " When tea was ready , it was again the men who had the first chance at it , sweetening it by sucking small pieces of sugar . In many houses , the head of the family treasured a bottle of cheap vodka , which would have burned the inside of any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the money for the stuff . The others watched him slump to the floor , and then the fight started to see who should be the next to get drunk . " At nine o'clock in the evening , when it was still light outside , all of them were asleep on the bare floor ,  | fully clothed . As a matter of fact , the floor was not quite bare , as it was swarming with bugs . " Then Alexij turned to the nearer past . This had been a Cossack village , and it was not easy to train the spoiled riders of the steppes , the darlings of the Czar , to Communist ways . They set up a strong resistance against Moscow 's agents , as if they could dictate their own terms , and it took several years before their resistance could be overcome . A few of them barricaded themselves in their houses and emptied their rifles at the Moscow envoys . Others burned their grain and slaughtered their cattle rather than turn them over to the collectives . Here the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive one . The president of the kolkhoz did not say , but one could not help wondering , how many of the recalcitrant inhabitants of the village had died or been bundled off to Siberia or the North , there to build the Baltic-White Sea Canal . Moscow 's efforts were not fully rewarded at first . Resistance to the collectives was so strong that the region could not be nationalized at once . Some of the old hands were allowed to cultivate their lands , but gradually the majority began to realize the impossibility of holding out against the government , and they applied for permission to join the kolkhoz , which meant that they had to turn over their fields and livestock to the community . A compromise was struck later , when Moscow decreed that one-family houses , poultry , a cow and a horse could be retained in private ownership . At first the kolkhoz tried to give its members  | what they needed , but later the policy of rewarding each according to his work was adopted . In the bureau of the collective the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modern industrial concern . Nothing reminded him of being in the " best room " of a rich Don Cossack of the imperial era , unless it was a few faded photos showing the owner in his most intimidating uniform , daggers and all . Alexij produced charts and figures , quoted percentages and expanded on the market value of farm products . He contrasted the smooth working of the combines with the inefficient operation of human brawn . A Chicago farm journal was lying on his desk . He spoke of stamping out illiteracy , running their creche and taking care of their ill and aged . He sounded earnest and serenely business-like , slightly condescending only in his questions about America 's privately owned farms . He could not see how practical-minded American farmers could not yet find the way to help themselves . When asked whether in his opinion the idea of collectivism had taken deep root , he answered with a decisive yes , admitting at the same time that in certain regions of Russia the light of reason had not yet fully dispelled the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to remain a slave of his past . Having been a slave so long , he could not always appreciate the blessings of freedom . What does this new freedom consist of ? Freedom from starvation , if he is willing to work and does not sabotage the work of those who want to help . Under the old system of large estates he saw nothing but millions of poverty-stricken peasants , holding on  | to tiny plots of land and killing one another so as to gain a handful of black dirt . And after they had it , were they happy ? No , because they had to retain it against a system which penalized hard work and served corruption and oppression . Many peasants were at first disappointed with the collectives , in which they saw the negation of their hopes . They had thought that communism would give every peasant a large estate , and disliked the idea , propagated by the Kremlin , that the kolkhoz farmer was a factory worker . They wanted to remain peasants . But now the idea was fast gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Does the Russian collective express the desire of a large part of Russia 's peasantry ? " In answering this question Alexij 's testimony had to be supplemented with the opinions of others not handicapped by official positions . If the Russian peasant were asked today whether he liked collective farming or private ownership , and were assured that his selection would not involve him in difficulties , he would no doubt select private ownership . The spirit of " mine and thine " is still strong in the peasant , and as he is a suspicious creature ( for which he has good grounds ) he never feels safe unless he knows that he has complete control of the object of his desires . So strong is the possessive instinct of the Russian peasant that even the militant era of communism had to take it into consideration . While the city was socialized , the village became the stronghold of a new grand army of capitalism . The peasant  | either took or received his land , and was happy with it , until he found that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not break up large estates , even though they represent the most iniquitous system of land-distribution , and expect the beneficiaries to profit from the agrarian reform unless you supply them with tools and means to effect readjustments . But Russia had not the wherewithal of such a reform , and even if she had had it , the success of the venture would have been in doubt . Besides , the Bolshevist leaders have their own blueprints of the communist heaven , and private property in the village is not ? and has never been ? taken into their calculations . There was a time when they became keenly conscious of the inconsistency of communism in town with capitalism in the village . What were they to do ? The town was a comparatively easy problem , as its inhabitants formed a small fraction of the entire population and its concentrated nature lent itself to effective police measures . But how was one to police more than eight million square miles of countryside , reaching from the Baltic to the Pacific ? A hundred and fifty million peasants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too dangerous even for the most determined Cheka and the Ogpu , the secret police . The masters of the Kremlin consider themselves apostles of an idealistic faith . In trying to execute the blue-prints prepared by Marx and Engels they proceeded from the assumption that the rest of mankind was also more interested in a cause than in financial returns . At the same time they wanted to make Russia  | reach a higher stage of civilization and prosperity with all the fervor of religious apostles . Only idealists can muster so much hatred for contrary opinion as they had . Wanting to take the hurdles at a terrific rate , they blandly ignored geography , history , and the peasant mentality . They knew that if they wanted to proceed gradually they could not accomplish their work in many decades . So , being intolerant , they proceeded by gigantic steps . In a European country this would have been impossible , but Russia is not Europe , nor is it Asia ; it is Russia , and the laws applying to it do not apply to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression that he has become used to words of command . Besides , a submissive religious strain in him accords well with the submissive religious basis of communism , which is largely an Oriental religion . Millions of Russian peasants went to bat for private property . They are either dead or silent . More millions had not strong enough convictions to lay down their lives , and their dislike of the kolkhoz was not vehement enough to upset the calculations of the Russian masters . If the entire country had revolted , the Kremlin would have been forced to abandon the idea of collectivization . But the country as a whole slowly yielded to pressure . Public opinion does not always assert itself positively , but sometimes acts in a negative way by failing to put up a strong enough resistance to permit the consummation of a result . Peasant public opinion , as expressed in passive and active resistance , lacked the punch to halt the onward march of collectivization . The idea of cooperation in farming is so healthy that it did  | not require too much effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the peasantry . Today the idea has largely overcome opposition and is on the way to final triumph . As the Russian village is becoming more articulate , the Kremlin derives encouragement to continue on the road that leads to collective life .  | ABOUT Italy you can say everything and its reverse . The poet Alfieri wrote that nowhere does the human plant develop as powerfully as in Italy . It is the country of mighty individualism and of the regimented religion of fascism . The contrasts begin with her population . Sicily is both Nordic and Oriental , blended with the African . " There one may be more taciturn than a Scotchman , " Count Carlo Sforza wrote , " and one is always haughty and sad , while in Naples one is dissipated and gay . " The same author asserted that the Genoese are more stiff-necked than the northern English and more intent upon profits than the Jews . The North and South of Italy represent not merely geographical locations but different cultures . The North grew up under German and Celtic influence , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africans may be clearly seen . Between the two were the States of the Church , a sort of No Man 's Land . While the North gave the world great artists , composers and poets , the South gave it some of its great philosophers . The Mezzogiorno , the South , is beautiful and bleak , the home of gay song and stark poverty , eking out a miserable living under a gloriously blue sky . It is again the very opposite of the rich Settentrione , the North ,  | the soil of which is watered by rivers whose very name is poetry , the land of vineyards and orchards , the reward of conquerors from Hannibal to Napoleon . While Rome is the center of the oldest and largest Christian religion , the Italians are born skeptics . Tolerance is said to be an Italian trait , and yet few civilized countries can match Italy 's record of intolerance . Is Italy the land of freedom or of slavery ? She is probably both . It was an Italian city , Bologna , which liberated the serfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large southern latifundia existed as late as the World War . Italians are known to be addicted to the dolce far niente , yet where is there a country in which Italians do not perform the heaviest and most thankless tasks ? Where is the modern pyramid in the building of which Italian labor had no part ? The English of the eighteenth century called the Italians the Carnival Nation , yet there is scarcely a foot of territory on the peninsula which has not been claimed from nature by back-breaking work . Lombardy , the world 's garden spot , was at one time a succession of swamps . Count Sforza is author of the statement that Italian patriotism is linked with the municipio , the city , and yet where else does the countryside exert a more potent influence on life and death ? It was an Italian philosopher who said : " Our nation has not changed since St. Francis , " and it was an Italian , Signor Marconi , who gave the world the modern wireless , considered by many the voice of the twentieth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The multitude is more constant and wise than a monarch , " and it was again an Italian , Signor Benito Mussolini , who contended :  | " The multitude can become articulate and powerful only through the acts of one man , the Leader . " The Italian was the typical Kulturmensch , a man of culture in the most exalted sense , and still it is fascism 's aim to make him a cittadino soldato , the military man . Tolstoy wrote in his War and Peace that the Italian is selfassured because he is excited and easily forgets himself . On the other hand , we hear of no nation with a stronger sense of dignity than the Italian . Out of such contrary seeds fascism has grown . Is it native to the Italian soil ? At the general elections of 1919 it was practically non-existent . A year later it was still negligible . Two years later Signor Mussolini was in Rome with his black shirts . Why has fascism been so successful ? " Because it has carried politics to its logical conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , " one observer holds . " It introduced methods which Tammany Hall tried on a smaller scale with such signal success . " A former professor of the universities of Rome and Milan , G. A. Borgese , finds the roots of fascism reaching back to the era of Macchiavelli and the Renaissance historians of Florence , who despised the idealism of unarmed prophets and believed in the State as an arbitrary power . Tracing the black- and brown-shirted creeds to their original source , Professor Borgese attributes its paternity to the racial and religious isolation of the biblical Jews . Whatever its origins , it is difficult to consider fascism as something permanent , since inconstancy is the only permanent feature of Italian life . Today II Duce may be extolled to heaven , and tomorrow he may be hurled  | into political nirvana without any warning . How he has gained the adhesion of millions of Italians will be briefly sketched in the following story of young Giovanni , who will also help us to understand how he and his like have helped to shape Italian destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought thousands of citizens to the streets of Torino . " To whom does Italy belong ? " a deep bass voice asked , and the multitude replied : " A not ! " " To us ! " The steps of the Stazione Centrale were black with excited country people , descended upon the Piedmontese capital to add their mercurial enthusiasm to that of the city . In the Piazza Carlo Felice the formidable chin of I1 Duce , painted on canvas , challenged the thousand-throated crowd to break into sky-storming cheers . Behind Mussolini 's gigantic portrait were the trumpeters who answered the fanfares of the marchers . The standard-bearers preceded the parade , followed by young avanguardisti wearing the city colors in their scarfs , marching with pantherlike elasticity in their rubber-soled sport shoes . Many of them were tall boys , fair of complexion , typical of the Northern Italian racial potpourri of Lombards , Goths , Vandals and diverse Teutonic tribes . Then came detachments of Young Fascists , carrying real arms , conscious of their privileges and even more conscious of the barrage of warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of autumn flowers in their path . Just before they reached the Ponte Umberto ,  | across the River Po , the paraders were joined by another column . The real celebration began when the united columns reached the faded green of the Giardino Pubblico . The monument of Duke Amadeus of Aosta was already surrounded by a milling crowd of townspeople , intoxicated with patriotism , with the colors of the standards , the sound of the fanfares , the portraits of Il Duce , the strains of the Giovinezza and perhaps a glass or two of chianti . After the marchers had taken up their positions , the loudspeakers were turned on to transmit I1 Duce 's speech from Rome . The amplifiers emitted sputtering shrieks , as if Inferno were broadcasting into vacant space a weird symphony of lost souls seeking their bodies . Then there came a hush , and even the noisy sparrows of the Public Garden seemed to be awed by the solemn moment . The silence was followed by the rattle of a powerful voice , which commanded , barked and chuckled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alps , the outlines of which could be faintly seen . It was Il Duce 's voice , coming from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia in Rome , where he faced an admiring army of Fascists . I.lis voice rose to a strident crescendo and then dropped to a confidential pianissimo , but it never faltered . All Italy stood before him , marveling at her own unquestioning obedience to the man who had the courage to command . As the voice rattled out of the amplifiers , hard faces assumed expressions of beatitude such as one would not expect to see outside of darkly curtained bedrooms . The voice thundered on , drunk with its own assurance ,  | carried away by reflected mass-suggestion . A breeze of the Alps stole into Torino 's Public Garden , light with the freshness of the freshly fallen snow of the high peaks , fluttering the standards and whistling a brisk melody into the amplifiers . Then there was a thunderstorm , as the loudspeaker registered applause in Rome , which Torino continued . Next the local party chieftains spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homage . Could anyone be as perfect as the Leader they described ' Did Petrarca ever see his Laura as enchanting as these hardened politicians saw their idol ? Now that the crowd had spent itself in marching and applauding , had dazzled and been dazzled , it was languorously ready to give pleasure a chance . Those who knew their way had made an early start for the cafes in the park . Giovanni Ruggiero and Giovanna Saladino were sitting at the table , sipping their vermouth with carefully husbanded delight . They enjoyed the vivacious crowd and the colorful setting of the Castello del Valentino , the rich renaissance style of which was in tune with the scene . It would not have surprised them at that moment to hear the fanfares announce the arrival of His August Highness , the Duke of Savoy , surrounded by his fantassins and standard-bearers . After the vermouth Giovanni ordered a light supper of polenta and stufatino , to be washed down with a bottle of nocera umbra . I was with them , and they were eager to make me see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fascist organization , and Giovanna was a member of the young women 's group . He was twenty-eight , a skilled mechanic  | in the " Fiat " automobile factory , and she was twentythree , a saleslady in a millinery shop . He was tall and his hair was light , indicating his origin as a descendant of Nordic invaders . His eyes were a luminous gray , his features clear-cut and expressive , and he had an honest face . She had that dark attractiveness in which the Italian cities farther South are so rich . Giovanni came from the village of Avigliani , a few score miles east of Torino . His childhood was spent in the shadow of a great disaster , after his father had been torn to pieces for his country when his regiment was going in to reserve from the murderous Doberdo . His mother was working then in a local dynamite factory where people were blown to bits for a piece of bread rather than for their country . An uncle sent them small amounts of money from America , which helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the poor Italian country boy on the rich plains of the River Po . Nature was kind , the fruit tasted sweet and his fingers were nimble ; besides , the wealthy landowner 's eyes were not always on the orchard . His mother was determined to give Giovanni some schooling , and she had made up her mind definitely not to allow him to risk his life in the dynamite factory . She had dreams of his becoming an engineer , with an assured income and a cozy home , where she would look after him . Ile was her only child , a daughter having died in infancy . In Avigliani the families were not large . Giovanni was fifteen years of age when Mussolini took the train to Rome and was invested with power by the King ? an event celebrated in history as the  | " March on Rome . " Although the local administration of Avigliani was radical , the village remained quiet after the march . For months after Mussolini was made premier the village fathers were positive he could not succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village continued to ignore fascism until one day a group of Black Shirts put an end to the " red " administration . Those who did not say good-bye to their old loyalties were jailed or exiled , and the others were given a chance to repent . Avigliani was now taken under Fascist wings and Il Duce began to dominate the scene . It was a local teacher , a former Socialist , who first discovered Mussolini 's greatness by studying his skull . The teacher , who knew something about phrenology , pointed out that the form of the Leader 's head revealed a genius similar to that of Julius Cesar . His words were at first received with guffaws , which soon turned into grunts of approval as the mockers were taken away . The squat house which had sheltered the Left tradeunion branch was now turned into the Casa del Fascio . The village also had one of the Fasci di Combattimento , and the day on which Il Duce formally recognized it was a holiday . Rumor said that Mussolini might visit Avigliani , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen him in the village , his heavy chin covered with a dense growth of beard so as to escape recognition . Giovanni followed the call of higher wages and set out for Torino , promising his mother an easier life . The automobile factory hired him , and he served the machine all day , adjusting to the cars a gadget which  | looked like a pair of skates . At first he thought his back would break in two . Once or twice he collapsed with fatigue and the foreman swore at him in the choice dialect of Calabria , which he did not understand . But after a few weeks Giovanni became used to his servitude and even began to find comfort in the quiet irresponsibility of his work . He earned far more than he could have made in his native village , and part of his money went to his mother . Looking back upon himself with the perspective of years , Giovanni now saw himself as a young animal with hardly more than a robust appetite for food and pleasure . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakening . In his free time he frequented the cinemas , but after he drifted into the Teatro Carignano and saw Il Pagliacci for the first time in his life opera became his passion . After the day 's work , Giovanni had little desire to read newspapers , except on Sundays , when he liked to read stories of high adventure but not the editorials . At that time fascism was scarcely more than a name to him . Reality for him meant the machine and the staccato automatic hammers , together with his daily food and the opera . But he could not help noticing the Black Shirts in the streets , Il Duce 's name on the walls , and his pictures everywhere . Without his knowing it , young Giovanni had become grist in the propaganda mills of the Roman gods . His work was good , and one day an assistant to the manager called him into the office , raised his pay , transferred him to a better working place and told him they were keeping an eye on him . One night soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated him to a glass of vermouth at the Cafe Ligure , and asked him whether he would not like to take an evening course in engineering . The foreman had heard at the office that Giovanni had good chances of promotion if he was willing to study in his free time . That night was a turning point in Giovanni 's life . Until then he had been a part of an amorphous mass ? the people , who want to eat , sleep and love . Now he discovered his ambition , and decided not to let the opportunity slip . He also awoke politically , which he attributed to his awareness of progress in life and to the fact that some of his fellow workers were Fascist Party members . Admission to the party was closed , just then , which spurred the young man on to crash the gate . Some of his teachers at the evening course appeared before their classes in black shirts , and combined their technical instruction with excursions into sociology . One of them had just returned from a trip to France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , once so contemptuous of their Latin cousins across the Alps , were developing a salutary fear at the prospect of the new Italy 's growing importance . Would Mussolini chase them out of Savoy and the western Riviera ? The teacher wondered . Giovanni began to attend Fascist meetings on Sundays , and gradually he discovered his Italianata . He no longer skipped newspaper editorials , and became a voracious reader of stories about Mussolini 's life . He also scanned the papers for evidences of Italy 's growing importance in the world , identifying himself with Italy ? man and country blended into an indivisible  | whole . He felt he was growing with Italy , and Mussolini became his special Godhead , in whom he reposed the unexpended ambition of the former country boy . In the story of his conversion Giovanni did not say whether the prospect of promotion entered his head when he sought admission to the Fascist Party . Probably it did , but he may have been unconscious of it . He did become a party member , and his initiation was impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In the name of God and Italy , I swear to execute the orders of I1 Duce and to serve with all my strength and blood , if need be , the cause of Fascist revolution . " Mussolini was now his deputy in arranging the affairs of the nation , and Italy his own personal property . He took week-end trips with the Fascist " After Work " Organization , Dopolavoro , in order to become acquainted with his domain . He took a personal pride in Milan 's marble cathedral , in the inestimable treasures of the Northern Italian cities , the Alps and the Great Lakes . He made a special point of visiting Milan when Mussolini spoke , and on one such occasion he happened to turn into a street when I1 Duce 's car swung out of it . He almost dropped dead at the sudden thrill of setting eyes on his idol at such close range . That evening Mussolini addressed Milan 's thousands from the balcony of the Royal Palace . Giovanni felt the warmth of the crowd , the joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle-formation against the powers of darkness . He did not care to realize that he was merely one of the many ; he felt the Leader 's eyes rest upon him with affection , addressing him personally , exhorting and chiding him , instill- ing greatness into him . He felt an almost sensual love for the black figure on the balcony , vociferating into the night , and that evening he felt himself a knighted citizen of Italy the Great . He felt he was somebody ; a man with a will and future . He did not know that his personal freedom was limited to adulation , and that the least criticism was high treason . He did not know that the newspapers which he now liked to read were written by journalistic coolies , the glow of their words synthetically produced in the furnaces of propaganda . He did not know ? perhaps did not care to know ? that this was a one-way political liberty , and that going in the opposite direction would have meant prison or the loss of life . Giovanni found himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most keenly when singing the Giovinezza : Youth , youth , springtime of loveliness , In the bitterness of life , Your song rings out and away . He engaged in sports , excelling in ski and mountain climbing . It was on a ski excursion into the Alps that he met Giovanna , who impressed him with her health , her muscular body , and the special colors on her uniform , which indicated that she had served the party well on some trying occasion . Work at the factory became easier , and now he was looked upon as a young man of much promise . It was hinted to him that if he tried hard enough he might be admitted to the Fascist militia , and he received this  | honor without the usual tantalizing period of waiting . The militia commander , a retired army officer , made a stirring harangue in which he admonished them to live dangerously . The phrase appealed to Giovanni , although he hardly knew what it meant ; but he found out soon enough that members of the militia were expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fascist cause . The life he now led was also one of heavy financial sacrifices , since he had to buy his own equipment , and attend to party duties which claimed nearly all his free time . On week-ends and holidays he joined his company in long marches and exacting maneuvers , but he still managed to see Giovanna . This was Giovanni 's life in a nutshell . Here was the ready-made product , a thoroughbred young Fascist , satisfied with a passive intelligence which found virtue in obedience and subordinated itself to I1 Duce 's wishes and whims . The first commandment of his creed was : " Mussolini is always right " ? Il Duce , who preached a religion of endless wars ! The nationalistic religion to which Giovanni subscribed was a militant one . His Italy was supposed to be so far superior to all the rest of the world that it could not help generating a strong , expansive force . Even the mothers were placed in war service , told that it was their patriotic duty to bring forth soldiers whose mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For Il Duce and the fatherland ? What was Il Duce 's fatherland ? An abstract principle , in the service of which Giovanni was expected to find his apotheosis of self-destruction . In explanation of his allegiance , Giovanni repeated  | the time-worn formula : " Before Mussolini there was Italy , but there were no Italians . " His childhood horizon had been limited to Torino and the Piedmont . ( He could not understand the language of the wounded Sicilians he met during the World War . He smiled at the lugubrious accents of the Apulian masons in his village . ) In those days Rome herself was only a mystic force , into which both Italy and Catholicism entered , with the Quirinal playing second fiddle to the Vatican . In Piedmont resentment was still alive against Rome for having deprived Torino of her dues as the nation 's capital . Was not the House of Savoy the creator of Italy 's unity ? Had not Torino been the capital for centuries ? Giovanni evidently recalled Cavour 's words : " It is more difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight against Austria and the Church . " He may have heard of a German writer 's observation : " The great plague of Italy is her campanilismo , her parish-pump outlook . " At Fascist gatherings some of the speakers must have quoted Bakunin : " There is not one Italian nation , but five : the church , the upper bourgeoisie , the middle class , the working class , and the peasantry .
