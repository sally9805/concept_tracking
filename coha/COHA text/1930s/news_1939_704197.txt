txt Formation of an export cartel , under the Webb Act . thorugh which orders from European nations for petroleum products could be cleared , was recommended by J. A. Moffett , chairman of California Texas Oil Co .. Ltd .. and former secretary of the National Petroleum War Service Committee during the World War . Mr. Moffett. addressing the 37th annual convention of the National Petroleum Association here , said that without some central organization . every " Tom , Dick and Harry " win have a war order which he will be trying to place in the United States , and thus cause unnecessary confusion . The first demand from abroad . Mr. Moffett said , would come for aviation gasoline and motor spirit , which will be followed by heavier demand as the war goes on , for a general line of petroleum products . The Webb corporation , be said , would permit the members to legally sit around the table establish prices for export , and the Allied governments should be notified that ti , is corpora tion should receive inforniall , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn , this corporation should allocate among the members their proper proportion of the purchases to be made . " If . later on , the United States should be drawn into the wart he Webb Act corporation could be absorbed by a National War Service Committee and to the coordinate picture of . the Allies ' demand , the requirements of the United States ' forces at home and abroad could be added , so that the industry would know quantities required , quality and specifications , and could take steps to provide the necessary requirements as was the case during the World War , " he added . Ryan Addresses Group Paul Ryan . president of the National Refining Co . told the convention that the industry could do much to solve its own problems , but only by concerted action and constructive cooperation . This , however , the large companies are afraid to do in the face of the growing trend of government investigations , he said . He said that the government could be helpful by imposing only reasonable taxes , eliminating punitive taxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial for the industry , the consumer and the government . The present maladjustment between the selling price of crude oil and selling prices of relined products , arising from the quasipolitical aspect of crude production and the restraint on adequate leadership in the marketing of refined products , precipitates a serious problem , Mr. Ryan said . " The recent concerted action of governmental authorities to curtail production , with a consequent stiffening in the price of crude oil , was approved by all in the industry , " he added , " because we recognize that neither the price of crude oil nor the price of refined products is high enough for profitable operation , nor up to the price levels of other products which the consumer buys . " In comparing the present emergency with the World War , Mr. Moffett said that practically the same situation exists in Europe with the exception of Rumania and Italy from the standpoint of supplies . Italy . during the last war , was fighting with the Allies , and it was possible to maintain a free flow of supplies through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and English ports . 011 From Iraq Should Italy join the conflict with Germany . he added , " it would be fair to assume that the Flow of oil from Iraq and shipments from Abadan level which it could have very properly charged . would be very materially affected , if not cut off entirely . The Iraq supply has averaged 82. - 000 barrels per day so far this year ; Iran 220. - 000 barrels per day . It is stated that approximately 70% of the Iran oil moves through the Canal to Europe . which would be approximately 154,000 barrels per day , plus 82,000 from Iraq , or 236,000 barrels per day for the Allies . " Posing the question : " Will the Allies seek supplies from the United States or nearby Latin American producing centers as they did during the World War ? " Mr. Moffett gave it as his opinion that if the war continues for any length of time , this will be the case . " I believe , further , that even though the Mediterranean and Suez remain open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here for supplies . " He added , however . that tonnage position will dictate the points of production from which supplies will be drawn . Stating that Allied tanker tonnage is approximately 4,000,000 tons , he said it is fair to assume that under war conditions this . will become 2.000.000 tons in actual carrying capacity . - Says Secretary Misinformed He charged that Secretaiy Ickes was misinformed recently " by someone who might have a desire to seize the opportunity under the present existing emergency to take over the petroleum industry under federal control . " Crude oil did not go to $3 a barrel during the World War , Mr. Moffett said , and the basic supply did not exceed $2.25 a barrel at the well and for a considerable time the top price was $2 . He added that shipments abroad represented a. small percentage of the total daily consumption , " that the oil resources were not exploited , and that the industry did not conduct itself in a. wasteful manner . " The industry . he said , in view of higher material and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
