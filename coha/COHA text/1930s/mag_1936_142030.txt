DEATH VALLEY PROSPECTORS-Dane Coolidge-Dutton ( $2.50 ) . <P> The first white men to see Death Valley searched for gold while fleeing for their lives , thereby setting a pattern that prospectors into that dismal region have followed ever since . On Christmas Day , 1849 , a party of emigrants in 27 wagons known as the Sand-Walking Company , lost while trying to find a short cut from Salt Lake City to San Bernardino , Calif. , entered the Valley by way of Furnace Creek and never got out . Ahead of the Sand-Walkers there was a band of young men , traveling in 20 wagons , unencumbered by women or children , known as the Jayhawkers , who split off to save themselves when the train bogged down , turned aside to locate what became known as the Lost Gunsight Mine , and never got out of Death Valley either . Only survivors were the families in four wagons trailing behind the Jayhawkers . When , the wagons could go no further , two young scouts pushed ahead , traveled 25 days across the desert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , returning with horses from California to rescue the two families surviving . <P> Last week Dane Coolidge made the Jayhawkers ' tragedy the starting point of a rambling , formless but interesting account of the perils of gold-hunting in the hottest region on earth , the 500 square miles of volcanic rock , salt deposits , borax mines , poison springs and complete desolation that make up Death Valley . Divided into eleven brief chapters and illustrated with 17 excellent photographs by the author , Death Valley Prospectors is partly an account of Author Coolidge 's travels through the Valley , partly history as he picked it up from his reading and his talks with Indians and oldtimers like Death Valley Scotty . The first famed lost mine in the Valley after the Gunsight was the Breyfogle . Huge , big-footed Louis Jacob Breyfogle found it in 1864 , brought back ore that was rotten with gold , but he had been so tormented by his Indian captors that he went crazy whenever he approached the area of his wealth and suffering . The Indians had started following him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left could have been made by a human being . <P> Still lost , the Breyfogle is generally thought to have been in a region where several rich mines were later located , is believed by Death Valley Scotty to have been buried by cloudbursts.
