In its 200-year-old , vast and grubby Charity Hospital New Orleans has a medical ulcer which long has pained the local medical profession . Last year Louisiana 's Governor Richard Webster Leche secured $3,600,000 from the Public Works Administration and Charity 's new director Dr. George Samuel Bel immediately started tearing down old buildings to make room for a 20-story hospital , the only State institution where Louisiana citizens may get all types of free medical care . While reconstruction progressed , patients had to be bedded in any available shelter . For Charity 's Negroes , the old Negro Pythian Temple proved handiest . <P> That makeshift ward recently became a subject of scandal when Editor Morris Fishbein of the American Medical Association threatened to bring it to the attention of " the medical profession and the people of America . " On a visit to it he had found 27 patients using ten three-quarter beds ( two resting and one waiting his turn ) , and men and women suffering from tuberculosis and other contagious diseases placed near children of six and seven years . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions in his hospital as let others do so . In a statement , remarkable in Louisiana where doctors in public office have had to mind their tongues , Dr. Bel , a heart specialist who has been Charity 's director since early in 1936 , declared : " I have attempted in every way possible to at least ameliorate the frightful conditions surrounding the hospitalization of patients . My efforts , I believe , have been somewhat successful . The ratio of patients to beds used to be 1.7 . It is now 1.2 . But , in spite of this , much remains to be done in order to remedy a situation which undoubtedly has no parallel in the medical annals of America . . . . <P> " When completed the new 20-story , 2,500-bed Hospital will only be able to provide adequate hospitalization for persons acutely ill from conditions other than infectious and contagious diseases . The new construction will not remedy the appalling and well-nigh unbelievable conditions existing insofar as tuberculosis , neuropsychiatric conditions , infectious and contagious diseases , incurable and convalescent patients are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ num-ber of open tuberculosis patients in New Orleans alone as at 2,500 . The Charity Hospital now houses 314 . There are at least 2,000 chronic and incurable cases of cancer and heart disease who require proper hospitalization . No facilities are now available to these poor , unfortunate sufferers . . . . " <P> Charity Hospital 's present trouble is a direct result of the late Huey Long 's insistent attentions to this oldest ( founded in 1737 ) charity hospital in the country . In 1928 Long " captured " the hospital , discharged an experienced director , and put in charge Dr. Arthur Vidrine , 31 , a promising graduate of Tulane University who had done post-graduate work in surgery in London , Oxford and Paris hospitals , as well as in Charity Hospital where Tulane and University of Louisiana medi-cal students all get their preliminary practice . In Dr. Vidrine 's particular favor for this important post was the fact that he had learned something of business management from his father , a wealthy Evangeline County planter and an early financial friend of Huey Long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
