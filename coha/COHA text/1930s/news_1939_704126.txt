txt Expenses of Government Every One , It Is Contended , Must Pay for Extravagant Spending TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As long as the government can spend all the money it wants to , over and above what it takes in from taxes , merely by printing government bonds , selling these to the banks , and then drawing checks against them , how can we ever hope to stop extravagant government spending ? And when the government spends these billions in such ways that , private citizens do not know which way to turn to make money , and therefore have comparatively little need to borrow from the banks on safe terms , where else can banks invest your money on deposit but in government bonds ? A banker knows that when the United States Government prints a government bond it says in effect that the government will tax the people of the United States to make it good . He knows , therefore , that government bonds are the soundest security in the country just so long as we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Savings Accounts Before the government started spending several billions more each year than it took in from taxes , the savings banks , for instance , could safely lend your money , largely to people who wanted to spend it for private or business uses , at a high enough rate of interest to cover their expenses and pay you 4 per cent . Under present conditions , however , one of the few remaining safe places to invest bank funds is in government bonds . Therefore , as the interest rate on longterm Treasury bonds has been lowered until their average yield is now approximately 214 per cent , at present about all the savings banks can safely get for the use of your money is enough to provide for necessary expenses and reserves and pay you only 2 per cent or even less on your deposits . The Treasury has just announced that to pay off some $426,000,000 of outstanding obligations , which are due in September , and now carry an interest rate of 1% per cent , it will offer in exchange new " notes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 per cent . A New York investment firm recently showed that Treasury obligations maturing in a little more than two years now afford a yield of only one one-hundredth of 1 per cent . At this rate of return it was pointed out that " an investor would have to hold more than $144,000 par value to provide an income sufficient to buy his morning newspaper each day ; he would have to hold $558 , - 000 to provide enough funds to buy a daily package of cigarettes . " As the average interest rate on all Federal obligations is lowered , those having money in savings accounts and insurance policies , which represent their personally saved " social security , " have their interest earnings also reduced as a large part of such funds are invested in government bor ds . This means , therefore , that it will take you longer to pay for your life insurance , as the annual dividends will be less or the premiums will be more . Paying the National Debt Some people think that only the taxpayers of future generations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you own a savings bank account you are paying right now for the increased national debt by getting one-half or less of the amount of interest you used to receive , and the trend is still downward . This means , then , that if , for example , you were trying to put in the savings bank enough money to give you $2,000 a year income , you will now have to ? save $100,000 or more , where when savings banks were able to invest your money safely and pay you 4 per cent you would only have had to save $50,000 to get this same income . Every one in the nation has to pay one way or another for the money our government officials are instructed to spend . Some pay taxes directly , but every one pays indirectly for all government services . The government has nothing to give to the people except what . it gets from the people . WADSWORTH W. MOUNT . Summit . N. J. , Aug. 3 , 1939 . Machinery , Jobs and Men To THE EDITOR OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tractored Out " I might add the following : When I left my apartment this morning I pressed a button for the elevator , stepped aboard , pressed another button , and when the car stopped the door opened and I stepped out . Self-service elevator , one man out of job . I then went to the subway station at Seventy-second Street and found one man making change and nine turnstiles : nine ticket choppers out of jobs . I then boarded a ten-car express manned by two guards : eight more men out of jobs . On reaching the street I noted a surface car operated by one man : conductor out of job , which also applied to a bus which went by at the moment . I also noted trucks which to my inexperienced eye carried probably ten to twenty tons handled by one man , and my thoughts went back to the days when loads of one to five tons required a man to handle them . More men out of jobs . The worst of it is that most of the men who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fitted for other jobs , and your editorial shows what their prospects are elsewhere . And with skilled mechanics now being replaced by machinery , who knows where it will end ? JACOB MARKS . New York , Aug. 2 , 1939 . Hint to Census Bureau TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : With the government about to take the census , allow me to suggest a question or two that will be of great help to the American people . Let the enumerators ? ask : " Have you ever served as a juror ? Which courts ? How many times have you served ? What do you think of our courts ? " I think such information is equally as important as whether the person has a radio . By all means , let us know who is doing jury duty and who is not . SIMON GLASS . New York , Aug. 1 , 1939 . For Peace and Prosperity War Risk in Europe Found Dependent Upon Economic Conditions To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There are two chief problems at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure peace we must make war difficult and onerous for the aggressor . The refusal to provide raw materials or capital would be very efficacious , at the same time boycotting the merchandise of the belligerent country . The embargo on arms also could not but discourage the aggressor . It is not sufficient in effect morally to reprove war : it is necessary to fight it by economic or financial means . But the risks of war in Europe have today economic causes and this is why it is necessary to call a conference of experts . The origins of the economic ills would be sought out by them and they would propose remedies : stabilization of currencies , the clearing up of public finances , the development of international economic relationships . But while awaiting these international measures each naticn ought to restore its own finances and economy . Budgets ought to be balanced and not absorb too great a part of the national revenue . A systematic policy of borrowing ends by pulling down the public credit and constitutes a perpetual threat to the Treasury . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency , with all its disastrous consequences . Finances cleaned up , prosperity will he reborn easily , but energetic action by manufacturers , farmers and financiers can only accelerate the renaissance of business . The government must lend an ear to the sorrows of the business leaders and accept their suggestions , as has just been done in France  --  deserting the regulations which block business , lightening the fiscal charges and not making profits impossible . These are the things which make the wheels go round . For the rest , our initiative has not been paralyzed by the European situation . Viewed from near at hand , it is less disquieting than is believed , and a certain optimism is beginning to make itself manifest . MAINFROT MAIGNIAL . Gaillac , France , July 28 , 1939 . Written in Washington To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The House of Representatives , too hot and tired to work any longer for their $10,000 a year , passed 244 bills In six hours . We have often wondered here in Washington who reads the Congressional Record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them and beguile the hours in their long vacation finding out what they voted for during the session .
