New York . New York 's Metropolitan Opera closed a month ago but one night last week the Opera House was alive with white ties and decolletage , turned out to watch the American Ballet dance three premieres in one evening . Igor Stravinsky , who wrote all three , was on hand to conduct . His Apollon Misagete had never been danced in New York . Le Baiser de la Fee had never been danced in the U. S. The Card Party had never been danced at all . <P> In the last 20 years , Stravinsky has wandered far from his original inspiration . His musical concepts are now spare , straightforward , logical . When , in 1927. music-minded Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge commissioned him to write a ballet , he decided to make it " white . " A " white ballet " does not use colored costumes or gaudy scenery , puts its emphasis on the dancing . Stravinsky was so anxious to keep Apollon Musagete free of color that he scored it only for strings . <P> A white ballet is merciless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone far but is still short of a finished ensemble . Last week it did less than justice to the sophisticated sequences describing Apollo 's birth , adolescence , reception of the Muses and apotheosis . The Muses , at least , were surer on their feet than Apollo , landed more firmly after leaping just as high . Experts , disappointed in the dancing , found much to commend in Stravinsky 's dry music and Stewart Chaney 's restrained , curious set . <P> Le Baiser de la Fee ( The Fairy 's Kiss ) tells how a baby is kissed by the Queen of the Fairies and parted from his mother . He grows into a handsome young man and falls in love . The Fairy reappears , kisses him again , and he follows her into the sea . Stravinsky meant the kiss to symbolize the bestowal of genius upon Tschaikovsky , called the whole work an act of " homage , " pieced it together from Tschaikovsky melodies . The music was distinguished only by some new harmonic departures . George Balanchine 's choreography proceeded unimpeachably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of a classic dance duet , wrapped an unexpected leg around her partner 's torso . <P> Because he had written it expressly for the American Ballet , people took most interest in Stravinsky 's The Card Party . Irene Sharaff 's clever set represented a gaming table in perspective . Upon this table dancers costumed like cards appeared . While they were shuffled , the orchestra played a little processional . The choreography was strict and classical . Group dances , solos , finales showed the cards being played according to Hoyle . William Dollar , a slippery , mischievous Joker , upset calculations , spoiled the most promising hands , was routed finally by a Royal Flush . When the last strains of music had died away , the audience rose and cheered a composer ingenious enough to have knitted fragments by Rossini , Delibes , Strauss , Ravel , Pugni and himself into a seamless whole .
