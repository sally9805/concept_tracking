txt A correspondent at Davenport . Iowa , whose name shall in charity be shrouded in the initials R. R. E. , informs this writer that he is " just plain crazy . " This diagnosis is made on the strength of an article recently appearing in this column on " Inland Canals . " The remarks offered in support thereof are illuminating as to the state of some " public opinion " in the Mississippi Valley . and it is perhaps not altogether a waste of space to print them . They follow . " .. No doubt there are any number of projects that are more or less visionary , but the ninefoot waterway in the Mississippi River is necessary , and the government is perfectly justified in getting behind this development . The financial assistance given the Ohio and Mississippi rivers does not amount to anything like the amount of assistance given by the government to the railroads In the early days in the way of land grants . etc. , etc . It is generally understood that the eastern states , more especially New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of your opposition . ' this improvement is going to be completed . Most of us out here hope for the time when we will be completely independent of eastern domination , and I believe that time is not very far off . It would be a great deal more becoming of a sheet like yours to support improvement of our inland waterways , more especially the Mississippi and Missouri rivers . Frankly your sarcasm and your misleading statements do not make a hit in this country . I do n't suppose there are very many residents in this section who take the trouble to write you , but I can safely say the sentiment of the majority of the citizenship is expressed In this letter . We resent your interference in this section . " Mississippi-Ohio Expenditures 9469.000,000 Up to the end of 1929 , the government had expended upon the Mississippi-Ohio waterways , including original cost , maintenance and operation . excluding all expenditures for other than navigation purposes , a total sum of approximately 5469,000.000 , and this by the end of 1930 had been increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expended for navigation purposes $119,000,000 on other inland and Intracoastal waterways . No expenditures by individual states are included in these totals : New York alone had sunk in its barge canal system at the end of 1929 some $346,000,000 . As against these expenditures , the total land grants to railroads amounted to 155,504,000 acres , either directly by the United States Gov- ernment or by the states , and up to June 30 , 1930. there actually had been patented 132,173. - 225 acres . The bulk of these grants was made prior to 1870 . The average value of these lands for the 20 years . 1850-70 , was 94 cents per acre Let us double thig and for good measure call them worth $2 per acre  --  say 5260.000.000 . This figure surely does not err by understatement . Our correspondent will please observe that this is only about one-half the sum spent on the Mississippi-Ohio Rivers alone , for navigation purposes . But that is merely the opening of the story . In ' the first place , the railroads never realized $2 per acre for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could to attract settlers , and they now hold only a small balance of their original grants . In the second place , they have since 1876 transported mail for 80 ' , of the rate paid to other railroads which received no grant  --  a saving of about $2.000.000 per annum to the United States . In the third place , they transport government passengers and property at one-half commercial rates , and it is worth noting that other railroads for competitive reasons take government business at the same reduction . The saving from this and from mall transportation is not less than $5,000,000 in a normal year and the saving is perpetual Railroads Must Pay Perpetually In the circumstances , it is reasonably certain that the railroads already have paid for their grants and yet must continue to pay perpetually . In the fourth place , of the money grants to the Pacific roads which totalled , principal and interest , about $181,000,000 , there was repaid to the government $169,000,000 . Only the Kansas Pacific , the Sioux City &; Pacific . and the Central Branch Union Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents the " subsidy " thus granted to railroads . Our correspondent 's " state of mind " on this point is the direct consequence of the " propaganda " ceaselessly distributed by government officials throughout the country , and it is hardly too much to say of it that it is little short of a scandal . It is hopeless to expect the truth to gain recognition when the air is full of this sort of thing with the government stamp upon it . Nothing quite like it tan been seen in a very long time , nor can it even offer the poor excuse of " partisan " advantage . Apart from this , our correspondent 's remarks are a good example of the " Gim-me " school of thought which , unfortunately , is all too numerous in this country when it is a question of public monies . It is interesting to note , moreover , that he is a resident of a state which has for a gelreiation enjoyed exceptionally low railroad rates ? yet its appetite is all the keener for yet more favors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal industry has influenced the thinking of some of its citizens in these matters ?
