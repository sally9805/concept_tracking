txt In one of the boldest kidnappings thus far written on the country 's records , two masked gunmen ' snatched William F. Gettle , a retired oil millionaire , from his newly acquired country estate here early today after a midnight swimming party . With no clues as to the victim 's whereabouts , a grimly determined force of Department of Justice agents , acting on instructions from Washington , and State and county police officers today had taken up the search for Mr. Gettle , who is 46 years old , and his abductors . It was believed that he had been spirited away to some isolated cabin , of which there are thousands dotting the canyons in the Sierra Madre Mountains . Mr. Gettle 's fiveacre estate , a part of the famous E. J. R. ( Lucky ) Baldwin ranch , is located in the foothills of the Sierra Madre chain . No Ransom Yet Demanded . So far as was known tonight , no ransom demand has been made by the two gunmen who invaded the Gettle mansion , unknown to Mrs. Gettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil man , whJ is reputed to be a millionaire many times over , proclaimed a willingness to pay " any reasonable ransom demands . " Walter Girten , brother-in-law of Mr. Gettle ; A. E. Fox , a broker , and William J. Drewes , both friends of the family , kept vigil at the big rambling house tonight in the hope that they might receive some signal from the kidnappers indicating what steps should be taken for Mr. Gettle 's release . The abductors left no messages when they took Mr. Gettle away . At the same time , reports reaching here said , that a typewritten note was delivered to The Evening Herald and Express , a newspaper in Los Angeles , fifteen miles away , in which the writer offered his services as intermediary for Mr. Gettle 's release . The writer of the note described himself as " Bill611-Colonial style " and said Mr. Gettle was the only person who would know him by such a name . Friends of the family suspected that the note was a hoax . Investigators declared that the abduction had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trapped in Recreation Hall . Mr. Gettle , the father of four children ranging in age from four to eight years , had just finished the construction of a swimming pool on his estate and gave a swimming party last night for a few friends . After a dip in the pool , Mrs. Gettle , an invalid , and all of the guests but one returned to the house . Mr. Gettle and a guest , James P. Wolf , a Los Angeles furniture manufacturer , went to a recreation hall at the rear of the grounds , where there is a bar , to change from their bathing suits . While standing at the bar , host and guest were startled by the sudden entrance of two young men , apparently Americans , whose faces were masked with handkerchiefs . Mr. Wolf related later that , without any preliminaries , the two strangers ordered him and his host to " stick ' em up . " After obeying the orders , the two men were told to walk out of the recrePtion hall , past the swimming pool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 yards away , continuing their conversation as they did so . During the walk , Mr. Gettle , thinking the men were bent only on robbery , managed to pull his wallet out of his pocket and toss it into some shrubbery . The gunmen saw his action but said nothing until they reached the seven-foot wall , surmounted by barbed wire , that encloses the grounds of the estate . ' Gunman Reveals Plan . Then one of the criminals spoke up : " This is n't a heist . It 's a snatch . " Mr. Gettle apparently understood the meaning of the underworld slang for " holdup " and " kidnap . " He pleaded with the men : " I 'll give you all the money I have on me and go into the house for more if that is n't enough . " One of the gunmen guffawed and replied : " That wo n't be enough . This is a kidnapping , fellow ! ' The abductors then removed the neckties from both men , tying their hands with them , and sealed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to a near-by tree and warned that he would be killed if he gave the alarm within an hour . Mr. Gettle , a heavy-set man weighing about 200 pounds , was hoisted up a stepladder which was leaning against the wall , apparently in accordance with a prearranged plan . The abductors pushed him over , letting him drop on the ground outside . Mr. Wolf said later that he heard the oil man groan as if injured by the sevenfoot fall . Escape in a Small Car . " Do n't be so soft , " Mr. Wolf heard one of the gunmen mutter . The second gunman disapp.easecl over the wall and Mr. Wolf heard an automobile start and drive away . Tire tracks on the lonely road leading to the grounds from the highway Indicated that Mr. Gettle had been taken away in a small car equipped with balloon ' tires . Mr. Wolf struggled desperately with his bonds for half an hour before he was able to free himself . Then he rushed to the house , the adhesive tape dangling from his mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom had retired by this time . Mrs. Gettle was reported tonight to be in a serious state of collapse from the shock of her husband 's disappearance . Their four children , Billy and Betty , 8-year-old twins ; Bobbie , 5 , and Jimmy . 4. were at the Gettle residence in Beverly Hills in the care of servants . A large gang of criminals , including at least one woman , is believed to be involved in the kidnapping . W. G. Lutzi , one of the house guests , who left here at 5 P. M. yesterday , said he saw a woman sit- . Iting in a car near the gate of the Gettle estate as he was deaartinz . A Mysterious Woman . Mr. Lutz ' said her actions struck him as being suspicious and he a proached her and asked what shel wanted . She countered with questions about the Gettle family and about the estate and about Mr. Gettle 's personal affairs . Finally , Mr. Lutzi said , the woman seemed to sense that he was suspicious of her and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she started her motor and drove quickly away . Another guest , Albert Hitchin , related that he barely missed seeing ' the kidnappers . " We had just finished swimming , " he said . " It was a warm night and we were all quite tired after the swim . Mrs. Gettle , Mrs. Wolf and my wife went into the house to retire . " Mrs. Wolf called to me and asked which room she was to occupy . I had just shown her to the room , when her husband came running ' uM He was a strange sight with the adhesive tape on his mouth and his eyes bulging . He shouted , ' It's1 a stick-up , a kidnapping . ' " Lawyer Offers a Ransom . Mr. Hitchin added that he could not believe Mr. Gettle had any enemies , and said that " about the only thing he was interested in was some form of philanthropic en-1 deavor . " The ransom offer by the Gettle ' family tonight was made through Ernest E. Noon , a lawyer , of Beverly Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The offer to pay " any reasonable ransom demand " was accompanied with the request for direct dealings with the kidnappers . The Gettle estate is one of the finest in this region . It is a heavily , wooded tract that was built up into a country estate years ago by Carl Einhart , a dry-ice. manufacturer . Constructed around a patio , the house is a rambling structure of Spanish , type architecture . To one side there is a combination garage and servants ' quarters . Mr. Gettle purchased the estate last year for $125,000 when it was put up for sale . He had hoped that the warm , dry climate of the Sierra Madre foothills might benefit his wife 's health .
