txt Twenty-six states had ratified the Child Labor Amendment when Governor Hurley of Massachusetts issued his vigorous blast against this newest attempt to broaden the Constitution in behalf of Federal Government . The blast was a welcome breeze of commonsense in an atmosphere sicklied o'er with false humanitarianism . From now on the Governor must expect to de attacked as a hard-hearted reactionary , a man without , compassion . That Is the lot of anybody who dares to oppose the Child Labor Amendment . Already there are those who are impugning the Governor 's motives . Personally , I do n't care what hidden motives he may have ; his arguments on their face are , to my way of thinklm unassailable . What of the motives of the advocates of the Child Labor Amendment ? No doubt those of the humanitarian wing of the crusade are pure . As much can not be said , I suggest , of those of the other wing , organized labor . I doubt that the motives of organized labor are dominantly humanitarian . $ * Such a doubt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The main speaker was a well-known labor leader . When a man in . the audience asked him the true motives of organized  --  labor 's crusade for the Child Labor Amendment , he got a withering look and an indignant response for his pains , " Shaming " an objector is , I discovered , the general tactic of labor proponents of the amendment . Turning to an employer , the speaker asked : " Would you , Mr. X , put 18-year-old children to work on your best machinery ? ' I thought at first that the employer would be cowed . At last , however , he essayed an affirmative , much to the discomfiture of the speaker . The motive of much of the agitation among organized labor is to limit work opportunities , The Child Labor Amendment would endow Congress with power to " limit , regulate , or prohibit the labor of persons Under 18 . " The wording does not warrant the title . This is the first time I dare say , that many advocates of the amendment have called the 17-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yOu point it out to them . They may , indeed/add that they would not approve of a ban on all juvenile labor . it is argued that , even if Congress obtained the power , it would not use it ; at least to its full extent . Then why afford Congress ; POwers that even the advocate would hesitate to see invoked by statute ? Prudence itself dictates that the amendment he so worded as to be satisfactory to its adherents if enacted in maximum . The amendment as it stands does not even qualify " labor " with ' " gainful " or " for hire . " It Is usual to laugh at such Met/lions as exaggerated fears . But the objections are particularly valid because of the composition of Congress , It Is well known that organized labor is the most powerful lobby in the National Legislature . A Washington writer said the other day that , except for the President , John L. Lewis commands More votes in the House than any other man . The possibilities underlying the amendment thus become ominous when one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A A A As with the 30-hour week , the great danger of the Amendment h. the passing , of a blanket statute in furtherance of it . For " child ' . labor looks different according to the way It is employed . On the farm , carrying wale : to the threshers or riding the lead horse on a binder , it is wholesome ; in the factory it may be thoroughly unwholesome . In the South a child grows to maturity faster ' than he does in the North . In such circumstances blanket legislation Is dangerous to the unity of the Republic . It may be that , in deference to the differences of conditions In the United States , Congress would try to enact differentials . Equally such an attempt is fraught with danger . NRA tried to legislate differentials in wages as between North and South , In the eaten textile code all was plain sailing for a time . But , before the collapse of the NRA , manufacturers of both North and South were dissasisfled with the differential . And they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NRA thus marked a gratuitous addition toThe stresses and strains of the Republic . Any attempt to lay down differentials in enacting a law in fulfillment of the Child Labor Amendment would , I suggest , have the same result . Such legislation , moreover , would be class legislation . The burden would fall upon the poor , the poor alone . In no plea for this Child Labor Amendment . have I seen any plan for recouping poor widows for the lost support of their juvenile offspring . In the same ' way the original crop reduction plan lost sight of the share croppers who did the reducing but did not receive any of the benefits that went with It . A One of our present problems is the hiatus between the schools and colleges on the one side and work on the other . Little is being done to fill in the gap . And , till the admittedly temporary devices of the CCC and NYA came along , crime , laziness , and unemployability were accumulating in that age group . Under the amendment these ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to me , is a general advance in the school leaYing age and ' the repair of the old apprenticeship system . If , after 18 , a boy is at his best for football , I can not , see that he is too soft to take over a Job of work ; certainly not to learn one , But , as soon as one mentions the repair of the old apprenticeship system , immediately organized is antagonized ; and for the same resons back of its advocacy of the Child Labor amendment , the abridgement of work opportunities . Those humanitarians who are working side by side with organized labor n promoting the Child Labor AMendment , would do well to reconsider-whether the amendment really dOes square with . true huMatiltarianism.
