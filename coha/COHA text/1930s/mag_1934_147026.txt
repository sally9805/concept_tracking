Capitalists rarely take to the streets to sing songs about their economic credo . Communists and " workers , " however , do , noisily , belligerently . A rousing mass song , they have learned , is worth a dozen speeches . And with the growing strength of workers ' parties many a new song has been written , rehearsed wherever workers get together . Lately the first U. S. Worker 's Song Book was released. * Two of the latest Communist hits : <P> " POOR MISTER MORGAN " ( A Round of the " Three Blind Mice " Variety ) <P> Gay and Lively <P> Poor Mister Morgan can not pay his income tax ; <P> Pity poor Morgan he can not pay . He 's dead broke he has n't got a cent . <P> " THE SCOTTSBORO BOYS SHALL NOT DIE " <P> Lively and Well Accented <P> Workers , farmers , Negro and white , The lynching bosses we must fight . Close your fists and raise them high , Labor Defense is our battle cry . Scottsboro boys shall not die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. L. D.+ Will set them free , set them free . <P> Included in Workers ' Song Book 1934 is " God To The Hungry Child . " The words : Slowly and Freely Hungry child , I did not make this world for you , You did n't buy any stock in my railroad , You did not invest in my corporation . <P> Ominous ( not too much ) <P> Where are your shares in Standard Oil ? I made the world for the rich . And they will be rich And they have always been rich . Not for you hungry child . <P> * Workers ' Song Book 1934 , published by the Workers ' Music League ( 250 ) . <P> +lnternational Labor Defense .
