The Lords- <P> Sat stonily through a great squirting of spleen at the Prime Minister by an old friend who left the Labor Party to follow Scot MacDonald but is now the bitterest foe of his National Government . Fired to fury by the repeal of the land tax which he as Chancellor of the Exchequer riveted on England 's great hereditary landlords , self-made and landless Viscount Snowden of Ickornshaw sneered at the Prime Minister : " Once he gave me assurance in a tearful voice that the land tax would be maintained . That was at the time he was begging me not to resign " ( as Lord Privy Seal-TIME , Oct. 10 , 1932 ) . <P> Since then , according to Lord Snowden , Britain 's Conservatives who hold the whip hand of majority over Scot MacDonald have made him their creature to such an extent that : ' ' They will have no use for him at the next election , except the use that is made of a reformed drunkard at a temperance meeting !

" <P> The Commons- <P> Roared approval as Lord Privy Seal Mr. Stanley Baldwin took over as Acting Premier with a suave but unmistakable Tory intimation that , with Pacifist MacDonald out of the way , His Majesty 's Government will at once proceed to build nearly 1,000 additional fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamberlain , whom they loudly cheered , the honor of breaking last week the German Moratorium recently declared by Reichsbank President Dr. Hjalmar Schacht ( TIME , June 25 ) . To bring Dr. Schacht to his senses the Commons , well aware that Germany has a favorable trade balance with Great Britain , passed a bill enabling Chancellor Chamberlain to confiscate enough British payments due on German goods to make good the Fatherland 's announced default on Dawes and Young bond interest payments . By brandishing this authority from the Commons last week , Chancellor Chamberlain scared Berlin into a promise to make full interest payment on the bonds concerned for the next six months ( see col. 3 ) .
