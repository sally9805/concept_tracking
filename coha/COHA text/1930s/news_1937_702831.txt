txt The Ku Klux Klan , while taking I no active part in this year 's Mayoralty contest , will keep a hooded eye on " this un-American city " to learn how to combat the " foreign elements " who are using it as a proving ground for tactics in the national campaigns of 1938 and 1940 . This statement was made yesterday in a suite of the Park Central Hotel by J. L. Baskin , graying middle-aged lawyer of Richmond , Va. , who described himself as the Grand Dragon of a Realm of the Invisible Empire covering Virginia , West Virginia , Maryland and the District of Columbia . Mr. Baskin , whose presence in New York was revealed at the campaign headquarters of United States Senator Royal S. Copeland , a candidate for both Democratic and Republican nominations for Mayor in tomorrow 's primaries , said he expected to address Klan meetings in New York during his visit to this city on " a business trip . " Hien Drive on for Members He estimated the present Klan membership in the metropolitan area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 75 per cent of the peak for all time . A membership drive was in fun swing now , he asserted , and was progressing satisfactorily . He consented to speak at meetings here , he said , at the request of the Grand Dragon of New York , whom he declined to name , solely in the interest of the membership drive . A pleasant-faced , smiling man , with a noticeable Southern accent , Mr. Baskin , refused to reveal where the meetings he expected to address would be held but he did make public some excerpts from the speeches he planned to deliver . He said that he had addressed Klan meetings on other visits to New York without ever knowing in advance where they would be held and he said the audience usually numbered about 300 . " Somebody just comes along and takes me to the meeting , " he explained . " I do n't know my way around New York so very well . " Annoyed Over Publicity Mr. Baskin was frankly annoyed that his presence here had become known to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace all day , what with reporters and photographers ringing his telephone and banging on the door of his tenth-floor suite . If he had known what he was in for when he accepted the invitation to speak , he declared , he would have refused and " taken the next train home . " A member of the Klan since 1917 , Mr. Baskin could not say if Justice Hugo L. Black of the United States Supreme Court also was a member of the hooded order . The Grand Dragon explained that the rules , of the organization forbade members talking about the membership of others . He added : " I have known Mr. Black for twenty-five years . He is an honest man and if you ask him he will tell you . If he gives you an answer it will be the truth . " Mr. Baskin then was cross-ex , amined by the reporters about Klan regalia , its program , its principles and its plans . The robes and insignia , once so fearsome a part of the order , Mr. Baskin said , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn at meetings . The present Klan , he said , was being blamed now for things done in the past by an entirely different organization . " There is no bigotry in the Klan , " he said . " There is n't anything in its rules or by-laws that 's bitter against any race or creed or color . " At the same time he explained , every organization has its own requirements for membership . The Klan , he said , insisted that its members be native born , white gentiles and citizens who believed in the Christian religion . A reporter suggested that Catholics would be admitted under these specifications and Mr. Baskin explained that while the Klan did not bar communicants of that church , " they kind of bar themselves , " because there were parts of the ritual to which Roman Catholics would find it impossible to adhere . As for the Negro , Mr. Baskin said they were good servants who could be made into good citizens but added : " I do n't want any Negro governors . " The Klan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Baskin thought would be combating corn- i munism and radicalism . The Grand I Dragon said he had no fear of fascism in the United States but that if he had to choose between 1 that and Marxism he would take fascism . The Klan , however , I wanted to preserve the American 1 form of government , he asserted . 1 He took occasion to remark that the unemployment problem of the I country , had been aggravated by the presence of 1,600,000 aliens who ought to be sent back to their homelands . In the speech that Mr. Baskin intended to deliver before a Klan au- I dience at some undisclosed place , 1 he dwelt at some length upon the Red menace to American institu- ! communism and criticized the Nations , attacked the C. I. 0 . and tional Administration for " cringing " before radical elements . He disavowed any direct Klan interest in the current campaign in these words : " We are not concerning ourselves about your local Mayoralty campaign although it might not be amiss for us to do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actively oppose to the best of our ability the foreign elements who are engaged in this campaign merely as a practice manoeuvre looking ahead to the national campaigns of 1938 and 1940.
