txt It is an old saw that the contemporary opinion of foreign nations anticipates the verdict of history . No saying is more in need of definition or qualifications . Alien outsiders often make pitiful blunders in interpreting political movements which only natives ' Can truly understand . As a " modern instance " of thfs , one has only to read the solemn conclusions of the French and Italian press about the significance of the rising vote against prohibition in the American elections last Tuesday . Already vintners in Italy and France see the Eighteenth Amendment repealed , with a great market in the United States " soon opening for their wines . British commentators are less credulous . They visualize merely the beginning of a fight against prohibition which must long be waged before it is successful in the form of repealed or modified legislation . It would be only fair to warn the would-be exporters to our shores of Marsala and Chablis that even if American prohibition were done away with , there might be still barriers to their wares seeking to enter this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years past , Americans have , under the spur of prohibition , leaped forward a long way in the art of distilling their own liquor and fermenting their own wine and beer . By the time prohibition is repealed , we may have developed , under its stimulus , a great new " infant industry " which it will be necessary to protect by prohibitive duties . Can one not easily imagine Senator JOHNSON of California transferring for the moment his zeal for home-grown lemons to the glorious native wines of his State ? Are they to be cheapened or pushed aside by spurious foreign importations ? It is not hard to foresee a powerful movement in favor of American drinks for Americans , with confusion to all interloping foreigners . In another way , what seems the touching simplicity of European expounders of Tuesday 's political reverse for the Republican party is disclosed in their apparent belief that it will lead to a cancellation ? at least a drastic cutting down ? of the war debts owed this country . They do not see that the qugstion in no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly defined party difference in respect to that subject It seems to be thought abroad that the Democrats , if they came into power , would be more lenient or generous than the Republicans have shown themselves . But it should not be forgotten that it was to a Democratic President that the European allies gave their I 0 U 's in wartime , and that the Democratic party has been just as insistent as the other on the policy of demanding payment up to the capacity of the debtor . It is true that the whole matter of trade relations and debt readjustment will have to come up for reconsideration in this country . But the time for it is not yet , and its coming has not been hastened by the results of the Congressional elections this year . The diplomatic agents of foreign Governments now in the United States will be remiss in their duty if they do not make this very plain to their superiors when writing their official reports .                 @ @ @ @
