txt In the civic and welfare work of this community the name ROBERT W. DE FOREST has for years led all the rest . He showed intelligent concern for the happiness and well-being of people in every walk of life . As a young man he became vitally interested in the charity that showed itself not in impulsive , careless giving , but in patiently considerate ' and sympathetic effort to help those in need to help themselves and in the thoroughgoing study of the causes of poverty and misery . " Not alms but a friend " was the motto of the Charity Organization Society which he , at the age of 34 , had a part in organizing . This friendly concern showed itself also in his study of the housing conditions among the poor .

His public activities did not end with that charity which , with him , began at home and extended to the ends of the earth .

PLUTARCH quotes some one as saying that it was the first requisite ' of happiness that one should be born in a famous city . As a boy Mr. DE FOREST , Who was born in this city , a descendant of one of its earliest settlers , used to fly his kite where the Empire State Building now'rises to as great heights doubtless as his kite reached . One of his last public acts was in filial devotion to the future of this city of his birth , whose towers have " transfeatured nature 's wild landscape to the sovereignty of mind . " To its millions , whether born here or elsewhere , he had helped to bring the happiness that a famous city should offer to its inhabitants .                   @ @
