" With these ends in view , he began this afternoon a two-day series of conferences with Lewis W. Douglas , director of the budget . Prior to that meeting , he had General Johnson for a luncheon guest and talked with Secretary Wallace and George N. Peek , newly designated special assistant to the President to stimulate export trade . To supplement his personal studies , the President was reported to have called on department heads and the chiefs of recovery and relief bureaus both for estimates regarding special expenditures in the coming fiscal year , and their views on the business outlook .

Mr. Roosevelt in effect is faced with the task of presenting a double budget to Congress , one for regular expenditures expected to approximate $2,600,000,000 , and another for the continuation of special expenditures segregated as relief appropriations . Rough estimates of this latter group include some $2,000,000,000 for the continuation of projects under the Public Works Administration and the Civil Works Administration and between $500,000,000 and $1,000,000,000 for increased capitalization of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation .

Beef was excluded from the original act at the behest of Western Senators and Representatives , but it is thought here that the Western sentiment has changed , although to what degree is not known . Mr. Peek laid before Mr. Roosevelt tentative plans for developing export trade , particularly in regard to agricultural surpluses , a move considered essential to permanent success of the farm relief program , but declined to describe his plan in advance of Presidential approval . He said he would confer with Mr. Roosevelt later in the week , and added : " I do not anticipate that very much legislation will be required . Most of the information needed is scattered in the various departments . " When asked if his plan involved the possible setting up of a corporation to handle all exports and imports , as recently reported here , Mr. Peek smiled and replied : " Oh , there is no such idea , so far as I know , to handle all exports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of such an establishment .
