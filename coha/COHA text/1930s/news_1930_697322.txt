txt WORK FOR THE LEGION . Efforts to inspire Youth to Aid Country Could Accomplish Much . To the Editor of The New York Times : It is a pleasure to read in the Topic of the Times " A. Memorial to Eielson " that the movement is sponsored by the American Legion in Alaska . As an ordinary citizen , I receive my impressions of the Legion from reading about its activities to influence Congress to appropriate vast sums for its members as a bonus or to the disabled as pensions , or else I meet its local representatives selling poppies to help some poor devil who seems to fare badly in spite of the niggardly billion a year the government is supposed to be spending on its veterans ' welfare . It would be much pleasanter to read about the Legion inspiring our youth and citizens by an example of helping the country rather than helping themselves . Some national commander could go down in history if he could realize the big job the Legion could do . In this country we have thousands of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These money-sensitive children do n't hear about our heroes , their deeds or the qualities and training that were necessary to accomplish them , but they read , see , and hear the same as I. This Alaskan job and the efforts to teach us about our flag seem much more worthy of men who proved their regard for the welfare of our country in time of emergency . The Legion might go further and sponsor oratory and papers among our school children by suitable prizes which would glorify the qualities . men or their deeds which have advanced this country . A simple medal or certificate with varying degrees for school children or any citizen would make it a " legion of honor " respected and beloved by all . It might encourage our writers through annual prizes to write a book , a play or a movie which would glorify the makers of our country and stimulate our own generation to do as they did . CHARLES R. NALLE . Philadelphia , Pa. , July 31 , 1930 . A Damaged Monument . To the Editor or The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circle this evening I was dumfounded to see the vandalism committed on the statuary by the street gamins who use the basin for a swimming pool . One figure has a hand broken off at the wrist . Another has the fingers of one hand broken . A large male figure appears to have lost the small finger of one hand . The damage appears to me to be beyond repair . What was a beautiful monument is now a disgrace to the city . Yet these youngsters were undisturbed up to 8 o'clock tonight , while a crowd looked on . Here is an example of what would happen to Central Park if it were thrown open to playgrounds . A. A. New York , July 30 , 1930 . Trees Need Attention . To the Editor of The New York Times : In the Bronx we have many trees , but nests of caterpillars infest some . In one privately owned place the worms are so thick that they can be discerned at a distance . Trees are such ornaments that one would think the city would take pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park at Fordham station one views with amazement the spectacle of the trees , some probably fifty years old , almost cut in half , leaving not much more than stumps , ugly to look at and useless for shade . FRANCES BOWEN . New York , Aug. 1 , 1930 . ANNOUNCERS MIGHT HELP . They Could Ask Radio Listeners to Cut Down on Volume . To the Editor of The New York Times : It is extremely gratifying to learn that so much is being done by the anti-noise vigilantes to procure peace . I. have to confess that I " snooped " one evening last week on account of a noisy privately owned radio . I. en deavored to locate the offender but could n't , so talked to the owner of the apartment house . He said noth ing could be said to such offenders until 11 P. M. and the idea of report ing noises from radios applied only to shopkeepers . Why private owners of radios are exempt is a question when they cause more disturbance than shopkeepers . If Mr. Brown 's volunteers came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty for their theory . Many of my neighbors are driven to dis traction at times . It is true that in passing one could do much to help the drive . I , for one , would be willing , and it could be done without spending the time of one 's employer . I consider that radio announcers could help a great deal , if they were approached , by asking their listeners to maintain a moderate ? volume of sound . KATHLEEN WARD . Astoria , N. Y. , July 28 , 1930 . Noise We Have Always With Us To the Editor of The New York Times : For nearly three years at intervals I have reported to the Health Department a violation of the municipal code ordaining that noisy machinery in an apartment house be shut off between 11 P. M. and 6 A. M. The preventable nuisance is an automatic pump connected with the water supply in ; the basement of the building that emits a factory whistle when in operation . Complaints always bring a call from an inspector , massive , courteous  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Health Commissioner bring courteous answers , but nothing else . Why should the renting company obey the law if it is inconvenienced by doing so ? Why should city employes waste city time by paying calls that are simply courteous ges-tures ? No wonder that when one suggests to other private and insignificant individuals a formal registering of complaint against law violations they shrug helpless shoulders and say , " What 's the use ? " VICTIM . New York , July 26 , 1930 . No Peace Even on Sunday . To the Editor o ' The New York Times : We are much interested in the article by Health Commissioner Wynne relative to ridding New York City of unnecessary noises . This is Sunday , and we naturally look forward to this day as one of rest and quiet , especially those who can not get out of the city . Today , starting at an early hour , we were awakened by a group of men drilling and tearing up the street . Sleep was no longer possible , and now at noon the same terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the commission that , although it is a herculean task , every effort should be made to rid the city of unnecessary noises , such as drilling , and especially on Sunday . A. J. SMITH . New York , Aug. 3 , 1930 . Noisy Riverside Drive . To the Editor of The New York Times : For many years protests have been made by the residents of Riverside Drive against the unbearable noise caused by the New York Central Railroad . It seems worse this Summer than ever before , as it is without cessation during the day , and with abominable intensity in the night and early hours of the morning . We have been informed , that " Diesel engines will be put in operation in July , " but thus far nothing has been done to lessen this noise . The question arises , If these Diesel engines have been delivered where are they ? LOU LAWRENCE . New York , July 29 , 1930 . THE COST OF EATING . One Marvels That So Much as $13.72 Need Be Spent for Food . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident sincerity of " Constant Reader 's " letter regarding food expense removes it from the realm of incredible and classifies it merely as inexplicable . I , too , was much interested In the recent news that food for a family of four could be purchased for $13.72 weekly , but my interest was because in nearly twenty-three years of supporting a family I have never spent that much to provide abundant , nourishing and attractive sustenance for a family which grew from two to five and is now reduced , by the independence of my two older sons , to three . We have always used quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables , butter , milk , meat and all the recognized components of the ideal diet , and so far as quantity is concerned the tendency has always been to overeat rather than to go hungry . Figures at hand show the following total food expense for my family of three during the first six months of the current year : January , $37.13 ; February . $36.08 ; March , $48.19 ; April , $40.73 ; May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 25 inclusive for a family varying from three to six my total food expense has been $39.31 . The guiding principles in catering for my family have always been , first , the provision of a plentiful , palatable and well-balanced diet ; second , thoughtful planning after , rather than before , the daily offerings of the markets have been considered , and third , the absolute elimination of waste . I have actually paid the following prices in the present month for articles of the very best quality , fresh and in perfect condition : Beans , 5 cents pound ; beets , 5 cents bunch ; carrots , 5 cents bunch ; lettuce , 5 cents head ; peas , 91/2 cents pound ; cantaloupe , 111/2 cents apiece ; milk , 16 cents quart ; prime rib roast , 29 cents pound ; flour , 29 cents ; lima beans , 71/2 cents .
