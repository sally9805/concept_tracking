Two years ago Britain 's Royal Army Ordnance Corps took over 600 acres of waste land , pockmarked with ramshackle buildings and rust-coated rail lines , in the interior of England , converted it into a mammoth garage and storehouse for His Majesty 's mechanized troops at home and overseas . By last week this central depot was sufficiently developed for proud Ordnance officers to show it off to visiting newspapermen . The location of the depot , undoubtedly known to every general staff in Europe , correspondents were obliged to keep secret . They filed their dispatches from " somewhere in the Midlands . " <P> Under huge sheds , one of them spread over eleven acres , some 1,600 army and civilian employes bustle about buying , inspecting , testing , maintaining and repairing the army 's first-line transport and fighting vehicles . Two years ago the army had 4,000 motor vehicles ; today it has some 22.500 , with 6,500 of them stored in the Midlands depot . Two hundred close-mouthed drivers are on the roads day &; night , shuttling new machines from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseas equipment to the docks . While most of the vehicles are modernized grey-green transport trucks , the garage also holds every type of unit needed by an army on wheels ; Diesel-driven lorries to pull heavy guns : powerful breakdown wagons for the recovery and salvage of trucks , tanks and armored cars ; three-ton workshops on wheels ; special trailers for pontoons and box bridges and even a de luxe wagon which spreads out a green canvas into a commodious office for a field headquarters .
