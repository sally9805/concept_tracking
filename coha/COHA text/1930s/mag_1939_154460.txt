When Racketbuster Tom Dewey last week wound up his biggest case , the most interesting item for New Yorkers was not the four-to-eight-year sentence imposed on Tammany Boss Jimmy Hines for selling protection at $30,000 a year to the city 's " numbers " racket. + More significant was a probation report published the same day . In detailing the life &; works of Convict Jimmy Hines , 62 , with data gathered from Hines 's family , friends , neighbors , District Attorney 's office and Hines himself , the report gave ordinary citizens who often damn but seldom understand political bosses , a first-rate picture of how such bosses grow , what makes them tick , how they can go wrong . Hines highlights and shadows : <P> Jimmy Hines 's father was a master horseshoer in Manhattan . To profit by shoeing police and fire horses , he had to be close to the Tammany machine . His shop was a hangout for neighborhood politicians and young Jimmy , who at 14 quit eighth grade to start working in the shop , soon learned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sr. sickened never to recover . Jimmy ran the smithy , by 21 was acting for his father as election district captain . Twice he was arrested for street fighting , once for assaulting a girl whom he took to a hotel and afterwards refused to marry-wild oats for a young man on the upper west side . Tammany took care of its own ; he was n't sent to jail . <P> Mrs. Hines , taciturn and parsimonious , mother of eleven , had small faith in her husband 's and son 's management of money . They gave her all proceeds from the smithy except what they needed for personal expenses . She also had small faith in banks . This , says Jimmy Hines , explains why he had no bank account after 1908 , why he carried large sums of cash . After he married in 1904 his wife bore him three sons and took care of most of his finances . <P> Jimmy Hines always tried to take good care of his family . They were devoted to him and he to them . They lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hines bought a cottage at Long Beach , L. I. , financed with a mortgage taken by a friend of Hines . <P> Meantime he had his ups &; downs . In 1902 , Republican Seth Low became mayor and Jimmy Hines lost the city 's horseshoeing business . For $3,500 he sold a share in the smithy to one Klenke . Hines drew $75 a week for himself and about $4,000 a year out of profits , but after 1907 , when he was elected alderman , politics was his real profession . In 1912 he sold Klenke the rest of the smithy for $7,000 , and with a man named Madden went into the trucking business , fattening on city contracts for snow , garbage , rubbish removal . After a strike by the city 's truckers , they made $10,000 in six weeks . In 1913 , Hines became chief clerk of the board of aldermen at $5,000 . <P> In 1916 , after another Republican reform regime ( Mayor John Purroy Mitchel 's ) came in , Jimmy Hines had to live on savings . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a factory supervisor and trucker for $100 a week and a percentage of profits . He arranged the sale of a 25% interest in Malto-Dextrine to Charles F. Murphy , Tammany 's big boss , for $175,000.
