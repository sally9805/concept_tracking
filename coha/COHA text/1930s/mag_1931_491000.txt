FIRST for a definition : Eleven independent native republics border the Caribbean Sea . Salvador on the Pacific side of Central America , naturally , falls in the same economic and political category . These twelve independent states are what is meant here by " Caribbean . " This excludes Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles , which are British or French ' possessions , and Porto Rico and the Virgin Islands , which are possessions of the United States . The region thus described has been the special field of our so-called capitalistic imperialism . We have , in a manner , taken it under our wing . To many minds , investments and interventions there have become practically synonymous terms , and I have even met quite intelligent people who carry a highly generalized impression that our technic in the Caribbean has consisted principally in forcing a loan at usurious rates on the unhappy natives and then sending a cruiser down to collect the interest . The investments have been endlessly debated from a political angle , but very few debaters have stopped to inquire what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what our actual experience with them has been . That inquiry is the purpose of this article . Investments of citizens of the United States in the Caribbean amount to some 53,000,000,000 . There are various estimates . A compilation recently made in great detail by Max Winkler puts our total stake in the Caribbean at $3,714,000,000 , and in all America south of the Rio Grande at $5,587,000,000 . Also it puts the total of present British investments south of the Rio Grande at $5,889 , - 000,000 ? or somewhat above ours . That should be kept in mind . One should keep in mind also that though the Caribbean has a land area equal to about two-thirds that . of Continental United States , and nearly one-third the population , it is a region of primary industry , with only a trace of finished manufactures . It really subsists on raw or partly processed agricultural and mineral products . About 80 per cent of its exports consist of sugar , coffee , oil , bananas and unfinished metals , mainly silver bullion . That is a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one state . As to eleven out of the twelve , 80 per cent or more of the exports consist of one or , in a few cases , two staples ; and even Mexico 's exports are two-thirds oil and metals . The exported product is the country 's cash crop , on which its economic condition depends . And for an offhand summary , by way of background , this region , up to the present century , was either under Spain or in a state of extreme political instability . Its output of revolutions , taken per capita or per square mile , exceeded that of any other part of the globe . Ordinarily , if the revolution succeeded , the victorious chieftain sought a foreign loan  --  as a matter of course . If the revolution failed , the existing government was sunk further in debt through defending itself . Up to the twentieth century these countries financed themselves mainly in London and Paris , sometimes in Amsterdam or Berlin , but rarely in New York . Some loans were made on terms which show clearly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenders . Bonds were floated as low as twenty cents on the dollar  --  if that could be called floating . But even so , the lenders pretty generally lost . It is well known that up , at least , to the World War , Europe did not take such financial levity on the part of small countries with good nature . Indeed , in respect of small countries , all that Europe was disposed to take good-naturedly was the country itself . As a matter of course , if the Caribbean had been on the other side of the Atlantic , it would long since have been absorbed and parceled out among the powers . A European appetite which , during the nineteenth century , was adequate to nearly all of Africa and quits a bit of Asia would not have boggled at a morsel like the Caribbean . But it was on our side of the Atlantic , and we had a Monroe Doctrine . That doctrine is popularly supposed to consist of a notice to Europe : " Hands Off America ! " But that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorandum on the subject which was published by the State Department about a year ago . The Doctrine only warns Europe not to colonize American territory or overthrow an American government . As President Roosevelt stated it in an official message : " An aggrieved nation can , without interfering with the Monroe Doctrine , take what action it sees fit in the adjustment of its disputes with American states , provided such action does not take the shape of interfering with their form of government or the despoilment of their territory uuder any disguise . " At various times aggrieved European nations did take coercive action against Caribbean states . Within this century , Venezuela had managed to accumulate a string of creditors that included Great Britain , Germany , France , Holland , Italy , Denmark and Spain . In 1903 , England , Germany and Italy jointly blockaded Venezuelan ports , bombarded Puerto Cabello and Fort San Carlos , and forced a settlement . A few years earlier , two German naval vessels steamed into the harbor of Port au Prince , where their commander informed a startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same day it handed over a cash indemnity which his government had assessed , released a German subject who had been arrested , and tendered an apology , he would bombard the government buildings . Haiti yielded and was coldly informed by the United States that the Monroe Doctrine , on which it relied for protection , had nothing to do with the case . Other similar examples since President Monroe penned his famous message might be cited , which was awkward for us . On paper , the distinctions may look simple , but the practical difficulties are obvious . A European power could not overthrow an American government without violating our American policy . But it could blockade the American country 's ports and bombard its public buildings , which would certainly contribute nothing to the government 's stability . One can readily imagine endless complications . One Default After Another If the peace and safety of this nation required , as President Monroe had declared , that European powers should not acquire American territory or overthrow American governments , then it seemed clear that chronic defaults in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was primarily with this idea in mind that the State Department undertook here and there to untangle the relations between defaulting Caribbean debtors and restive European creditors ; the process sometimes involving transference of loans from London or Paris to New York . Santo Domingo is a rase in point . In 1869 , whoever happened to be president at the moment floated a loan of ? 757,000 , in London at 50 to 70 per cent of face value . The loan quickly went into default . In 1888. a loan of ? 770.000 was flouted in London and part of the proceeds used to pay off the loan of 1869 at twenty cents on the dollar . In 1890 , a. loan of . C900.000 was issued at 77 to build a railway . Two years later both loans were in default . But some other loans were floated in London , Paris , Amsterdam and Brussels  --  with otherdefaults . From 1903 to 1905 the United States took a hand in financial rehabilitation ; the upshot . being that $20,000,000 of 5 per cent bonds were sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sixty cents on the dollar for their claims . This arrangement at any rate wiped out a contingent political complication under the Monroe Doctrine . An American agent collected the customs duties and applied them to the service of the debt . In 1922 and again in 1926 , 810,000,000 of 5l/ per cent Dominican bonds were floated in New York at 9914 . In short , the Dominican Republic , under American financial tutelage , was able to borrow in this market on quite as good terms as such powerful and long-stabilized states as France and Italy . Financial Sanitation An important part of our Caribbean investments before the World War came by this way of transferring European loans to New York , or borrowing in New York to pay European creditors . As late as 1913 British investments in the Caribbean were greater than ours , and there were important investments by French , Dutch , German and other European nationals . In this matter of government financing we initiated nothing . The Caribbean countries were in debt before we appeared on the scene ; and we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . After the war that current was reversed , so that , since 1913 , our Caribbean investments have at least trebled , while England 's have increased hardly at all . Since the war this market has been almost the only source of capital for the southern republics , but as to government financing , we only stepped in where Europe left off , and the borrowers , generally speaking , have got much better terms from us than they got before . What we did initiate was financial sanitation . In nine of the twelve states American financial advisers or supervisors , with various official statuses , have introduced order and economy , with the natural result of improved revenues and far better credit . In this century Colombia 's paper money was quoted at one cent on the dollar and her foreign bondholders , largely British , compromised their claims at about forty cents on the dollar . In the last ten years the republic of Colombia , its provinces , cities and instrumentalities of the government like the Mortgage Bank , have floated $180,000,000 of bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accorded the public securities of great European nations . These bonds are now quoted around sixty to seventy cents on the dollar , the depreciation averagingabout one-third , so on the face of the returns at this writing the only person who has been exploited , imperialized and trampled into the ground under an iron heel is just the American investor . Under American supervision Haiti has been steadily paying off its public debt and is in excellent financial condition  --  for the first time in its troubled existence  --  with the result that its per cent bonds sell at 95 or better on the Now York Stock Exchange , even in the present disturbed condition of foreign securities . Honduras , small , but active in the financial line , floated guaranteed railroad bonds in London and defaulted on them until British bondholders were able to figure up a claim which , with more than half a century of arrears of interest , totaled ? 29,114,775 . After long negotiations under our supervision , this claim was settled for ? 452,000 , and Honduras floated new 7 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be cited . In this realm of public financing there is also the impressive case of Mexico . In 1908 , that country , long orderly and solvent under Diaz , undertook an ambitious scheme of railroad consolidation and improvement , to be financed in New York . By special act of the Mexican Congress a company called The National Railways of Mexico was incorporated to take over , extend and improve existing lines . The Mexican Government owned the 875 , - 000,000 of common stock and guaranteed the bonds , of which , together with preferred stocks , 8335,000,000 in round numbers were listed on the New York Stock Exchange . At the end of 1909 the railways ' prior lien OA per cent bonds were quoted at 94 and the general lien 4 's at 87 At the same time the Mexican Government 's 5 per cent bonds were quoted at 9794 and its per cents at 93 . These figures , of course , denote high credit , and there is no doubt that Mexico , with its great natural resources and generally industrious population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had remained stable . Our Investment in Mexico But it presently lapsed into revolution  --  Madero , Carranza , Huerta , Villa  --  with the natural result that by the end of 1914 all bonds , government and railroad , were in default . They have been in default nearly all the time since then , and for a good while there has been little market for them . The latest nominal quotations range from 13 to 19 for the government bond , and from 12 to 18 for the railways . Three times a committee of bondholders , working with the Mexican Government , has arranged a settlement . The first two schemes promptly petered out , and the third is still pending . By its terms , bondholders will forgo all arrears of interest , now amounting to more than two-thirds of the principal , and accept now paper bearing 2IA per cent interest for the first year and gradually working up to 5 pee cent . The new paper , of course , will be no better than the old unless the country enjoys political stability . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around 8300,000,000 of the railroad securities . A conscientious auditor would no doubt write off two-thirds of the investment at this time . Again , the person who has , in fact , been ground under an iron heel is nobody but the American investor . Now , there is a quite general , albeit hazy , notion that because the Government of the United States has a very special interest in the Caribbean , it somehow stands behind investments in that region , and if you ca n't collect otherwise , Uncle Sam will finally do it for you . I know that some Caribbean bonds have been bought on that comforting assumption ; probably a great many have been so bought . Of course , this Government has never assumed any such obligation . In fact , this Government guarantees nothing whatever unless it specifically says so over its own signature . The Monroe Doctrine and our special interest in the Caribbean have been functioning these last sixteen years , but Mexican bondholders have been whistling for their interest , and may continue to whistle . Washington will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a settlement , but there is a painful difference between good offices and money in the bank , Our great investment in Caribbean public bonds shows , at this writing , very heavy loss , but much the larger part of our postwar investment down there has been private  --  in industries rather than in public bonds . In that field we have initiated and pioneered . In turning down a large business proposition canny Andrew Carnegie wrote , " Pioneering do n't pay . " History , whatever it thinks of his grammar , approves his judgment . By and large , in bard cash , it doesn't. pay . The British have done as much financial pioneering as anybody , and one result of their experience is an axiom among London brokers that the time to buy into a new enterprise is after the third reorganization . But as long as there are restless , energetic men , there will be no lack of pioneers . From the Indian trader onward they have been capitalistic imperialists as far as they were able to be  --  that is. they hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new land . But they were often disappointed . It is the zeal for adventure that keeps the pioneer going much more than it . is realized cash profits . Our Caribbean private investments have been largely pioneering . The Sugar Slump Decidedly the biggest item is sugar . Various estimates ' put the total from 8600,000,000 up to $800,000,000 . Perhaps the real sum is halfway between . Americans in Cuba did not so much buy an existing sugar industry as make a new one , pioneering by felling virgin forests in the central provinces , bringing new land under the plow , building new mills , railroads and docks . The deplorable state of the cane-sugar industry the last three years is well known . For two years Cuban sugar has sold most of the time under the cost of production . In 1916 the largest American-owned Cuban sugar company listed 8.50,000,000 of 7 per cent preferred stock in New York , which sold at par . This year it was quoted at 2 . The bonds and debentures of other Ameriean-ownedCaribbean sugar companies that are quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the share capital , of course , is in a still more depressed state . Whatever our total sugar investment is , a competent auditor would probably write off two-thirds of it on the basis of present conditions and immediate outlook . Again the trampled person has been the American investor . Depressed sugar has depressed other things . Some Cuban railroad and public-utility bonds are low . If these investments are imperialism , one shou Id follow the story through and show where the imperialists are getting off . Oil is probably the next largest item . Like sugar , it was mainly pioneering . The petroleum resources of Mexico and Venezuela were largely developed by American initiative , but in both countries the British have a very important hand . No doubt , this oil investment , on the whole , has been profitable in the same way and to the same extent that proved oil fields have been profitable everywhere . As to Mexico , however , production fell from almost . 200,000,000 barrels in 1921 to about one-quarter of that in 1928 , which can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are believed to 1140. ' 0 $400,000,000 or so invested in mining and smelting , mainly in Mexico , where the chief products are silver , copper , lead and zinc . Like oil , this was largely developed by American initiative and it has been profitable to about the same extent as similar developments at home . Iu both oil and mining , American capital has reaped quite as large , or larger , returns elsewhere . The Caribbean has offered no inducenieuts that distinguish it from other fields for like investments . Teaching Us to Eat Bananas Also , we have a large banana investment , which is typical of various other American pioneerings in the Caribbean . In the 70 's Minor C. Keith , one-time salesman in a Broadway haberdashery at three dollars a week , went to Costa Rica . At that time bananas were but little esteemed in the American tropics or subtropics , and hardly known in the United States . By the early 80 's Keith was trying to build a railroad , and in that connection cleared a jungle and planted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a much more hazardous undertaking then than it is now . Three of Keith 's brothers , all under thirty , died of fever . But Keith made the first important shipment of bananas to New Orleans , and from his plantation the industry spread . Andrew W. Preston , of Boston , became impressed with the commercial opportunities of banana culture and formed a company to carry it on . In time , his company and Keith 's and some others combined in the United Fruit Company . Now bananas constitute more than three-quarters of the total exports of Honduras and are a mainstay of that country 's finances . In Guatemala , bananas are second only to coffee , and in Costa Rica they bulk large in foreign-trade returns . Elsewhere they are an important product . But , yes , they had no bananas until the Yankees name , and probably would have none now but for American initiative . I have looked over a long list of Caribbean investments . In oil . ruining and bananas it is not possible to segregate the Caribbean investment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every case where such an investment can be fairly segregated and stood on its own bottom , it is worth less in the market today than the investor paid for it ; and two of the very biggest items , aggregating at least $1,000,000 , - 000 ? sugar and Mexican Government and railroad bonds  --  show an enormous presentloss . These two especially de.pre-ciated items make up nearly one-third of the total . On the basis of present conditions we are entitled to say confidently of Caribbean investments in the lump that they have not been profitable . Two special hazards that can not be overlooked have been sharply illustrated of late just to the south of the particular field of this article . I have here a list of bonds of the United States of Brazil and of Brazilian states and cities that have been floated in New York in the last nine years . It foots up , in round numbers , e380,000,000 . The 6 per cent bond of the central government recently sold down to 48 , and at this writing is about 70 . Bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent sold at 48 . The whole list at present would show a depreciation of one-quarter to one-third . Coffee , of course , is Brazil 's great staple , and the efforts of the government . to valorize that commodity have extended over many years . But of late years there has been too much coffee . That is the economic hazard in a one-crop country of primary production ; and the Caribbean , as mentioned above , is predominantly a one-crop country of primary production . In addition , there was the revolution in Brazil  --  mostly a result of depressed economic conditions  --  and that at once caused a devastating slump in its bonds . To be sure , so far as information has yet reached the United States , the revolution caused but little property destruction and did not disorganize the economic system . Perhaps , as its adherents assert , it was really a constructive measure . But construction by revolution must always be a costly and very uncertain proceeding . The state of the Brazilian bond market shows how dubious investors are about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the background of all Caribbean investments . No doubt if the revolution had occurred in a Caribbean country we might have intervened , as we have already done at various times and places , and our intervention would assure a minimum of disorder . But the cost of those interventions must be charged to the Caribbean account , and the heaviest cost is not financial but political . They provoke criticism and resentment at home and still sharper criticism and resentment in Latin America . There is no doubt that a great majority of citizens of this country heartily dislike them . A Result of the Monroe Doctrine But it must not be forgotten that Europe got into the Caribbean extensively more than a century before it got into Massachusetts and Virginiaa . We took over a condition already heavily Europeanized . It is a problem that we were born to , inherent in our situation from the beginning . We never had the option of just letting the Caribbean alone , as wo have that option in respect of more remote regions . Our first important move there  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense , deemed necessary then and ever since , yet it amounted to an intervention in the Caribbean in respect of European nations . To paraphrase another President , interventions have been a condition , not a theory . But they are a liability , reenforeing the conclusion that the Caribbean undertaking has not been profitable . Someone may say there is a large credit on the other side of the ledger in improved living for many millions of people through sanitation , good roads , hospitals , more settled and orderly conditions , so that a humble , industrious man is surer of the fruits of his labor ; in short. , that we have been bearing the white man 's burden . But that is a feat which only the white man applauds . It is notorious that backward people seldom want to be improved in our manner , or show any gratitude For the favor . They are apt to retort that if we are bent on improving people we can find plenty of opportunities at home . Since Kipling penned his THE SATURDAY EVENING POST famous line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign ideas on people who do not care for them . President Grant negotiated a treaty for the annexation of Santo Domingo , which the Senate rejected . Every administration , of this century , Republican or Democratic , has intervened in sonic shape or other in the Caribbean . A treaty with Nicaragua , specifically putting that country under the tutelage and protection of the United States , was negotiated by no other Secretary of State than William Jennings Bryan , who can hardly be charged with imperialism . The Senate rejected it . as it had rejected Grant 's treaty ; thereby reflecting the country 's steadfast reluctance to mix in Caribbean internal affairs . Yet , perforce , we have mixed . Whoever wants a hard , fast , immutable and impeccable principle to govern our relations with the Caribbean will have to invent one . Nobody has been able to do it so far , for situations arise in which there are grave objections to every possible course of action , and intervention seems simply the choice of the lesser evil . Some two-score interventions of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , if you count every time we have stuck a finger into the Caribbean pie , although sometimes we did it only on explicit Caribbean invitation . Those that involve the use of armed force in any degree are irritating to Latin America in general , and irritating at home . They are a nuisance . .. /7 Man 's Life and His Properly It is often urged that we may intervene to protect life , but not investments . Few Americans relish the use of the American Navy as a debt-collecting agency . If we make bad investments at home , as frequently happens , no cruisers and Marines rush to our assistance . Caribbean investors voluntarily assumed the risk of going into a region with a bad financial and political record . If the investment turns sour through civic disturbances , why should Marines be pulling them out of a mess that they walked into open-eyed ? That is a popular argument , but the case is seldom as simple as the argument implies . Citizens and investments of European nations are found all through the Caribbean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the protection of both lives and property  --  in small countries . They would undoubtedly assert that right in the Caribbean if we hung back . In academic discussion it is easy to put the man in one box and the dollar in another , but in nine practical eases out of ten they are inseparable Siamese twins and it is impossible to protect the one without protecting the other . In an acute ease the Marines restore order and preserve it , but they can not keep order on the east side of the street , where lives are threatened , and not on the west side , where only property is in danger . Usually , in fact , the mere presence of the Marines at once restores order over the considerable area that is within their military reach , protecting lives and property alike . It is often urged , too , that we should intervene with force only in cooperation with other American nations , such as Argentina , Brazil and Chile , all of which have had revolutions of their own in 1930 , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often develop rapidly . If you are to say that the fire department must not . move until the town council has debated the matter and passed a proper resolution , the usefulness of the department will be limited to purposes of parade and the annual firemen 's hall . Probably this Government. , whatever party is in power , will go on substantially as in the past thirty years , dealing with each situation as it comes up , really trying to do the most good with the least harm . Where intervention seems the lesser of two evils , the country will accept it as a disagreeable necessity . But that liability constitutes a debit to the Caribbean account . Of course , the first motive was our own peace and safety , for which we must expect to pay . Except as it may have promoted that end , we have gained nothing on net balance , but have lost by taking over Europe 's role of exporter of capital to the region . Buying Foreign Bonds I may be reminded that Caribbean investments bring indirect gains through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trade has been industriously worked , and overworked , in connection with the floating of all foreign bonds in this market . The theory was never valid anywhere in such a conclusive way as the marketers of foreign bonds have assumed . The direct and necessary connection between a country 's foreign investments and foreign trade is limited . Generally speaking , the country with the best goods at the best prices will get the trade , irrespective of who makes the loans . For many years we have bought two-thirds to three-quarters of the chief exports of the Caribbean . We are by far the best market for their sugar , coffee , oil , bananas and metals . So long as we have suitable goods to offer in exchange at suitable prices , we would get the larger share of their trade , irrespective of investments . Of course , there has been some increase in trade through investments . When we put in a sugar central , a smelter or an oil refinery , the machinery came from the United States and was paid for with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by more than $2,000,000,000 ; perhaps by as much as $2,500,000,000 . Our exports to the region have increased by about 10 per cent of the latter sum . Nearly a quarter of our total foreign investments are in the Caribbean , but that region takes only 10 per cent of our exports . British investments in Argentina are more than three times as great as ours , but our exports to Argentina are almost the same as Great Britain 's . London cables the other day reported keen disappointment because a new trade convention , from which British exporters expected substantial gains , had been dished by the Argentine revolution . British investments in Brazil are more than twice as great as ours , but our exports to that country are rather larger than Britain 's . In fine , coupling investments with trade , as though there were some direct and exact relation between them , leads only to confusion , especially to confusion for the bond buyer . He is very seldom the same personas the exporter . If , in a given case , there should happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan and the export of goods , whatever profit arose from the latter operation would get around to the bond buyer  --  if at all  --  only in such diffused , uncertain form that he could not take it into account in judging the investment . It has often been suggested that some patriotic virtue attaches to the purchase of foreign bonds , because it promotes the prosperity of the country through increased trade . But that is largely bond sellers ' hokum . The purchase of a. sound domestic bond usually is a direct contribution to the prosperity of the country , because the bond buyer 's money is directly and immediately used in the employment of American labor and the purchase of American materials  --  for laying new rails , the building of a new power station , a new school , or for whatever purpose the bond may be issued . The money not only directly buys American labor and material but it immediately improves the American industrial or social plant . When the money goes into a foreign bond , its reaction upon the demand for American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an individual and as a citizen the bond buyer 's first duty is to see that the foreign or domestic investment is sound on its own merits . Unless he judges the bond solely on its own merits  --  with all the marble-hearted detachment of a village skintlnt judging a mortgage  --  he is quite apt to do his country disservice by dissipating some of its capital in a wasteful investment . Few things in the financial line are less serviceable to the country than buying had foreign bonds . High Rates But Higher Risks Making foreign loans since the World War has been useful to this country and to foreign countries , in certain cases . In some cases it has been really useful to nobody but the banker who got the commission . We rather abruptly stepped into Europe 's shoes  --  especially England 's  --  as the great exporter of capital , and we accepted a theory of capital exportation , notably English , without sufficient examination of its validity . The machinery for it was all , there , ready-made . The arguments for it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks and n high rate of interest to the bond buyers . We did not carefully consider whether an important part of the exported capital might not , in fact , have been employed at home with greater profit to the country and more satisfaction to the individual investor . It seems to some observers that England , still a large exporter of capital and the most chronic sufferer from unemployment , has never sufficiently examined that question . When the account is all written up we will probably find that less enthusiasm and more discrimination would have been profitable . In the past twelvemonth stock speculators have received a fair share of attention , but there are many bond speculators , too  --  conservative persons who would buy nothing on a margin , but find fascination in a conjunction of the terms " bond " and " 7 per cent , " especially if it is offered at about 97 Of course , the great lure of Caribbean and all other foreign investments has been the comparatively high rate of return . A comparatively high rate of return is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a very long list of foreign bonds indicate that the original rats was not high enough to compensate for the risk . Some bond buyers have persuaded themselves that , although the interest rate indicated risk , certain kinds of bonds were bound to be good . For example , that Caribbean bonds were bound to be good because Uncle Sam stood behind them ; or the bonds of the new succession states in Europe were good because other powers would support the government there ; or domestic , municipal bonds were good because the Supremo Court would protect them . But no kind of bond is bound to be good , Especially is no bond bound to be good for any such merely assumed or implied reason as stated above . Government bonds , state bonds , municipal bonds and bonds in every possible category have turned out bad . Nothing is bound to be good , and in a wide , free market the rate of return accurately reflects the most expert opinion of the risk that attaches to a given issue . Allowance , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , but as a rough-and-ready formula , 4 per cent and 6 per cent on the same day reflect expert opinion that the latter is so much riskier than the former . Certainly any bond buyer is entitled to back his own judgment and assume the larger risk , but he should not delude himself that the risk is not there .
