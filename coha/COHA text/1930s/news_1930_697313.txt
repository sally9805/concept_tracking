txt Mr. ALEXANDER LEGGE , chairman of the Federal Farm Board , has been talking again with his characteristic frankness . He bangs away at Chambers of Commerce , the Democratic National Committee and the whole tribe of politicians . It is true that " the farmer 's problem is an " economic one that will never be " solved by any political remedies . " Yet the creation of the Farm Board was itself a political remedy , the least objectionable of the three , chief ones proposed . The political parties fell over one another in their zeal to " do something for the farmer . " By a false analogy his industry was to be put on an equality with protected industries . A certain Czechoslovak manufacturer of women 's shoes makes them too cheaply for his competitors in Massachusetts . So shoes are taken off the free list . This may comfort distressed makers of women 's shoes in Massachusetts ; but suppose that in a dozen States the making of women 's shoes were the chief industry . What would happen to prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much wheat , but so are their brethren in Canada , Europe and Argentina . Surpluses and carry-overs ' pile up . In a universal depression foreign buying power is slight . What kind of protection , what kind of equality , can the American farmer get by legislation and its administrative agencies ? Mr. LEGGE is confident that a voluntary reduction of acreage will ultimately end the piling-up of surpluses . Hitherto Nature has been the unfeeling and resistless regulator of prices . The prosperity of the American farmer has depended in large part upon the adversity of other followers of the occupation at home or abroad . Mr. LEGGE hopes to add an artificial regulation to enable the farmers , by cooperative organization under the agricultural marketing act , to control production and marketing . This is an experiment to which at least the farmers of Minnesota , the Dakotas and Montana  --  of Oklahoma , also , according to Mr. LEGGE  --  are willing to give the time " for a trial , without prejudice . If Kansas howls to the reverberate heavens , that is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy any more wheat or cotton . These essays in valorization are merely local applications , impotent In the case of a world-disease . He has a hard job . Irrespective of questions of tact and taste and expediency , he may be forgiven for using hard language . Since the Farm Board , while properly " not in politics , " is the creation of politics ; since farmers as voters are inexpressibly dear to all parties , he ought to be less sensitive to political attacks and " bunk . " If he is no politician , he is Mr. HOOVER 'S appointee . Inevitably , it is part of the business of the Democratic National Committee and of the pleasure of many anti-Hoover Republicans to damn everything that Mr. HOOVER 'S Farm Board does or declines to do . Like Mr. HOOVER , the Farm Board has played in hard luck . " There may be a reduction of that and of the wheat crop . Surely a non-politician like Mr. LEGGE can afford to be as cheerful as a politician like Senator COPELAND.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
