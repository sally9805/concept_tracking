Winthrop Aldrich Rockefeller , fourth of John Davison Rockefeller Jr . ' s five sons , is always going somewhere , usually in a hurry . Vacationing from Yale in 1933 , he worked for the Rockefellers ' Humble Oil and Refining Co. in Texas until a kidnap scare caused him to scuttle for Manhattan in an airplane with a bodyguard . That autumn a Connecticut motorcycle police-man caught him doing 64 m.p.h. on the Boston Post Road . He said he was trying to get a friend to a boat , was fined $27 . Early in 1934 , because his marks were poor , young Winthrop left Yale , set out to be the first Rockefeller since his grandfather to go into the oil business for a career. * First stop was in Jennings , La. , where he boarded at Mrs. Inez Daugherty 's Ardennes Hotel , labored with a " roughneck " gang in Humble 's Roanoke field . From Louisiana he went to Texas again , did all manner of tasks , became a deputy sheriff so he could carry a gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Houston , Winthrop Rockefeller , now 24 , said he had finished his Humble apprenticeship of nearly three years , was ready for new work , probably in California . Said he : " I got a certain satisfaction out of physical labor , but my aspirations are slightly higher . It does not look like efficiency to have a man of my height 6 ft. 3 in. wielding a short-handled shovel . " At home and abroad , young Mr. Rockefeller 's business last week displayed these proofs of prosperity : U. S. oil production set a new all-time high with an average daily flow of 3,184 , - 650 bbl . Just short of one year ago Tide Water Associated Oil Co. " spudded in " a well in California 's Ventura Avenue field six miles from the sea . It was named McGon-ig ! No. 12 after the owners of the land .
