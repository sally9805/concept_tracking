txt  | they feel is better than any of the solutions previously entertained have had a thrill which makes mere compromise an unsatisfactory thing and victory over another person in argument a mere illusion . This achievement of integration is indeed " unity in common action . " The different stages of agreement go through a series like this : 1 . An authority commands ; The group obeys ; The result is acquiescence. 2 . The leader or teacher tells ; The group or student accepts ; The result is assent . In both these situations , the person of higher status secures the compliance of those of lower status . How much the result is based on status and how much on reason or emotional adherence are not always determinable . When a revered teacher or beloved parent tells , the student or child generally assents gladly . When a mean little sergeant gives an order , it may well be that the soldier hates even while he is obeying . 3 . Equals debate And give a little here , a little there ; Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody . 4 . Participants develop facts and opinions ; They agree to this and that ; They wrap up their agreement in general terms ; The result is consent and a good deal of satisfaction . 5 . Participants also explore possibilities ; And invent solutions ; The result is integration or creation ; and everybody is pleased ? " This is better than I dared hope for . " To achieve this integration , the different needs must be identified and analyzed , then synthesized . In every situation there are : 1 . Human factors . 2 . Technical factors .  | 3 . Principles , policies and objectives . 4 . Time factors . The work of a committee or working party set up to solve a problem through fact finding and discussion usually follows these stages : 1 . Determine objective , method ( at least approximately ) , and the time factor . 2 . Survey needed facts : laws , regulations , policies , contracts , and pertinent data regarding the situation , such as important attitudes and power to be considered , firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experts or those with specific experience of different factors may be needed . 3 . Finding possibilities for solution . 4 . Arranging facts in the light of possibilities ? this usually requires some new facts , and often requires an expert . 5 . Weighing alternatives and selecting the best alternative , which usually has characteristics of some of the other solutions offered . 6 . When the tentative agreement is reached , checking the solution against the needs , facts , and attitudes of those who must approve , carry out , or otherwise be affected . 7 . Making the program for action or recommendation , including time factor and mode of operation or presentation and communication . It is not enough for a group to arrive at a conclusion it thinks is good without also checking how it would work out . Sometimes a group is much surprised when higher management rejects its recommendations . Often the manner of presenting a conclusion has much to do with its acceptance ; for instance , the group may have uncovered facts which the manager would not have available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the conclusion . Moreover , great care should be taken to think through the consequences of action and obstacles to action . Management 's known or previously expressed views may well be one of these obstacles . Many ideas are born in committee which can not compete in real life . The wise committee does not give those ideas artificial feeding but looks for a huskier baby that can survive under existing conditions . Common difficulties encountered in holding meetings are outlined below . 1 . Proper limits are not set to the scope of the committee . The chairman should know why the committee is serving and its exact scope .  | 2 . The problem or issue is not stated clearly at the outset . The chairman should see that this is done . 3 . The people who could best contribute are not present . 4 . Members are not qualified in knowledge or experience to discuss the matter . 5 . People are not prepared on the topic . Relevant information should be gathered together ahead of time , and frequently an outline should be prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of importance . 6 . Some members are indifferent . This is often because of the faulty way the committee is functioning . 7 . Some people have fixed ideas or emotional sets . 8 . People jump to conclusions before the facts are stated . 9 . There is irrelevant discussion , which must be curtailed tactfully . 10 . Some do not get a chance to talk . Either the chairman or others have been dominating . 11 . The self-centered chairman is more interested in his own ideas than in those of the committee . He should seek the participation of all who have something to contribute . 12 . The chairman presents his own views too soon . 13 . The chairman does not always properly phrase thought-provoking questions with which to stimulate the group into active participation . He should study ways on how to lead a discussion . 14 . Politics or ulterior motives affect the committee process . When one person is in a position to have ideas for the committee to work on , he should prepare them very carefully in advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee but with the distinct understanding that the committee is to amend and improve and not simply to accept them . It is usually well to prepare written agenda of the subject , presenting the suggested treatment in outline and giving the basic facts . Preferably , the agenda should be sent out ahead of the meeting so that they may be thought over . Otherwise the meeting should begin with a careful summary or agenda which can be quickly read . Sometimes a committee is called together to pass on a plan already thought out and ready to be put into effect . The purpose of the meeting is fundamentally educational , and less discussion is needed . The object is then to sell the idea and incidentally to gather up points for improvement or objections which should be met . Even here , a discussional tone is better than the use of steam-roller methods . If the will of the planner is to go into effect unchanged , a mere announcement is sufficient .  | An informational discussion may be appropriate in order to present a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except when making announcements , the man who goes through the form of presenting his ideas when no changes will be made is ordinarily wasting the time of the committee . Getting ideas through without change usually indicates either that the committee is incompetent or indifferent . It therefore approves as the simplest way to dispose of the matter . Sometimes the functions of a working and an educational committee can be combined effectively by appointing the worst offenders on a committee to improve a situation . In a company which was experiencing difficulty in having correspondence answered promptly , those with the worst records were given the job of finding out how improvements might be made . A large committee is not the proper place in which to decide on details of a program ; they should be entrusted to a small committee or to an individual . The value of a large committee is to bring together all those to be consulted on matters of policy . It can formulate policies and bring out differing points of view . When the differences are definitely brought into the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas which make a bridge between the contrasting ideas . With skill he can usually show that ideas are not so opposed as they appear on the surface . Integration and not compromise should be the solution . Compromise generally satisfies no one , since each leaves feeling that he has given up a valuable part of his own ideas . A committee under proper guidance can usually arrive at a result which individual members feel is better than the ideas with which they themselves started on the subject , because it is richer and represents more diverse experience .  | Even in a small company these days an office supervisor finds that he has a number of associates . In a large company or government bureau , they are numerous indeed . How we behave with our associates is particularly important in a business organization . We do not report to them and they do not report to us . One of us does not tell the other what to do . We associate together freely , without much regard to relative rank . You may call your superior " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but you address your associate as " Bill , " " Nancy , " or " Paul . " You do not command your associates , and you do not say , " Yes , sir , " to them , either . You listen but you do not pay attention unless you wish . You persuade if you can . Otherwise they will not do what you think they should . Thus the things which work among equals ? those who do not have to listen to us and who certainly do not have to do what we ask ? are likely to be good for us to remember when we want to persuade Mr. or Mrs. Big or Mr. Little .  | The supervisor 's most difficult period is apt to be the time he first assumes his new duties . He is no longer a worker among the workers but is now responsible for the work of his group and for relationships to others . How can he outgrow the feelings , habits , customs , attitudes , and behavior of a worker and become a supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in many ways . A primary task for a supervisor is to be accepted by his fellows . Yet he is usually removed by space and the flow of work from most of them . He meets them , however , in the course of work , when attending staff meetings , conferences , and social functions , and while serving on committees . With them he has many common interests and problems . When he first becomes known as a new supervisor , his new associates are likely to want to become better acquainted with him . Usually they are glad to explain present relationships and give him background from the past . It is therefore a good idea for him to ask questions , thus gaining a first-hand knowledge of how his job fits into the scheme of things , and how his colleagues see their jobs in relation to his . Advice and counsel may be had where information is needed in interpreting procedures , rules , cases , and in answering inquiries . Informal chats at lunch or coffee breaks develop friendly relations . He who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showing an interest in other people 's work and seeking information and sharing it are good ways to indicate concern for the other person , too . These informal and personal interests gradually build assurance and acceptance as part of the management team . Through them a supervisor learns as he goes along the codes , ethics , standards , and customs of management . A supervisor gains intimate knowledge of underlying management policies in an organization through working closely with his associates . For example , how late is late on a deadline ? What is acceptable work ? Who should review or see certain types of papers ? What are acceptable as social obligations , customs , and ethical conduct ? Answers to these questions in a company office can only be found through personal experience in its diverse activities . These unwritten management policies of an organization are threads that create a pattern of conduct expected of all persons who belong . One 's associates ' experiences , counsel , advice , and suggestions will help to avoid the pitfalls and dangers which are obscure in interpreting company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper insight into his job through reflection upon the experience of others . He  | strengthens his powers with people by voluntary cooperation and active participation in the life of the organization . An intimate personal conversation with an associate may give an understanding not provided by hours of reading files or studying reports to answer a question or solve a problem . " Personal compatibility " with all associates becomes a strong bond to unite the organization . Being accepted by fellow supervisors as an equal gives him status in dealing with subordinates and superiors . Out of the many formal and informal relations people have in working together the organization structure grows . A supervisor must understand thoroughly this social framework surrounding him if he is to give purpose and meaning to his work . He gains by comparing his ideas with those of people not directly related to his field . A host of new experts and specialists have been created through specialization . Some of these are officers or important staff people who carry responsibility for thinking out problems or furnishing technical advice . The wise supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within his department and in other parts of the company . He consults the legal department on matters affected by the law , the personnel department on personnel matters , and the planning department about new office systems and machines . The personnel and planning men in most organizations are staff people who assist the line supervisors by giving suggestions and advice rather than by issuing orders . The large development of the personnel function in recent years has increased the amount of background available to the supervisor , but has not taken away his responsibility for dealing with the employees who report to him . Within many operating departments , also , the role of the specialist is growing . The man who knows the intricacies of the law , or of lay underwriting , or of accounting , or of a score of other specialties is often as well paid as the supervisor to whom he reports . The specific role of the supervisor is to deal effectively with people and to see that the work goes through smoothly and well . Often he knows less about a specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible nevertheless for seeing that the contribution of the specialist is properly geared to the rest of the work of his unit . Specialization steps up the necessity for management and supervision to see that all the specialized activities are synchronized into smooth operations . Specialization of knowledge and of function has  | vastly increased in the last generation or two and will almost certainly be extended further . Each increase in specialization , however , increases the necessity for direction of the work , and more especially for its coordination . The greater the subdivision of functions , the more attention is needed to see that the functions are properly integrated and controlled . Coordination is a continuing problem . The supervisor thus finds himself in a situation where he cooperates with the specialists working under him or with him , from the highly paid experts to the specialized filing clerk ; with technical sections outside his department that send him advice and that must be consulted ; and with supervisors of other departments who handle part of the processes on which his own department works . These crossrelationships with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation of the supervisor . He will supervise his own work best if he continually reaches out toward related work in an effort to understand it and if he is always ready to subordinate the needs of his own work to the common good of interrelated processes and of the company as a whole . One advantage to the supervisor of the increasing complexity of business is that he is no longer valued primarily according to the number of persons in his charge , but far more on the effectiveness with which he can deal with others , whether they are in his own unit or elsewhere in the organization . The emphasis has changed from " bossing " to cooperation . The modern office with its departments and specialists has brought new complications . Records , cases , and papers flow from desk to desk and from department to department . A transaction involving several departments may end in conflicts unless there is good feeling and mutual regard among the supervisors . A supervisor should often ask himself , " How does our work affect others ? What is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who should be advised of changes or stoppages , work scheduling troubles , and problems of standards ? " Timing operations so that they mesh together is an art . It can only succeed where information flows freely , with communication avenues open . Putting changes into effect requires careful thought and consultation . Difficulties between departments often arise either from differences of Personality or from lack of coordination . Personality complications be- tween colleagues must be dealt with just as those with other persons . Although many of the interdepartmental relations will be decided upon by the higher management , direct cooperation by the supervisors concerned will often strengthen the organization and help both departments . Usually it is desirable to have a definite understanding of the scope of each department , but it is also exceedingly important to develop the cooperative spirit . Rules and agreements should act as guides to action . Whenever the letter of the rule seems to go against its spirit or to hamper effective operation , either the case should be treated as an exception or the rule should be modified . Frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims or desires , or a lack of understanding of one another 's requirements . Departments may work at cross purposes if each needs the same records at approximately the same time . Again , cases very important to the work of one department may be delayed elsewhere when their handling is only incidental to more important tasks . A definite schedule of the flow of work between the departments concerned should be worked out . Sometimes the supervisor should go to his colleague and present his problem , asking for aid in reaching a solution for the common good of the organization . He should give his colleague time to consider the problem ? to incubate it ? and should be prepared to talk things over with him later . He should respect his colleague 's right to have an opinion and should want him to contribute a solution satisfactory to them both . Sometimes in clerical work certain unusual cases must be referred to another department before final action can be taken . Often these cases are not important to the second department and are held up unduly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type , do not indicate your judgment of what another man is doing by complaining of " lack of cooperation " or " poor service . " Get the facts . Suppose the operation takes only a small amount of working time , but an actual record shows that the last ten cases were returned as follows : two on the same day or with one day 's delay ; three with two days ' delay ; three with three days ' delay ; and two with five days ' delay . If you go to the other supervisor with these data , you do not approach him as an opponent who accuses him of something wrong ; you have certain facts , which are obviously not satisfactory , and by a little tact you can indicate that you are both working together against the unsatisfactory condition . Is your department sending the material to him at the wrong time or in an inconvenient form ? Can your department do anything to speed up the completion of the work ?  | In a certain life insurance company special commission adjustments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one which passed upon the application and wrote the policies . The issue department tried to give prompt service . However , the other department frequently would not decide upon the commission adjustments for several days . The issue department hit upon the plan of holding the cases one day for the other department and then issuing them , with a letter stating that they would write about the commission as soon as they heard from the other department . This speeded up action materially , as the other department did not wish to appear at fault . Such a plan might often be useful , especially when the two supervisors agree upon a fair time to allow . Much unessential work is performed because one unit does not know the needs of another . Often a little time spent in checking with others on the use of information in a report will eliminate some items and add some of greater usefulness . Duplication is often caused by one supervisor not knowing what happens to his output . Often it is not enough to consider changes by thinking only of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow a regular system of discussing changes with others and using a systematic way of checking and clearing changes before they are put into effect . It is a great help to try out your new ideas on associates . In fact , you should always talk things over with them before making a decision which will involve them . Teamwork depends upon acting as if you were in the other fellow 's place . How you consult him will have much to do with the cooperation you receive . When points of controversy arise , keep the matter of determining the facts and deciding a proposal as objective and impersonal as possible . Find out further whether you and the other person are really discussing the same thing . A definition of terms often shortens a dispute . The truth or the best way , and not a personal victory , should be sought ; admit you are wrong if you find out you are , and do n't give a long explanation unless it is required . Deal with the other disputant always on a basis of courtesy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel compelled to tell him that his views are foolish ; do not insinuate against his motives , but speak and act as though he also is guided by a wish for what is best . Different persons , looking at the same situation often see it quite differently ? a fact which sometimes leads to disputes and misunder- standings . In Figure 1 are two straight lines with arrowheads at the ends . The upper line has the arrowheads pointing out ; the lower one pointing in . The length of the lines between the arrowheads is slightly different . Probably the lower line will look at least as long as the upper one , yet actually it is a trifle shorter . The upper line represents the feeling of the supervisor who looks out at the other fellow and thinks he himself is getting the short end of a deal ; the lower line represents his feeling in looking in at the other fellow who is thought to be getting more than his share .  | The work of managing is tending to become professional as a distinct kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that requires a great amount of specialized thought , effort , and training in the principles as well as the techniques of managing . For the manager has the challenging task of getting results through the work of other men and women , rather than directly through his own effort . This professional approach requires , in fact , a dedication of the man 's self and service not only to the owners of the business through his board of directors , but also as a steward to the company 's customers , its industry , its employees , and to the community at large . The professional manager must always place the balanced best interests of these ahead of his own personal interests . The corporate manager today thus has an opportunity and an obligation for service comparable to the highest traditions of any professions in the past . Ralph J. Cordiner , New Frontiers for Professional Managers , copyright McGrawHill Book Company 1956 , pages 16-17 , by permission . The supervisor 's main duty to his superiors is to conduct the work assigned to his department . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A department head complained , " My supervisors wo n't make decisions . They always pass the buck to me , or they just sit and wait for me to make a decision . " On talking with the supervisors the authors  | found that they wanted to make decisions but they had been reversed by their superior so many times that they were discouraged . They wanted to see the direction from which the wind was blowing before reaching conclusions . The supervisor should stand ready to do more than is assigned and should train himself for larger tasks without pushing himself forward . Sometimes he may suggest additional tasks he might effectively take over . At other times , for the good of the organization , he should suggest a reduction in the activities of his own department . As pointed out in the first chapter , if his duties are not well defined , he should attempt to clarify them , at least in his own mind . The supervisor should study his superior 's temperament and mentality in order to assist him effectively , to avoid friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not urging that a supervisor toady to his superior or render him blind or uncritical loyalty . An outgoing sympathy , understanding tact , and good sense should guide his actions . He should profit from the good points shown by his superiors and should train himself to avoid following any poor practices . He must be equally loyal to his superiors and to his subordinates in order to maintain a healthy spirit of cooperation . The superior will naturally turn to his assistants to learn the details of the functioning of the department . The supervisor must give as fair and consistent reports as he can , bringing up points which are handled exceptionally well or which present unusual difficulties . The superior will need to do little about the good aspects , but he should be told when a member of the staff does particularly well . He is required by his job , however , to know what difficulties are encountered . He may wish the supervisor to handle some types of trouble , whereas he may help on , or actually handle , other types . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the kinds of difficulties which he should handle himself , and those which he should refer . You should remember also in your relations with your superior that you represent the workers as well as yourself . You have the responsibility to represent your employees , to plead their cause , present their grievances and suggestions objectively , and seek transfers , pay increases , or promotions for them on the basis of merit . The climate of the office is created by the relations of the human beings who compose it and above all by the day-to-day working relationships of yourself , your employees , and your superior . He needs to know from you the feelings  | of his employees . You are in some measure an extension of his eyes and ears to tell him what he needs to know . Although you have a great responsibility to give your superior the information he should have and to representing your employees to him , you also have a big need for information from the boss . If you do not get new policies promptly , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you are not " in the know " about things which are happening elsewhere in the company , you can not do the right job of representing management with your workers . To be sure , you would share this difficulty with many other supervisors . The National Association of Manufacturers found in a survey that 50 per cent of the foremen felt that they had no responsibility in interpreting the company to employees and that 65 per cent said that they had not been trained on how to pass information on to employees . We believe that a comparable study of offices would show a similar situation . If you have a perfect boss , he might remember to give you the information you need . If your company operates on a perfect plan for communication , you will get word through channels about new policies and programs and production and vacancies and shutdowns and many other things . It is likely , however , that neither your company nor your boss is perfect . It is the part of prudence to make it easy to hear things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that only a brief word with your boss may give you the enlightenment you require . It helps if you are on the look-out for information . Thus you glean from your boss and from others the facts you need , about the company 's philosophy , organization , budget , sales forecasts , research and development , plans for expansion , changes in personnel policy , and other developments and changes which you may know or suspect are in the wind . One of your most important duties is to assist your boss effectively . If you wish to be on good terms with your superior , study his work habits and respect them . Note the times of day when he is relaxed and ready to listen . For example , he may arrange to ride home half an hour after the office closes , or he may come in bright and early . But he may want those times for special work in his office . So be sure you know the times he does not wish to be disturbed . Some superiors believe that their instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to question the orders of a superior is insubordination . The best executives , we believe , expect  | their subordinates to question any order which seems unwise . They have no respect for the subordinate who says , " You told me to do it this way . I thought at the time you were wrong ; but you are the boss , so I did n't say anything . " The subordinate ought to mention his doubts at the time . Then if the superior still thinks his plan best , the subordinate should carry it out loyally . Many criticisms which intermediate supervisors make of their superiors reveal a lack of reflection on the nature of executive work . An executive spends much time dealing with actual or potential troubles or in planning for the future . Normally what goes well is called to his attention only in summary . In contacts with the staff , he is frequently dealing with some trouble . Usually he is pressed for time . He must see that work is carried on by others , since he would cease to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet it is his duty to be sure things are done properly . The organization , therefore , should be set up so that when things go amiss he will know and can take action . If you hear an executive criticized because he acted with meager knowledge of a situation , ask yourself how he could get greater knowledge , and whether if you were in his place , with all the other duties which you would have to perform , you could have used the time and planning necessary to get a more detailed picture . Then ask yourself whether you take up his time with matters you should handle yourself , and whether you take troubles to him early enough , before they have created a bad situation . It is sometimes discouraging to find how little attention an executive appears to pay to good points . Many times he is quite aware of the good work which is being done but does not take time to express his appreciation . The general manager of a large company was criticized by a supervisor of one of his departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures which were supplied by this man 's department . Instead , the general manager looked over the figures , picked on one or two and asked for a detailed explanation and verification of them . What better method could a general manager use to be sure that the figures were prepared sufficiently carefully to warrant his signing the report in which they were to be presented to the public ? Asking for such detailed verification is about the only way to build up confidence in the picture as a whole . To test grain in a freight car , a little wheat taken from several places in the car is very thoroughly  | analyzed and tested . On the basis of the small sample , the whole car is accepted or rejected . A higher executive often becomes greatly annoyed when he finds a minor error , in itself unimportant , in material supposed to be correct . He naturally wonders how many other inaccuracies there may be . Usually it is physically impossible for him to verify the work himself , and financially prohibitive to have every bit done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act upon the work done and how far to allow for other errors . Under such a circumstance , it is natural to show anger , which is the typical emotion when one 's desires are thwarted and one feels unable to do anything about it . A superior should be warned if given unchecked work . Then if he finds an error , it will not cause him to doubt the other work . Presenting ideas and suggestions is an art beset with various difficulties . In this discussion , it is assumed that the supervisor is convinced that his views are valuable for the organization as a whole and that he is not interested in tricks for putting wishes over , when what is gained by one person is lost by another . There are several principal difficulties in getting suggestions adopted : Preparation of Idea Suggester lacks knowledge of interrelationships . Not clearly thought through or presented . Difficulties not sufficiently overcome . Importance not demonstrated . Time Suggester has not time to work out idea adequately . Executive lacks time to act on it . Not opportune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idea Difference of opinion on best solution . Suggester lacks tact and patience . Fear of unknown or unproved . Perfectionism . " It has never been done that way " ? pride , prejudice , jealousy , inertia . Supervisor wants to originate the idea himself . Suggestion may take work away from someone else .  | The commonest justifiable reason for no action or unfavorable action on a suggestion is its improper preparation or presentation . The suggester should know exactly what he has in mind . It may be unwise , however , for him to invest a long time in working out the details if he thinks the idea may have been considered before . It is sometimes well to inquire about the suggestion in a preliminary way , both to find out the most important objections and to allow for incubation in the mind of the superior . When a certain junior officer wished to get a plan adopted , he would work it out in detail himself . While seeing his superior , he would mention casually , " I 've been thinking about such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe we would be able to work out the solution along these lines . " He would then mention the high spots of the plan , but he would not ask for an opinion . However , he would get at least a general reaction and a hint of the probable points of agreement and disagreement . He could then in his later presentation take care to meet the objections which he gleaned in the preliminary discussion . The superior had a chance to think over the proposal both consciously and unconsciously . The completely worked out plan would not seem wholly new , since he had had some preparation and incubation on the proposal . If a memorandum is prepared , give the general idea clearly and briefly . Find out how much detail a certain superior wishes , and meet especially the points he will probably raise . In addition to the strong points of the suggestion , it is well to mention difficulties and disadvantages , since it is the duty of the executives to see these . It may save time to point them out and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be given and objections met in a supplement . The memorandum should be prepared especially to interest the man who will act on it . His mental habits should be studied ; for instance , if he is mainly interested in service and general ideas , show how the plan forwards service . If his actions are influenced largely by definite factual considerations , give statistics . If he is a crank about punctuality , be sure to be on time for an appointment to discuss the idea . These suggestions are made not to encourage insincerity but to make relationships smooth and constructive . When the superior knows of a specific difficulty or sees that an idea is particularly applicable at the present time , he will more easily give it consideration . To make a suggestion seem important enough to he acted on , a saving in time or cost should be brought out , or better  | service suggested . Definite figures of the number of times the situation arises , or of the proportion of the difficult cases to the total , may indicate clearly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If exact figures are hard to get , approximations or estimates or the results of an exact count of a sample group of cases may be presented . The superior is likely to be interested in the broader aspects involved , and he may want to know that you have considered them . Furthermore , he is probably not so close to the actual working details as you are . If details have been changed since he was in touch with them , you should review the facts . In this way , you can help bridge the gap between your experience and his and make your knowledge available to him . Sometimes a superior appears indifferent when actually he has other solutions in mind or knows reasons he can not disclose why the idea can not be tried . The superior is more likely to approve an idea if it is in shape to be put into effect easily than if he has to work out further details himself . The extra work you do to make it easy for him will probably result in greater practicality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up the suggestion . State briefly , before going into details , the main points of difference between the present and the proposed methods and the chief advantages of the proposal . Sometimes detailed descriptions of both methods may be given . You may prefer to omit writing out the details , but when the idea is ready for final approval be sure you have them clear in your own mind , or better , on paper . Often a detailed description of the steps under a proposed method will seem much more complicated than the present ones . When one is familiar with the present method , one tends to think it simple and straightforward , and to forget many of its complications . A new routine with unfamiliar features may appear far more complicated even when it is really simpler . Charts of the present and proposed steps , if prepared on the same scale , can give a quick visual perception of short cuts . Some superiors may wish to see the data on which you base your recommendations ; others prefer to hear what you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion with one or more subordinates and try to persuade them of its practicality . They may bring up new points and may show you what questions your superior is likely to ask . Also , they will feel part of a team if their suggestions and advice are considered . Care should be taken to present to an executive only such ideas as arc worth his time , and on an occasion when he is not too busy to give the requisite attention . When , however , an idea is definitely pre- sumed to be of value to the company , it is up to the individual to find a time when he can bring the matter up . Remember that at times what you know to be quite important may be relatively unimportant to the top executive who must pass upon it . A personnel manager was granted an interview to discuss a new training scheme with the general manager . When he arrived at the office , the latter said , " I am glad you called up . Can your matter wait ? I want someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an option on ( naming one of the many chemicals used in the manufacturing process ) . We use about a million dollars worth of that a year . The option expires at five o'clock today . When we took the option we were threatened with inflation and the price seemed very good , but now it looks as though prices might drop instead , in which case we could lose a lot of money . " For two hours the personnel man sat listening , his own proposal shrinking in importance . He could perhaps save ten thousand dollars a year by his new training plan , but that was not important at the time ? a million dollar contract was . Chalice Kelly Coyle , Personnel Journal , January 1938 , page 181 . It is difficult to draw the line between proper persistence and being a nuisance . A busy , important executive , who may be typical of many others , said that he considered it distinctly the responsibility of a subordinate to get in to see him no matter how busy he was if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I will give a man a ring at four o'clock and I do not , it is up to him to call me and remind me that I was to get in touch with him . " In another instance a supervisor told an officer 's secretary that he had made an appointment with the officer to see him the first thing in the morning . She replied , " Oh , you 're the fifth one . " Ingenuity is sometimes demanded to get action from executives ( as well as from other people ) . This is not because executives are necessarily dilatory , but because so many responsibilities fall on them that it is difficult for them to take up everything at the time when it should be taken up . Therefore , their subordinates should make it as easy as possible for them to take up things in a brief and satisfactory manner . When possible , keep the initiative in your own hands . It is tactful to say to a superior , " If I have not heard from you by next week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? " If he suggests that such and such an activity can not be undertaken for three months or until after the vacation period , be careful to bring it up at the designated  | time . If he has promised to telephone you at a certain hour and you have not heard from him , you might call him a little later , saying that you were out of the room shortly after the appointed hour and you hoped you had not caused him inconvenience if he could n't get you . A supervisor in a discussion group told of a difficulty he had in getting executive attention . Two exceptional cases came up , and he found he was unable to get an interview with his superior . Therefore he handled the cases according to his judgment . Later his superior called him down for not bringing the cases to his attention . " It 's up to you to get in to see me when cases like this arise . " Another time , the junior did break into his executive 's office and was refused time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . The group asked him what he was going to do next time , and he said , " Next time I will also burst in , and probably get thrown out again ! " The suggestion was made that it would be fair to the man and also to his superior if he prepared a brief memo outlining the case , with the statement that he had tried to consult his superior , had been unable to do so , and so had taken a particular action . Do not expect your ideas to be accepted when you first suggest them . Remember the importance of preparation and incubation in the thinking process . Be prepared to present the same idea several times , possibly in slightly different forms , over a period of time . Do not stop because you hear that the idea was turned down once before . Put a new dress on it , if it seems to need one , and try its fate again . Once the authors were making a survey of a company and submitting recommendations for changes . The planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated two , three , or even five years before outlining substantially the same recommendations on which favorable action was being secured . The fact that suggestions often must be repeated several times before they are approved is one reason why it is so hard to give credit for a suggestion to the proper person . Usually the last person rather than the first is the one who gets the credit . In submitting suggestions it is advisable to keep a copy . It may be useful later . A man presented a memorandum to his chief only to have the idea dismissed as impossible . Three months later the chief asked him for some ideas  | on the topic and he produced the memorandum , merely changing the date and having it retyped . This time it was " a perfectly fine idea " and was immediately adopted . ( One supervisor commented upon this story : " Only too true ? and perhaps three months later the boss presents the idea as his own inspiration ! " ) If you become quite sure that your proposal will be turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suggest that the matter be laid aside for a few months , or until more data are available . Once it is definitely rejected it will be harder , though not impossible , to bring it up again .  | Most companies other than small ones now have a personnel office that works out personnel policies for the organization and does some staff work on personnel matters . Even though some parts of the personnel job may be well performed in a central office or by personnel  | specialists , the heart of the personnel job must be carried out by the supervisor in the work place in face-to-face relationship with the employees . The quality of the staff and above all the quality of relationships built up have a great deal to do with the success of your department . Moreover , you will be judged by the good or bad work of those in your group . Well-selected , well-placed , and well-trained people with high morale can make almost any system work , but poor training or morale can wreck any system too . You have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screening , and testing are usually performed by the personnel office . The supervisor usually sets forth the general requirements of the job before it is filled by hiring or by transfer or promotion . Usually he prepares a job description or list of duties which the employee is to perform . Standards of physical fitness , education , skills , training , or experience may then be determined . Many of the best employers consider applicants on their merits without regard to age , sex , religion , or national origin . The laws of some states forbid some kinds of discrimination . Educational requirements are fairly common , but are frequently waived if the individual has a good record of experience . During and since World War II larger numbers of office workers have been employed from the young , the old , and the physically impaired . People in all these groups can perform well . Some may need more supervision , training on the job , and individual attention at first . After they have been on the job a while , they need not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in dealing with the needs of these workers ? Annually the youth who have finished high school and college form a great part of the nation 's new office work force . The help they get in starting out may shape their future attitudes and worker-employer relations . A foundation for a young person 's lifetime industry and performance is often laid in his first job . A young worker requires patience , more careful job instruction , and different treatment from that given his elders . You have to orient him to a job more slowly than an experienced worker . You should he clear and specific in all instructions ; and be sure he learns each step before going on to the next . You must constantly be aware of developing good work habits . Try to discover his capabilities early and develop  | him to take responsibility . Show him how well he is doing and give him credit for a job well done . Be enthusiastic and show genuine interest in his work . Remember that " good attitudes are caught not taught . " More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live longer . In 1955 a boy baby could expect to live to be 67 and a girl baby to be 73 . These are the best life expectancies in history . The number of people over 45 is increasing more rapidly than the total population , but as a result of the depression of the 1930 's there are and will be fewer adults under 40 for some years to come . For the first time in the United States , females outnumber males . The proportion of females in the population and in the work force is rising . One worker in three is a woman . Office , banks , small companies , and service industries that formerly expected to recruit young people from school and college are now looking to older people , particularly women , as a labor source . Many women in their forties are returning to work after their children go to school . In their first job after a gap of years they may require careful supervision and refresher skills training . After a brief adjustment , they are usually able to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that older workers have good work records and perform well . They are dependable and have longer job tenure . They quit jobs less often than do younger workers . However , they often have a harder time in finding employment when they are out of work . In World War II a considerable number of physically handicapped persons were employed . They gave an excellent account of themselves . Many handicapped , including veterans , are at work now . It is common for good employers to accept handicapped applicants and to place them selectively . Thus persons who are blind and deaf , amputees , spastics , persons with health deficiencies , and those whose faces are disfigured are all employed at jobs for which their particular impairment does not disqualify them . Many handicapped persons have better records than do the unhandicapped . On the average they do not have more accidents on the job . Normally they produce slightly better and have less than normal rates of absence or turnover . Their performance usually has a good effect upon fellow workers . Many of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the desk or other equipment may be needed , and sometimes slight changes in procedure . Training also takes a bit more time and care . Regular follow-up should be made for some time to assure the success of the worker and to help him with any difficulties  | which may arise . Fatigue , strain , accidents , or absence should be noted . The handicapped individual usually wants to be treated as nearly as possible like anyone else , but he may be more than normally appreciative of being assured that his work is satisfactory or better . A supervisor who can help an impaired person make good gets a big reward in satisfaction . Tests have now become accepted aids in the selection of people for jobs . Many of these are used as the cook uses a strainer to remove what does not seem suitable . A general intelligence test is such a screening device . If people score very high , they are not suitable for retention on routine work ; if they score very low , they probably should not go into clerical jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance companies , published by the Life Office Management Association in November 1957 , shows that all the large life insurance companies use tests . So do more than three-quarters of the smaller or medium-sized companies . Among those employing fewer than 200 persons , slightly more than half use tests and quite a few more are planning to do so . Extensive use is made of tests of typing , clerical aptitude , mental ability , shorthand , and mathematical ability . Tests for temperament and personality , English usage , mechanical aptitude , manual dexterity , and bookkeeping are used less . The life companies make fairly extensive use of " home-made " tests , but these require substantial amounts of research to be reliable . Established tests are available from numerous sources . However , the usefulness of a specific test under conditions obtaining in a given company should be carefully evaluated . Tests are used not only in initial hiring and placement but also for subsequent transfer and promotion . They are aids in making personnel decisions , and add valuable information to what is already known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and experience . Although tests measure some important characteristics in a job situation , they do not measure them all . Hence when the employee is known in the company , his record of performance should be the primary basis for his transfer and promotion . The giving of tests does not require much special skill . However , a good deal of special knowledge is required in order to select a test , check its validity under company conditions , and interpret its results . Where testing resources are not available to the supervisor , he should  | not ordinarily get into testing unless he is able to give careful study to the results secured by himself and by others . He may wish to do so if he heads a large department . In any case he may try out some very simple tests himself . He may also profit from spending some care in determining what practical things to ask or to have demonstrated in order to judge the suitability of an applicant . If the latter does badly on the rough test , however , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infallible guide . Moreover , lack of ability in one line may not mean any lack in other types of work . A few examples of simple tests are suggested here . A stenographer may be given a few paragraphs of dictation to transcribe . A typist may be asked to type a standard letter . Both accuracy and speed should be considered . It is not hard to test for adequacy of grammar , punctuation , letter composition , and the spelling of words commonly used . A fairly typical letter is prepared without punctuation or capital letters , with some grammatical errors , and with a number of misspelled words . Then the person to be tested is asked to type a correct letter from the incorrect draft . People vary markedly in their ability to file promptly and accurately . Various simple devices may be used to test filing ability . Tests are also available commercially . A set of cards prepared with names and numbers can be used . They are shuffled and the applicant is asked to sort them alphabetically and numerically . Another device is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of the items in the two columns being exact duplications and others having slight differences . The person tested should be able to mark quickly which pairs of items are the same or different . Often a few minutes ' talk with an applicant will indicate clearly that he would not fit the requirements for such positions as are open . Therefore , it may be well , before giving any tests or even having an application blank filled out , to talk with the applicant . Those who will not be considered further should then be told tactfully but truthfully that they do not qualify . This is particularly easy when the reason is quite objective , such as poor grades in recent schooling . It is fairer to the applicants to reject them definitely than to hold out the possibility of employing them at a later time . When the personnel office does the recruiting and screening of applicants , the supervisor usually has at least some say on actually employing the individual for a job in his unit . An exception may be re- assignment during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a person whether he thinks well of him or not . Even then he is usually asked to interview the individual before accepting him as a member of his work group . If he is not satisfied with the prospective employee , he should tell the personnel office or his superior at the time . There is little use in saying later that he thought all along the applicant was not good enough . When you interview an applicant , even if you do not expect to employ him , remember that he will judge your company and your department by the contacts he makes . Try to have him leave with the feeling that your organization would be a fine place in which to work , that the people in it know their jobs and treat the public fairly . Remember that it will take no more time to see a man promptly than to see him a half hour later , and you can politely be brief if you have not kept him waiting . Put the applicant at ease as soon as you can , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you can find a common interest in school , place of birth , or some other point . Your object should be to learn about the other person and what is on his mind . Do n't waste time by speaking too much yourself . Be a good listener . You may need to talk at first to get the other person started , but once the ice is broken you should do little more than guide the conversation and keep it going by asking questions . Often you will get more information if you will let the person talk as things come to his mind . The important point to decide is how well the applicant would fit in . Definite questions should therefore relate to the job which is open . For instance , if it involves quite continuous operation of a calculating machine , ask how much calculator experience he has had , how he likes working with office machinery , and whether he has ever timed himself on machine work . If the job is of higher grade , one might ask what he expects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to reach his goal . This may indicate how ambitious and how practical he is . A good interviewer tries to find out whether in the past he has done what he has set out to do both in school or college and in previous business jobs . It is not worthwhile to take able workers for easy jobs unless you can advance them reasonably soon . Some people are too capable mentally to remain satisfied or interested in simple work . They have interests which are not absorbed by their task , and if they are kept at it for a considerable period they are likely to prove unsatisfactory . In describing the job , be careful not to make it appear better than it is . You may get a desirable person into the company by an over- statement ; but whether deliberate or unintentional , it will soon be discovered by the new worker , and you will lose his confidence . If you make any promises as to probable salary increases or promotion , be sure to write them down and file them where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out . Some supervisors do not mean to make a specific promise , but they may say in a general way , " If you come in here and do a good job , you will probably be getting ten dollars more by the end of six months . " In one such instance a clerk entered her work with enthusiasm . When at the end of eight months there had been no salary increase , she wondered whether the management wished her to resign . Actually the officer interviewing her was quite unaware of having made any promise . The girl 's work was quite satisfactory , but for several reasons an increase of salary had not been considered . What was thought to be a broken promise almost ruined the clerk 's future with the organization . Some companies now no longer ask for written references from persons seeking employment , since few people will refer to anyone who , will not write favorably . However , if one can talk with a previous employer or other reference over the telephone or , better still , if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal about the applicant . A new employee 's attitude is easily shaped by the first impressions he receives . His cooperation is invited and his adjustment eased when he is carefully introduced to his job . Be sure that there is someone on hand to direct him when he reports for work . Usually his immediate supervisor is the proper person to start him on the job . Immediately tell the new employee something about the program for the day . Go over with him briefly the important aspects of the company practices in regard to such things as hours , lunch time , lateness , overtime , how payment will be made , where to hang his coat , where to wash , and so forth . Perhaps your company has a booklet that gives some of these facts . A new secretary , Ada Chase , had just been hired for the department head , Mrs. Montgomery . " No , I do n't think I should start Miss Chase on Monday , " said Mrs. Montgomery to the personnel officer . " Make it Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings . I do n't think it is good for a  | person to report to work and then find that nobody really wants her around . I want personally to get her off to a good start . Can you arrange something else for her on Monday , such as orientation in your shop ? Otherwise ask her not to come in at all until Tuesday . Then I shall be ready for her , bright and early . " You as supervisor should see that the new person is personally introduced to the persons with whom his work will bring him in contact or who are working around him . Introduce him yourself if you can . It will help him if he is given a rough diagram showing where the people sit by roughly sketching positions of their desks with the names . If first names are generally used , they can be put on the chart as well . It will give the new employee a sense of being worthwhile if he is introduced to your superior and to the highest officer above you who is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one company employing several hundred people , the chief executive personally meets each new employee and spends three or four minutes talking with him the day he starts to work . In another company , the president meets each employee on his second anniversary of service . Probably you will not wish to spend the whole morning with the new employee , who will doubtless be glad to sit down by himself or with someone not his boss . You should have planned some job which he can do with very little instruction . Give him this , or turn him over to someone else who is ready to help him . You may wish to see him later the same day . In many cases the new worker should be turned over to an experienced person in order to learn the particular job which he is to perform . But the immediate supervisor should maintain frequent contacts , say once a day , during the first few days . Either on the first day or soon after he has started to work explain to the new employee the relation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole . Also see that he knows something about the company 's place in the business of the country . Practically no office job can be done without at least a small amount of training . Even on simple filing there must be instruction on the way a particular office files titles like " The ABC Company " or " 286 W. 11th St. , Inc . " In large companies training of new employees is systematic . It may  | even involve sending employees to school . Especially in the case of office technicians and executives , special training may be given by universities , schools , or professional associations . Most training , however , is not so formal in character and rests upon the shoulders of the supervisor . Training involves : ( 1 ) job instruction sufficient to do current work and to operate new office equipment ; ( 2 ) establishment of sound working habits ; and ( 3 ) understanding of relationships and subject matter to provide for intelligent , constructive attitude , and for promotion . The authors have found that most groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties or disadvantages which should be avoided or reduced in importance . The following lists are based upon the experience of a number of office supervisors . The advantages of a definite program of training office workers to do their jobs better include these : Workers can perform more accurately and faster . Office work methods can be standardized . Trained workers require less supervision . Good work habits are inculcated . Training requires the supervisor to learn his job well . Training fulfills a moral obligation to develop subordinates . Training promotes cooperation and teamwork . Training minimizes the difficulties caused by turnover . Training of others frees the superior so that he may rise . Training preserves the advantages of past experience . An attempt at training enables you to find out sooner whether the worker is suited to the job . Definite training develops workers much faster than the trial and error method of letting them find out for themselves how to handle work . Training gives a better basis on which the worker may exercise his judgment . Training often makes handling of details practically an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to give special attention to unusual cases . In the process of training , the teacher can learn a great deal about the capacity of the worker and forecast future promotion . Trained people take more interest in their work . Trained people can accept responsibility when it is delegated . Training workers in one another 's work provides flexibility and substitutes for those who are absent .  | As a result of these factors , training reduces turnover and costs . Offsetting the above advantages are a number of disadvantages or difficulties . Some or all of these may be present in any given case . In recognizing them a supervisor can make the necessary adjustments in planning and carrying on his training duties . Training may be given which is not required by the work performed . Training requires the expenditure of time and money . During the training regular work is likely to be interrupted so that individual output is reduced . Teaching and instructing are difficult and a poor instructor may do more harm than good . If a worker is trained , he may feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may become dissatisfied unless he is advanced promptly . If a worker leaves soon after the training period , the company loses most of what it invested in training . Go over these lists , checking those factors which you consider of most importance . Do this first for training the new employee on his first job . Then do it for training an established employee for further work . Some training is inevitable . The practical question is not whether to train , but what training to give , when to give it , by whom , and how . Keep in mind that training means developing certain work habits in a person and giving him information which will help develop those habits or actions which lead to practical results . The distinction between education and training should be recognized . A football fan may be highly educated in the theory of football but utterly useless as a player . Similarly , a clerk may be trained to compute quickly and accurately the loan value of any life insurance policy likely to come to his desk , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the values are determined . As a trained computer , he may calculate much faster than an educated actuary . There is a lot of difference between knowing the rules of chess and being a good chess player . As to the danger to a supervisor of losing his job because he trains his staff , we believe that this is much more than offset by the danger of his losing a promotion if he does not train them , and particularly if he has not developed an understudy . A story , told by Dr. Walter Dill Scott , of how different persons learned to solve a Chinese puzzle illustrates four main ways of training .  | Dr. Scott was staying at a boarding house where a boy had a Chinese puzzle . He worked at it by the haphazard method , trying blindly , till he just happened to get it right after eight hours ' work . His next attempt did not take so long , but it was many days before he could solve the problem rapidly . Another boarder attempted to solve the puzzle by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . The second person accomplished the solution in two hours , by the apprenticeship method of watching someone who knows how . A mechanical engineer set out to do the puzzle by scientific procedure . He figured out the principles that he thought might be involved , tried them , and abandoned methods that proved unsuccessful . He succeeded in half an hour , and later trials were all successful and rapid . Dr. Scott then started on the puzzle with the engineer standing by . He tried to unite the blocks , and as one difficulty after another arose , he was given instruction in the principle for overcoming it . No principle was presented until the situation required it . Practice and theory went step by step , but practice preceded principle . As a result , the problem was solved in fifteen minutes , and Dr. Scott knew how he had done it , and how the principles would apply under other circumstances . Very little can be said in favor of the " sink-or-swim " method of training . It is often quite expensive , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in higher average output per worker and lower employee turnover . The apprentice method is often followed in clerical offices . A new clerk is told little or nothing by the supervisor but is put in charge of an experienced clerk to watch him work . The crafts in which the apprenticeship system is followed do not seem to have progressed much . For instance , the craft of bricklaying is at least 6000 years old and has been passed on from one skilled workman to another . Some years ago , however , Mr. Frank Gilbreth , a consulting engineer , studied bricklaying to see if he could improve it . He found that eighteen movements are customarily made by bricklayers in laying bricks , but four and one-half motions suffice , provided the material is properly arranged and the worker efficiently trained . He devised a new method of laying bricks which increased the number laid per man from 120 to 350 bricks per hour without making the bricklayer work harder . In clerical work it is by no means unusual for a clerk trained in technique to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untrained clerk . Better methods are induced by study and training . " Training on the job " is usually given by the supervisor , but may  | be delegated . General principles are taught insofar as they are related to the work immediately in hand , and their application is made evident . A central training department can effectively give office workers a general background in the organization 's history , policies , and the interrelationships of the different departments . It can also give instruction in specific types of work and in special skills . For instance , typing , filing , and business letter-writing can be taught effectively to personnel drawn from a number of quite different departments . The proper use of adding , bookkeeping , calculating , and other automatic office equipment can be taught centrally . Representatives of companies which supply various office machines are usually available and willing to conduct classes or give individual training on their particular equipment . Some companies also supply training guides for supervisors to use . Most of the modern office machines are quite complicated and require initially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisor with only a few machines in the office can not be expected to be familiar with the operation of all types of modern office equipment . He should know , however , what is necessary to maintain them and to recognize when they are out of order . He should also know what to expect of a worker 's performance and what constitutes a good standard of production on any of them . The primary responsibility for training a person to do a job well rests with the supervisor . Training away from the job takes away many contacts which the supervisor should make with the new employee in order to size him up fairly and to fit him into the organization effectively . Most training , except when there are obvious advantages in centralization , should be conducted in the department by the supervisor or under his direction . If he is a senior supervisor , he may delegate some or all of his responsibility for training , but he should see that it is carried out , that the trainers are competent , and that the subordinate supervisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be given by a person of fairly high rank . Specific training may then be carried out by the immediate supervisor or his assistant , or by a clerk who not only is thoroughly experienced in proper methods but also has teaching ability . If the supervisor feels that he himself has not the knack of training , he should develop it . Normally it can be learned , if time and attention are devoted to it . An advantage of the supervisor  | doing the training is that he then sees the details himself and can easily make sure that extra work has not crept into the procedures . It is wise to avoid having the training done by someone who is about to leave the company unless there is no question about his competence , loyalty , and ability to teach . Normally training should be a continuous process and can not be done in full by a person about to leave . If the supervisor does not do the bulk of the training himself , he should keep in close touch with the progress of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . The beginning of bad work habits should be avoided or corrected . The supervisor should be sure to polish off the training himself , unless he is perfectly satisfied with the results obtained . The proper steps in the process of training on the job are to : 1 . Put the trainee ( person being trained ) at ease . 2 . Explain to the trainee the fundamentals of the work he is to learn . Tell its purpose , and explain briefly how it is related to work done before and afterwards . 3 . Demonstrate the best arrangement of the work and the work place . This should be done by deliberate study and should not be left to the worker 's discretion . 4 . Demonstrate one operation . Where an exact technique has been worked out , the best motions and the correct sequence of the motions at a standard rate of speed should be taught . 5 . Have the trainee try the operation . 6 . Correct any mistakes which the trainee makes . 7 . Follow up , repeating steps 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placing emphasis first on one and then on the other . Training starts with what the new employee needs to know . An up-to-date job description or list of duties is important . Since the knowledge and skills of individuals vary , the training should be tailored to the need . A method which works with one person may not succeed with another . The more carefully the job has been studied in advance , the more effective the teaching can be , since the best motions and the correct sequence can be taught . Also , there should be a standard rate of speed . Even when the job has not been studied in such detail , the foregoing steps should be followed . How soon a second operation should be taught will  | vary with the job under consideration , but usually teaching it should start before the first operation is fully mastered , unless mastery of the first is required to perform the second . It should be explained that standard methods are the best which have been worked out to date , but that improvements are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have in the future will be carefully considered . Not too much material should be given at a time ? " Do n't feed him more than he can swallow . " It is said that only about eight ideas can be taken in at one sitting by the average person . If much detail must be given , it should be carefully grouped under a few main points . To get the best results , it is necessary to cover details , but not to overburden the worker with new information . It is important to correct errors as they arise so that they will not develop into habits . Correct working habits can be learned as easily as wrong ones ; but if the wrong ones are acquired first , the process of correction is far harder than proper learning in the first place , since the old habit must be broken and replaced with the good . The head of the accounting department in a large life insurance company secured excellent results in training a new calculating machine operator to do her work properly . The girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work that she was to do in analyzing accounts was new to her . He started by giving a brief explanation of the principles upon which the accounts were divided for analysis , and mentioned specifically the more frequent items she would encounter . He told her that he expected her to make some mistakes , as he would not attempt to have her learn all the rules before she started , and that she need not be worried when she made them . Then he turned her over to the section head under whom she was to work . He explained a little more about the details of the operation she was to perform and then started her in with some actual work . He checked her work as soon as she had done a moderate amount and found several errors . The work was then taken to the head of the department who went over each error with the clerk , explaining to her the proper handling . From time to time the section head taught the clerk additional details about her work , but the department head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not burdened with too many rules at the start . Her errors were corrected before they had hardened into improper habits , and the department head was able to keep close control upon her progress and to test the ability of his section head as trainer . The girl 's record of errors was two or three a day for the first 15 or 20  | days . A month later she had reached a point where for 17 days she had not made a single error . Whenever possible the worker should be required to correct his own errors , thus learning to avoid similar mistakes the next time . If it is impracticable to have the worker correct the error , it should at least be called to his attention soon . One should avoid laying much emphasis upon possibilities for mistakes . For instance , it is poor to say : " Do not , under any circumstances , multiply the figure in this column by the one next to it , because this would give you an answer which would be almost twice as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the error without suggesting it , by saying : " Be sure to multiply the figure in this column by the figures over here in the column headed . . . . " There are plenty of ways to make errors , and most new workers will find many of them without suggestions . The three main methods of learning clerical operations are those of the eye , of the ear , and of the muscles ( technically , the visual , the auditory , and the kinesthetic ) . When items on one sheet are to be checked with those on another , the quickest method is to match them by eye , without the intermediate steps of hearing the words or numbers in one 's mind or forming them with the muscles of the lips , tongue , and throat . People who easily take in impressions through the eye photographically can go faster than those who do not . The visual method improves with practice , and is very important for clerical work . When facts are to be remembered , however , visual images can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another what one has read or seen facilitates memory , since saying words and hearing one 's self speak intensify the perception of what one has seen with the eye . A person speaks at the rate of about 100 words a minute , but can read 250 to 350 words a minute . It is very important in clerical jobs to learn the art of rapid reading , since so many clerical activities depend on reading and comparing data . Leedy 's book on reading improvement is included in the bibliography . A knowledge of the laws of learning is a help to the trainer , and perhaps to the learner . Let the worker know that it is normal for a person to learn a certain amount and then either to slow down in acquiring more skill or even to lose part of what one thought one had acquired . During this slowing down or slipping back , the trainer and the trainee are likely to become discouraged . In spite of no apparent progress , ideas and habits are being formed , but a certain amount of confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews of principles  | may help the trainee to consolidate what he is taught and to reduce the extent of these " plateaus of learning . " One should invariably be careful to treat all the learner 's questions seriously . Laughing at a foolish question is one of the quickest ways to cut off further inquiry and to complicate the training process . If you can not help showing your amusement , turn the joke on yourself , and make it appear , if possible , to be because of a funny mistake in your teaching . A trainer can not assume that people will ask about what is not clear . Some will , but others will think that they " will catch on later to the reasons , " and so will not ask ; and still others will think that they have a clear picture when a little questioning would show that in reality they have not . Things which you may think are too obvious to mention may not be clear to the new employee . This is especially true of new terms or of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used , they are understood . The authors had to learn that the frequently used initials " P.I.B. " in one company were equivalent to " M.A.Q. " in another ? a " Physician 's Inquiry Blank " and a " Medical Attendant 's Questionnaire . " Sometime during the training process the relationship of what is done to what goes before and what will follow later should be taught . It may also increase the effectiveness of the worker if he is given a picture of the work in the other departments , possibly by seeing it actually done . We were once talking with a man who handled the reports from the agencies of life insurance premiums which were not paid by the end of the days of grace . He said that when an agency wrote that it expected to get settlement from the policyholder within a few days ; he would rush the termination through , as otherwise it might not be terminated when the money was reported as collected . We suggested that a number of terminations could be avoided if he held such cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " Oh , what 's a termination ? It 's easy to mark off the business and put it back on the books again ! " He had no idea that the termination alone would have to pass through the hands of twentyseven different clerks and that the revival would be equally complicated . Sometimes a person can do much toward training himself by reading correspondence or other papers on past cases . This is a particularly good method for technical or semi-technical work and may be useful to a supervisor who is required to train a man while he himself is very busy . The new man night be given a hundred recently completed  | cases of the type he will learn to handle . After he has been given a brief explanation of the underlying principles and the requirements , he should see how the case developed , starting with the earliest paper or entry . After following several cases to their conclusion , he should study them and decide how he would act at each step had the case come to him . He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ask about any action for which the reason does not seem clear . Not only does this method reduce the time required of the supervisor , but also it may result in getting useful suggestions from the new man on how particular types of cases might be better handled . In addition to a study of past cases , it may be useful to have the subordinate read the current correspondence of his superior . Until actual physical deterioration sets in , age has comparatively little to do with learning ability , but habit has a great deal to do with it . Those who are forced continually to learn new things throughout life ? like business executives , salesmen , and uncaught criminals ? are in general better able to learn than the average college man who falls into ruts and does not have to adapt himself to many new conditions . To those who quote the proverb " You ca n't teach an old dog new tricks , " one may counter with " Never too old to learn . " At present , the second one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker who has done the same thing from sixteen to thirty-six is about as hard to retrain as one much older who has done the same thing for twenty years . In the interest of the organization and of the workers themselves , care should be taken to see that they are faced with new situations from time to time in order that they may retain their learning and adaptive powers . If this has not been done in the past , it may still not be too late to start it even with workers above sixty years old . They could hardly be expected to revive their learning and adaptive capacities in a very short time , but they should be capable of gradual revival if they are properly handled . Modern business is changing so fast that it has become an important responsibility of the supervisor to keep his employees from falling into a groove . A change in methods or an advance in technique can make almost any specialized clerical job obsolete . In order to maintain an atmosphere where change is possible without ruining the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept adaptable . The easiest way to insure this is continual adaptation ? rotation ? job broadening ? as discussed in other chapters .  | Even those who are very " sot in their ways " can accommodate to new challenges . The coming of automation in a large division of a government department created great apprehension , especially since a number of clerks had been doing the same routine , repetitive clerical work since World War I. Many of the clerks were moved to other divisions as vacancies developed . Finally it appeared that the remaining ones had to make their choices , to retire on reduced annuity , to find their own jobs elsewhere , or to learn new skills . They were told that if they would learn typing they would be able to transfer within the department without loss of grade and pay . Many of them took training in typing , either from the beginning or in a refresher course , and backed up by their supervisors and the personnel office were able to qualify for new opportunities . Some , however , chose to retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some persons who are below normal mentally . They are a challenge to the supervisor who is interested in people . If he can fit them into a job where they will be productive and self-supporting , he will not only carry out his immediate job as supervisor but he will also do a real service . Such subnormal persons often make satisfactory routine clerks and may be placed appropriately in blind-alley jobs . A number of companies have prepared written instructions or " Standard Practice Instructions " on how to perform their various jobs . They are designed to be a guide to the clerk and to cover all the common and most of the exceptional cases . Sometimes they are used instead of other training methods . A group of supervisors mentioned the following advantages of written instructions : Help memory . Cover technical instructions . Relieve supervisor of questioning . Encourage standardization and uniformity of practice . Insure against omissions in training . Preserve a record of previous practice , which may be useful after a change has been made . Fix responsibility .  | Help training for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May include explanation of reason for operation . Provide means of guarding against error or carelessness at especially important points . Preparation of the written instructions frequently leads to improvement in methods . The following disadvantages were mentioned by the same group of supervisors : Create a tendency not to remember . Take much time to prepare . Hard to keep up to date . Must be exceedingly accurate or will lead to errors . Too voluminous if they cover every situation which may arise . Cramp initiative if followed too implicitly . Judgment is needed in determining which instructions apply to a particular case . Some oral instruction is generally advisable when an employee starts on a new job . The principles behind the work should be explained , and the reason why it is required should be given . The oral method may be helpfully supplemented by written instructions , summarizing the principles and giving the detailed method of handling individual cases . A particular value attaches to the written instructions for jobs performed only at infrequent intervals . The day-to-day routine , once learned , will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be . In some instances , the instructions are little more than a check list of items to be considered in doing the job ; in others , they may be elaborate descriptions of the details of all the common and most of the uncommon aspects of the work . Particular persons should not be referred to by name . Reference should be to the job they hold , so that , if their work is changed by promotion or otherwise , the instructions will still be correct . One way of getting a groundwork for instructions is to have each person prepare a list of his duties and a brief description of how he performs them . Although such lists will be especially useful to the supervisor during vacation seasons , it is best to have them prepared at some other time . If prepared just before salary increases or promotions are to be decided upon , the employee will probably emphasize the number of different things he does , whereas just before his vacation he is likely to minimize them .  | It is sometimes surprising how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for even a relatively simple job . A group of supervisors was asked to list the details and responsibilities in which a new bookkeeper should be trained . At the first meeting twenty items were listed ; a week later thirty more items were added ; and finally three hundred were included . Written instructions may be prepared by the supervisor himself , by someone under him , or by a planning department . Their preparation almost always involves a consideration of why the work is done and whether it is done in the best way . Much time is required to prepare written instructions and also to keep them up to date . Simple , general instructions , maintained up to date , will usually be of more value than detailed instructions which are allowed to get out of date . In order to show some of the difficulties of preparing and following written instructions , we have given the following instructions with minor modifications to several groups of supervisors . Seldom does one out of five follow them correctly . In order to try yourself out you need only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows a sheet correctly marked . Look at this after you have tried yourself . Draw two lines across the top of the sheet each about half an inch apart and the upper one an inch from the top . Draw two lines along the whole left side in similar relation to the edge . Write the word United in the upper left space , and the word States in the upper right space . Write a small script letter d upside down in the smallest space . Fold the paper three times . Write your last name on outside . Frequently the supervisors turned their paper upside down in order to write the small script d . Few realized that they could write a small script p right side up . Many put the words in the wrong places , sometimes as a result of drawing the lines improperly . One of the most frequent errors was that the paper was folded twice ( into thirds ) instead of three times . Even when folded three times , several different sizes of finished product were turned out . The written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or both . Instructions substantially like the above were given to three groups of supervisors in a large life insurance company . We found that five out of nineteen in the first group followed them correctly ; four out of eighteen , in the second group ; and only one out of sixteen , in the third group . The best score was made by the junior group and the poorest by the senior . Of course it would be unfair to generalize from one such sample , but the result is in keeping with the theory that the further up a supervisor is in an  | organization , the more thorough in general are the explanations given him and the more he uses his own head . The junior supervisors , some of whom spent most of their time doing individual work , were more accustomed than the seniors to being told to do a thing and to go ahead without knowing just why . The seniors appeared to be trying to get some reason out of the instructions , and since there was none , they had difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions given above and the failure to be specific about the detail of how to fold the paper illustrate some of the difficulties of preparing written instructions . To test proposed instructions , try to follow them yourself , noticing any places where the wording is not exact . Then get someone not familiar with the job to do it from the instructions while you stay nearby to see what difficulties are encountered in interpretating the directions . Written instructions help to secure uniformity of practice . They are an undoubted aid in training and for vacations and substitutions . They avoid unnecessary questions and eliminate many excuses . Their disadvantages are that they require work to prepare and to keep up to date and that they are sometimes too rigid and may discourage initiative .  | No job is too complicated to be covered by them , but they may make the job seem much more complicated than it really is . America 's high standard of living as shown by its Gross National Product , the total value of goods and services produced in any one year , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , but one principal factor is increased individual productivity . The things which motivate people to higher productivity are found to be work methods , interest in the job , kind of supervision received , and the human relations climate existing among the work group itself . Training workers to improve their skills and to make their job more satisfying affects their productivity directly . Careful planning by a supervisor to use training in his daily work will make his job easier and supervision more effective . He also can more likely reach the standard of individual productivity expected by management . Recent research findings in the field of productivity , supervision , and morale show the close relationship between the type of supervision received and the productivity of the worker . Although training is given office personnel in better work methods , supervisory practices , and special job knowledge , there is a constant problem of helping people to carry out what they have learned . Unless the training given is directly related to the needs of the worker and is acceptable to his boss , the chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it results in the desired changes in worker behavior on the job or when it increases his capacity and ability in some way . A supervisor must frequently reinforce a worker 's desire to use the training . He does this principally by praising him , telling and showing him how to improve his work methods , and by carefully following up without taking from the worker his responsibility for results . To maintain worker productivity the supervisor should continuously feed back to the worker information and knowledge which he can use currently for his self-development . No one can change another person . We can only change ourselves . Training is a means of creating a favorable situation for a person to introduce change in himself . It enables a supervisor to develop in workers good attitudes toward work and the organization . But to do it well a supervisor should provide in his daily operations conditions where the worker can express himself easily . By providing opportunity to accept responsibility , make decisions , and take actions , he prepares the worker for promotion .  | Thereby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to reach his total potentiality and make the most of his ability . Training helps each worker also to find his place in the company and to identify himself with its goals .  | Fairness is basic in building ' up morale and in developing an effective organization which gets the most from its members and gives them satisfaction in their jobs . Good will and good intentions , however , do not invariably lead to fairness and justice . In an organization of only four or five persons , familiarity with the important facts in each individual 's situation is comparatively easy , and fairness may be based upon individual consideration . As the size of the organization increases , the difficulties of knowing the individual situations increase very rapidly .  | With a couple of hundred persons it is hard for higher management to consider each case on its merits or to learn what those merits are . Different supervisors vary considerably in their ability to impress that management with the importance of work done by people under them . Some supervisors may have such high standards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lax that they rate poor clerks high . Generally speaking , salary rates are not set logically according to the actual service rendered , but are based on competition and custom . Naturally the amount paid by competitors for employees of a particular type is a factor which must be considered . In addition , some types of occupation are regarded more highly than others by the community , so that jobs of less intrinsic value may be rewarded better than more skilled work . A number of companies have tried to construct a logical classification of jobs , to provide , as nearly as possible , equal treatment in salary and privileges to persons doing work of equal value . Jobs are therefore arranged in groups of approximately equal difficulty or value on the basis of factors such as the mental qualities demanded , what type of decisions need to be made and how often , what contact is necessary with other employees and with the public , what financial responsibility is directly and indirectly involved , and to what extent supervisory ability is required . A satisfactory classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. A. Bills and published as an appendix to M. C. Niles , Middle Management . The Life Office Management Association has also done much interesting work on job classification . We do not quote here the details of any plans since the classification of jobs is a specialized one which in many cases is left to the personnel department . The United States civil service and many state merit systems use detailed classification plans . Classification is most valuable when the positions in many or all departments of an organization are classified . The job should be graded regardless of the capacity of the particular individual or individuals holding it . Afterwards the individual should be rated according to his performance on the particular job he has to do . Merit rating is important in directing attention in an analytical and comparative manner to the qualities and attainments of employees . Those who rate and those who use the ratings focus their thinking on points which are essential to the success of the person in his job . They see each individual 's strong and weak points . Rating is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An increase of pay  | is regarded by most employees as a definite expression of the estimate their employers make of them . Frequently , the form of rating is determined by the personnel department , which may also handle the difficult problem of putting into their proper relationships the ratings made by supervisors in different parts of the company . Some supervisors rate strictly ; others leniently . It is unfair to the good worker to rate a poor one high . Such actions tend to make the rater 's superior discount what he says about the really good workers . A number of rating scales have been tried , varying from simple to complex ones . Some attempt to rate the person on many different characteristics ; others on only two or three . Some provide for ratings as a percentage of average or a percentage of the ideal ; others compare the standing of the employee with that of others in his group . Most rating scales attempt to give some picture of the personal traits of a person as they affect his position in the company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production , although they should be considered in connection with such records . Often office work is not measured even when it could be done simply . Volume , alone , frequently is not a sufficient criterion . Quality needs to be considered along with quantity . For some jobs a person with 1 per cent errors , doing twice as much as another person with 0.1 per cent errors , may be more valuable , and in other jobs less valuable than the second person . Furthermore , even with high quantity and quality , an intangible factor such as willingness or loyalty may be lacking . Some of the better rating scales use questions and phrases of action type to describe the factors to be rated . For example , if the question is " Does he catch on easily or does he need repeated instruction ? " the answers may be subdivided to indicate : figure The supervisor can then check off the appropriate spot on the scale . Instances to support his judgment may also be called for . The selection of qualities to be rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A device for covering certain essential qualities is as follows :  | If employee falls down on one of the following qualities , please check , and give comment : Neatness in personal appearance . Neatness in work . Punctuality . Honesty . Courtesy or refinement . Tact . Cooperation with others . Knowledge of his job . Sufficient intelligence for his job . Has he an unusual degree of : Tact ? Adaptability ? Teaching ability ? Proficiency in his work ? In some companies each person is rated on his anniversary of employment or transfer . In other companies , all persons in a section are rated at the same time . Thus the contribution of each individual is evaluated in comparison with others . The rating scale is useful in dealing with transfer and promotion . When an employee shows distinct growth in successive rating periods , advancement should be sought for him . Contrariwise , when an employee shows arrested development , stimulation is needed and may be applied by talking things over , by modifying the work , by transfer , or by further training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your department , group together those whose jobs appear to you to be of about the same difficulty or value . Then rate the people in each group and arrange them within the groups according to their ratings . Then , and not till then , put their salaries next to their names . Do not be surprised if there are some inequalities but do what you can to correct them with reasonable speed and try to prevent similar inequalities from developing . You may be unable to remedy past mistakes , but you can take a part in controlling future ones .  | Plans of salary standardization are attempts to be fair about remuneration . They aim to overcome the difficulties that arise from the different habits and outlook of different supervisors and from other factors which sometimes cause one employee to be paid much more than another for substantially the same grade of work . Usually the plan of salary standardization is largely determined and applied by the personnel department . It is closely linked with job classification since the basis of most salary standardization schemes is to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The actual compensation of any individual on a job of a particular class is determined according to that person 's rating and length of service . Theoretically , no one should be paid more than the maximum set for the position . Sometimes salary standardization plans have been applied too rigidly , and the range of salary for any particular job has not been sufficiently high to provide at all fairly for the exceptionally good worker . Some excellent workers turn out two or three times the work turned out by poor workers and yet the maximum salary may be only 25 per cent above the minimum for that class of job . Of course , the better workers could hope for promotion to a higher grade job if they kept on working well and if length of service were not allowed too much weight in determining advancement . The practice of one company in having a maximum and a " high maximum " seems wise . Not over 5 per cent of the workers may get the high maximum . Some may be ready for advancement , but there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are paid as much as they would be worth to another organization . Regardless of competition , it is worthwhile to keep morale high by rewarding excellent work appropriately . Salaries up to the high maximum are allowable for these clerks without considering them exceptions to the general scheme . Promotion may be determined by length of service , by practical ability as shown by quality and quantity of work performed , by the general attitude or loyalty toward the company , or by other manifestations of superiority . It may also , unfortunately , be determined by personal likes and dislikes , by company connections , or by family relationships . Several of these factors may have weight simultaneously . Practical ability and productivity are frequently difficult to measure  | in clerical work , and often , even where they could be measured fairly well , they are not ; general attitude , sound judgment , cooperation , leadership , and loyalty are almost impossible to assess . Nevertheless , promotions should be determined largely by these factors to create the most effective organization . Promotions based on other factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and its morale . Some employees fail to secure a promotion because they lack the factors mentioned here or because there are reasons to think that they may not stay with the company for a period sufficiently long to justify training them for and introducing them on the higher job . Others miss promotion because of personal appearance or outside habits which are not approved by the management , or because of simple prejudice . Sometimes this prejudice does not exist in the minds of the superiors , but it is recognized as existing in the minds of the rank and file and it has to be considered by those responsible for the smooth running of the organization . Generally the recommendation for promotion is made by the immediate supervisor with the concurrence of his superior and , in a large company , of the personnel department which sees whether others in the company might be promoted more properly , and whether the recommendation looks sound . A policy of promotion from within the organization may increase the morale of the members of the staff , but it sometimes makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the job even if it is necessary to go outside the organization . Bringing in an outsider now and then to take a responsible position often has a very stimulating effect upon the insiders , both by making them more alert to prepare for the next promotion and by the fresh viewpoint of the outsider . The outsider , however , should have demonstrably good qualifications for the job . Considerable care should be taken in deciding whom to promote . Some persons who are excellent in a particular job may be poor in the one next above . In a large company , a clerk for some years had been doing her job far better than the previous clerks . The supervisor wished to secure an increase in pay for her , although she was already at the maximum for the class of job . The personnel department refused to grant this unless she were promoted to a position carrying a higher maximum salary . Since the next higher job involved contacts with others , the supervisor felt that the particular clerk would not be able to handle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to follow a carefully laid-down  | line of promotion , the personnel department insisted that the excellent clerk be promoted when the higher job became vacant . This was done , with the result which the supervisor feared . The clerk was not only unsatisfactory but also very unhappy . The situation was so bad that the supervisor felt that the only remedy would be to place the clerk in another company . In this instance the supervisor was not at fault , but a system was being applied too rigidly . Someone else should have been selected for promotion and an explanation given to the clerk who was in line for it . Frequently , when a person in a senior position is promoted , a number of promotions are possible so that several persons move up a little , and a new person , if needed , starts at the bottom . Making many promotions out of the necessary one often has an excellent effect upon morale , assuming that favoritism is not suspected . The supervisor should explain carefully to each person who may have expected promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of having someone advanced ahead of him may be enough to pull a person out of the rut . Care should be taken not to let a disappointment spoil his value . Properly used , a promotion can be an effective tool of personnel management in dealing both with those promoted and with those left as they were . Some junior officers were discussing a particular clerk . One of the officers said that he thought the clerk was disappointed at not having been given a salary increase and was becoming bitter . Another officer said , " Oh , the fellow was n't interested enough to see that he got a raise . " Another officer said that a clerk is often caught between the dilemma of : ( 1 ) not asking for a better position and not getting it because he is thought to be too dumb to ask for it and ( 2 ) asking for the position and not getting it because he is thought to be too grasping . During vacations or absences a person may be tried out on work to which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion gives the supervisor an opportunity to get an idea of how well the person might do . It may avoid the disappointments which sometimes come soon after a permanent promotion goes into effect . Training for promotion and transfer is just as important as training a new employee . Similar methods are applicable . The person 's interest and ambition must be aroused so that he will want to learn . When he begins on the better job , he should learn a part of it at a time . After the necessary explanation , the learner may he given the duty of going over the work after the person who is doing it has finished and before  | the checker gets it . The learner should attempt to check the work , but the supervisor should not rely upon this check . After the learner seems to understand , he should act as the doer part of the time , then full time . A simple method for transfer and promotion was devised by the head of a division of ten girls . On analyzing the work within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate clerical tasks . He listed these with four columns opposite each item , headed " Date begun , " " Date done regularly , " and " Date attained proficiency . " In a final column the date was entered when the person was entrusted with reviewing the work of others . When a new clerk came into the department , she filled in the dates herself in all the columns except that headed " Date attained proficiency , " which was filled in by the supervisor when convinced that the girl justified this rating . The girls knew what tasks they had ahead of them and took an interest in seeing how soon they could learn them all . This is a very good method for developing understudies since only part of a job is learned at a time . During an absence , the duties may be divided among the various clerks . Organizations are not static . Changes in personnel on account of old age , accident , sickness , death , and other voluntary and involuntary resignations create some of the most difficult problems of organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective organization if one could secure as detailed specifications about the capacity and durability of each person entering into it as for an alloy steel or a chemical dye . The average organization is faced continually with the risk of sudden loss of any employee , from the most important to the least . Preparedness to fill all openings as they arise with properly trained personnel is an ideal that is approached in varying degrees but seldom attained . Understudies may be trained for the various jobs except the lowest . When a senior leaves , someone is ready to succeed him . The person promoted is replaced by someone else , who has been trained as his understudy , and so on down the line until a new person is taken on for the lowest type of job in the series . Such a procedure may not always work ; for instance , it may be undesirable to start college men as office boys . Sometimes , also , an understudy can be provided only at considerable extra expense . As an example , punch card machines are rented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentals at a minimum . It may be impractical to have an extra person on the payroll and require the extra machines . When  | an understudy is not provided , a plan for securing a replacement should be ready ; for example , getting an experienced clerk on a temporary basis from the equipment company . For every important job , at least , there should be in the organization a person ready to take it over and conduct it with reasonable satisfaction . It is not necessary that each key man have just one understudy , nor that his job should fall in its entirety on some one other man . Especially in a growing organization , two or more persons may understudy a particular man , so that when he leaves or is away his work will be divided among them . The " three-position plan " of developing workers is often desirable . Under it each person is learning a job above his present one , is doing his own job , and is teaching his own job to a junior . Within a department , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be carried on reasonably well in vacation times and in periods of sickness or peak loads . One test of whether the understudy situation is satisfactory is whether the routine matters which each person normally handles get done by someone junior to him when he is away . If they are loaded upon those above him , the situation probably is not good . The supervisor should be especially careful to develop understudies ; for his own position . An incident like the following is not an unusual occurrence : The X Company decided to establish a new department . The president was discussing possible men to head it . " Mr. Astor seems to have a very good general knowledge of this business and to have a good personality . How would he be for the job ? " asked the consultant who had suggested the department . " Fine , " said the president , " but we ca n't use him there . He has n't developed anyone to take his place . " " How about Mr. Dodge ? He also seems good for this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , as good as Astor , but we ca n't give him the job either because his assistant is not yet ready to take his place . What do you think of Mr. Lay ? " said the president . " Well , since I have n't seen so much of his work , I may be wrong , but I think that he would not be so effective as Astor or Dodge . " " I agree with you . However , he has developed Miss Emory so she can take over his work and do it just as well as he does ? or maybe a little better . I think we had better give the promotion to Lay , even though he wo n't do as good a job on it as Astor or Dodge . Moving Lay up wo n't  | disturb the organization , even though it may disappoint Astor and Dodge . I 'm in favor of promoting them just as soon as they develop someone who can take their jobs . " Lay got the advancement . A distinction may be drawn between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence , and to replace him if need be , and delegation to an individual who will definitely take responsibility for the continued performance of tasks formerly done by his superior . Often it is hard to get an assistant to assume responsibility . He will make his decisions with more care if he knows he will be backed up in them . A man who came to a company as vice president said to his assistant who had been with the organization a number of years : " Mr. Edwards , you have been coming to me with a lot of questions . I have asked you each time what you thought should be done before I gave you my opinion . I have been keeping a record of your questions and our action . You have asked my advice on 117 matters in a short time . In all but one of the cases I would have handled the matter just the way you suggested . In other words , we agreed upon how to handle over 99 per cent of the cases without even discussing them . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind on these things and act accordingly . Do n't ask me about them unless they are particularly important , or unless you want my advice because you have some real doubts about action . I will take the chance on the 1 per cent of the cases where you may not act as I would . " Mr. Edwards was convinced that his judgment was similar to that of his chief , and he assumed the responsibility for many matters which had taken up the time of previous vice presidents . Many executives find that the problem of building an organization is their most important one . A person with technical skill and individual excellence is easier to find than a man who can develop others and delegate work in such a manner that it is well done and that he himself is freed for broader duties . A frequently underemphasized area of personnel work is the transfer of persons from one job and from one department to another . Not everybody can be promoted , but almost everybody can continue to grow in competence and knowledge . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisor has as one of his most important responsibilities the growth of employees and the maintenance of their flexibility . The authors stress in this book that employees should be given an opportunity , if they want it , to broaden their responsibilities even within the same unit . Usually it is possible for the work to be rearranged so that they can progressively learn to handle more tasks . Most of what is said about transfer applies to movement of employees from one supervisor to another without any promotion or demotion . There are many valid reasons for transfer , namely , to : Prepare the employee for promotion through enlarging his knowledge of the company and increasing his competence through broader experience . Build a versatile work force . Gratify the ambition of an employee to try work of another kind . Take him out of a blind-alley position and place him in one where there are chances of promotion . Save the adaptive powers of workers before they get into a rut . Give the employee a change because his work has become monotonous ( even on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from placing his attention on a new set of problems ) . Adjust work of employee for health reasons . Adjust personal relationships when there has been a lack of harmony . Correct an erroneous placement . Meet an increase of work in one department or a decrease in another . Adjust to reorganization of function or activity . Adjust to obsolescence in a certain type of work . Two sad groups may be found in almost all companies . Some workers have become stale through monotony or lack of opportunity . Others have become too set to readjust to changed conditions , although their work would have remained satisfactory indefinitely had not the system or the personnel around them changed . The problems involved are partly psychological , partly technical . They can be solved only by foresight and constant attention to the position each worker holds at each stage in his career . The advent of a new calculating , addressing , or automatic office machine may disrupt the work of a number of people . The change in type of leadership in a department or division may upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods used may be equally suitable . Business , like life , is fluid and everchanging , but it does not change at a uniform rate . If the management wishes to retain the elasticity of youth in its stable  | workers , it must furnish enough variety and novelty to prevent them from becoming incapacitated for new experience . This is particularly important as the size of the organization increases . The rapid development of automation in the office is new cause for emphasizing this point . When a worker is transferred to another department , if he is better than average , objections may arise from the losing supervisor ; if below average , from the gainer . Often the average person is not transferred at all . The unsatisfactory workers are likely to be transferred most frequently . Sometimes many of them land in one department with a supervisor who easily gives in to pressure to take a poor worker . He may yield because he is weak or because he puts the interests of the organization ahead of his personal convenience ? a fact which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The misfits from the other departments of the company were sent to Mr. Clark , the head of a department doing mainly simple filing . He accepted those who were sent to him , without making any inquiries as to why they had been sent , and he tried to rebuild their morale . When the clerk first reported to him , Mr. Clark would say : " You have been told to report to me this morning . Now I do n't know whether your work was good , bad , or indifferent where you were , but here you start off new . You have been sent to me because the personnel department thought you could do this work . Now it is up to you . We are a happy department , and we are glad to have you . There is room to rise here . We have to have quick and accurate work to serve other departments . There is important work to do here , and all the time they are taking the good people away from me to advance into other departments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark found that he sometimes got satisfactory work from people who had never done it before . " Sometimes I get a break through other people 's mistakes , " he said . " For instance , Miss James is fine . I ca n't imagine why they sent her to me ? but some people just do n't know how to supervise . However , I had to let Miss Nottingham go . She talked all the time , was lazy , and would not cooperate . I do n't think it has hurt the others , though of course when they come here they are afraid they are on their way out . " An effective personnel department may frequently suggest transfers in a large organization , some of which will help the supervisors immediately , whereas others will be a handicap . However , the policy of frequent transfer , including good and average clerks , has many advantages to the organization as a whole , and in the long run will make the supervisors ' jobs easier to perform well .  | A group of supervisors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction to transfer . The fact that the company is not expanding as much as it did may create a problem for trained men who are able to handle better work , but for whom no promotion is available . Various methods of meeting this were suggested , among them the possibility of transfer of such persons to other work in the same or in another department . The reluctance of the supervisors to give up a good man might be partially overcome if they were sure of getting another good man in return . One of the members of the group said that the energy of trained persons should be used to solve problems , either on their immediate jobs or in another department . They are quite likely to suggest improvements when they are transferred to other work , because they bring a fresh point of view with them . Their suggestions should be encouraged , even when they arise from lack of understanding . Too often clerks do not question procedures on a new job because they think they will catch on to the reason . Later they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first appeared unnecessary . Although it is the policy to shift new clerks around the company for training before placing them permanently in a department , someone suggested that the contrary policy of transferring senior men would develop persons more able to benefit the company . A combination of the two ideas may be even more valuable ; that is , a groundwork may be obtained by the shifting of juniors , and then a later transfer made to broaden the point of view . Thus the good men in a large company would receive advantages which accrue naturally in a small organization . One of the officers of the company had had a policy of shifting the clerks around as soon as he got everything running smoothly . He wanted to be prepared for emergencies and to have the clerks familiar with many jobs . Every time a qualified office worker leaves a company it costs a substantial sum to replace him . Even a minimum figure of the cost is $300 and not uncommonly it is closer to $1500 counting the necessary interviewing , hiring , placing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizable investment which the company has made in his placement and training . Yet many times good employees leave who would probably remain if the conditions were more satisfying to them . A study by the American Management Association in 1955 showed that 20 per cent of office clerical personnel turnover was caused by poor selection and initial placement . Improper hiring standards were  | used . Skills of the workers were not fully employed and there was general dissatisfaction with the caliber of supervision . It is well known that turnover is heaviest during the first six months on the job . A supervisor can save trouble for himself and money for the company by hiring only those persons who appear to be good risks for the jobs available and by taking care to see that the people he does hire are fitted in to the advantage of themselves and of the office . Some of the causes of quits can not be controlled ? death , retirement , transfer of the head of the family to another town , leaving to have a family . Many other causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to restlessness . These fall to a low point when the supervisor makes work interesting , pays attention to the needs of workers for recognition , cultivates a team with a sense of worthwhileness in their work , and aids workers in securing training and experience which add to their chances of promotion . The employee who is helped to grow may not remain in the supervisor 's unit but often retains a permanent loyalty to the company . Even though turnover is costly , it is still more costly to retain people who are not effectively contributing to the department . Discharges are of three general types : layoffs , dismissals for incompetence , and dismissals for improper behavior . In practically any case of dismissal the supervisor is expected to discuss the situation in advance with the personnel office and with his own superior . It is usually harder to fire an individual than it is to hire him because of the obligation of the company to treat its employees fairly and because of the impact on employees , or employee organizations , and on the public of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on discharges are followed , at least . He may normally refuse to keep an individual in his unit . Sometimes , however , the individual may be placed elsewhere in the company . Thus the supervisor maintains his own responsibility for the work committed to him , but the company maintains a common treatment of employees across all organizational lines . Layoffs among clerical workers are less common than among bluecollar workers . Traditionally , clerical people have expected continuity of employment . Their ties with management are frequently closer . Layoffs are therefore seldom made , even when work drops off , without careful consideration by management . When they are necessary , those with the shortest service are usually released first . However , the  | layoff may occur after a period of clerical shortage during which workers with low ratings were kept because of difficulty in securing replacements . In such an instance the least satisfactory might be released . When it is possible to reduce the number of jobs through better machines or methods , many clerical organizations either knowingly keep more employees than are needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of employees or other work opens up for them . Many companies pride themselves on keeping their long-service employees and in helping any surplus employees to find positions elsewhere . Many management officials have stressed that employees have little or nothing to fear from office automation . One reason is that it normally takes a couple of years to plan the system and to get delivery of an electronic computer . Then the actual installation usually requires considerable manpower because of overlapping of the old and new systems . It is therefore common for managements to announce that all employees rendered excess will be placed in other positions in the same or another organization . This policy recognizes management 's social obligation as well as the effect of security on the morale of members of the organization . The commonest type of dismissal is that of new employees who do not measure up to expectations . Even though employees have been selected and trained with care , some mistakes are bound to occur . Those who are not satisfactory should be weeded out in the early months of employment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage you may want to give the employee the benefit of the doubt . Remember , however , that it is kinder to drop him soon rather than late . The longer a satisfactory adjustment is postponed , the worse for the individual and for the company . A prospective employer does not regard seriously an unsatisfactory record of a few months but inquires carefully into the cause of leaving after a stay of several years . Quite often the employee is not satisfied , but he hesitates to take the positive step of hunting for a new job . He may even hope he will be discharged , since he could then blame someone else for the need of making a new adjustment . A particular person may be a misfit because of individual reactions which would be quite different in another environment . Perhaps you and he do not mix well . That need not reflect on either party . Or he may not get along well with other clerks because he is too young , or too intelligent , or too stupid , or because he holds strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reasons which have nothing to do with his efficiency . If a person with an active temperament and good mental  | capacities is put on work requiring little use of his faculties , he is likely to be dissatisfied . He may leave the organization voluntarily , or he may try to get an outlet for his ability and some satisfaction for his desire for action by seeing how much fun or trouble he can stir up . One of the most capable women the authors know was once discharged for misconduct by a large organization which gave her a routine job that did not interest her . As we recall it , throwing spit balls and pinning impertinent notes on the back of her supervisor were the immediate causes of her dismissal . She later held a very responsible position . When you are faced with an unsatisfactory employee with considerable service with the company , you should of course analyze the situation carefully to see what more you could do to turn the situation into a satisfactory one . As someone has said , " Do n't fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person who does not perform up to standard is a drain on the unit and most likely weakens morale . This is especially so if he does not appear to be trying or if he is considerably under par . People feel foolish to work hard for little or no more reward than is given to an unsatisfactory person . Analyze the situation carefully , then talk with the people in the personnel office . Perhaps they can place him to good advantage . If not , then you have to decide whether you think you should terminate the relationship . An officer mentioned that a certain supervisor lacked judgment in dealing with people , but that when one talked with him he often seemed to be very good . " You know , he 's something like a gear with 60 teeth ? 58 of them mesh accurately and smoothly but the other 2 are bent , and you ca n't get a good running machine with a gear like that . " Eventually he was dismissed . Before taking action , you will wish to consider the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is measured and the output of each worker is posted , the transfer or discharge of a worker with a very poor record is usually regarded as entirely fair and demands no special comment . The following instance shows some of the morale difficulties of discharging a man for cause . Mr. Case was fairly well up in the organization . He appeared to be doing good work although he did not mix well with certain other persons and it was an open secret that he got along poorly with the boss .  | One day the boss learned that certain hints of improper conduct with the customers of the concern were well founded . If contacts with the customers were denied , there would be no job left for Mr. Case . His resignation was requested , on the ground that his personal morals were unacceptable to the organization 's customers . The boss was kindhearted and kept confidential the cause of the discharge , merely announcing that Mr. Case was leaving on a certain date . Mr. Case took advantage of the situation and told his friends in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to his resignation . Two of his friends , who did not know the real truth , were so incensed by Mr. Case 's story that they considered resigning and hunting for jobs in a fairer organization , or at least in one where there was " less hypocrisy about fairness . " After some weeks of growing discontent in the organization , the boss finally realized that Mr. Case was not playing fair . He then told some of the key men the whole story . This cleared up the situation quickly , but it never restored the lost production of the weeks of discontent . Fairness alone may not be enough to maintain morale . Although in the above incident the boss was not only fair but even generous , people knowing only that the boss and Mr. Case did not get along well together readily accepted the story of discrimination . It would have been better to discuss the matter with some of the influential colleagues , saying perhaps that the reason was more than sufficient to warrant the discharge , but that it would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect a discharge may indirectly have on the public must also be considered . The dismissal may be so tactfully conducted that the clerk feels the organization is fine and has done the fairest thing in suggesting he look elsewhere for work . On the other hand , he may bear a grudge which will influence his friends against the company . Sometimes he has a real or fancied grievance which , if talked out , will not be likely to develop into a story of injustice . Putting a thing into words usually defines it in one 's own mind . Often a person finds that he has nothing of real importance as a basis for his imagined grievance . If the grievance is real and is clearly expressed , a skillful listener can ask questions which will help the situation . He may inquire how such a circumstance could arise . If the employee has no suggestions , several ways may be suggested , some of which reflect upon the man blamed and others which leave him guiltless . The interviewer does not need to express his own belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities that may have brought about the situation . They can draw their own conclusions .  | A junior officer was told that he could no longer try to improve the work of a checker , Mr. Clough , but that he would have to dismiss him for inaccuracy . Mr. Clough had been with the company for seven years . The officer realized that the company 's decision would be a blow to Clough and that it might hurt the morale of the department in which he worked . He therefore devoted time to learning from Clough 's present and past supervisors about his family and his situation outside of business . When he called Clough to his office he said : " It hurts me to tell you your services are unsatisfactory , Clough . I know what a fine family yours is , and that you have worked faithfully here . I know this will disappoint your father , who is a vestryman in the same church as my friend , Mr. Hague . It seems to me you are n't cut out for office work . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work would make you satisfactory . But this seems to be the wrong thing for you . " Have you thought of some outdoor work which would be more congenial ? I hear your uncle is an engineer . Could n't he give you a place with him where there would really be a future for you ? I am convinced you can make good in the right situation , and greatly regret we can not fit you in here . " The young man took the blow of dismissal in good part , and left with genuine hope of making good elsewhere . Just before a worker leaves , either voluntarily or involuntarily , he feels free of many of the inhibitions which may have prevented him from expressing himself fully about his job . Therefore an " exit interview " is part of the personnel procedure of some organizations . This is a private and sometimes confidential interview between the employee and one other person ? his supervisor or his supervisor 's superior or a representative of the personnel department . At times two or more persons may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about his experiences with the company and to offer any suggestions in regard to the way the company treats its staff . In the course of the exit interview , it may be desirable to express interest in the employee 's future and to help him get placed satisfactorily elsewhere .  | The supervisor 's chief functions as leader are to develop the individuals under him and to integrate them into a cooperative team . To accomplish these ends , he must feel the right way , know the proper technique , and act in the appropriate manner . A great deal can he learned by observing the good and the had supervision exercised by  | others and by analyzing why certain conduct seems to affect one 's self and others favorably or the reverse . One may not be able to equal the best he sees , but he can avoid some of the pitfalls into which he sees others falling . High morale is one of the essentials for effectiveness in the office or in any organization . In the army , good morale is considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of any organization in which the thought and feelings of the men could be more completely ignored than in the army ? if it paid ? The Chief of Staff of the United States Army had this to say : The military effectiveness of an army is equal to the product of its physical attributes , including strength , skill , equipment , and organization , multiplied by the intangible factor of morale . A unit with high morale will often accomplish the seemingly impossible , but when this all-important factor approaches zero there invariably result inefficiency , failure , and finally disintegration . The unfailing formula for production of morale is patriotism , self-respect , discipline , and self-confidence within a military unit , joined with fair treatment and merited appreciation from without . It can not be produced by pampering or coddling an army , and is not necessarily destroyed by hardship , danger , or even calamity . Though it can survive and develop in adversity that comes as an inescapable incident of service , it will quickly wither and die if soldiers come to believe themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their government , or of ignorance , personal ambition , or ineptitude on the part of their military leaders . Good morale is based upon a feeling of having an essential part , although perhaps a small one , in a worthwhile organization . A person should feel competent to fill his part , which may require education and training . He should also feel that his superior is willing and able to help him and has his true interests at heart . Before real cooperation can be obtained , the individual must be interested in the work of the group , in the work of the company , and in the part he himself plays . The forces leading people to work throw some light upon how their interest may be aroused and also upon why some persons work without any real interest in what they are doing . People undertake jobs for a variety of reasons , and they work with a will for a still larger variety . Some of the reasons commonly effective are :  | 1 . They wish to earn money for common necessities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . Once on a job , they want more money to " get ahead in the world , " to provide further comforts and conveniences for themselves and their dependents , educational facilities for their children , a good car , better housing , and so forth . Girls who once would have stayed at home want money of their own , sometimes for personal adornment and luxury , sometimes for independence , and sometimes to get ahead . 2 . They desire economic security for the future , in illness or old age . 3 . Many take jobs to fill their time or use their energies . Frequently girls work between school and marriage for these reasons . They may wish to get away from home or they may be bored or restless . 4 . Others work because it is " the thing to do , " even though they do not need money and are not ambitious . Social pressure , or the opinions of their friends , may make having no job less tolerable than working . Some persons have never considered the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a disreputable one ( if they have not ) . 5 . Some work because they feel a social obligation to be useful and to do their share of the world 's work . Once on the job , they wish to feel its usefulness . 6 . People are driven by a creative urge to do something worthwhile . Some writers call this the " instinct of workmanship . " 7 . Some have a desire for power and work to attain a position of authority . They like to direct others . Some merely like to have a sense of personal prowess . The supervisor should use this motive with discretion . 8 . Almost everyone has a wish for approval or recognition . This motive is a powerful ally of the supervisor . 9 . Many persons wish to be part of a social group and to do their share in it . This wish is a basis for teamwork . Most people tend to conform to group pressure . A few tend to resist it . 10 . Some wish to excel those about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 . People are loyal to their group or their leader , even when they are not interested in the immediate task , just as a mother does unpleasant chores for the sake of her children . This loyalty is the fine flower of cooperation and mutual confidence . 12 . People become interested in their immediate task or in the end in view .  | Fear may drive persons to action , but usually it is a negative motive . In animals , we see that the effects of fear are running away , fighting , and playing dead . The effect on human beings is more subtle . Fear is the great inhibitor and often causes permanent damage to the personality . It should not be used as a tool in the office . To be sure , people may work hard under the fear of discharge or of displeasure , but far more effective is the will to do things for some positive end . As Schell says , " One measure of executive success is the ability to get employees to work with a will . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the individual so that he faces his work with a self-inspired eagerness . " ( Technique of Executive Control , page 74 . ) Appeal should be made to the positive motives in attempting to build up interest and teamwork . The wish to make money and the fear of losing a job are reinforced by other desires often far more potent . The importance of financial incentives has probably been overrated in the past . However , so much emphasis has been placed upon salary that praise will seem insincere if frequently given unless it is followed up , without too great a delay , by a financial reward , or unless the employee has been given some good reason for lack of such action . Since the motives mentioned early in the list are satisfied by almost any job , once a job has been obtained they are not likely to have much effect in getting the individual to work harder than is necessary to avoid being dismissed . The motives in the latter part of the list must be called into play to secure real effectiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well illustrated by an often-quoted story : There were three men cutting stone ? stonecutters ? working inside of an inclosure , and back of them , up on a little eminence , there was a cathedral , about three-fourths completed . A stranger came along and said to the first man , " My friend , what are you doing ? " " Me ? What am I doing ? I am working for eight dollars a day . " He went along to the next man and he said , " My friend , what are you doing ? " " Me ? What am I doing ? I am squaring this stone . See ? I have got to make it just like this ; see , right there . I have to make it absolutely straight , an absolutely straight edge right down there , on that part of the corner , and square it right off here . Look , I 'll put the straight edge on it for you . Is n't that a perfect edge ! You see this little niche that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fellow working down there is cutting a niche just like this , only the other way . His fits right into mine . If we get them just right , they lock together  | tight , and they are just as solid as if it was one stone . " The stranger walked along to the next man and said , " What are you doing , my friend ? " " Me ? What am I doing ? You see that cathedral up there ? I am helping to build that . Is n't it great ! Is n't it grand ! " E. K. Hall , " A Plea for the Man in the Ranks , " Personnel , November 1931 , page 56 . What people want in work varies considerably with their education , age , sex , personalities , and interests . It is obvious , for example , that people 's attitudes are different at 20 than at 50 , and whether single or married . Sometimes what supervisors believe workers want and what they actually want are not the same . Supervisors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them more effectively . A couple of studies show attitudes in specific examples . In 1945 to 1947 the Minneapolis Gas Company studied what applicants wanted in a job . Among 472 applicants for clerical positions , 259 were men and 212 were women . figure A broader study of applicants for all types of positions , not merely clerical , showed that the primary consideration for the men covered was security ? steady work and no lay-offs . For the women in the sample , on the other hand , type of work came first , then security , followed by advancement , hours , and type of coworkers . In general , the more education the person had , the less he gave priority to the security of the job .  | A survey was conducted among employees of General Electric as to what they liked and what they did not like about their work . Out of the study emerged certain qualities that an employee wants to find in his position with General Electric . The order of importance varies with each individual and with the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job , or a sense of belonging . Important and significant work , or a sense of purpose . Full information . Good pay and other material benefits . Good working conditions . Good managers . Steady work . A fair chance to get ahead . Respectful treatment . Each of these categories presents almost endless opportunities to the manager who recognizes that human resources are ultimately the resources that count most deeply in an enterprise . . . . The achievement of such powerful human motivations and satisfactions throughout the entire organization starts with the philosophy of management : the decentralized philosophy that recognizes the dignity and capacity of each individual . It is implemented in the structuring of the organization , and of each position in the organization , so that each position has its own responsibility and authority . It is implemented in the climate which prevails ? and that is deliberately created ? in each organizational component , and in each man-to-manager relationship . It is implemented in the ethical behavior , and therefore in the ethical beliefs , that guide a company in its work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Frontiers for Professional Managers , copyright McGrawHill Book Company 1956 , pages 106-107 . First-line supervisors meeting in a conference were asked how they created subordinates ' interest in work . They suggested that the supervisor may : Show the relation of specific work to the whole . Make work as creative as you can . Be considerate in all that is done . Secure social recognition for work well done and give publicity to outstanding achievement .  | Appeal to pride in workmanship . Involve each person 's feelings and concern . In talking with employee refer to " your job , " " your paper , " etc . Make the group socially significant by referring to " our team , " " our group , " " our unit , " " our company . " Make work active , living , vital , and important to success of the group . Substitute the machine for distasteful routine tasks . Remove monotony and repetition whenever possible . Study all jobs that appear to lack promise for individual happiness , make them as personally rewarding and creative as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees ' viewpoint . Study the jobs where high turnover occurs to see if lack of interesting work is the cause . Tie together several monotonous repetitive tasks to create variety . Review jobs and redesign them to create interesting work or group effort . Each work group , department , company , or government bureau has its own climate . You as a supervisor do not create this climate singlehanded , but you do have a great deal to do with the climate of those who work for and with you . Much depends on you whether the work place provides challenging and satisfying experiences or a situation of drudgery to be endured until a better job is found . The climate of the work place is made up of the feelings and beliefs , attitudes , behavior , and temperaments of all the persons concerned . Their relations to one another make up the human relations of the group . To the sum total of these individual characteristics and relations are added also the formal policies , procedures , rules and codes of conduct of the particular business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate which is warm and friendly , with respect for each person 's rights and human dignity . Or it can be unpleasant , filled with fear and suspicion and with lack of consideration for the individual . The climate can be pleasant and yet not effective in meeting the organization 's goals ; or it can be unpleasant and still not be effective . The ideal is when it is both effective and pleasant . The chances are , in those circumstances , that not only is the output of goods or services satisfactory but also the human growth and happiness . We can describe with some confidence the kind of situation where a work group or a cluster of work groups or a whole company meets the conditions of good human relations and sound and effective organization and work methods .  | 1 . Each individual should understand what his work is and how it fits into company objectives . This point was discussed in connection with the work group in Chapter 4 . We say that the objective of a business is to make a profit . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other company goals are real , too , and usually more meaningful to the employee ? to make a good product or provide a useful service , to provide good employment , to develop a superior institution , and so forth . Each subdivision of the enterprise has a more specific objective . This should be made real to the employee and should be related for him with the broader company objectives . Satisfying his own needs and attaining his personal goals need to be tied into the goals of the work group and the organization . 2 . Much satisfaction comes from the work itself , from the pride of workmanship of individuals and of groups . To achieve this satisfaction , an employee should be placed in work for which he is at least moderately well-suited and which he enjoys to a reasonable degree . 3 . Setting standards of good work is an encouragement to individual and group performance . A person likes to know what a good job is and whether he does his job well . On most kinds of work he should be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of performance . " You do n't play tennis without a score . " Records of what an individual produces or accomplishes are often stimulating . Some are interested in making a good record ; others work in order to show that they deserve more salary ; others , in order not to let " a dumbbell like Miss Brown " beat them ; others , in order not to show up worst ; and so forth . When it is not practicable to measure the work of each individual , people 's interest in the group record can be built . This can be accomplished by making each feel that he is doing an essential part of the group 's work and that the measure of the group 's success is partly his own . People like to see results . Demonstrating the results of the work in true stories of human interest helps too . A statement which is uninteresting in its details to the clerks preparing it may serve as an incentive to group action if the team becomes interested in having it complete for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they find that the figures are seldom used , however , they will not work with the same will . When an objective for group effort is carefully set , and pride in attaining it aroused , the group will use pressure to secure the cooperation even of laggards . Just as an individual works harder when his pride is aroused , a group works with a will when it is proud of a departmental record . 4 . Good work should be recognized and rewarded , but work less than good should be adjusted and not overlooked . It may destroy the will  | to work of those who get excellent results in quality and quantity of work if they get no more praise or pay than persons who turn out mediocre work . 5 . Interest in work develops gradually and should be cultivated . When a new employee begins work , usually he will not be particularly interested in his junior job , but he may be enthusiastic about starting in , about earning money , about fitting himself into an organization , and about other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his particular phase of the work will generally be lacking , for he usually will not know what his exact job will be until after he has begun on it . Interest usually develops , if at all , after the worker has settled into his place . Since an employee can hardly be interested in what he does not understand , the supervisor should take pains to teach each person the reasons for what he does and how his work ties in with the rest of the organization . It is particularly painful to bright workers to perform steps apparently unnecessary , and yet supervisors often do not encourage questions which would clear up reasons for doing things . A shifting of emphasis from one part of the work to another will maintain interest . Too great concentration on one aspect causes interest to wane . An occasional change of emphasis from the volume of work , to the accuracy with which it is done , or to the speed of completion , or to the cost of doing it will help hold interest . The different ways in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know when he actually has aroused the interest of some workers . Some lack self-confidence and are afraid to take any responsibility . Often others appear to lack interest . If they are given some small special jobs which they can do well , their sense of achievement may lead them to attempt other and more difficult work . Sometimes a worker appears " offish " ? that is , he attends so strictly to his own business that he pays little attention to those around him . His reactions will need to be studied carefully . Perhaps he can be made gradually to take an interest in the department as a whole if his advice is asked about some of the problems of operation which come up . This is especially true if he is an older employee . 6 . Work becomes meaningful when accepted as part of one 's own life , when it is " my work " or " our work . " How otherwise is it possible for a doctor or other person to endure hardship , suffer physical injury , and undergo danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work ? Some psychologists call this " involvement of the ego . " An unpleasant component of the work is accepted , and a worthwhileness and satisfaction come from the doing of the task .  | Two paragraphs from a memorandum prepared by the supervisor of a well-run mechanical duplicating department summarize how he had succeeded in building excellent morale . " It is a gratifying symptom to hear a girl say ' my ' machine can do this , or ' my ' machine can do that . A machine is more than a bunch of wheels . It should seem to have definite characteristics . All machines are different , even cars of the same model . It is possible to foster interest in any apparatus and it is a necessary step in the training of an operator . " There are two ways of placing a big batch of work before an operator . The first way is to throw it at her ( figuratively speaking , of course ) . It will surely land as a millstone about his or her neck , with bad results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm . It is a compliment for any overseer to have a big task placed before him . If he were not capable of handling it , it would not be there . After all it is some person 's measure of his capabilities . The processes of passing along this idea are many . One method ? to the operator goes the work , with a few remarks and a little discussion on how to tackle it . A concluding remark might be , ' Well , it 's a big job , and it will sure keep you going . ' There is usually a healthy response such as ' Oh , I did more than that such and such a time . ' The stage is all set for results , the operator proves the point , does something hard , it is appreciated . This is the ' soil ' in which energy is let loose , quality work is done , and enthusiasm generated for more . " The supervisor , if he is to develop in each worker this attitude , must understand that person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dislikes . What is one man 's meat may be another man 's poison . Each individual 's need for recognition , belonging , and security should be met to the degree possible . Fortunately the supervisor is not the only one to build up feelings of belonging , for in a well-knit group most members cooperate with other members . The supervisor , however , must be particularly perceptive in avoiding those actions which may break down good group feelings . He can also do a large amount to build a sense of security and to give that recognition which almost everybody craves. 7 . The individual should have room to make judgments , choices , and adjustments concerning his work . Naturally this freedom must vary with the job . Where each person does only a small portion of an interconnected operation , he has little latitude . We really can not expect much from a human robot ? usually less than from a mechanical one , for feelings are apt to get in the way . A person doing a small task on an assembly line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor substitute for a machine . The essence of a human being is his capacity  | to think and to exercise skill . A job which does not call on these abilities should be either further mechanized or humanized . When work is so arranged that his mental faculties are called upon and when he can vary it and adjust it himself , he naturally feels a greater sense of responsibility and contributes more thought and care . It is hard to have much feeling of satisfaction in a job if we can not work out anything for ourselves . " Why did you resign ? " the personnel officer asked a competent stenographer . " You like the company , the pay is good , and working conditions are pleasant . " " True , but that supervisor was always looking at the back of my neck , " said she . " He never really let me do anything on my own . No sooner did he give me instructions than he was out looking over my shoulder to see if I was doing what he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the supervisor are important to an effective relationship . Confidence is based on the fairness and justice of the supervisor . It is not enough for him to mean to be fair ; he must be fair in appearance as well as in intention . This involves a sense of perspective , not making a big fuss over a little thing and later allowing a big failure to go by with little attention ; a genuine interest in those under him ; time spent in helping each to develop ; and directing the work of the department effectively , clearly , and consistently . Try to put yourself in the other fellow 's place and imagine how your acts would affect you . Keep on imagining the situation and make allowances for differences between yourself and him . Do not do this just once , but try it from time to time , especially before you take any drastic actions . Remember that comparatively few people are dominated by reason . Emotion plays an important part in almost all of us . Truthfulness , sincerity , and tact are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the result of broadening the interest of the individual to include the whole group . Thus he contributes to the group and it reinforces him . If each member of your staff is interested in his own work , you have laid a solid basis for teamwork , yet unless you have actually achieved cooperation , one of the mainsprings of action will not be touched . Integrating your group into an effective whole is the test of your leadership . To paraphrase Ordway Tead , a good leader gets things done chiefly because through his influence people become willing to do them . He releases energy , achieves teamwork , builds enthusiasm ; in other words , he creates power for the organization ,  | A team implies that a number of persons are working together to achieve a common aim . Various persons specialize in particular aspects , but all must cooperate to make the play effective . Each person should know what he and each of his teammates are supposed to do , and the progress of each toward the goal . Cooperation can not be effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is to be done and how to do it . Teamwork is hard to achieve when employees do not see the object of their task or when they notice that others are not cooperating . Sir Norman Angell told this story from the vineyard districts of France : " The parishioners of a certain priest decided to make him a present of a barrel of wine , and each was to contribute a bottle to the common barrel . This was done on a certain Sunday , and it was observed that the parishioners were a little secretive in the way in which they brought in their bottles . When the priest went forward and turned on the tap , out of the barrel came pure water . In the subsequent explanations it was discovered that nobody was to blame , because , said each parishioner , if only the others had done their duty , my little lot would never have been missed . " Teamwork does not imply that each person should try to help the others at all times by volunteering information or aid when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help everyone that she gets the reputation of butting in on the business of others . The supervisor then needs to correct the situation without hurting the basic desire to be helpful . A girl in a small office had the reputation of being a busybody . Her supervisor believed that this criticism was unfounded , but explained to the girl that in order to change the opinion of those in the office she must be very careful not to give information unless definitely asked , and to pay attention to her work only . Even though a word from her would prevent a mistake from being made by others who were misinformed on certain matters , she should let them make the error unless they asked her . After a few months the general opinion of her changed completely and she got along well with the other clerks .  | Teamwork springs from satisfying relationships on the job ? in the daily associations with coworkers and the boss . If these relationships arc pleasant , cooperation is smooth , it is easy to get out the work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups emerges " company spirit . " Company loyalty is thus fashioned out of daily as- sociations . In a situation of high morale , almost everyone feels and accepts the worth and value of the organization , and the chances are that production is good too . The feelings and sentiments the employee has toward his work group seem to us to determine his major attitude toward the company . Some few people have dedicated themselves to a cause and work hard even if conditions of work are disagreeable . Most of us , however , seek not only to meet our economic needs through work but also to satisfy many of our psychological and social needs through associations with our working companions . Recognition that this is so has changed the ideas of many people about supervision and management . People used to think of the " economic man " who balanced off all his needs to the degree that he would stop working when his demand for a given amount of money was satisfied . It hardly sounds reasonable , though , that young workers exert themselves harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that they will get out this week 's work better if they have the promise of sick benefits or vacation benefits for a given number of weeks . Douglas McGregor of M.I.T. , however , has pointed out the irony of expecting employees to work hard now for the sake of rewards off the job ? retirement , sickness benefits , paid vacations , unemployment compensation , or severance pay . Even pay is spent off the job . These economic considerations are important to induce people to start work or to continue with a certain employer . They probably have relatively little to do with production above the minimum necessary . For example , double pay on Sunday may be an important inducement to a number of persons . This and other financial and fringe benefits , however , probably do not have much effect on the quality and quantity of work done or on the spirit in which it is performed . Presumably they do not curb the impulse to talk now about the World Series rather than get the work out . The expectations of co-workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the amount of production turned out . 10 . Good communication is basic to good relationships between the individual and his group and between the work group and the larger organization . Communication is affected by feelings , sentiments , and attitudes , and by the angle of vision too . Your own angle of vision as a supervisor differs from that of your employees or of your own superior or of the methods man or other technical specialist you deal with . The chances are that you and your employees do not feel or see the same way about a particular job or about the company as a whole . The difference in viewpoint multiplies the chance of error when you try to interpret employee feelings and attitudes . You should bear this in mind continually . For example , surveys of morale show that supervisors be- lieve morale to be better than employees say it is in their responses . Nancy C. Morse found in one study that only one supervisor thought morale was poor when almost all employees thought so . Supervisors also differ from employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other matters may be quite acceptable to the supervisor but annoying to employees . Supervisors , Nancy Morse found in her study , liked the security which the company afforded them and appreciated the benefits provided . But employees placed chief values on hours of work and on the kind of people with whom they worked . A study by Glen D. Mellinger of the attitudes of 330 scientists at the National Institutes of Health shows some interesting data . If the individual believes that someone else has confidence in him , he is more likely to be accurate in estimating that person 's opinion . But when another person 's confidence in him is thought to be low , the individual has difficulty in estimating the other 's opinion of him . This is particularly true when he thinks that the boss does not have confidence in him ; it is then hard for him to estimate the boss 's opinion and he is likely not to be frank in expressing his views . The superior therefore is unlikely to judge correctly how the employee feels . When confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both share the same opinions . When people like one another , it is hard for them to believe that there is disagreement between them . An individual who has only mild liking for someone is usually more accurate in perceiving the other 's opinion than if he has strong liking . Apparently we expect our friends to agree with us and have confidence in us . But if we do not have a liking for someone or lack confidence in him , then we expect disagreement . Dr. Lillian M. Gilbreth , world-renowned management engineer , pointed out to the authors that in her opinion children usually learn to love other members of their families but are not taught to like them . She thought we should encourage people to look for the likable characteristics in others and emphasize our liking for these features . Thus even if we get irritated with someone we can learn to enlarge the area of liking . Is n't this important in office situations ? If we learn to like a person , we begin to have confidence in him . You can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like your subordinates and develop confidence in them . Thus they acquire a sufficient sense of security to tell you what they are thinking and they can listen with greater attention to what you say . II . A genuine sense of participation is a foundation stone of good  | morale . When employees take part in decisions affecting them , they usually have higher performance than otherwise . They are stimulated to do their part when they have a voice in determining their work assignments , plans , schedules , and changes , when they have a chance to talk out their troubles , and when their suggestions and ideas are listened to and often accepted . In this type of atmosphere , constructive change is easy and suggestions are freely generated and tried out . To scold at and torment all your servants appears , at first sight , to be the desirable thing ; but those who study the best method of this amusing art , will tell you , that it is much better to select out one or two , at the most , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel your strokes ; for by this means you may make use of all your bad servants as instruments to plague the good . Be sure on no account to make use of any distinction , or ever examine into the true author of any fault or carelessness , until it be done privately , in order to lay the blame on a wrong person . . . . Be sure never to lay the saddle upon the right horse , as being the most certain method of galling . The old saying , Twice I did well , and that I heard never ; Once I did ill , and that I heard ever ; must by no means be contradicted by you ; for the oftener you give your servants an opportunity to apply it to themselves , the oftener do you make them feel your power . Author Anonymous , An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting ; With Proper Rules for The Exercise of That Pleasant Art , A. Millar , London , 1753 , pages 20 , 21 , and 22 . The factors which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy it are usually evident to all but the person who inadvertently disregards them . Things which make a person think , " What is the use of trying ? " will break morale for himself and very likely for others . A group of foremen in a public utility concern discussed the causes of lack of interest and the remedies . Their findings are summarized in the columns below :  | Interest will be stifled if the existence of unnecessary work is known , if systems are not satisfactory , or if proper equipment is not provided when needed , or if there are obvious wastes of time , energy , or materials . It is also retarded if some people are allowed to get away with inefficient work , if work is inequitably divided , if there is any hint of partiality , or if there are appreciable differences of pay among those of similar length of service and class of work . If a worker is known to those about him to be doing work which is far below the average but to be getting a higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the worker may have been with the organization for years . If there are good reasons for retaining such persons , they should be put in jobs where their work can not be directly compared to that of others . Perhaps one of the most frequent ways in which morale is undermined is by the supervisor 's making a big fuss over a little fault . An accumulation of little things may gradually have aroused his ire . Or he may just have been called down by his boss , and , being in a bad humor , be excessively annoyed at something wrong . Losing one 's self-control and the use of sarcasm or ridicule are almost always bad . Usually one should inquire into a situation before acting . Mr. Howard , the head of the supply department in a company with about 100 clerks , had been working till ten or eleven o'clock at night in order to get rush work accomplished . One night he worked till midnight . He was delayed at home the next morning and came into the office two minutes late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vice president saw him , sent for the officer in charge of personnel , and asked why Mr. Howard was late . The personnel officer sent for Mr. Howard and told him that the vice president had been asking about his lateness . Mr. Howard explained to the full satisfaction of the personnel officer , but he said to us : " Do you think I 'd work late after that ? No , I 'll quit at 4:30 and the stuff can get behind . Why make all that fuss over two minutes , without paying any attention to the overtime I was working ? I certainly wo n't do anything extra for that vice president . " Ill health is a frequent source of difficulty . Medical and psychological advice may be needed , since health is affected by mental and emotional factors . A good vacation may help . If a worker suffers from a physical impairment , the work should be adjusted to him . Ill health may be due to maladjustment in work or at home , and often much can be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his situation  | with the right person . A large percentage of the work force may have problems of adjustment or of personality . Some of these problems require a psychologist or psychiatrist ; others can be aided by a supervisor or counselor . Frequently , grudges and difficulties of all sorts need only to be mentioned for the right solution to come to mind . Supervisors , on occasions , can help by sympathetic and understanding listening . Morale may be seriously undermined when the lines of authority which have been established are not adhered to till officially modified . Sometimes a superior gives an order to one of his assistant 's subordinates , thus " short-circuiting " the assistant . This violates a fundamental principle of management , but is surprisingly frequent . The supervisor is likely to short-circuit his assistants , and is himself likely to be short-circuited by his chief . A superior needs to have intimate and easy contacts with subordinates , and should talk with them and gain information from them . When he gives orders directly instead of through his assistant , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordinate will tend to turn to him directly , and may be embarrassed by not knowing to whom to report or whose work to put first . The intermediate tends to slip into a position of figurehead . He may be seriously inconvenienced if the directions are contrary to his own , or if the clerk was supposed to do other work . Either his superior short-circuits him unintentionally or he is not doing his part satisfactorily . Often , the best thing is for him to go to his chief , explain his embarrassment , and have the situation cleared up . The evils of short-circuiting may be avoided largely by one of three methods . First , the superior may ask the intermediate supervisor to send a particular person to him for instructions about work he wishes to explain directly . This is preferable when higher officers are dealing with the lower ranks of workers . Second , the worker may be told by the superior to report to the intermediate what he has been instructed to do . This is often appropriate within a department when the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when the latter has supervision only as an incidental part of his work . The third method is to have the intermediate present along with the worker . The intermediate will then know what is wanted , can help get it , can arrange his other work accordingly , and can present his views . If an intermediate is to develop , the superior should do all possible to strengthen him in the efficient performance of his duties , and should create an atmosphere in which the subordinates will recognize his authority .  | A clerk who was seldom late and was much interested in his work came in a little late one day . The head of the department , Richardson , heard the section head , Jones , reprimand the clerk quite harshly for his lateness and lack of interest . Richardson felt that the reprimand had been much too severe and that it would do harm rather than good . A group of supervisors , who discussed what Richardson should do in this case , felt that he should stand by Jones in his dealings with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get facts in the situation , but he should deal primarily with Jones and try to get him to see that he had not acted wisely . He might even suggest a way out of the trouble ; for instance , Jones might say to the clerk , " I am sorry that I spoke to you harshly about your lateness this morning . I was annoyed at other people who were late and I put you in the same class for the moment , but I realize that you are seldom late and your good work entitles you to more consideration . " If persons feel that the underlying aim of building morale and teamwork is the personal advancement of their superiors or money grabbing for the corporation , they will consider themselves fools to work any harder than they have to . Most employees want to feel that they are helping to make a better and finer institution , of genuine value to the community . The most public-spirited policies and the most enlightened ideas in regard to the staff are frequently misinterpreted somewhere along the line from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . When this happens , someone is failing in his job as supervisor . If the supervisor thinks he is faced with basic unfairness in his superiors , he is truly in a difficult position . He can not select his superiors any more than his subordinates have selected him . He may be able to influence them in the long run , but his main job is with his own subordinates . He can make the most of the opportunities he himself has to promote fair dealings in his own department . More and more , business management seems to be developing into a profession , with the active managers feeling genuine responsibility to the employees and to the public as well as to the stockholders . An executive with the management-engineer type of mind wants to see the organization working effectively , smoothly , productively . He realizes the necessity of making a fair profit if he is to hold his position and if the company is to continue permanently . When he improves working conditions , he may be doing so in the name of profit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job can be made to the person doing it , probably the greater will be his value to the employer .  | Therefore , both self-interest and human interest often lead in the same direction . What we have been talking about some writers call " consultative supervision " or " employee-centered supervision " or " democratic management . " Whatever the term , a democratic way of life ? at work ? is easier to talk about than to achieve . It calls for stern self-discipline in the supervisor . He must be aware of what kind of influence he exerts and what example he sets . He shows interest in people without prying into their affairs . He helps people to develop , to make a constructive contribution , and to cooperate with the group . In making assignments and changes , he leaves room for individuals to work out adjustments for themselves , if possible . He indicates in all his actions that he thinks people 's needs and feelings are important . Such a supervisor must be available for consultation . It is not enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must plan his work so he has time to listen . He should get around and talk with people , share their problems , and act like a member of the group . He does what he can to give assistance without breathing down people 's necks . More by his feelings than by his acts , he encourages them to feel secure , to feel they belong , and to accept their responsibilities in the enterprise . The job of supervision is not easy ? it is complex . The supervisor needs to understand the diverse way in which people behave . We differ biologically , mentally , emotionally , and educationally . No two of us look at the same thing in the same way . Our personalities and backgrounds influence us in all that we do . We are conditioned by our perceptions , beliefs , and customs . In a group of people there are also social pressures , standards , rewards , punishments , and internal relations . No wonder a supervisor needs a wide span of observation and perception . Perhaps above all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morale is the capacity of a group to pull together to achieve a common purpose . The supervisor has an important part in this group capacity . He must be willing to pull with the others , on occasion to help speed up or slow down that rhythmic pull , and even at times to modify the course in line with the emerging objectives . In the words of a great management teacher : Every executive has a certain rhythmic pace which he establishes , and the group draws their rhythm from it . It does not make much difference where  | the fife and drum are in a column of soldiers . They radiate rather than impose a rhythm . Erwin H. Schell , in Business Management As a Profession , edited by Henry C. Metcalf , copyright McGraw-Hill Book Company 1927 , page 317.  | There are specific , identifiable attitudes that one individual can have toward another and . . . these could be stated as follows :  | Savagery ? The other fellow is my enemy and is to be destroyed . Slavery ? The other fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servitude ? The other fellow is to serve me for a consideration and ask no more . Welfare ? The other fellow should be helped up when down , without too much concern for what got him down . Paternalism ? The other fellow should be cared for , and I will decide to what extent . Participation ? The other fellow has something to contribute to my efforts and can help me . Trusteeship ? That for which I am responsible is not mine . I am developing and administering it for the benefit of others . Statesmanship ? The other fellow is capable of being far more than he is , and it is my responsibility to help him develop to his fullest potential . Statesmanship in management . . . is a very real thing ? as close to the individual as his daily life . Indeed , with many Americans , it is a way of life . It is the spirit in which by habit and custom they approach their families , their communities , their businesses . Their objective in each case is development ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in contact to realize his full potential . In the following pages we deal with some of the more specific problems that arise in dealing with subordinates . Almost any one of the subjects could be expanded to take up a whole chapter . In considering them , the importance of the informal organization should be borne in mind . Remember that the way you handle the problem may be more important than what you do . The manner in which rules and instructions are developed and issued has much to do with teamwork . All should bear in mind that the reason behind the rules is to secure united action toward common objectives . What may seem quite insignificant may actually be of vital importance to someone else in a later stage of a process . We have already discussed the supervisor 's task of interpreting general policies and decisions for application in the particular office . The additional rules are normally few ? only as many as the needs of the work and of the workers require . What rules there are should be followed . If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or have them observed . Initiative is wanted in suggestions but not in rulebreaking , for teamwork demands coordination . Different kinds of orders are useful in various situations . An outline that appeared in the Manual for Leaders of Foremanship Conferences , Works Progress Administration , has proved helpful :  | George Washington , when 13 years old , wrote " Rules of Stability and Decent Behavior in Company . " There were 54 rules , two of which deal with reprimands . No. 16 : When a man does all he can , though he succeeds not well , blame not him that did it . No. 17 : Being to advise or reprehend anyone , consider whether it ought to be public or in private , presently or at some other time , also in what terms . to do it ; and in reproving show no signs of choler , but do it with sweetness and mildness.  | A supervisor who is either too lenient or too strict with his staff is likely to get into difficulties . Firmness , consistency , impartiality , justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructively or to reprimand in front of other people violates the sense of loyalty and mutual consideration . Praise can be given in the hearing of others , but reprimands should be private . If weaknesses are due to lack of ability or to other conditions which probably can not be corrected , criticisms are likely to result in more harm than good . Possibly , better habits can be built up in time , but the process demands tact . A typist had been showing some signs of conceit , so one day her supervisor said to her , " You know , I think that some day I might tell you that you are getting to be conceited . " She was startled , but did not like to take the remark as a charge that she actually was conceited then . However , the remark had its effect and she improved . Praise is one of the most valuable tools at the supervisor 's command . It should always be used with discretion . To appreciate good performance is important , but before giving praise , the supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither stingy nor lavish , but just . To praise a person for improvement is good ; but not to praise also someone who is doing consistently good work may cause hard feelings . Supervisors often ask , " How friendly should I be with my staff ? " It is difficult to say more than that one should at all times be friendly and take an interest in each member of the staff , but avoid too much intimacy . As one supervisor said , " Take an impersonal personal interest . . . . " When you do show an interest , be as concrete as you can . Instead of saying , " How 's the family ? " ask , " How is Johnny coming on with his piano lessons ? " It is impossible to give specific rules because the conditions vary in different places and companies . What is regarded as too intimate or even impertinent in one organization is considered only common friendliness in another . One should be guided in part by the customs of the place . Toleration of a nickname or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord with the usual practice of the place or it may show too great familiarity . A certain amount of friendly contact outside the office , especially if the organization is in a small town , should do no harm and may do good . On the other hand , if it is known that the supervisor is intimate with  | only certain members of his staff , it is likely that his acts will be viewed by some with the suspicion that he is favoring his friends . It sometimes happens that two persons who have been friends outside business find themselves in the relation of superior and subordinate . The outside friendship should be separated from the business relations . A supervisor who recommended a friend for a position indirectly under him agreed with her in advance that if she were hired , their friendship could continue outside but was not to affect their relations in the office either during or after hours . Within the office she was " Miss Pryor , " but outside she was still " Mary . " The manager of a trade association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that not one per cent of the people whom he has met will deliberately divulge confidential information . Even so he would not trust more than about one man in a hundred . Most of the ninety-nine men who do not intend to divulge secrets fail to realize how easy it is to spill facts . Maybe they will give only an innocent part of the situation which is to be kept strictly confidential ; but someone else may give another part , and the secret leaks out . Often a person who is seeking information can get it by skillful questioning when the person with the confidential information is unaware of its leak . Suppose , for instance , that one hears that the trade association manager is involved in a deal preceding the possible merger of two companies in financial difficulties and that he has spent much time out of the city . Someone , wishing to get further information , might call upon the executive , find him out , and inquire where he had gone . If told " Los Angeles , " he might jump immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one of the companies in difficulty . Ideas of what keeping a secret means vary with different people . The president of a bank laid before a meeting of the board of directors a proposal which would make several hundred thousand dollars for the bank , provided it could consummate the deal before outsiders learned what it was planning to do . The president , therefore , was particularly strong in his emphasis upon the confidential character of the proposal . Finally one member of the board said , " That 's all right , Mr. President , what you say about keeping this deal secret . I can do that myself . What worries me is how to stop the mouths of the people I always tell . "  | Knowing when not to talk and what not to say is as important as knowing when to talk and what to say . Always respect the confidences that any of your staff or associates have reposed in you , whether or not they have gone through the form of getting you to promise not to tell . Beware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing to do but ride up and down all day would n't you be interested in gossip ? Prompt action upon requests and suggestions aids morale since delayed action may be interpreted as a sign that the supervisor does not think that the problem or the new idea is important . If you do not take action promptly , tell the employee of the delay , if possible with reasons . From time to time , mention the matter to show you have not forgotten . Jot down on a calendar pad , or in some other convenient place , all promises made , either expressed or implied . if you refuse a request , be sure to say so . Do not make any promises you can not keep . Keep all you make . To secure a flow of suggestions it is important to reply promptly to those offered . Definite rejection is preferable to indefinite shelving . If an idea is adopted , give credit to the proposer. if rejected , take care to explain to him the defects or the objections . Possibly point out ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pay attention to the psychological attitude of the suggester and try to discourage him as little as possible . A suggestion should not be laughed at , if offered seriously , even though it may seem ridiculous to a man with knowledge and experience . Do not smother future good ideas in rejecting a foolish one . Try to see the suggestion as a whole before you object to details . I f you can , mention some good points . Do not immediately bring up all the objections . Perhaps you can tactfully bring the conversation gradually toward them , and maybe the suggester will see them and mention them . You may want to say , " That would be easier than the way we now do , but how would you handle cases like this . . . ? " You may be surprised to find a good answer ready . Sometimes employees presenting good ideas are criticized for not having thought of them before . A few such criticisms will seriously curtail the flow of suggestions . Many really good ideas are obviousafter someone puts them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  | we think of that before ? " We do not blame an inventor for not making his invention earlier . Nor should we blame a man for not thinking sooner of a better method of handling work , essentially an invention . Many suggestions are made as a result of laziness , but efficiency might he defined as effective laziness , that is , getting the work done with the least expenditure of energy . The steam engine was improved when the boy attending it wanted to play . His job was to pull a rope every time a mark on the engine 's flywheel reached a certain point . This changed the valve openings and let the steam into the other cylinder . The boy found that if he tied the end of the rope to a certain part of one of the wheels , the rope was pulled automatically at the proper time . He tied it , and went out to play . He was beaten by the boss for his laziness , but his invention has been used ever since . In trying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of learning . At the start the method may be slower , but an increase in speed over a period of several days may indicate that with further time the method will be an improvement . Frequently , the person making the suggestion is the best one to try it out as he understands it and is interested in its success . It is wise to indicate to subordinates the problems on which a solution is sought . Often the mere statement of a problem will suggest solutions to other persons . When any general changes are to be made , requesting suggestions is often productive not only of new ideas but also of cooperation in putting the new plans into effect . If the suggestion made under one supervisor affects the work under another , the former either can go directly to the latter or else he can turn the idea over to the planning department , if there is one . If the attitude is taken , even occasionally , that the workers " are paid to work and not to think , " a source of possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk is nearer to some aspects of the work than you are . Try to show him you want ideas from your staff . After discussing a matter with the vice president , a supervisor who had served under other vice presidents said : " Well , I will do anything you please . What would you like ? " " I would n't like a damn thing , " replied the vice president . " Look here , we are both interested in the company . Now what do you think is the best for the company ? That is what I want , not what I personally like . "  | A number of companies have found that the average lateness is about four or five minutes , or only a little above one per cent of the average working day . If only a few employees are late , is it really worthwhile to bother about lateness ? If the company emphasizes the opening hour and insists on promptness , will not the workers emphasize the closing time and leave promptly , so that in the end the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers feel that there is a job to be done and that doing it is more important than putting in a certain number of hours , wo n't the work get out better , even if some individuals come in late occasionally ? Why insist on punctuality ? These questions need to be considered carefully inasmuch as they are likely to come up in the minds of the staff . If the supervisor has definite reasons for his policy , he can apply it more readily . Similar questions were asked a group of supervisors . They had reasons for wanting their staffs to be prompt . Lateness is unbusinesslike . It means that a person does not fulfill his full part of the job . A habit of tardiness is likely to get worse if not corrected and may also spread to others . Punctuality is necessary to teamwork . An office is essentially a team . It can not function properly if a part of it is missing . Coming in late may delay and interrupt the work of others . Stress was laid upon the psychological reaction on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting on time . Some defended the view that certain individual and creative workers might well be late without affecting the quality of their work or their value to the company . The general attitude was that they would have a demoralizing effect upon others , even though their own work might not suffer . Some of the causes of lateness are : Oversleeping . Failure to allow enough time to reach the office . Careless attitude or lack of interest . Lack of foresight . Laziness . Job too difficult . Overtime . Emergencies or unusual conditions . Transportation delays . Outside activities and interests , including bargain days at stores . Chronic illness in family .  | Personal ill health . Wish to vary the monotony . Desire to gratify one 's sense of independence . Supervisor 's lack of discipline . Location in building , top floors being harder to reach than first floors . There seems to be no unanimity of opinion regarding what constitutes a good punctuality record for a clerical job . Figures of various clerical organizations indicate that a standard is attainable of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average . Considerably better records have been reported . Many employees do not know what is considered a reasonable standard of punctuality for their department , probably because many supervisors have never set one . Setting one may help the record . The standard itself may be variable in that " satisfactory " may be considered as average or better in comparison to the department as a whole or it may be set in relation to a schedule for improvement . Two ways of securing punctuality are of basic importance . First , set a good example yourself , thus suggesting compliance . If you are late , you may seem insincere and you will have difficulty in securing prompt attendance . Second , have work ready for everyone when the office opens . If work is not on hand , people tend to resent getting there at a fixed hour . They see no need of wasting time in the office instead of taking a little more time in bed or at breakfast . A number of the listed reasons for punctuality are not operative , and the appeal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand and you can not invent something useful , possibly you can get permission to start your department later than the other departments and to close correspondingly later . If lateness still continues , an effective plan is to find out exactly which people are coming in late . Usually a department 's record is spoiled by the frequent lateness of a very few persons , while others are practically never late . One supervisor found that a certain stenographer was chronically a few minutes late . He suggested that the clerk set as his " zero hour " a time five or ten minutes ahead of the bell , so that if he came in a few minutes behind the time he had set for his arrival he would still have a good attendance record . The plan worked out well , although unless the clerk had been interested in improving his record he might have thought the plan rather silly . Setting his watch and keeping it , say , five minutes fast might also be used effectively .  | In some companies , a clerk who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel department . In others , the reason for lateness may be written on a slip by the offender , and a report made to the personnel department . An officer stopped one day and counted the number of workers who came in late . He then asked supervisors in a meeting why they tolerated tardiness . Apparently , their answers did n't satisfy him so he installed a bell which would ring at 8 A.M. and at 4:30 , the end of the work day . He then checked for tardiness a few days later . There was none . But at the end of the day there were few people left in the office either . The bell reminded them that it was time to quit . Time clocks sometimes discourage proper interest in punctuality and in the performance of the job , since they may seem to lay undue emphasis on the time served rather than on the quality of service . On the other hand , the authors have seen clocks used effectively and with no apparent undesirable reactions . Sometimes it is effective to post the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A supervisor in a large department store once found that three girls were primarily responsible for the poor punctuality of his department . He tried in all sorts of ways to persuade the girls to be on time , but made little progress . One day he drew a chart of a large pair of scales . He put in the pan on the low side the names of those who had brought the record down . He said nothing to the girls but posted the chart where all could see . The girls reformed immediately . Competitions among different departments , either arranged by the supervisors or stimulated by the management , may be useful in securing better attendance . Telling new clerks about the department 's standards will help maintain them . When all else fails , the discharge of a person consistently late may make the others try to get away from the bottom of the list . This is rather drastic , however , and should be avoided if the employee is satisfactory in other ways . The problem of absence is about the same as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal situations worker absence occurs . Sometimes , it is  | a very serious matter . As reported in an article in Supervisory Management , September 1956 , absence costs total five billion dollars a year , the equivalent of the output of a million workers , and range from 1.5 to 4 per cent of payroll . Absences are higher in the shop than in the office , among women than among men , among employees of large firms than of small , in companies that provide sick pay than in those which do not . Absences are highest on Mondays , lowest on Wednesdays and Thursdays , and rise before and after a holiday . If employees are absent a great deal the first year on the job , the pattern seems to continue . Weather and the distance workers have to travel do not have much to do with absence except that it is lower on hot days than cold . The largest single factor is respiratory disease ( mostly colds ) which accounts for half of all absences and one-third of the total time lost . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one for punctuality . Some persons set eight days ' absence per year , excluding vacations , as a reasonable average . A number of life insurance companies show considerably lower averages , ranging approximately three days per year for men and five or six days per year for women . Women normally have higher absence rates than men , but fewer long absences . The causes of absence include : Illness . Personal business . Public duties . Family or home conditions . Personal pleasure . Lack of interest in work . Lack of industry . Desire for extra vacation . Unpleasant conditions in the work group . Character of department head . The first four causes are frequently unavoidable . The others are usually up to the supervisor , as are abuses of the first four . Although the immediate causes of absences and of lateness may appear to be outside a supervisor 's control , he can fairly be held responsible for securing a satisfactory attendance in his department . To improve the attendance record , the clerks with the worst record should be located , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them some of the ones used for controlling lateness . It is usual to require employees to report in by telephone if they are  | sick or faced with an emergency . Otherwise advance permission for absence should be secured . The supervisor should give prompt and fair consideration to requests for leave . He must weigh the needs of the office against those of the individual . In cases of personal emergency , leave is usually authorized without question . In less urgent cases the importance of the leave to the individual ( to get married or attend a wedding or funeral of a close relative , to transact financial business , to move from one house to another , and so forth ) must be treated equitably in relation to the other employees . The superior should consider the amount of work which the department probably will have on the day when the person wishes to be away , how recently that person has had a similar absence , and how many such requests the clerk has had granted over a period of , say , a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground that " there have been too many non-sickness absences recently , " unless that particular person has indulged in some of them . If he has seen others excused for personal reasons and is refused himself , is he not justified in thinking there is discrimination against him ? A simple record of the names of the employees and the number of personal and illness absences of each will help the supervisor to be consistent . He should not penalize some individuals for his leniency to others . The control of absences for personal reasons other than illness is not always easy . The character of the department head is an important factor ? the example he sets and the type of supervision he gives . If he is too lax , he may be imposed upon ; if he is too strict , he may accentuate nervousness so that employees will need to stay home more than they would if he developed an atmosphere with fewer tensions , where more work would be done with less mental and emotional strain . A large life insurance company found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence rates of the different departments than such factors as bad ventilation , noise , or crowding . The company , which had outgrown its building , had several departments with poor space and others with good space . The absence rates by departments showed no relationship to the type of space . Where the quality of supervision was excellent , illness and absenteeism were low , irrespective of poor working conditions . Apparently , this situation resulted because the most capable leaders produced a working environment where nervous tension and other psychological handicaps were reduced to a minimum ; consequently , health conditions were favorable , and , further , people came to work even when they were suffering from minor ailments . Supervision has a direct effect upon worker absence . The kind of  | supervision received often aggravates personal problems on the job . Poor work management , boredom , discouragement , and bad relations with superiors and other people in the office lead to absence . A report by Floyd C. Mann and James Dent on supervision in the Detroit Edison Company indicated that the attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some work groups had low absence rates , others high . In the low-absence groups there were more employees who were generally satisfied with their supervisor than in the other groups . The study also showed that employees have low-absence records when they have a free relationship with their supervisor and can readily discuss their problems with him . Wasting time , like lateness and absence , is a matter over which the supervisor has much influence , both directly and by the atmosphere he creates . The main cause of wasting time is usually poor organization of the work , caused by poor supervision or general management . Waste of time is almost inevitable when the flow of work is uneven , when the department is overmanned , when machines or other equipment are inadequate or improperly installed , and where there is a lack of cooperation between departments . In a great many instances , the supervisor is largely to blame for time wasted in washrooms . When work is poorly organized , and a worker knows that he has little to do , he will stretch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After he has used up as much time as he can in apparently productive ways , when he has straightened his desk and can think of nothing more to do , he goes to the lavatory and talks with anyone he finds there . The most effective way to prevent time being wasted in lavatories is to pay attention to the organization and measurement of the work , to see that each worker has something to do as much of the time as possible , and to cut down the excuses and necessities for wasting time which exist in many offices . There may still be some people who waste time . Locating the worst offenders and dealing with them first may have a good effect upon the rest . Careful observation will usually show which individuals are leaving their desks continually . As a last resort , a record may be required of each person as to how he spends his time , the record to he kept by five-minute intervals every day for a week or a month . A supervisor worked out a good method to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of spending considerable time  | washing up before lunch and before closing time . This hampered the work . He therefore assigned each person a regular five- or ten-minute period at these hours , arranged so that only a few were absent from their desks at once . They might go freely to the lavatory at other times also , but they all understood that visits were to be brief . Stress is not even necessarily bad for you ; it is also the spice of life , for any emotion , any activity causes stress . But of course your system must be prepared to take it . The same stress which makes one person sick can be an invigorating experience for another . Hans Selye , The Stress of Life , copyright McGraw-Hill Book Company 1956 , page vii , by permission . Although office work is not heavy labor , it is fraught with stress , monotony , and fatigue . You must meet constant pressure of deadlines , mountains of paper work , and frequent changes . Continually you must adjust to friction , tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stress occurs when there is pressure , injury , or overstimulation . You may react , aside from physical hurt , with nervous tension ? being keyed up ? or emotional disturbance . Restraint , fear , frustration , and conflict are among the factors which doctors think cause the wear and tear . You can not avoid stress . You must adjust to people and events . You must face the frustrations of doing things the way they have to be done even if it is not necessarily the way you think best . You also must live with the emotional disturbances of associates , subordinates , and yourself , too . Often you can avoid much of the wear and tear by shifting the point of pressure frequently , that is , by changing from one activity to another . This is like shifting the weight of something you are carrying before you rub your skin off . Thus people say that change is rest . Consequently , it is healthy to change from one task to another . For most persons , though not for all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tasks . At least some fatigue-creating stress can be avoided when workers ' abilities and skills are fairly fully used on the job . It is also relieved when you encourage expression , constructive achievement , development of individual personality , and recognition of each person 's needs for job satisfaction . When work is a satisfactory experience , both the worker and the supervisor get a lift . In dealing with individuals under stress , a supervisor should use tin- derstanding , a sense of humor , and faith in each person 's capacity . Above all , he should permeate his actions with good will . Sometimes frustrations show as irritation , often as apathy or withdrawal ? what 's the use of trying ? This often gives the appearance of fatigue . In an office , fatigue is seldom due to physical exertion . It is usually emotional and mental . Whenever there is unsatisfactory emotional adjustment , symptoms of fatigue are likely to occur , if not signs of tension , irritability , or breakdown . These symptoms are reactions to stress or to monotony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetitive , but still requires watchfulness and accuracy in making fine discriminations . Where the work becomes practically automatic , the mind is free to wander and to follow trains of thought which may be amusing or interesting or depressing . However , some jobs demand enough attention to make a preoccupation with something else impossible , but not enough to fill the mind and energies of the worker . Jobs such as these may contribute to the nervousness and frequent mental breakdowns in American life , particularly when factors outside the business make for an unhappy emotional tone . It has been shown that jobs which permit reverie or mind wandering frequently develop dissatisfied workers , since the free time is spent in brooding over real or fancied grievances in the business or personal environment . Much depends upon how well one has adjusted to life as a whole . The relation between repetitive jobs , boredom , and mental fatigue is quite well established . Mental fatigue tends to be greatest when we are called upon to inhibit our natural impulses . One of these impulses is the tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what we are doing , it is not hard to prevent them from wandering . But the hardest thing is to continue to do what takes only a little attention . Then indeed our minds slip into daydreaming . That is why in a later chapter we have stressed job broadening . Monotony does not affect workers equally . Some are happiest doing simple repetitive work . Many of these persons have less than average intelligence ; they learn slowly , but once they have learned , they will be contented with limited jobs . Sometimes rearranging the work will remove the element of boredom and increase the effectiveness of the clerks . Supervisors often assume that a particular job is boring to everyone . It may be boring to them or boring to some of the workers who have tried it , but not necessarily to everyone . Clerks frequently say about quite routine office work , " What I like about my work is that there is  | something different all the time . " Yet the range of interest is narrow . Often , small points are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that the names and amounts on checks agreed with the requisitions , and she told us she got much pleasure from noting unusual names . Her job was responsible , but repetitive . An operator , totaling figures which have no meaning for her on an adding machine , may be thoroughly bored , or she may enjoy the job , as one girl we know does . She absolutely refused promotion , because she loved her work and she was too nervous when she tried work of a higher grade . There have been various studies of the effect of rest periods of different lengths and at different times . Some of the results which have been attributed to rest periods are undoubtedly due to the fact that the work is being studied or measured . What is the best period for one person will probably not be the best for many others . Some compromise may be reached and a definite period selected . On the other hand , many offices operate successfully with no definite rest periods . Bad posture is an important cause of fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a manner as to interfere with the most effective functioning of the body . Posture chairs tend to prevent this impairment of efficiency . They must be adjusted to the individual , however , or they are likely to do more harm than good . They should be of a height which sustains the body weight without undue pressure on the leg just above the knee ; they should have a seat which conforms to the shape of the body ; and the back rest should be adjusted to fit the small of the back well forward of the position of the hips on the chair . In addition , the height of the desk or other equipment should be right for the employee 's eyes and arms . If the desk is not adjusted but the chair is raised , a foot rest may be needed . Posture chairs or other equipment adjusted for a particular person should be carefully marked so that the proper person gets them each time . A piece of adhesive tape or a label with the clerk 's name on it is adequate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion of a group of supervisors , you as a supervisor should : Know yourself and your job . Understand the nature of supervision and how it deals with work , people , and the relationship between the two .  | Develop ability to live with and deal with conflict , change , stress , and people . Develop ability to manage work . Have faith in people and their ability to grow with responsibility . Take the wear and tear of the office with equanimity and good humor . Develop ability to see relationships between people and their jobs . Try to harmonize interests of the individuals with the needs of the company . Develop ability to bring ideas and people together to communicate and understand sympathetically . Develop ability to gain wisdom .  | It has been said that some men upon receiving authority grow , while others swell . This is but another way of saying that some men as they come to larger and larger responsibilities in life begin to look upon their positions more and more from the standpoint of the obligations which are imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . You will always note that those in managerial positions who acquire and develop that point of view make the very best managers .  | Throughout this book we emphasize that the office supervisor should possess or acquire sympathy with people and understanding of their individual personalities . This requires that he learn how mental and emotional processes function in people as they work alone or in groups . He must develop in his own character , those actual or potential qualities of getting along with people . Finally he should create action patterns which translate his inner feelings and knowledge into effective action . This chapter presents some ideas on how a person can constructively develop himself as a supervisor . The supervisor is a human being with needs , aspirations , talents , and weaknesses . At the same time he is also the occupant of a given position in a particular organization . There he is cast in the role of a leader in a complex situation . However , he is no abstract or ideal leader . He is a very human person situated among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed three relationships of particular closeness ? with the members of the group he supervises , with his own superior , and with his colleagues who report to the same superior . Beyond these close contacts , relationships fan out to other persons inside and outside the organization . Usually he is in a constantly changing and developing situation . He must try to meet the needs of the situation and at the same time act like a good human being . In all these relationships , probably the most difficult person you ever have to deal with is yourself . If you are to be anybody who is somebody , you must first reckon with yourself , and find out what kind of a person you are and want to be . There is one person in the picture whom you can never get away from , even in your sleep ? the person under your skin . But how hard it is to deal with that person objectively and factually ! What wishful thinking and what self-deceit ! You believe you have sincerity of purpose , but you find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather not acknowledge even to your best friend . You want to be a good fellow , but sometimes the things others are willing to do are not in agreement with your own standards of what is right and sound . Sometimes you feel driven by your situation . You feel you can not really be yourself . In this book we try to show that each person must be himself and also must recognize and respect the selfhood in each other person . If you try to have respect for the dignity and capacity of others you should begin with self-respect . Upon the foundation you can build the action patterns you need . As time goes by you can mold your character deliberately and develop your personality .  | Let us take another look at the job of the supervisor . It is the consensus of various groups that a supervisor should : Have a well-rounded and pleasing personality . Be genial and cheerful in his attitude . Consider the rights and feelings of others . Be human , realizing that all of us have our limitations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have sympathy for his staff . Take a personal interest in his staff . Be a good judge of human nature and character . Have respect for the personalities of those about him , even if he differs from them in standards and actions . Be stable and consistent in purpose and demeanor . Be impartial and never play favorites . Exercise tact and courtesy , especially under trying circumstances . Be loyal to his subordinates and superiors . Enjoy the confidence of those about him . Be straightforward and honest . Control his temper . Have the courage to face difficult situations . Be punctual . Be enthusiastic . Have a detailed knowledge of the work . State what he has in mind clearly and unambiguously . Be accurate in what he says and does . Lead . This formidable array is rather discouraging . Yet which of them can be spared from the make-up of a real leader ? Knowing where one rates high or low on these points is difficult . Yet knowing one 's self is the first essential toward improvement . The three main ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) analysis by others ; ( 3 ) observation of the effect of one 's actions upon others . A number of self-rating scales are available . These are used to stress characteristics necessary for leadership . In recent years the opinion has grown that good leadership varies with the situation , the type of persons , and the kind of work . You should therefore keep in mind the actual behavior required . You need to think what standard of comparison you have in mind . The question , " Are you good at remembering names and faces ? " implies that you will compare yourself to other  | persons or to some standard . Should you be able to remember two new faces a day , or twenty , or two hundred ? What is good ? What do other people do ? On this capacity a salesman or a politician needs a higher standard than a bookkeeper . In spite of the weaknesses of self-analysis , we give below a set of questions modified from a list used by Glenn L. Gardiner . 1 . Mutual respect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual under me ? Have I done any specific thing , by act or word , to demonstrate to each person that I respect him or her ? Do I ever take any ungentlemanly liberties with women subordinates ? 2 . Open-mindedness in disagreements and toward suggestions . Am glad to have subordinates come to me with their suggestions ? Can I remember having been stubborn about accepting a viewpoint of my subordinate ? Do I listen patiently , and without annoyance , when a subordinate presents an idea with which I disagree ? 3 . Understanding with subordinates of what is required . Does each person know what he is supposed to do to win advancement ? Have I sat down with each person and had a full and frank talk with him about himself and his work ? Do I do this at least once a year ? 4 . Approachability . Do subordinates approach me timidly ? Do I consciously try to make it easy for my subordinates to take up personal matters with me ? When a subordinate approaches me with something on his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task immediately at my hand or do I give him my attention at once or at least acknowledge his presence and ask him to sit down ? Do I ever avoid the approach of a subordinate by putting on a busy air ? 5 . Self-control . Do I indulge in arguments with subordinates ? Do I let my personal grouches affect my manner of dealing with my people ? Can I control myself under trying and irritable circumstances ? Do I lose my temper ? 6 . Keeping promises . Do I ever make promises , the fulfillment of which is dependent upon the approval or act of someone above me ? Do I make a promise with the intention of finding some logical way out of it before the time to keep it arrives ? Do I ever have to be reminded by my subordinates of promises I have made to them ? Have I any outstanding unfulfilled promises now ? 7 . Patience . Do I become irritable when subordinates do not live up to the letter of my expectations ? Am I willing to repeat instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Am I greatly annoyed by minor mistakes ? 8 . Fairness , impartiality . Do I allow personal likes or dislikes to alter  | my treatment of individuals ? Do I have any special arrangements or dealings with individuals that I could not explain logically and satisfactorily to others under my supervision ? Have I the strength to be honest and impartial under all circumstances ? 9 . Understanding of human nature and sympathy . Do my subordinates ask me for help with their personal problems ? How many times have they done so in the last year ? Do I read books and articles on handling people ? Do my subordinates show sympathy to me ? Do I fit the job to the worker as well as the worker to the job ? Do I make allowance for bad health , worry , or sorrow ? 10 . Loyalty . Do I put my personal interests ahead of the interests of my workers ? Do I accept full responsibility for the mistakes of my department , or do I lay the blame on individuals under me ? Am I as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to me ? 11 . Appreciation . Do I show pleasure when work is performed unusually well ? Do I express satisfaction to the person doing a consistently good job or do I only mention outstanding jobs ? Do I express my appreciation not only to the one doing the good work but to others ? 12 . Consistency . Do I ask for too much work sometimes and too little at others ? Do I give privileges some days which I will not give at other times under similar conditions ? Are my requests consistent with the difficulty of the work ? Are they consistent with the ability of the workers ? 13 . Reasonableness , standards of quality and quantity . Do I ask my subordinates to do things I would not care to do myself ? In assigning tasks I have never actually done myself , do I give careful consideration to the amount of work I can reasonably expect a subordinate to turn out ? Am I impartial about requiring overtime ? 14 . Observation . Do I know upon what work each subordinate is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is handled in my department ? Are infractions of rules or of good practice usually called to my attention by others or do I usually observe them first myself ? 15 . Aim . Do I have a definite goal for my department or division ? Do I expect to get out a certain volume of work ? Do I have a standard of accuracy which I aim to reach ? Do I aim to develop my subordinates by a definite plan ? You can rank yourself if you grade 3 on each of the above groups where you feel you are distinctly above average ; 2 on those groups where you are about average ; and 0 on those where you feel you are below average . A total of 45 would be perfect ; 30 , average ; 15 , poor . If someone asks you to give him suggestions or to help him analyze his character , you will be showing him the sincerest friendship if you  | talk with him thoroughly and frankly . It will be all the more friendly if you do it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may make your advice more helpful if you follow some of these suggestions : 1 . Ask him to analyze himself first , so that you can tell what points he has in mind and what his own opinion is . Then you can not only tell him what you think but you can point out where his judgment of himself differs from the opinion of others . 2 . Be sure to comment on praiseworthy actions and characteristics as you come to them . Temper honest criticism with sincere praise . 3 . Try to give the views of others about him , rather than only your own . Do not mention the others by name , but possibly say , " In some way or other you have got the reputation of being conceited " or " Regardless of how you feel yourself , when you do so and so you give others the impression that you are trying to get out of your share of the work . " 4 . Do not pass any moral judgments . Talk on the assumption that he is fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions and the impressions which they create on others . If he has angered or hurt you in the past , be impersonal about it . If you make a charge in an impersonal way and he wants to know whether you think it is true , try to avoid committing yourself . You could state that such an interpretation would not be an unfair inference from the actions observed , but that you are not acting as judge . 5 . If you have some severe criticisms to make , or if you find that you are giving him rather more than he can stand on the first interview , tell him you would like time to think further about certain things , and that if he wishes you will talk with him again ; or else close off the conversation and several days later take it up again , with such words as , " I 've been thinking about our talk of a few days ago , and it occurred to me that one point we should have mentioned was . . . . " 6 . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , conversely , that many different actions may result from the same motive in different people . 7 . Criticisms of weaknesses which on account of habits , age , or lack of ability can not be corrected are likely to result in more loss than gain . If you want someone to help you , you might suggest that he follow the method just described . He should know you well and should be frank . You will be fortunate indeed if he is also truly tactful . Tact is not the suppression of unpleasant facts , but their presentation in the least offensive way . You must control your annoyance if your friend tells you things which you do not like to hear . Hearing merely nice things may inflate your  | ego , but will not help you to get along better . If he mentions faults which he thinks you have , or which he says others think you have , do not try to defend yourself , but encourage him to tell you all he can about the situation . You may not be guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you are guilty , you had better change your actions . Having decided what characteristics or habits you wish to develop , choose only one or two which seem to be most important . Do not try to become perfect all at once . It is better to be consistent in improvement than to try too much and fall back . Will-power and a real desire to develop the new habit are essential . The desire may be built up by realizing the good consequences which may be expected . There are recognized methods of habit formation . The classic statement , which may be found in William James 's Talks to Teachers ( pages 64-77 ) , or Psychology , Briefer Course ( pages 142-150 ) , is summarized as follows : 1 . First make up your mind that you really will overcome the old habit and develop the new . Think as clearly as you can about the advantages of the new habit until you are sure that you really want to establish it . In order to reinforce your resolution , tell others about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the old , bad , or negative mode you are getting away from . 3 . From the time you make your resolution , allow no exception to your resolve . Start today ? not when you get around to it. , If you slip into the old habit , impose some penalty upon yourself , thus attaching an unpleasantness to the old habit . 4 . Practice the new habit all you can ; make opportunities if you can for its development and practice . For many years the importance of correct reasoning has been impressed upon us . We live in an age where imagination is coming into stronger prominence . The art of advertising has shown us how prone most of us are to act on reiterated suggestion . The executive can take advantage of his imagination as well as of his reasoning powers . What he strongly suggests to himself sets up a process of thought which may bear fruit later . Not only can he set before himself problems on which he requires an answer , but he can influence his own habit patterns by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suggestion takes effect when a person consciously constructs in his imagination what he is going to do . He may begin with reasoned analysis of what he should do . Then he projects himself into the future situation , actually seeing in his mind what action he will take . As dramatically as he can , he makes sound pictures of himself : feels himself going through the motions , and uses his senses to create a situation in advance . These vivid imaginings apparently make a deep impression on the mind and lead to a reproduction of the pattern in actual living . The method sounds thoroughly childish ; but adults who have tried the childish method of actually talking to themselves about what they are going to do and picturing their conduct find themselves less childish in actual living , since they live true to the best thinking they can do rather than yielding to the line of least resistance when a situation arises . By the power of visualization we become what we look at , subject to the laws and limitations of our own nature . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself put before his mind . The more positive is one 's thinking , the more powerful is the impetus towards bringing it to fruit in action . Many people hold themselves down by the evil effect of negative suggestion . The reiteration of " I ca n't " will have its result until some strong influence breaks up the restriction . A mother , for instance , may think she is so afraid of the water that she can not bring herself to go out in a boat ? until her child is in danger , when she will go forth to do what she can , laying aside her fear . The holding of a positive attitude has a cumulative effect . Naturally the result must be within the capacity of the individual . The bootblack will not become president simply by telling himself he will . The attitude " I can do that " should be followed by the question " How can I do it effectively ? " Observation and reason can reinforce what will and imagination envision . The building of definite action patterns is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public speaking by visualizing himself on the platform , choosing appropriate gestures , listening to his own voice to make it effective , and developing his attitude to the audience deliberately . Without insincerity , one may develop actions appropriate to the occasion . David Seabury in one of his books says that one would not go to a hunting party in evening clothes nor to a formal dinner in a bathing suit . We dress our bodies in a way appropriate to the activity . It is even more important to clothe ourselves in proper mental costume , putting ourselves as fully as possible into the mood appropriate to the situation .  | A person 's manners and appearance have weight in the impressions he gives to people . The basis of good manners is respect for others and for ourselves , revealing itself in courtesy and consideration for the other person 's feelings and needs . Good manners make for easy relations and soften points of friction . Almost everyone remembers to show common courtesies to the boss but some forget to do so with equals or subordinates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , whatever the rank or status . " You know , since Jim got married he has really mellowed , " said a colleague to a mutual friend . " He used to come into the office every morning and go past a dozen people without a word . Now if I say , ' Good morning , Jim , ' I get a greeting in return , or at least a smile . He always meant well , but he never realized that people found him frosty . " Relations with people are kept friendly with words of greeting and by " passing the time of day . " Such behavior when it springs from genuine kindliness brings returns in warmth and need not take up much time . It is worthwhile to examine how you meet people . Do you look them in the eyes ? Do you smile ? Do you shake hands warmly ? Maybe a friend will help you check on yourself . Office etiquette between men and women calls for special mention . Manners customary in social relations are used among office people off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places of those affected . For example , a man offers to carry anything heavy for a lady and stands until she sits . In his own work place , some of the customary manners are adapted a bit and he treats both men and women subordinates very much alike . However , he should not precede a woman through a door unless she specifically asks him to go first . When a woman with whom he does business frequently comes into his room or up to his desk , he normally does not rise . He is careful , though , not to keep people standing for any length of time without rising or offering them a seat . A lady supervisor likewise does not keep a man standing . When a business group is seated and a lady comes into the room it is not customary for men to rise unless to offer her a chair . Manners are useful in conversation too . You should adapt your voice to the room and not speak too loud . Be careful not to interrupt or contradict others . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin Franklin 's example , you may say , " It seems to  | me that . . . " or " I thought I had observed such . . . " or " I wonder if you have heard this . " Appearance is important , too , in making a favorable impression . Good posture and some spring in the step are assets . Clothing should always be in good taste and adapted to the particular office . The supervisor 's clothing and grooming are noted by colleagues and superiors and set the tone for subordinates . A woman supervisor , in particular , has an influence on the young women starting in . Conspicuous or overdressy clothes and hairdos are inappropriate in the office and too casual an appearance should be avoided also . In many offices , men work in shirtsleeves . In some , sportshirts are worn . It is often the custom to put on a coat to go to the room of a superior or to a conference attended by superiors or outsiders . The type of summer dress worn varies greatly , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality but also with the particular organization or subdivision . Good grooming is important in the case of both sexes . Clothes should be clean and neat ; hair , fingernails , and teeth well cared for . Personal cleanliness and daintiness are expected . Neglected pyorrhea or slovenly appearance has been the cause of lack of promotion , yet superiors are diffident in mentioning such personal matters . One 's personal efficiency is largely a matter of habit . Some persons are habitual procrastinators , daydreamers , or interrupters . Proper health habits are of great importance in avoiding the slight illnesses which do not keep people away from work but which lower their vitality and often constitute unnecessary handicaps . Suitable food , regular elimination , and enough rest are important for everybody ; exercise is of great importance to some . Health is fostered by hygienic habits and prompt attention to ailments , and even more by a healthy and happy outlook on life . Recreations , outside activities , and beliefs may have important reactions on effectiveness . Having hobbies , outside interests , and spiritual resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's time to business . Most office workers have their business time directed in considerable detail by their supervisor , but supervisors have to direct themselves to a considerable extent . How effectively they do so will often determine how far they will advance . One person working long hours may do less in a week than a faster person who works fewer hours . Sometimes the supervisor who normally puts in a great deal of overtime does so  | because he is a poor organizer . " Some of the busiest people in the world are only picking up the beans they have spilled . " When overtime is necessary , it is frequently possible to do after hours different parts of the work from those which fill the regular day . The change provides a certain amount of rest . A detailed analysis of how you spend your time for a few days may suggest ways of improvement . Keep a sheet of paper on your desk and record on it the time you change from any one activity to another , noting briefly what each activity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary or not . You may find that a number of interruptions are caused by yourself . Maybe you should save up questions for others and take up several matters at a time , and maybe you need to train others to do this with you . In any case , the record of how your time goes will give you the basic data upon which to plan more effectively . After you have kept the record for a few days , find the amount of time you have spent upon different types of items . Make up your own list of headings . You may want to analyze the record in several ways : according to the type of work , such as planning , training , correcting , personal work , and so forth ; or according to the subject worked on , as new orders , back orders , cancellations , and so forth ; or according to the persons involved , as Mr. A , Miss B , and so forth . See how much time you actually spent in planning for your department 's better operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with the routine ( that is , without getting into the question of revision of the department 's work ) , and how much time you consider was purely wasted . Determine what wastes you are suffering from and who are causing the most interruptions . Deal with factors which are your own peculiar problems . You may get some ideas on how to cut out some wastes from portions of this and other books . It is helpful in most jobs to plan your time in advance . You may wish to list each evening the ten most important things to be done the next day . At the close of that day , the accomplishment should be compared to the plan . Keep the list in front of you during the day to help you put the schedule through . There is usually so much that a supervisor could do with his time that he must be careful not to neglect things of major importance in order to handle minor things with too great thoroughness . Each day time should be set aside to think . A supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his work and people . If he has an important decision to make , he should look at a problem from all points of view , and in terms of the whole business .  | One supervisor the authors knew tried to go fishing , take a trip , or get away somehow before deciding upon an important problem so that his subconscious could mull over the problem . Some people like to think in the early morning hours when their minds are fresh ; others think best later in the day . In some offices definite times are set aside when there are to be no interruptions except for urgent matters . During these " quiet hours " important mail can be handled or plans requiring concentration can be developed . Matters that require consultation with others can be put aside to be taken up later . Even if there are no quiet hours for the office as a whole , a supervisor can arrange that his staff interrupt him only for urgent matters during certain hours . Time can often be saved by writing a brief note long-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memorandum . Much time is often lost in deciding what to do or say . Some executives rate a man upon his capacity to make no wrong decisions . Others rate him upon the number of his right decisions and consider how many right ones he makes to each wrong one . In the first case , there is a temptation to make few decisions and to be as sure as possible that each one is right , or at least backed up by precedent . In the second case , there is a real stimulus to the development of new ideas and a force which makes for growth . Learn that decisions can be made rapidly if you develop the habit of using the steps of preparation , incubation , illumination , and verification . Some persons waste time putting things off . They may think that it will be easier to make a decision later , or when they have more time . They use up time and energy thinking half about the problem and half about how they can postpone it . Usually it is better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , fix in your mind exactly what the problem is , so that the process of incubation can go on , and decide to lay it aside for a time . Seeing callers promptly is not only appreciated but will often save your time . Tell them you will see them without delay since you can spare only a limited time . In short , do not just drift . Apply common sense to the way you are handling yourself and your job .  | In the first place , there is the supervision in which there is absolutely no order , in which there is no prevision and no planning ; the supervision which attempts to resolve a succession of unexpected problems and things to be done , in which the executive is all the time on the qui vive as to what must be done next and as to who shall do it next , and in which the workman is at the same time on the qui vive as to what he shall be directed to do next . In the second place , there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we have the appearance of precision in the coordination of the efforts of workers separated in space and time , but really a limited coordination ; and usually the procedures of such coordination generate a large amount of irritation because of the emotional reaction to confusion which can arise where there is ill considered , unnecessary red tape . In the third place , there may be a supervision that will bring about the reign of law and order in an enterprise , an atmosphere into which the worker may come and say , " Here one feels one 's self under command without being commanded . " To be sure , that involves routine and system , but every element of the routine and system must be devised to meet the particular situation and must be obviously essential to the particular situation . It must be the result of painstaking investigation , experiment , explanation , and informal instruction . If it meets the situation and sets up a reign of law and order , it is , as I conceive it , the highest type of supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Psychological Foundations of Management , edited by Henry C. Metcalf , copyright McGraw-Hill Book Company 1927 , pages 145-146 , by permission .  | We have emphasized that the supervisor 's responsibilities are concerned with human relations and with managing work . Most of the remainder of this book relates to managing work . Even when we are talking about the work , people are still involved . We must not forget that work is performed by people . Moreover , if the work can well be done by someone working alone , an organization is not needed at all , and therefore you as a supervisor would be out of a job . An organization implies and requires cooperation . Every change in work either maintains cooperation , heightens it , or dampens it . If the desire to cooperate is damaged , productivity usually falls . If people work with a will , productivity usually is good . If people are reasonably well selected and trained , and if they want to do a good job , the chances are that you can get out the work even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if your people are activeminded and if the climate is such that they feel willing to make suggestions , they will be ready to help with suggestions on how the conditions and procedures can be changed for the better . There are numerous sources of ideas for work . You doubtless have ideas yourself . Your boss and colleagues have them too . You may get thoughts from meetings , books , and articles . Then , too , the company may have one or more staff offices which work continually on improvements or on checking into results . If your company does not have units for planning and control , your own efforts are obviously needed . If such facilities are available , your active participation and your cooperatively critical attitude toward their work are great assets . Whether there are planning and control units or not , you can not hope to become an expert all at once in the many fields of office management . But you can readily acquire the major principles and techniques and learn to apply them to your work . Then you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields which seem most important or congenial or both .  | Kipling 's widely known lines quoted at the beginning of this chapter form a good working guide to the managing of work . What is to be done and why ? When we can answer these questions , we are reasonably clear on the objective of our tasks . This is the first step in good management . How shall the work be done , where , and when ? These questions are answered through planning and scheduling . What means shall be chosen to achieve the objective ? Wh procedures , machines , materials , and so forth ? Are the means available ? Machines may accomplish a better result more quickly than the present method , but if the machines ' cost is higher than the resulting saving , the money is not likely to be forthcoming . Who shall perform the different tasks ? People with the needed skills must be available . Moreover , most companies do not turn people off as soon as they can be replaced by machines . Rather , the installation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lay an axe to the roots of morale , loyalty , and cooperation . Other important questions are : How much should be done in how long a time ? How well should each task be done ? The answers require the setting of standards and controls . It is not enough to say that work should be accurate . If your finished work is in typed form , how many typing errors are permissible in final copy ? If you get perfection by extremely careful checking and by rejection of imperfect products , are your costs then too high for the importance of the result ? Or is the result too late to be useful ? Planning is the process of consciously selecting and developing the best course of action to secure your objective . Planning is the general term for foreseeing the whole procedure from the time a task is first outlined until it has been completed and checked over . Everybody plans as a natural thing . The housewife makes a rough plan for her meals for the week before she does her weekly shopping . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on who is going to be home , whether there will be guests , and other factors . A family plans its vacation automobile trip by deciding the general direction and then discussing alternative routes , weighing their advantages and disadvantages , and then picking on a general outline . On the trip  | itself , changes may be made because of road conditions , weather , the health or illness of a family member , or maybe just because of desires . Scheduling is a particularly important part of this planning because time usually affects both service and cost . In many cases , time is indeed money . The cost of electronic data processing machines , for example , is very high . The machine can not be used effectively unless the flow of work to the machine is precise . Even a few minutes cut from machine time represents a saving ( provided the machine can be used productively in the time saved ) . Moreover , preparation of data so that they mesh together well spells the difference between excellent information and spotty or unmeaningful statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now . With the rapid advancement of data processing by electronic means , however , you may be more involved tomorrow than you think . The work you are responsible for may be readjusted so that it can be done better by machine . Even if it is not , you may find that it has to be processed more accurately or in a more even flow because so many related details of the business are being geared into one integrated system . It is therefore wise for you to be aware of the possibilities and informed about ways to make constructive use of them . Planning , as we have stated , always begins with the objectives to be reached . We must be clear what we want before we do much about getting there . At first we may have rather a hazy idea of what we want . Then we visualize it more sharply . Later we often see the objective as containing a series of detailed objectives , each of which may require a series of actions . Planning is bound to be involved when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an organization , we should remember , is a " system of cooperative activities . " Most activity or action is performed in the work place . There the worker applies his personal energies to accomplish an immediate definite objective . The worker 's part is indispensable . So is the coordination of his efforts with the efforts of others . This means that all the people who work on an activity really must have a common understanding of what is to be done . They need to know what part each person plays in a specific act . If this common understanding is absent or dim , effort can not be truly intelligent . To some degree , then , cooperation is lacking . A change desirable in one spot may require a change in activity by someone else . Thus communication becomes necessary . This need for communication is one of the basic reasons why the supervisor or the executive is necessary . We brought out this point in an earlier chapter . At present we want to emphasize that planning is necessary to main- tain fruitful teamwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place at the right time by the right person in the right way . Much of this action occurs at the work place itself , in answer to the immediate situation . But plans for action must be dovetailed through a series of decisions at different times and places by different people . Thus planning in an organization of more than a few people needs to be somewhat systematic . Planning is normally done to some extent by every member of the organization , but it is frequently specialized in some specific jobs . Systematic planning may be broken down into a number of steps for analyzing the needs for action , making a decision for action , and setting up the policies , methods , and schedules by which the action will be carried out . These steps are quite complicated when a large new venture or a big change of system is involved . The usual steps are listed below and then illustrated with a relatively simple example . The normal steps in planning are to : 1 . Recognize the problem or need for action . This includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger the organization , the more important it is to consider the needs of others . 2 . Consider the possible alternatives for action . 3 . Detect the key factors in the situation ? the things which can or can not readily be changed , the things which encounter strong patterns , customs , and feelings , and those which cost a great deal of money or require important changes in personnel . 4 . Analyze the possible alternatives in relation to the key factors and sort down your ideas into one or more possibilities which take your key factors into account . 5 . See what kinds of facts you need to give light on your alternatives or on your key factors and go after the facts . 6 . Analyze and interpret the facts and select one or more of the possibilities to work up into tentative proposals . 7 . For each proposal , see what would be required ? the changes needed in policy , method , schedule , budget , and personnel . Determine the critical points where you could see whether the plan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the basis for control . 8 . Decide on the best proposal . You may do this yourself , or more likely , your boss or his superior will do so in consultation with others . 9 . Refine the work you did under point 7 to the degree necessary to put the plan into effect . 10 . Follow up to see how the plan is working and what the results are .
