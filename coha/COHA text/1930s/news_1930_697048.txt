txt In tiny cells in the punishment gallery of Auburn prison six convicts accused of first degree murder are waiting for the verdict of a jury of farmers Which is to decide whether the pris6ners shall die in the electric chair or serve out the balance of the long sentences already imposed for other crimes . The jury , which for nearly three weeks has heard evidence for and against the men accused of responsibility for the death of Henry Sullivan , leader of last December 's unsuccessful prison riot , began its deliberations late this afternoon but had not reached a verdict tonight and will continue its deliberations tomorrow . After dinner the jury returned to the court house to resume its consideration of the evidence . It was 7 o'clock . In the next hour and a half Mr. Hosmer and all the defense lawyers returned and began an expectant vigil . Herbert Robinson , attorney for Leagan : Harry Gleason , Udwin 's counsel , and . Amasa J. Parker , Lewis 's lawyer , conversed with Mr. Hosmer , Benjamin C. Mead , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Thomas , Cassidy and Force , were in the corridor trying to reassure Maurice Udwin , worried over the fate of his son Slowly the court room filled again and by 8:30 all seats were taken . Just before 10 o'clock it became certain there would be no verdict tonight . Justice Cunningham emerged from his chambers and told a bailiff to announce that the jurors , unable to agree on a verdict , would be sent to bed . Court will be reconvened at 11 o'clock tomorrow . As the crowd filed out , Maurice Udwin remarked : " There is still hope . " Before the jurors left the courtroom they had heard Supreme Court Justice Cunningham deliver a charge which left them no middle ground . They had heard District Attorney James J. Hosmer , in an analytical closing address which lasted nearly all day , conclude by urging them to " do your duty to the State of New York . " As the jurors filed into the room reserved for their use , Justice Cunningham remanded the six prisoners , In shoddy gray uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warden of Auburn prison , there to wait in solitude until their separate fates are decided . " First Degree Murder or Acquittal . " Any hope the six may have had of escaping capital punishment by a verdict of guilty of murder in a lesser degree than charged faded as the court read the thirty-minute charge . Separate verdicts might be found for each of the accused men , Leo Lewis , Claude Udwin , Albert Cassidy , Frank Leagan . Jesse Thomas and William Force , Justice Cunningham declared , but , he warned the jury , they have no choice but to acquit or find the iefendants , guilty of murder in the rirst degree . It was not for them to consider the punishment which would be meted put following a verdict of guilty ; that iVas for the court to think about , raid the judge , who in ten years on : he Supreme Court bench has yet to pronounce his first sentence of death . The jurors need concern themselves only with questions of fact , he aduised them . The chief point at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired the ; hot which caused Sullivan 's death . ' f the jury were " convinced beyond L reasonable doubt " that it was a mllet from the gun of a State troopI. or other officer of the law they must acquit all six defendants he asserted . Judge Defines Charge . If , on the other hand , the jury beieved the State 's contention that the atal bullet was started on its course iy one of the convicts attempting to scape from the prison , first degree ' erdicts must be found against such , f the defendants as were actively articipating of their own free will a an attempt to escape . Since each of the defendants was confined in Auburn prison on commitments for felonies any attempt at escape constituted a felony , the court ruled . That fact was not changed , he added , by any order of General Edgar S. Jennings , the former warden , because such an order , issued by an official in captivity and under duress , was invalid . Any homicide committed during the commission of a felony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not claim , or is it . necessary for them to prove , that one of the men on trial fired the shot which killed Sullivan , he said . It is necessary only to establish that they were " aiding and abetting " other convicts in carrying out a plan to escape , according to the judge , and that during their participation and in furtherance of the plan one of the band fired a shot which caused some one 's death . Defendants ' Claims Recited . Justice Cunningham referred to the testimony of Leagan on the witness stand that he wanted to withdraw from the riot after discovering that State troopers were guarding the gate , but was forced at pistol point by Alexander Tucholka , a rioter who was killed later , to remain loyal to the mutineers . If the jury believed the convict 's story and believed that he took no " further active part " in the riot , he " must be acquitted , " Justice Cunningham asserted . Force testified that he also wanted to withdraw before the start of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was dissuaded by the rifles which , he said , he believed were in the hands of guards stationed in the mess hall , the door of which he would have to pass on the way to his cell . If that were true , Justice Cunningham said , and the jury had " a reasonable doubt " about his further participation in the disorder , " the defendant , Force , is entitled to the benefit of that doubt . " As for Lewis , who claimed insanity , Justice Cunningham held that the burden rested upon the State to prove him sane . He ruled that if the jury felt there was reason to suppose he did not know the " nature and quality of his acts " on Dec. 11 he must be acquitted . He added if that were the ground for a not-guilty verdict in his case the reason must be stated . Thomas Angered at Counsel . Justice Cunningham did not mention Thomas , who admitted on the witness stand that one of the guards , Lucius Huguinen , took a pistol from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas was thrown in the successful effort to rescue the warden and eight guards . The court pointed out that two of the defendants , Udwin and Cassidy , were not sworn as witnesses and that Lewis testified only " as to his mental condition . " These facts , cautioned Justice Cunningham , must not be " considered against them . " When Justice Cunningham concluded the reading of his charge , all six defense attorneys and the District Attorney consented to allow the jurors to take all the exhibits in the case into the juryroom . The exhibits consisted of pistols taken from guards and used by the mutineers , bullets taken from the body of Sullivan , bullet-riddled clothing , pictures and diagrams of the prison . For some reason Thomas was angered by his counsel 's consent , and he left the court room with others in the chain gang , muttering and cursing through lips that were white and tightly drawn over his jutting teeth . Benjamin C. Mead , his attorney , gave his client a wide berth . Counsel Lays Death to Officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence , and then marched out of the courthouse in column of twos and headed for the Osborne Hotel to have their dinner . Justice Cunningham said that if they had not agreed upon a verdict by their usual bedtime , about 11 o'clock , he would tell them to wait until morning to continue their debate . He wanted them to consider the evidence with " minds that are fresh and clear , " he said . The last two days have been trying ones for the jury . All day yesterday they listened to the closing arguments of five defense attorneys . Charles C. Wright , attorney for Cassidy , concluded the presentation of the defense side of the picture this morning in an address which lasted an hour . Mr. Wright declared that the six defendants were " lambs being led to the slaughter . " They had not fired the shot which killed Sullivan , he said . He argued that the convict leader might have been slain by one of the two bullets fired into him by officers of the law , as he lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as by the bullet through his head which the State maintains was fired by a convict . It was not reasonable to suppose that Sullivan was dead when the two shots were fired , Mr. Wright concluded , because " there is no man so despicable as to fire Into the body of a dead man . " ifosmer Decries " Extraneous Matter . " Mr. Hosmer at 11 A. M. began summing up for the prosecution . His address lasted from 11 until 12:30 and from 2 P. M. until 4 , when Justice Cunningham began reading his charge . This is the first murder case the prosecutor has tried since he took office last Jan. 1 and he was intent upon leaving no loopholes . He began by accusing the defense of trying to obscure the facts in the case by introducing extraneous incidents . That was the purpose the defendants ' attorneys had in dwelling upon the manner in which Perry Johnson , a convict , died . Johnson . according to testimony , was forced to brave the fire of his comrades and tear down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson 's death had no bearing on the cases of the six men on trial , Mr. Hosmer argued . Yet he defended the use of the convict as a shield by saying that some one had to go through the door and take down the barricade . It was better , he said , that Johnson should die than that one of the State troopers " like Lieutenant Franklin D. Orser , standing over there , " should be killed . No Connection in Officers ' Shots . The two bullets which were fired into Sullivan after he was dragged out of the gas-filled guardroom had no connection with the case either , Mr. Hosmer declared , for they were fired after the bullet through the back of Sullivan 's head made the convict 's death " inevitable . " He answered the criticism of th , 1 defense attorneys for not producing in court the men who fired the shots into the convict 's prostrate body by asking the jury to consider why the defense had not done so on their own account . Sergeant George Sullivan , assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of two men who were " standing over Sullivan when these shots were fired , " he declared . The real reason they were not called , the District Attorney averred , was that whoever fired into the convict 's body " would be guilty of at least a misdemeanor and you ca n't force any one to testify against himself . " As for the testimony of Erwin Sheldon , the deputy sheriff who swore he heard a shot fired and saw Sullivan fall before any gas bombs were thrown , Mr. Hosiner said he believed " the witness was honestly mistaken . " Juror and Prisoners Doze . It was impossible that this one man , the strongest witness the defense has produced to cast doubt on the theory that Sullivan died by a convict bullet , was right and that all the dozen or more State troopers and guards were wrong , Mr. Hosmer insisted . The long summing-up address was delivered in a tone little above a whisper . Much of it consisted of reading testimony from the record . One of the jurors fell asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas 's head nodded and Lewis nudged him awake . Later Leagan dropped off and Thomas aroused him . Then it was Udwin 's turn to be awakened by Lewis , and Leagan , leaning over to the press bench almost at his elbow , said : " If any of you birds want to leave a call with the clerk , it 's 0 . K. " Mr. Hosmer concluded with a denial of the defense charge that his case grew out of a zeal to wreak vengeance on the survivors of the riot for the injuries inflicted upon guards . He " wished to God " he could have avoided the duty placed upon him by his office , he declared .
