The Bulletin Index is a pert weekly published in Pittsburgh and mainly concerned with Pittsburgh affairs . Last week its editors printed an indignant story ( which they privately regarded as a great scoop ) about a scientific " miscarriage of justice " which was incidentally an outrage to Pittsburgh 's civic pride . <P> The 1937 Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Albert Szent-Gyrgyi , a peripatetic Hungarian who extracted a substance called ascorbic acid from adrenal glands and plants and later identified this acid with Vitamin C ( TIME Nov. 8 ) . Szent-Gyrgyi 's long researches on carbohydrate metabolism and oxidation also counted with the committeemen , but that they were largely preoccupied with Vitamin C this year was shown when they split the Prize for Chemistry between Haworth of England who mapped the vitamin 's complex molecular structure , and Karrer of Switzerland who synthesized it . The Index 's point was that a shy , soft-spoken U. S. chemist , Dr. Charles Glen King of the University of Pittsburgh , was the first to isolate Vitamin C and recognize it as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before Szent-Gyrgyi announced his . <P> The story was ferreted out by an Index reporter who was once an instructor of English at the University of Pittsburgh . With the help of King 's friends , he traced the history of the vitamin in scientific journals . Dr. King 's work , well-known and highly regarded among biochemists , was described two years ago in Outposts of Science , an omnibus of science for laymen by Bernard Jaffe ( a chemist himself ) . Jaffe unequivocally credited King and his coworker , William A. Waugh , with first obtaining the pure vitamin : " On April 4 , 1932 , after seven years of continuous work , King finally isolated fifty milligrams from one litre of lemon juice , and identified the pure crystals . . . . Before scientists gathered at a meeting of the American Society of Biological Chemistry at Philadelphia , King described his method and exhibited some of the crystals . Mc-Collum , * who was in the audience , rose to give King his scientific blessing for having made a great scoop for American Chem-istry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' great vitamin pioneer .
