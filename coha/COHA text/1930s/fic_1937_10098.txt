the jerky background of the Ninth Avenue houses . Fools ! He bit his teeth together disgustedly . Children , I suppose , he said then , babies , that have to have their arses wiped for them while they try in every way to smear themselves from head to foot while you are doing it . That 's a funny thing the way a baby tries to spoil everything you do for it . They hate clothes . When they get their clothes off , they 're happy . Then they kick like frogs . They kick and if you do n't watch yourself they 'll kick themselves right out of your hands . That 's stupid . If you want to feed them , they try to knock it out of your grip . She 's a smart one , though . I think she 's going to have blue eyes . When you come near her , she stops crying . She seems to be listening . She lies still , listening . Then if you pick her up , she 's happy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts crying . She ought to be out in the park these days . But I wo n't push the carriage . That 's a woman 's job . I 'll work , I 'll provide , I 'll be responsible for everything you want of me  --  but I 'll be damned if I 'll push a baby carriage . That 's the place for a baby  --  out in the country . Hello , Frank . Hello , Mr. Stecher , said the night watchmanto him at the entrance to the building . Nice morning , eh ? Yah , a nice day to go fishing . But I guess you 're going to have a big time round here in the next couple of weeks from all they say . Do you think you 'll get the contract again this year ? Sure , said Joe , why not ? Makes a little extra work for me , that 's all replied the old man . Well , you 're paid for it , are n't you ? Yes , I guess so  --  rotten pay , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. F.  --  American Federation of Labour  --  this year ? Do you ? was Joe 's answer . To which the old man said nothing . Letting himself into the empty offices and shop , the stillness of the presses , the dull , cold smell of it , Joe did however think of the old man 's words . Yes , it was a battleground all right , his battleground  --  the bosses on one side and labour on the other  --  he in the middle . And he did n't know whichp51end of the mess was most to be distrusted . Of late  --  well , he did n't know . ' Work , that 's all he had to do for the time being . EIe picked up several torn sheets of paper as he walked down the aisle between the presses  --  muttering to himself as he did so  --  and put them in the waste basket in his own particular corner over by the west windows as far as possible from the main offices . These were partitioned off with oak and opaque glass at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him a small desk  --  as manager  --  and here he had his own safe , his own files which he himself cared for without other assistance . For the twentieth time he took out the six sheets of carefullywritten foolscap and laid them before him , the writing and the numerals on it , a minute , delicate tracery as if it had been engraved  --  a work of art , really . But the art was not really in the writing , that was just the show of it . The meat as well as the art was in the accuracy of the figures . All estimates originated from that corner  --  nothing was done , nothing accepted , without that . And for this he was paid twenty-five hundred a year without vacation . Big money . Yes ? he ran over the figures again rapidly , changed nothing , put the papers back into the safe , closed that and the first of the press hands began to arrive . They wandered over to the lockers one by one and began to take off their collars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose we 're gon na get the God damned Government Contract again this year , said Carmody , one of the pressmen . Why not ? came back from one of the others near him . You ought to be glad you got a job to keep you from starvin '  --  the way you did last winter . I suppose they 'll be havin ' a cop standin ' behind us next when we 're workin ' and send us all home in the Black Maria for safe keepin ' . You can tell what 's up when you see old parrot feet sittin ' at his stall that way this time of the morning.  | Aw go wash your drawers , said another of the men near him . Your old woman 's sinkers is killin ' you . Christ , you guys has got a lot of wakin ' up to do , youse guys  --  if you think you 'll ever get a break around this place  --  as long as that tamale is sittin ' over there in the corner  --  pointing to Joe at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first answered him . A fine labour leader he must a bin . Who the hell do you think he 's workin ' for ? Youse ? He paused a moment . That 's what happens when they come up from the ranks , they turn on you and work the hell out of you for old time 's sake . I got that little Dutchman 's number a long time ago . You wait and see . As Joe pressed the electric buzzer that sounded all through the plant , the men began to move over to the machines . Come on , boys , get to work , said Joe , his watch in his hand , eight o'clock . Right , Mr. Stecher  --  and in a few moments the presses groaned , slapped , grated a little and were off , so that from that time on for the rest of the day  --  save at the noon hour  --  you had to speak at a yell everywhere on the floor to be heard . Later in the morning Joe took his arithmetic in to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he had been told it was n't necessary . Come in , said the boss 's voice on the inside . Then when the door had opened : Oh , good morning , Joe , he added , and how 's the new kid getting along these days ? Fine , sir . Good , I 'm glad that 's off your mind . What do you know about this , Lester ? said he heartily to a young man sitting near him , Joe 's got another daughter . That 's fine , Mr. Stecher , said the Junior partner . Meanwhile Joe was glad Gurlie was n't there . Thank God Gurlie is n't here , thought he , or she 'd make me strike him for a rise.  |p53Probably  all were thinking much the same thing for the moment , for there was an awkward pause . Then Mr. Wynnewoodcleared his throat and resumed : Let 's see the figures . Joe handed them to him . He glanced them over . Hm , that 's what it amounts to , eh ? About the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Joe . Pay roll ? Yes , said Joe . I ) o you want me to check them over ? said the one he had called Lester to the old man . Christ , no , said this one laughing . What the hell would you know about it ? Or me either  --  for that matter . Is n't that right , Joe ? Stecher smiled , his boyish grey eyes twinkling gaily but he said nothing . It was at these moments when he was completelycryptic that the true quality of the man most made itself felt . He closed himself in behind that quiet smile and a complete mystery took place before the onlooker . Old man Wynnewood knew that smile , knew what it meant , knew there was nothing more to be said  --  and knew besides that it was all to the good as far as the Wynnewood CrossmanCo. was concerned , there was n't an abler printer than Joe Stecher in New York City . But the old man was n't cntircly satisfied with his manager for all that , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe 's unfailingreticence . Joe 's too honest , the old man would say sometimes . Christ , you ca n't carry on a business that way . I low much do we make on it this time , Joe ? said he to his manager who was still standing there waiting . " Ten per cent that 's what you wanted , is n't it ? Think we 'll underbid them ? Joe smiled . Ca n't see how anybody could honestly bid less and do the work at a profit , was his answer.  | All right , thanks , Joe . When are the bids opened ? Monday , the 23rd. 10 A.M. at the Post Office in Washington . Thanks , I 'll go down myself this year . Look over your pressmen and weed out anyone you do n't want . Fire ' em , that 's all . We do n't want any breakdown this time once we get going . When Joe had left the office Mr. W took up the figures again . Take a look at this , Lester , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't see anything like this again as long as you 're in the printing business in this unchristly hole of a country . Look at it . And what the hell good is it ? Do you think I 'm gon na send those figures in ? Like hell I am . And he knows I ai n't gon na send them in either . Those are our figures , that 's what it costs us to do the job and I tell you one thing , those figures are right to a split nickel . Well , what 's the dope then ? What 's the dope ? Can we do business on a lousy t o% margin ? On a government contract ? When we go down there and those bids are opened we 're gon na be close to the top bidder and every bid under ours is gon na be thrown out  --  that 's the way we work it , that 's your father 's job . I 'm tellin ' you . Every bid under the bid of Wynnewood Crossman Co. goes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're going up to the club . It was hot in the shop that day . Word got around that the old man was out to skin the hide off the loafers and the machines banged and clattered all day without a let-up . Joe walked up and down the aisles a couple of times , checked on a few proofs here and there but aside from that it was just a day like any other . When the men were going out , he happened to be over near the door looking over the addresses on some mail that was stacked to go out in the morning . As Carmody passed by him , Joe looked up and fixed the man with his eye for the flick of a second . Good night.  |p55Good  night , said the pressman . Finally when everyone had gone , Joe went quickly , expertly , among the machines to ace that the rollers were properly lifted and everything tidy , took another final look around , then locked up the place and started out for home as usual . Sunset  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North River . He always sat on the west side of the car going home so that he could look up from his paper and see the sun setting over Jersey  --  where he wanted to live some day  --  in the country . Gotterdammerung , he said to himself unaccountably as he caught sight again of the red blur . A fine day today though , he added . A fine May day . When he arrived home Gurlie was giving the baby a bath before putting it to bed . Joe forgot all about supper in his amusement . He took off his coat , took Lottie , the older girl , on his knee and sat at one side to watch his wife go through the simple ceremony . He felt like that today . There were no frills to it when Gurlie did anything . But she was in one of her gay humours tonight so everybody felt happy . Look at the thing , she said , having stripped the baby and laid it on a blanket over the tubs . The darlin ' , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from your side of the family . Anybody could see that . Yah , said Joe , it 's a smart kid . You think you 're clever , said Gurlie , laughing , when you say a thing like that . Well , you are a smart little Dutchie , or I would n't have married you . You can bet on that , bejabbers . Gurlie was fond of imitating the Irish when she felt in a good humour . Look out , said Joe , as his wife grabbed up the baby in one hand as she attempted to lift the half full tub out of the sink with the other . You 'll drop it . Drop it , me eye , answered the mother sturdily . You 've got a smart head , but I 'm the one  --  in this family  --  yah ?  | Well , be careful of the baby , said Joe , Never mind anything else . The older girl came close so that when the baby was slopped into the tub it splashed out some water which wet her shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the baby was in the water , it folded up its little legs and shot them out like a bull frog until the mother almost dropped it entirely . She let out a yell of laughter . What , she said , look at it ! look at it ! Go on , wash it , said Joe . Do n't stand there playing with it . Look at it , said Gurlie , it 's stronger than you think . I think it could swim . In some places they put little babies like that in the water and they swim . Well , do n't you try it with this one . Say , who 's washing this baby , you or me ? Look out ! said Joe . You 'll drown it . That 's what it needs , replied his wife mockingly . So Gurlie ably and quickly made a few passes with a cloth up and down the baby 's back and belly , here , there and around , and she was through . She picked the child out of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mind your own business , said his wife nonchalantly rubbing the baby vigorously with a towel . Give me those clothes . You 're one of those important blokes that has to tell everybody how to do everything . Well , you can boss your printers and the rest of the men down there , but you ca n't boss a woman  --  you ca n't boss me . For some reason  --  tonight this sort of thing only made Joe feel warmer inside  --  and made him chuckle and laugh  --  it relieved him and made him love her the more  --  whereaswhen he was tired some days  --  he nearly wanted to kill her . But today was a happy day  --  any way you looked at it.  |p57Yah  , you 're right , he said . How 's supper ? Oh you get out of here . And she shook her wet hand in his face . He jumped . The child at the window laughed outright and coming forward wanted to throw water too . But her mother waved her off with a sweep of the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good riddance , she answered . But he stayed to watch her nevertheless . The infant , drugged by the warm bath , drowsy , lay back perfectly contented and smiling . She put it into its crib as if she had been putting down a cat , tossed the covers over it and taking up the bottle , felt if it was warm enough , pushed it into the baby 's mouth  --  as it lay on its back with its head turned to one side  --  balanced it on a folded diaper and said to Joe who was watching her : Come on now , leave it alone . Go sit down . Get out of the way . But he merely stepped back and let her pass , turning again to look at the baby whose little hands were pressed hard together as it sucked so that the fingers seemed quite bloodless . Come on get your supper , Gurlie called to him from the other room , if you 're so hungry . He could smell it already and it smelled good . He went at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delicious . Down in his heart he loved this wife of his like nothing else in the world . She was beyond him  --  everything which he was not . Fine ! he commented generously  --  when he felt that way . One thing I 'll say for you , he said , as he sat in his shirt sleeves and unfolded his napkin . You are a fine cook . All Scandinavians are , she came back at him swiftly . If you give us money enough to do it with.  |p58T  H E baby , still scarcely more than six pounds in weight , lay upon Gurlie 's hands across her lap as she sat at the front window looking out . It pumped its legs , waved its arms as she held it listlessly . Then it puckered its face and once again coughed and wheezed out its cries of cat , fowl or whatever other straining barnyard thing no one could say . So hard it forced itself it farted at the other end in its effort and its voice finally whistled in its throat . Gurlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggling infant  --  not bewilderedly but absently with some amazement but no recognition in it . Then she stood up , comforted the baby gently for a moment against her breast and  --  though it was still crying  --  placed it in its crib and walked away . She closed the door behind her , walked to the other end of the house and sat at the back window , there to continue looking out . It was mid afternoon , the small back yards were full of new washed clothes . Well , said Joe coming in later on  --  at the usual time , how have things been today ? We 've got to get out of this place by the first of July , was her answer . We have a lease , said Joe . Well , do you want the baby to die because of your lease ? She 'll die here , stay home and take care of her yourself then . God damn it , said Joe , flaming into a sudden wild fury , get the hell out of here then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face had gone suddenly ashy white , his eyes seemed to or actually did sink into his head , from which they lookedp59out as beasts from their caves . What the hell good are you here anyway ? He shouted , he stormed , he took hold of a book and dashed it to the floor . His wife cowered away from him , laughing but backing up . She stopped and straightened finally , just stood and tried to get in a word . Shush ! Shush ! What 's the matter with you ? You act like a fool . I did n't say anything . What ! he shouted at her  --  beginning to cool in spite of himself  --  forcing himself now suddenly to appear angrier than he was . What ? you did n't say anything ? Do you know what it would cost us to pay rent here and in some other god damned stinking hole in this .. . Hey you ! She broke in . The neighbours will think you are crazy . I do n't give a good god damn . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you a hundred times . Fifty dollars a week . What 's the good of talking to you ? But we have to live on that . We have to sleep , eat , dress , travel , amuse ourselves on that  --  that 's all we have . We ca n't afford any more . Do you understand that ? Can you get that much through your thick head ? We ca n't , we ca n't . I do n't care what you do . What do I care ? I tell you we 've got to move . We 've got to . Do you understand that ? Or else the baby will die . It ca n't live here , I ca n't take it out into the street every minute . It has no air , it 's dying from these rooms . I 'm dying . We 're all dying here . You do n't look it , said Joe . We 've got to go somewhere where there is more fresh air , somewhere near the river  --  or anywhere . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , get more money then . Tell them you 've got to have it . Tell them if they do n't give it to you you 'll quit . Sure , sneered Joe , that 's a bright idea ! Ha , ha , ha ! Thenp6o we wo n't have anything at all . We can sit on the gutter then , ca n't we ? And eat out of garbage cans . You make me sick , answered his wife . Are you afraid ? Is that what it is ? Afraid to ask them ? Afraid to quit if they wo n't give it to you ? Let them fire you . That is n't what scared me ! I 'll sit on the curb if I have to , I 'm not ashamed . You 'd be ashamed to . That 's what 's the matter with you . We 've got to have the money and you 're afraid to make them give it to you . Let me go down there . That always sobered Joe , for he did have a fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and make a scene . He cooled down now rapidly  --  and began to use his head . The colour began to come back into his cheeks  --  but steadily now he was breathing easier and his heart thumped less violently . Go wash your face and hands and come in to supper , said his wife to him at last . And he went silently as she bade him . How about some beer ? Yes , said Gurlie , but you ought to be hit over the head with it instead of drinking it . This made him laugh , a good chuckling laugh and by the time he came to sit at the table he was again in reasonablygood humour . Where 's Louie ? he asked . Oh yes , he answered himself , remembering that she had been sent away to a relative for the time being . You get so excited , commentedGurlie , that you do n't even know what you 're talking about . Yah , he answered , eating carefully . Open a bottle for me . Gurlie had to do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing and plunge , as if brushing some petty obstacle out of her way , which was always impressive . There it is , quick ! But it foamed over on the cloth before he could get his glass to it . There , he scolded . What 's that ? she replied definitively , giving the spot a swipe with her finger . When do we move ? Before July first is what you said , did n't you ? Go aheadTHE BOUNDARIES OF THOUGHT 61p61and find a place . Hire a palace on Fifth Avenue . We ca n't pay for it , what do we care ? Go ahead , see what you can find . But do you think we can sublet this one ? she asked somewhatdisturbed  --  not having thought of that previously . Why bother , he answered , we have lots of money . But after supper when he was sitting in the front room reading his paper he called to her . What do you want ? she rcplied . Here , he said and pointed to the paper in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad among the apartments-to-let column . This is over near the East River , near the Astoria ferry . Do you mean it ? she said . But what about this place ? Leave that to me . To you ? She hesitated a moment looking at him , then came over and began to stroke his hair somewhat roughly . No , he said , go away , get out . . . but he liked it just the same . Gurlie called him her smart little Dutchie in a lisping , babyish voice which he could never quite fathom and finally went back to the kitchen where he could hear her singing a few unmusical yodeling notes . But the next morning , though nothing was said of it at breakfast  --  nothing whatever  --  as soon as Joe had gone down the stairs on his way to the office , Gurlie took the baby up to the woman in the flat above her and set out on her strong , straight legs , walking  --  across Central Park  --  toward the East Side . Immediately she was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a drunkenness shot through her  --  the impersonal joy of people used to the country who have been cooped and tormented by city exigencies . It was a clear , hot day . She did not linger however but hurried on to her destination . With the piece torn from the newspaper in her hand she went on until she stood before the house itself and looked up . The revulsion she felt at the sombre , rather respectablep62building with its fire escapes and grey brick facade struck her motionless for a moment . But finally she shrugged her shoulders and went in . Not on your life would she take that apartment ! She gave it one sniff . What else have you ? So the janitress showed her one on the third floor , seven rooms , newly trimmed and papered which she knew at once was too expensive for her , but .. . No , she said , and walked out . And for two hours thereaftershe walked the streets looking at other places until her mind was made up . She went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked it over once more , told the woman to hold it until the next day and took the 86th St. horse car to the West Side once more . Joe argued , lost his temper a few times but finally  --  and within no more than a week  --  the family found itself established in the new location . It was really a very pleasant place , quiet , cool , with good rooms , in a respectable German neighbourhood . But , of course , it was too big . Gurlie solved that at once , though only in part , by having her mother , who had been living in Brooklyn , come to live with her . The old lady took one look at the baby whom she had not seen more than once or twice in its short existence and said at once that she prayed God would take it . She shook her head and over and over again said the same thing . And that was one of the things that helped to save its life  --  for that made Gurlie mad . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage . She too prayed , that the baby should be saved and she worked hard to give it the air and sunlight which her instinct told her it must have . How she did walk  --  she and the baby . The park and the river were her resorts . She travelled the ferry time and time again , over to Astoria and back , and then one day a German woman with a big husky child on her arm stopped to look at the puny infant.  |p63What  are you feeding it ? Gurlie told her . Good ! said the woman . Give it all it wants though  --  whenever it yells . From that time things went better . But Gurlie grew tired of walking and one night announ-d a servant.  |p64How  much does a little thing like that really know ? said Joe half to himself one evening . It does n't look as if it ever would know anything , said his wife sitting nearby . It 's a smart kid , Joe went on . All it does is cry , broke in the grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and walked by the hour with it always in the park  --  with her slow gangling gait , looking around over her shoulder whenever she 'd hear some outcry of the playing children there , or sitting lazily watching the smart carriages go by on the drive . But she liked the baby and considered her job minding it a pleasant and amusing one . That 's the worstest lookin ' baby I ever did see , she would say to herself putting it in the carriage or taking it out as it wobbled and slid about in her able hands , the po'est baby I ever had to do with  --  as if she had ever had to do with any white baby before  --  which she certainly had n't . But she was a natural mother for all her lack of years . And she 'd give black looks to anyone who happened to look into the carriage , some old lady who would perhaps exclaim at the baby 's appearance . It was from the beginning the baby 's very scrawniness which seemed to fascinate her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was charmed by its curiousness , its unlikeness to anything familiar to her in her brief experience of living . It tickled her to see it naked , she 'd grin all over and shake her head from side to side : Well , if you ai n't the worst ! Butp65Gurlie kept pretty close watch on the little nigger  --  for a time , so Vinie could only stand by and watch while the baby 's toilette was being made , her hands on her hips , her head on one side , her face intent on watching every movement of her white mistress . Can I . . . wo n't you let me dress her this mornin ' , Mrs. Stecher ? No , said Gurlie . But one day the third week , a hot day , Gurlie had to take her mother over to Brooklyn , so after several words in Norwegianbetween the two women , Gurlie came to Vinie and said they were going to leave the baby alone with her  --  that it was asleep and maybe it would sleep till she came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth . To which Vinie nodded solemnly : Yas 'm . Yas 'm . It was awfully hot in the apartment . Vinie watched from the front window as the ladies emerged from the door downstairs , looked up and then , seeing her , walked slowly down the street and finally disappeared . There she continued to lean listlessly in the baking sun for half an hour , kneeling on the floor and looking up and down , leaning way out to try and look into the apartment next door  --  which she could n't quite do . So she pulled her head in and after getting a drink of water at the tap in the kitchen , soaking her face and head there , letting the water run up and down her arms , she shook her hands more or less dry and went in to see if the baby was still asleep . And there she sat down and looked at it till it opened its eyes to hers . That made her goggle and look around instinctively to see if she were being watched . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big bed and saying to herself , out loud , that it was an awful hot day , she started to take off the baby 's clothes . What you doin ' ? she said to herself . What you doin ' takin ' of that baby 's clothes ? Didn ' I tell you never to do that ? Did n't I tell you ? But she kept on steadily , carefully undressingthe baby for all that . It grinned its crooked little grin at her as she lifted and turned it  --  which encouraged her to1 '  | work rapidly . Her heart was beating with excitement . Carefully she spread a soft cotton blanket on the big bed and upon it lay the completely naked baby  --  carefully , skilfully . There , she said at last , tha 's the way . There you is . There you sho'ly is . You ai n't got nothin ' on you . You ai n't got nothin ' on you at all . Nothin ' . Tha 's what you like . Tha 's yo ' summer dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that . Flow you like it ? For a fact the baby liked it immensely in that hot room , if actions mean anything , for it lay completely relaxed on its back , its head moving slowly about as if it were viewing the room though its eyes did n't seem to focus on anything  --  or if so just for a moment and then wandered on . What you seein ' ? asked Vinie watching it intently . Can you see Vinie ? Hea ! here , she moved her own face so as to get it into the baby 's line of vision , but without result . Tha 's a funny baby , she said now . You is a real funny baby , she changed her manner , talking direct to the little mite . You ai n't even a cat . How big is you ? With that , she put her elbow down on the bed by the baby 's feet and then lay her forearm down beside the baby , her finger tips coming just to the mite 's rounded crown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big you is , half an arm . The baby was playing up to the girl 's gentle voice and easy manner to perfection . With half closed eyes , it moved first a finger then an arm as if talking some mysterious sign language . Vinie could n't contain her curiosity . She got right onto the bed beside the baby and started carefully to look it over . For no reason at all her look began at the belly button . Now will you tell me what in the world is that to do for ? she wondered to herself . She took her finger and gently pushed at the small rosette of skin where the umbiiicalcord had grown , then put her hand up to her own belly feeling there also . She looked deeper into the little umbilical pit , spreading the skin apart and saw there a little accumula/lion of cotton dust which with great care she picked out upon her sharp finger nails . The baby did not move but ' teemed to enjoy the play . But all at once the infant voided freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had been quicksilver  --  without sinking in . Vinie jumped and in a flash was back with h a diaper . It had not got on the coverlet  --  luckily . Man A l i v e ! she breathed , is I lucky ! The whiteness of the baby 's body caused her to look and look again . She pinched the flesh of the belly gently up between her fingers , shaking her head again and again . So flabby was the skin that it remained that way , pinched up , for several moments after she had withdrawn her hand . You ho ' is po ' , was her only comment . Its little ribs seemed to slide back and forth under the 1,111 as the infant breathed , irregularly . Now it would take 11 ' If a dozen rapid , fluttering inhalations . Then it would strip , it seemed , no sign of life there , then the fluttering . Its hands were open but the minute Vinie went to look at them they closed vigorously shut so that she hardly daredspread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there , inlittle sweaty palms , were the same dust flakes she had elsewhere . The feet squirmed and drew back suddenly from her hands , sharply with a snap . But somehow the baby did not cry . Vinie was slow and gentle . You ai n't got no legs at all , said the girl sympathetically. o more than a frog . But the little feet wiggled and twisted away each time she put her hand upon them . And your armsworse . But when the baby got a grip on the coloured girl 's tong index fingers with each of its tiny fists , Vinie could almost lift it from the bed . The diminutive pimples of the breasts next caught her cyc , she gently rubbed them with her finger tips as the hairy squirmed and stretched . Tickles , huh ? she said . Tha 's tight . All under the opaque white skin she could make out On . blue veins . Blue blood , like you Mammy say.  | Rather uncertainly she looked now at the miniature middle parts but got to laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with a deprecatory  --  You 's a girl all right . You ai n't no boy . A white girl , they ai n't no difference  --  do n't seem to be  --  she turned to the baby 's ears and nose and face with evident relief . By chance her finger fell into the fontanelle whose lack of bone made her pull back her hand suddenly . That was one too many for her . The time was getting on . Hurriedly she began dressing the baby which , when finally she had clothed it as it had been before , she put it back in its crib , then giving it its bottle as she knew how to do , she left it and lay down on her own bed where Gurlie found her fast asleep  --  the baby crying  --  when she returned at six , all excitement and bustle to begin to get supper ready . The grandma went in to the baby and picked it up instantly , found it soaked , and spoke sharply to the mother in Norwegian while Vinie stood with wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Agh , nonsense , replied Gurlie in English to the older woman , leave it alone . Take the baby out of here , I 've got to get supper . She was satisfied with Vinie who only cost her two dollars a week and could n't bother to get another girl . The grandmother took the baby and went away still talking . Sure , if you pick the baby up every time it opens its trap , said Joe later in the evening , it will get to like it . Would n't you ? To this the grandmother objected that it would ruptureitself if it were left to cry . How many babies have you known that ruptured themselves crying ? asked Joe . None , because we pick them up when common sense tells us to in my country . Then what are you talking about ? was his reply . Anyhow the baby , who began crying again at that time , was picked up and he went out of the room . How long is the old lady going to live with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't take it amiss as c thought she might  --  for he was half joking . She herself ad not been so well satisfied with the new menage since it ad been growing on her in the past few weeks . Seizing the situation as it stood , she told her husband she would likenothing better than her mother out of it  --  any time they could find a place for her  --  the sooner the better . Turn out the light  --  hard , he replied . I 've smelt gas round this place ever since we moved into it . Did that damned little nigger come in yet ? Oh , go to sleep , said his wife . Good night , she added aning over him . Go on away , he answered her , it 's too hot might for that sort of thing . But he kissed her just the rile . Mornings Gurlie bathed the baby with her own hands  --  ke that ! A blanket on the table , as the mother laid the Pant down , brusquely , feeling the hard under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over-balanced by the eight of its own occiput , rolled half to one side , felt itself ailing and in a sudden fright threw out all its limbs , rigid , d instinctively caught its breath then let out a convulsive cll . Then in the effort rolled wildly to the other side , greened and kicked out stiff again , yelling , shaking and rowing red with the effort . It 's all right , said Gurlie in her usual collected manner , rawing the water . All right ? said her mother hurrying to pick it up . It 's terrified . That 's no way to treat a baby . Oh , said Gurlie , I 'm watching it . Yes , you 're watching it . It could kick itself onto the floor . I pray God may take it  --  you 'll never raise it this way . on let it lie there . You let that ignorant child mind it . ou are not a mother to it . You should hold it in your arms . I do , said Gurlie . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held.  |p70Look  at the back of its head , all the hair is worn off . That 's how much you mother it . Vinie had noticed that too . Look at it , flying in all directions . It does n't know what to do . Babies should be swaddled to hold their legs straight , to make them feel firm . But I am old fashioned , I know nothing . Nothing but a diaper that is too big for it  --  a big wad of cloth pushing its poor little legs out like a frog . You do n't even know how to put on a diaper . But you wo n't listen to me . Its legs need to be comfortable and firmly held . And it should not be left to cry . Well , pick it up then when it cries . It knows how to get what it wants . Ever since you came here it cries and you pick it up . Now you 've taught it that . Sure , Joe would say at such a time , I told you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes to all this , Vinie too would say : Lady , you sho ' knows what you want  --  amazed , amused , when the baby would be convulsed with crying , her sensitive mouth opening in imitation of the baby 's who would be mad through . But most mornings , the weather being fine , when the baby would begin its whining yell , Gurlie would call to Vinie to drop whatever she was doing and take it out  --  into the park . And she had never to speak twice . We got that fixed , said Vinie to the baby , taking it downstairs . When you wants to take yo ' ride , you yells . And I 's here to take you . And does you know it ? Once in the park the morning ramble would begin once more . The baby drowsy or else its eyes wide open , staring , or so it seemed , at the joggling fringe at the edge of the hood which the mother would tell Vinie to pull down to keep the sun out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way ? Vinie would say to the baby , later on . And back she would push the hood , though if the baby squinted and blinked too much she was carefulp71to turn round and walk away from the sun until she could find a shady bench to sit on and watch the squirrels or the others like herself with children there . If the baby yelped she 'd look at it , change it or joggle it awhile , then if it went on yelling she 'd sit and look at it intently , watching how its little mouth would go into a square , showing the gums and the curled back tongue , stiffened , unmoving as the surprising sound issued from that hollow throat . Vinie would try to look far down to see if she could see where all that noise came from . The whole posture , lips and tongue , might have been a flower so unaffectedly did the little coloured girl look at it sometimes . Itses would pucker closed . If it got its cap cockeyed over nc eye , even down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You sho ' can cry . You sho ' can cry when you gets setit . Then she 'd be attracted by some other happening and appear to forget the baby . Till it would stop . Then she'draighten it , get up maybe and walk a little further . These summer days were doing the infant a world of good . But what would the fall and winter bring later ? Itas hard to say . But as the thing seemed to know when to cry so that the grandmother would rescue it , so in the end it learned not to cry when in the park with Vinie . Mostly as July wore on it would rest quietly in the carriage when outdoors , or miraculouslycease crying as soon as Vinie spoke to it . It lay in the sun moving its hands , tentatively fumbling with them in spasmodic jerks along the cotton quilt , then wildly gripping  --  the air  --  or whatever came against kin locking its fingers into the loose fabric and holding on like grim death . Leggo , Vinie would say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the baby would swing the other hand up and grab lindly with that also . Her face would be all excitement at such times , her whole body would draw itself up and she'd try to cram the object , no matter what it was , toward her mouth . I 'll fix you one of these days , you wait and see , said Vinie , if you suck that blanket that way . Look , at yo ' mouth , all red slobber . Leggo ! I 'll put some pepper on yo ' fingers . You see if I don't.  |p73OSCAR  ! Gott , Gurlie ! You 're getting good looking . Joe must be making money . Come in . Where in the world did you come from ? What 's happened to bring you here ? Thanks . Chicago . Nothing . Give us a kiss . He made to kiss her on the lips but she turned her cheek . Go long wid you . How are you anyway ? he said then . Fine . But what brings you here , insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , straight through thecountry . Where is everybody ? Where 's Lottie ? And thebaby ! Hey Lottie . There was a small commotion of a chair and little feet at the other end of the corridor . Shhh ! said Gurlie . Lottie 's in the kitchen and the baby 's sleeping . Come in here . And she pushed the curtains back from the big door to the front room . Oh , sleeping ! said the man in a whisper . But when he had got into the parlour he spoke out again . Ump um ! I should say ! Joe is making money . Do n't be silly , said Gurlie . Rents are very cheap down here . Ha , ha ! Quit your kidding , he answered her . Sit down here , said Gurlie , and do n't make so much noise with your big voice . Oh , is that so ? said Oscar . But he sat down easily andp74carefully for all that . Do you think it will hold me ? But that was n't the kind of question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to load it up but stopped and put it back in his pocket after a moment . Were you fired ? said Gurlie standing before him with her arms akimbo . No , said the man , I quit . Yes , you did n't , replied his sister-in-law looking down at him . Did they close down ? Be yourself , Sis . I got tired of hefting their beef . Wanted a little air . Life . The big city . You know . Got a place here to put me up in ? For how long ? About a year maybe ? And he roared out his amused laugh at the look which came over her face . Go on , find Lottie for me . And wake the baby . Tell her her old German uncle from the wicked west is here with a horse and wagon for her . What you worrying about ? But Gurlie did n't move . I 've got my card , have n't I ? I can get a dozen jobs anytime I want ' em . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even bring a satchel ? asked Gurlie . Sure . I left it down at the room . Oh , said Gurlie , brightening . What 's that ? pointing to a big paper bundle he had dropped into a chair . Presents ? As they turned , at a little sound , they saw a serious blackcurl-surroundedface looking at them from the edge of the curtains . You do n't mean that 's Lottie ? said the man getting up slowly . Gott in himmel ! Why she was just a baby . And he went over and raised the little tot in his hands as though she were a kitten . She grinned sheepishly down at him without a kick or quiver . Then smiled from ear to ear . Lottie : said the man . Do n't you know me ? How could she ? said the mother . After almost two years.  |p75Leave  her to me , said Oscar . So Gurlie went out , saying she would make him some toffee . I drink this ! said the little girl showing a small bottle unobservedby the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . What ? said Oscar . Let 's see that . by that 's medicine . Hey , you Gurlie ! What 's this ? .. . t the cork was still firmly in place and so no harm had en done . Gurlie went back to the kitchen . Then the child cld out one foot , the shoe unbuttoned  --  and looked downt it . Oscar picked her up and placed her upon his left thigh ith her two feet sticking out in front of her and did up her buttons : And there you are . The child looked up at him and smiled . Where do you Weep ? she said . Where do I sleep ? Well , by God , Lottie , that 's a good one . Why , on my head , of course . Where do you sleep , on girl ? Tell me that . But the child just kept looking up fascinated at him where she sat sidewise on his lap . Can lay here ? And so they talked together while Gurlie was making the coffee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something nice , said c man . But first standing with the little girl between his ands he began raising her up as if he were going to toss her to the air : Ein , Zwei . And a half ! and he did n't toss her her all . Then again . Ein , Zwei . And this time at Drei he live her a full toss so that she flew up , her arms spread wide , her legs out , high into the air , looking down at himstill unafraid , into his eyes  --  and he caught her under the armpits , easily breaking her fall . And again . And again . Until she began to laugh drunkenly and he saying : Whoops ! Whoops , every time and , There she goes ! Well , what 's this ? suddenly broke in a voice from the doorway , and there stood a tall , thin woman in street clothes end a hat , looking in from beside the curtains . Oscar , put the child down . Both stood there looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how did you get in ? Well , if you leave your front door open .. . Silly , we always leave it open , said Gurlie . Do n't you know who this is ? This is Oscar , Joe 's brother . You 've often heard us speak of him . This is my sister Hilda . Oh you mean ? I 'm very pleased to meet you , said Hilda coming forward . Same here , said Oscar taking her hand . Ouch ! said Hilda . Ha , ha , said Oscar , did I squeeze it too tight ? Ooo ! said Hilda again , what hands ! Gurlie brought out a little table and they had coffee and cakes . Lottie sat on the man 's knee and ate what she pleased in spite of the protests of the women . She even had some coffee . Tell you what we 'll do , said Oscar at last . I 'm feeling good . Let 's have a party tonight . What sort of a party ? said Gurlie . Let 's give Joe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? Bring what in ? said Gurlie . Everything . What time is it now ? Four o'clock . In half an hour . Auf Wiedersehen ! And he was on his way , kissing Lottie in departing and bending his head again at the curtains as he went through . She ran to the window to see him go running down the front steps . And that is Joe 's brother ! said Hilda catching her breath after the cyclone had departed . Yes , said Gurlie . Now I 'll have to work . Is that the one ... ? Yes . Here , help me take out these things . What did he do ? persisted the thin auntie . He ran off with the general 's wife ? Gurlie laughed heartily . His captain'swife , said she , not the general 's . Oh , said Hilda , and so he had to come to America . That is very romantic . A lazy , good-for-nothing , replied Gurlie , coming likep77this in the middle of the afternoon to disturb everybody . Joe should have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on her . See here ! she said , do n't you say anything against my husband . Why I never said anything against Joe , replied the thin ' untie . Yes , you did , came back Gurlie . That one can run away with a married woman . And you think that 's fine , you think that 's wonderful . Foolish people like you . But his brother had to work , from the time he was a little boy , slid bring up the whole pack of them . No , no , you ca n't Soy anything against Joe . Look out for that in your hand . She stopped , listening , both listened . And sure enough the baby 's thin cry could be heard coming fitfully from the back of the house . I ere , said Gurlie , when they reached the kitchen , you can make good cakes . There 's all you need  --  somewhere in here . Make a cake . I do n't know what you want , replied lilda . A cake , said Gurlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you need ? Here are three oranges . Make an range cake . All right , said the thin auntie , but it 's only four o'clock . Take this , said Gurlie , handing her an apron . Roll up your sleeves . And before she knew much more about it Hilda was hard at it mixing up a cake batter while Gurlie Was prodding the range with broad skilfull hands untilc had a roaring fire there . Her hands were grimy and her blonde hair was in wisps flying about her forehead and temples . Vinie ! she called and the lanky coloured girl came in with the baby on her arm and Lottie traipsing after her . Come here , put down that baby . Yas 'm . Take the things off those tuts . Yas 'm . And the baby having been propped up in a high , rolling chair with a pillow , was given a wooden spoon to play with . Lottie wanted it and deliberately pulled it out of the baby 's grip , tho ' the mite , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main  --  yet it was taken from her . Waaaa ! she yelled . Then the door bell rang . Vinie went . And with a great clatter in came Oscar , a case of beer on his left shoulder and a bushel basket heaped with small packages , unwrapped vegetables and a bottle , in the crook of his right arm . Here we are , he called out . I rang the bell with my elbow . Could n't push the door open . Oh ! shouted the ladies in amazement . Oscar ! what have you done ? But with that case of beer on your shoulder that way , you should n't .. . Who ? laughed the man . But you 've bought too much . What is this ? Everything . Then he saw the baby and stopped . The baby ! said he . And he dropped everything to the floor and went over at once to the chair where little Flossie was still sobbing , broken-hearted , over the loss of her spoon . Then he turned seriously to Gurlie : Is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who 's taking care of her ? He turned to Vinie who backed off with a scared expression to her face . She 's too thin . Why do n't you feed her ? Leave the child alone and mind your own business , said Gurlie . We have work to do if we 're going to cook all that stuff you 've brought in . I think you 're crazy  --  for four people . And there was Lottie crowding in  --  or trying to  --  between him and the baby , looking up at him with big , reproachful eyes . Let 's see what they gave us , he said . Gurlie started to laugh in spite of herself . And who 's going to fix that chicken ? Me , I suppose . Watch someone as can fix a chicken , he replied . And to Vinie 's intense amusement , he threw off his coat , rolled up his sleeves , tucked a kitchen towel around his waist  --  he wore no vest  --  and the game was on . But not until he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and : What about the gal ? he said turning to Vinie . But Gurlie shook her head . No ! at Vinie behind his back . No , not for her , said Gurlie , she does n't like it . So Vinie looked down and sucking in her lips tried not to laugh . Here 's to success ! said Oscar , come on Lottie , take a sip . Success ! and the ladies said the same . And some meat on your bones , Babes ! He leaned down to the baby . Pros't ! And he drank the glass down as if in one swallow to the baby 's health and filled up another . The time flew , as did their fingers . Soon the kitchen was filled with delicious smells . Whee ! said Gurlie , open those windows at the top . And how old were you when you were in the German army ? asked the thin auntie . Eighteen , said the man , in the Kaiser 's Dragoon Guards , not a man among us under six feet in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is very romantic , said I filth . Was she very beautiful ? Oscar gave Gurlie a broad wink . Wunderschon ! It was love at first sight . And then ? said Hilda eagerly . And then , when it was too late , I found she was my captain 's wife . Nonsense , said Gurlie . You must have known who she was . No , no , said Hilda , such things do happen . But you do not understand , you are not romantic , she concluded addressing her sister . On my soul I did n't , said Oscar melodramatically . I thought she was free . What could I do when I found other-wise ? But what were you doing when they found you ? There we were , continued Oscar . It was a dark moonlightnight . I had climbed from the back window of the kaserne , dropped twenty feet to the ground .. .  |p8oI  do n't believe a word of it , said Gurlie . Why yes , said the thin auntie . That is how these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gurlie . I 'll bet you do . Wait till you try it . I 'll bet she saw he was a nice boy and took him by the ear ... But did you . . . did you ? Did they catch you ? continued Hilda ignoring her sister . No , not exactly , said Oscar , a little sobered in spite of himself . Not exactly . Or else I would n't be here . Well , here 's to the living . And he downed another glass of beer . Anyhow , she was a fine woman . The baby was crying again . Lottie had pushed her sister 's chair far over , little by little , while they were talking , against the wall with her face the other way . Look , said Gurlie , laughing . Look what she 's done . Vinie , come here . But Vinie who had been setting the table in the other room frowned heavily at the older child as she brought the baby , still crying , around to face the room again . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , said Oscar , let her stay . They like to cry . That 's their profession . The first thing they take up is crying . And with that the baby stopped at once and a broad , sunny grin spread over her features all running wet with tears  --  the toothless grin of a five months old baby  --  while she snuggledher face down shyly into her pillow having attracted attention to herself at last . Why do n't you get married , you like babies so much , said Hilda . It 's bad luck , said the ex-cavalryman . I once heard of a man who did it  --  and his wife lived to be a hundred . Well look out , you smart guys , began Gurlie . But she suddenly changed her mind . What time is it ? Look and see , Vinie . Ten minutes past six , Ma'm.  |p81Then  a wild scramble ensued . Why , the baby should be fcd and asleep by this time . But she was jabbering loudly and gaily along with the others and banging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Oscar . I 'll have to clean myself up , said Hilda . Chairs were rushed about . Then , as it approached six-thirty  --  all traces of excitement were ironed out , not an unusual sound or sight prevailed , just the smell of the roast chicken , and  --  the sound of a key could be heard in the front door . It was Joe . Helloooo ! he called out . No answer . Hey he said then . Where is everybody ? Oh , is it you , said Gurlie coming forward . Then she lost control a little , took him by both cheeks , pinching him hard with her strong hands and kissed him vigorously all over the face . It 's me darlint , she said , my little Dutchie . Leave me alone , he protested harshly . What 's the matter with you ? You 've been drinking . Get out of here . And with that Oscar and Hilda rushed forward into the hall . Hello , Joe ! What 's this ! What 's this ! said Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . For what ? said Joe . A party ? For us ! said Gurlie . It 's Oscar 's treat . That 's good , said Joe . I suppose he has lots of money . Well , how arc you ? Glad you came . Let 's go into the other room . The dinner was tremendous . Skol ! said Gurlie holding a glass up to her husband 's nose . Skol ! come on , you . Drink . Joe , though , somehow could n't get himself up to the mood of the others and gradually , as the effect of the beer wore off and they had eaten more and more , they grew soberer and soberer . Hilda had let her head fall on Oscar 's shoulder and he had placed his arm around her gallantly . Vinie was a little bored . The baby had been put to sleep earlier and Louie who had been kneeling on a leather pillow behind Oscar 's chair ended by going to sleep there also.  |p82Why  did you say you came east ? said Joe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he added , they 're good . No thanks , replied Oscar . I 'm going to fill up the old pipe in a minute . I just felt like it , so I came . Good , said Joe , that 's the way to do things . Just quit , eh ? Oh , it must be wonderful to be a man , commented Hilda drowsily . Yes , just stepped out , said Oscar , for a little vacation . Are the meat packers pretty well organized these days ? asked the older brother . Stop it , said Gurlie . What 's the matter with you ? Skol ! Oscar . He 's too serious . Well , somebody has to be . What 's happened to you , Joe ? said his brother . You were always a hard worker but .. . Shame on you , said his wife , this is no time for such talk . Oh , she said rising , I know where there 's something in the pantry . And you 're going to drink it , she threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding it , replied he . All right , she came back at him , Why do n't you let yourselfgo then ? Go on , said Joe , get out of here . Ca n't a man talk to his own brother ? Are you a member of their union ? he continued , addressing Oscar . Sure I am . Please , said Hilda , do n't quarrel . Joe gave her a look and laughed in spite of himself . Here we are , said Gurlie , coming in with a half bottle of brandy . She poured out a small glassful and held it to her husband 's lips . Drink ! she said , drink ! I 'll drink it , he replied drawing back . Give it to me . He took it and smelled it . What 's this ? Let me seethe bottle . Oh , you make me tired , she answered him . It 's poison ! Ca n't you see it written here ? It 's poison , I tell you . That 's why I gave it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see it just the same . Was der Bauer nicht kennt , das frisst er nicht.  |p83What  's the matter , Joe , something on your mind ? asked Oscar . Why should there be ? Ai n't I married ? What do you mean by that , came back his wife swiftly . Plenty , he grinned at her , frowning to keep himself from breaking into a laugh . Look here , young man , she went on . If it was n't for me you 'd be in the soup . I 'm the one that stands behind you . I 'm the one . Is n't it so ? Do n't you know it down in your heart ? Do n't you know it ? Tell me . Do n't you know that I 'm the one that makes you get anywhere ? Well , where are we getting to ? That 's what I 'd like to know . The poor house , as far as I can see . Bah , bah , bah , bah ! She got up and tousled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet my little Dutchie against the world  --  raising her glass in a powerful gesture . Hoch , hoch ! You have , and how I know it , said Joe . What do you mean by that ? What can I mean ? Look here , young man . If you do n't think you 're lucky to have me pushing you where you do n't want to go yourself .. . You 'll see ! she continued , ignoring his answer . You 'll see . You have everything  --  but the courage . And I have that . You wait and see . Gedul ' bring ' Rosen ! I hope so , was Joe 's rejoinder before Oscar broke in with : You take too much on your own shoulders , Joe . Well , it 's lucky someone does . That 's right , put in Gurlie . Listen to your brother , he knows how to live . No , it is n't that , Oscar answered quickly , but Joe 's too good . Gott ! What difference does it make whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean  --  as far as the world isp84concerned ! You 've got to think of yourself more . This idea of thinking you 've got to take the whole business on your own shoulders  --  I 've noticed it 's usually you little fellahs who get the weight of the world on your necks . While you 're studying your latins and getting your scholarships .. . Yes , exactly , said Gurlie defensively. ... why , continued Oscar , we 're out .. . Yes , said Hilda. ... living , concluded the ex-dragoon . Ha , ha , said Joe , you 're right . But what exactly he meant by his laughter it would be hard to say . This is the end . We 're living in the last times . Read the Bible , broke in Gurlie . It 's the women coming into business that 's doing it , said Joe ignoring her . They 're too damned lazy to stay home and take care of their own work . They want to put men out to show how smart they can be , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with .. . Nonsense , answered Gurlie quietly . Give us enough money and we are satisfied . Whoop la ! she shouted , thenla de da dee da dee da dee ! Na na , na na ! Ca n't you keep quiet for a minute ? Ca n't you let us talk ? No , you are too serious , said his wife . You 're drunk , he replied . Who 's drunk ? Not I. But you ought to be , that 's what 's the matter with you . You need it . Who 's going to give us a toast ? I will , said her husband suddenly , and paused . Down with the unions , he cried out , standing . Come on , drink it . There was absolute silence for a minute . Nobody drank but Joe who finished his glass . Let 's have another , he added , holding his glass out toward the wife . What 's the matter Are you having trouble down at the shop ? said she shrewdly , not filling his glass as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Come on , give me something to drink . Down with the unions ! And he laughed his chuckling , halfp85mocking adult laughter . Come on , all of you . Drink up . All right , said Oscar . Down with the unions . And down went his dram . Now then , tear up your card , said Joe , with a malicious twinkle in his eye . Right you are , replied Oscar , reaching into his pocket . He had his eye fixed on his older brother . No , said Gurlie , stopping him . Papa , what 's the matter S ith you ? Are you crazy ? Well , are you going to let me talk then ? Not when you talk that way . All right then , forget it . To hell with the politicians . Vote for Cleveland . Hoch soil er leben , hoch soli er leben ! Drei mal hoch . Is this all you 've got to drink ? My God , Joe ! said his brother , I 've been hoping to seeyou lit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pee ! I forgot it . And she jumped up and went running out of the room . Champagne ? said Joe . I love champagne , said Hilda . It makes you feel so  --  I do n't know what . No , I guess you do n't , said Joe . You 're right , said Oscar . That 's right . Listen to old Joe , said he to Gurlie returning . He was just saying .. . I think you 're terrible , said Hilda . What are you men after , embarrassing my poor sister . Oscar was working at the neck of the bottle by this time . I le did n't try to hold back the cork . Pop went the cork , bouncing sharply from the ceiling directly into Hilda 's lap . Good luck , good luck shouted Oscar . Say Oscar , this is fine , said Joe after a minute . You should n't have done it . That must have cost a lot of money . That 's fine of you , though . We have n't had champagne  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama ? Oh , this is delicious , said Hilda . It reminds me of when I was in Paris.  | And here 's to your health , all of you , said Oscar . To us all  --  God help us ! And down with the unions , said Joe laughing . The unions and the politicians . Say , is Sis still playing in the Black Crook ? That 's one of the main reasons I came down this time . Sure , she 's still in the chorus , said Joe in his usual cryptic manner . Want to go and see her ? Yes , said Oscar , I was thinking we might all go down there now .. . Yes , yes , broke in Gurlie . Not tonight , said Joe . Not me anyhow . I 'm sorry . Take the ladies if you like but I 've got to go to bed . I 've got a big day ahead of me tomorrow.  |p87STRECHER  ! He took a step out onto the floor where every press was going full blast . Stecher ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned back into his office again . Where the hell is Stecher ? Boy ! Go find Mr. Stecher and tell him I want him in here at once . Yes sir . And the boy canoe around from the window and went out through the office door closing it behind him . Joe was back of the No. 3 press at the far end of the second row , in his shirt sleeves , crouching down , almost to the floor looking in , over the upturned Brodies , the overalls and body of the head mechanic who was lying on his back looking up under the rollers . This press was still . This one only . What is it ? said Joe at the top of his voice . One of the roller gears is snapped , came back the voice . God damn it to hell , said Joe under his breath . Then , Where is it ? Put your light up . At that moment the office boy came up from behind . Wanted in the office sir . Joe paid no attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold your light up higher . Higher , I cud . Put your hand on the break . He got down on his knees , then drew back and spoke to the pressman who was standing by . Is the power off , Carmody ? She 's jammed , said the one addressed . Wo n't move one way or the other . I did n't ask you that . I asked you if the power is off . Yea , said the man , trawling out the word slowly . With that Joe went around to the controls and looked for himself then came back behind the press again . You 're wanted in the office , sir , said the boy . Joe looked at him as if he 'd never seen him before . Then he started crawling in under the press near the mechanic . When he was in there their faces were only a few inches apart , both were looking up at the undersurfaces of the rollers , the mechanic 's face was smudged diagonally across the forehead . Look out for your head , Stecher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Joe was looking carefully at the place that had been pointed out to him . Suddenly he started , almost microscopically , did n't say anything at once , but reached up and tried to take hold  --  but could n't quite reach it . What 's that ? What ? said the mechanic . That , said Joe , sticking out there . That 's not a part of the machine . If you 'll let me get where you are I 'll see what it is , said the mechanic . All right , said Joe and he crawled out backward . The mechanic moved over , lifted himself up and took hold of the object Joe had pointed out . What is it ? I ca n't move it , said the mechanic . It looks like part of the gear . Get it out , said Joe . The mechanic seemed awkward and slow . Mr. Stecher . Wanted in the office . All right , said Joe . Can you move it ? he spoke again to the mechanic . There was a hammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the voice , saying , I ca n't make it . It 'll have to wait until we take the press down . No , said Joe . Get it out now . I 'm likely to damage the roller if I go hammering . Get that gear clear and bring out any loose pieces , saki Joe . There was more pounding , then a clatter of falling metal and something dropped out from under the press and bounced on the floor . The pressman reached for it , picked it up . But Joe went up to him and took it out of his handp89roughly with a quick wrench of the wrist . He looked at it . It was the shaft of a small screw driver . This yours , Carmody ? he asked . Let me see it , said the man sulkily . No , said Joe . Show me your kit . The man slowly got his tool kit out and loosened the strap . Joe looked in . Then he looked tat the man , square in his eyes . The man returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? said the latter . Nothing , said Joe quietly . Report tomorrow morning at the usual time . We do n't need you today . Better leave now . And take better care of your tools next time . Then he burst into a rage . Have n't I told you . . . the man took it like a lamb . Yes sir , said the man . Now get out , said Joe . Every press was going at full tilt and every man in the place sensed , and saw , almost one could have said , they heard every word that was uttered in that irregular clatter and clash . Carmody hesitated a moment , looking right and left , then walked over to the lockers . The mechanic was out from under the press and on his feet by the time Joe got around to him again . How long will it take ? said Joe  --  leaving the rest of the sentence to he understood . It all depends on whether I can get a part in the city . Well , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Joe . But do n't you think I 'd better start ? Can you fix it without the part ? No , but could n't you send one of the boys while I . . . Then do what I tell you . Get what you need , wherever it is made . Get on the train . Go where they make them . But get it . Work all night if you have to but this press has got to be running by tomorrow morning . Do you understand me ? Sure , Stecher , I understand you . Then Joe went to the basin , holding his delicate soiled hands out before him , washed them , dried them , put on his coat and went to the inner office . For Christ 's sake , Stecher , where the hell 've you been ? Did n't the boy tell you I wanted you right away ? Joe made no answer . But the old man went on as if he had . Dropp90what you 're doing and come on the run when I call you next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the presses , said Joe . Broke down ? said the old man . Yes , cracked gear . For God 's sake , Stecher , you knew what we had ahead of us this month , why ca n't you keep those presses in order ? I told you time after time to see that everything was up to the minute . That 's your job . I told you to have the presses put in trim for a heavy load . Which press is it ? No. 3 , said Joe . That 's a brand new machine . We have n't had it in the shop a year . What 's the matter ? Ca n't you take care of the equipment ? This made no impression on Joe . He knew and knew that the old man knew he knew there was no one that could take his place He knew too , that the old man had to work off his steam some way . Let him blow . But Joe did n't enjoy it . He just kept his mouth shut and looked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few moments earlier . And what have you done about it ? We 'll be rolling again by tomorrow morning , said Joe . The old man said nothing for a minute then turned to his desk and picked up a letter . Look at this , he said handing it to Joe , God damn ' em . It had the U. S. Government Seal at the top  --  an order from the Post Office Department that they were to double their deliveries of money orders beginningthe next week . Joe read it and handed it back to his chief . We can do it , he said , if you 'll let me run a night shift . Christ , what can I do ? Let you run it ? How in hell arc we to do it if I do n't ? Costing how much ? Joe again did n't answer . That 's all , said the old man . Fix it up and go ahead . And what do I get out of it ? Nothing . Nothing but a kick in the ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't keep me waitinga half hour , come at once.  |p91All  right , said Joe and went out . Carmody was still hanging around the shop at the lunch hour . I guess the little Dutchie called you that time , huh , Irish ? said one of them . Balls , said Carmody under his breath. es sir ! that 's the way to talk of him boy . Like a  --  Yes fir ! he says , as sweet as you please . Didja hear him ? Yes sir , he says . What j ' drop your screw driver in the press for , Car ? Shut up , you bastard . Sure you did , did n't you ? Did it on purpose . That 's what I did . Like hell you did . You have n't the nerve , said one of the older men . Do you know what that might cost ? What the hell do I care what it costs ? Well you 're lucky . If I was him , I would have fired you ass over teakettle out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bastard 's number . He did n't have the guts to re me . I know they need the press . They 're up against it and do n't want to start a night shift . Afraid we might earn some money ! Let him fire me . I 'll close the whole God damn shop down on them . This is Government work . Let him try it . Aw go soak your head ! said one of the others . I told you .. . What j'a throw it in for ? I did n't tell you .. You said you-did . It fell in . Come on out for a smoke . Coming , Jim ? Joe was sitting at his desk a couple of days later , when he saw , out of the corner of his eye , a man in a derby open the shop door , come inside , close the door and stand there a pwnlent looking around . He was smoking a cigar . Without further ado he came down the press aisle toward the floor manager . Joe continued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Like to have a little talk with you . ' So all right if I sit down ? Busy ? Go ahead if y'are . I 'm in no hurry . And he took the idle chair and leaned back in it looking over the shop . Several of the men , one after the other , cast quick glances in the direction of the newcomerbut without hesitating in what they were doing . You do n't smoke in here , said Joe . All right , said Mr. Burke , taking the cigar out of his mouth . Drop it in there , said Joe , indicating an empty metal waste basket . The man looked at the cigar which was only a third consumed and placed it on the edge of Joe 's desk . Joe picked it up and dropped it into the waste basket . The men looked at each other but said nothing further for a moment . What do you want ? said Joe . I wanted to see the old man , but I understand he 's out . It 's funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . Look here , Stecher , said Burke . No use shinanigin around with you . I can see that . I 'd like to talk a little business with you . What do you say ? You 're the real boss here , everybody knows that . If you and me can agree on th ' propositionI 'm gon na spring on you in a minute , I know it will be all jake with that crowd in there . He jerked his head toward the office . Now I do n't want no trouble . I come in here as a friend of the workin ' man . I always want to see things arranged amicable . What do you say ? Well , what is it ? said Joe . Well , I wan na know how you feel about it first , said the ' man . About what ? said Joe . Say , listen , Stecher . I got a rotten cold today . I feel like hell . Tell you the truth I ought to be home in bed . Whenp93I got the call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says to my wife .. . What do you want ? said Joe again . Well now , why ca n't you talk reasonable with me , Stecher ? Listen , you and me can do business if you 'll give me the high sign you 're on the level . . That 's why you waited until you saw the boss go out ? Joe came back at him . What ! said Burke jerking himself up straight . What 's t hat ? Joe had turned his back on him for the moment and was drumming his fingers rapidly on the desk , thinking . Nov listen to me , Stecher , said the man , assuming a threatening tone , none of your damned back-yip . Or I 'll pull every pressman from in front of them presses so fast it 'll take the breath out of you . Joe did n't bat an eyelash . Show me your card , he said . Burke took a leather card case with a celluloid front to it out of his pocket and held it in his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , said Burke . Let me see it , said Joe . And he took it in his own hand . And you can look at this too , said Burke pulling back his coat and showing a bright nickel badge pinned to his vest  --  Pressmen 's Union at the top . And across the middle  --  Delegate . I see you 're a master printer yourself , said Joe . Yes , said Burke , a little proudly , I am . We need good printers these days , it 's a pity you gave it up . What do you get now ? Oh , it ai n't the money so much , said Burke . But that 's got nothin ' to do with it . You ca n't work these men the way you 're doin ' it in this shop unless you give them more money . What do they want ? said Joe quickly . Well , it ai n't what they want so much , but it 's the prin/ciple . You 're paying them time and a half for the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business , said Joe . I 'll talk to Mr. W about it and you can come in at the end of the week . No you do n't , said Burke . Got to know today . Hey , listen , Stecher , it 's worth something to youse here to get this government contract off your hands on the tick . Right ? Well , why not give me a break , then ? Because I 'll be God damned if I 'll pay you a nickel , said Joe suddenly flaring up , for your crookedness . And if you do n't like that , get the hell out of here and tell Sam GompersI sent you . Do you understand that ? Tell him Joe Stecher kicked you out of the door and tell him why I did it . Now get out . Whoa baby ! laughed the man without stirring . Yes , I know all about you and Sam Gompers . You and Hilyard and him started the Typographer 's Union , did n't you ? They said you was a tough customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stecher ? Huh ? I 've got no more time to spend with you , said Joe . If you want to call a strike go ahead and call it now , we 're ready . What 'll you do then ? Try it and see , said Joe . Scabs , eh ? said the man . But I do n't wan na call no strike . This is a good shop . The men need the money . What do you think about it yourself ? Do n't you think they ought to be paid more ? Do you want to know what I think ? said Joe . Yes , said Burke , I 'm interested . Well I 'll tell you then , and Joe looked at him quizzically a moment , as much as to say : I wonder if you have the ' brains to understand anything . I think the men should get more money . I 'd like to see them get it and I 've tried to get it for them . But I could n't do it  --  not yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in hundreds of others all overp95the city . We keep the place clean . They get fresh air . They have individual lockers . They have a decent washroom and toilet  --  not one of those stinking  --  Joe made a disgusted gesture with his hands . But this is not my shop any more than it is theirs . You ca n't come in here right when we 're in the middle of a government job , just when we need to work , and to work hard , and every day at our maximum capacity  --  you ca n't come in here at such a time and ruin the work . That 's why I quit their union . They want too much . They want to own everything . They want to tell me how to run a shop and what I must do . That 's too much . And what are they thinking of to call a strike now ? There 's work to do . So that 's just the time they choose to make trouble . When there is work that must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not honest , it 's not upright . The unions have got into such hands and that 's why I got out . They want too much . Wait till we have finished this contract . Come back then and I 'll work with you to get as much for the men as I am able . I 'll work with you . I 'll do the best I can . But not now . Yes , that 's all right , said Burke . But I do n't know nothin ' about all that . I was sent up here to get more overtime money for the men .. . And you could n't do it , sneered Joe , so you had to call a strike . And you 've got to sneak back and tell the gang that sent you , that you could n't make Joe Stecher come across . You got to say he licked you , you could n't do it . You did n't know how . You were n't good enough . Go on home , like a whipped cur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strike today . I know the game better than you ever could or will . ' l'ry it . Go on walk out there on the floor and try it . And I 'll fire every man on the spot that so much as turns his head to listen to you . I 'll give you free leave , go on walk out there and talk to ' em . Burke did not stir . Now he began to tap the desk with his hands.  |p96But  , I 'll tell you this , Burke , went on Joe . They can call a strike if they want to after they hear your report this afternoon . We do n't want one now . Tell them they 're right . The men should have double time . Tell them Joe Stecher said he will try to get it for them . And come back tomorrow  --  about two o'clock  --  and I 'll give you your answer . That 's fair enough , said Burke . Put it there . And he held out his hand . They shook hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he did so , Joe followed him with : And take my advice , Burke , as soon as you can , get a decent job for yourself . We need good printers . Will you give it to me ? came back Burke . Ask for it and you 'll find out , said Joe . In hell I will , said Burke , and went out . The old man would n't hear of it . No , he roared out . No . God damn it , are the Unions going to own us entirely ? Or is this my business ? I wo n't pay them another fokin ' nickel for their time . They get too much now , the swine . What do they think I run this place for anyway ? For them ? Where would they find a place to earn their lousy dollars if I did n't give them a chance to work for it ? It 's my shop . What are we coming to anyway ? I put up the cash for the rent , do n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the business . Where would they be ? Yes , and you also get most of the profits , said Joe almost to himself . The old man wheeled on him like a flash . Joe turned white . He had not meant to speak that way , but he did not flinch from the stare which met his . The expected explosion did not ocur , however . Instead the old man contented himself with saying : So you 're going back to them , are you , Stecher ? No , said Joe , I 'm not . But in this particular case I think they are right . Men working at night that way should have double time . I think , besides , that we are in a difficult situation . I 'd pay it now just to have peace .. . Never ! said the old man . What ? Buy peace from a lot ofp97dirty thieves , a lot of highway men who . . . He stamped about in a mounting fury. ... if you do n't , went on Joe coolly , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a long silence between the two men . Well , my answer to you , Stecher , said the old man finally , is that I wo n't pay it . Tell that to the bastards and let them take a fit for themselves . What do you think will happen ? said he in an altered voice . Joe thought a minute . Are you quite sure you want to tight them ? Yes , said the old man . I do n't ask you for much , Mr. Wynnewood , went on Joe . But I 'd like to see the men get this increase today . I think we can carry it in several ways . I 've been thinking it over for a long time . And as a matter of fact , said Joe , I 've been convinced for the past four months that it 's a general st rike . For what ? Shorter hours and a probable ten per cent increase in wages . Why they 'll ruin the business . The smart move in my opinion is to beat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the first shop in town . What ! My God , man , you 're crazy . Are you . . . ? I think it 's policy . Never . Well , this is what will happen . This man here today was just a lot of bluff . But it 's coming soon and when it does happen they 're going out all over the city at once . Welight buy immunity long enough to finish our present con-t acts . I think .. . A general strike . That 's my opinion . And it will be hard under such conditionsto get non-union men . We 'll have to import them . All right . Let it come , said the boss.  | Am I free to act if it does ? said Joe . Go to it , beat them if it costs the works . It may be an expensive fight , said Joe . Can you win it ? I can , said Joe . Then fight ' em , said the old man . Go the limit . I 'll need a liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . Win , that 's all . All right , said Joe.  |p99i.  was six o'clock , perhaps a few minutes earlier . Joe was in his stocking feet , his suspenders hanging down . Why in hell do n't you keep some toilet paper in this house ? he shouted sticking his head in at the bedroom door . Gurlie was hardly awake . Lottie sat up in her crib . What 's that you 're yelling about ? said Gurlie . What kind of a house is this ? Oh , forget it , said his wife , what 's the matter now ? No toilet paper in the bathroom . No order anywhere . Where are my clean shirts ? Have you looked in the drawer of your chiffonier ? Yes . Well , look again , said Gurlie and you 'll find them . And you 'll find the toilet paper on top of the medicine cabinet if you have any eyes . I ca n't for the life of me see what you do with yourself all day long , continued Joe , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken care of . Look here , young man , said Gurlie sitting up suddenly . Mind what you 're saying . I work . I hate this being cooped up in a box like this all day long . I 'm not used to it . I ca n't keep every button on your shirts and every hole in your socks stitched up just when you think I ought to . But you 're no wonder yourself  --  at a lot of things . Well , all right , all right . Yes , it 's all right when you want to yell but I must keep quiet. pI00I never heard it yet , said Joe . Well , I 'll tell you one thing . Get me out of here , went on his wife , I want to get into the country . I need air . I want to feel the dirt . I 'll show you what work is . I can work . But I ca n't do this housework all day long . I 'll go crazy . Go ahead , said Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Gurlie checked herself at the instant of a blind fury as it flashed into her mind what day it was and the dangers that lay ahead . Stepping down a peg from an instinctive retort in kind to her husband 's irritable attack , she contented herself with : You ! You know as well as me that you 'd wear the same pants , and shirt too , from one year 's end to the other if I did n't take them away from you , before you disgrace yourself .. . This ended it . Joe had to smile to himself  --  but would n't show it . Well , get some toilet paper in the place . There 's plenty of it in the kitchen closet . Why do n't you put it in the book case where it will be convenient when we need it , said Joe . But she did n't answer him this time . She kicked her feet out sidewise from under the sheets and in her nightgown walked barefoot to the kitchen , dashing some cold water into her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range , put the kettle on . The baby was crying . The new maid would n't come for another hour . Gurlie took up the baby , put it on its chair , pulled down the hinged tray and let it stay there while she went back to put some clothes on . Joe came in and looked at it . The baby was in a wonderful mood . Joe sat there , contemplating it with affectionate pleasure . Gurlie came back , having put on a new face with her dress , gay in her rough manner  --  carelessly sticking up her hair any old way  --  fastening her dress . There , sit down , she said to Joe as if he himself were a baby , sit down and letp101mama feed you . Poor man , you must have lots on your mind . Shall I make some toast ? No , said Joe , I do n't want anything but a cup of coffee . Oh , but you must eat something . I 'll fry you an egg  --  with some bacon . All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quick . He turned to the baby again which was grunting in a succession of grunts and doubling its face down on the tray of its chair , afterward , laying its cheek on the cool wood and then turningand looking at the wood with curiosity , then laying its cheek down again and grinning , then banging the wood with its open fists . Squealing with pleasure . Joe snoozled his face up to the baby 's which the mite tried to avoid hilariously . But suddenly it reached out and grabbed Joe by the moustache , wildly with a spasmodic jerk . Joe 's head went along involuntarily , he could not pull away . So he took the baby 's little fist in his own , tried to loosen it . With a terrifying shriek the baby let go of the man 's hair . Joe sat up . But the baby shrieked and shrieked in terrific earnest . Gurlie dropped her cooking . The child was in agony . Suddenly Gurlie lifted up the tray and , as she did so , both saw that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nail was almost off . In Joe 's struggle to free himself , he had slightly lifted the tray and the infant placingits hand in the open hinge to steady itself in its struggles had been caught viciously in the trap . Joe went white , sat down to keep from falling . Helpless , speechless . Oh , said Gurlie , oh ! Joe took out his handkerchief . No , no , said Gurlie . Send for a doctor , said Joe . The doctor ? Go on now , she added roughly  --  gently , get out of here . Drink your coffee first . I 'll take care of this . It 's nothing . But . . . the baby was still shrilly screaming but GurliepIO2 just shook her head deprecatingly and with one hand on her husband 's back , had him soon at the door . Go on  --  and do n't get hurt . Come back to me tonight . It may not be till late , said Joe . The day was a hard one for Gurlie . The morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else to her uneasy sight . They 've had a hot time down town today , Mrs. Stecher , said the old fellow who sold papers under the elevated stairs at the corner . They 'll be bloodshedtomorrow if it keeps on this way . Gurlie 's code forbade any sign of fear in public . I suppose you 'd be scared of your life to go down there , she replied to the man , who looked up at her sharply . But her heart felt weak . She turned and left him , it seeming a mile she had to walk nonchalantly to her front steps , slowly , as if it did n't matter , and into the house . She stood inside the door without going up and scanned the headlines  --  Strike ! Scenes of disorder ! Violence ! Typographers being importedfrom Paterson and as far west as Buffalo . Both sides girding their loins . A general strike among the printers unlessthe pressmen 's demands are acceded to by noon tomorrow . Winthrop , Hallowell &; Co the centre . . . She read no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper . The enforced inaction all day , violence within herself , had Gurlie nutty . As she moved about the house , she brushed the children aside or stuck things into their hands in a thoughtless way to which they responded very nicely  --  it must be admitted . After a while they seemed to act just as if she was n't there , amused themselves with all sort of little ordinarily forbidden tricks . Lottie dragged an old coffee pot , which she loved , onto the kitchen floor and the baby  --  the bandageoff her finger ,  --  smeared herself gloriously with her oatmeal , finally succeeding in getting the empty bowl right on top of her head . Gurlie sat by the window but could n't stand it . Thep103strike  --  the word " strike " made her strike out with her two fists , into the air . Images of men taking hold of each other . Joe standing up and trying to get through a crowd of hostile pressmen lined up by the door to the place . Joe , of small size , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked off his hat . Joe leaned to pick it up . They kicked him . He stumbled . He tried to see who it was when they closed in . . . Gurlie leaped to her feet from before the window  --  her hand flew to her throat . Then she  --  walked to the kitchen . So it had gone all day long . Now it was dark . She washed the children , did up the baby 's finger again  --  somehow or other the little thing had never paid any attention to the sore finger after the first shock of pain . The children in bed asleep , supper at the back of the range , she could n't stand it any longer but went out into the street and walked up and down . About ten o'clock she saw Joe come out of the elevated exit . What are you doing here in the street ? he said and kissed her . He looked dirty and tired . Are you all right ? Sure , why not ? Humph ! she replied  --  and they walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a tough day , but not so bad  --  not yet , Joe told her chuckling . She was relieved and thrilled seeing him in such a capital mood . Sure , he replied to her , the streets are full of them . What did you expect me to do , run ? But . . . you 're not hurt ? The whole police force was out . Anyhow , we kept the place open . And we 'll keep it open . We wo n't miss a day . I 'll beat ' em so bad they 'll never get over it . A pack of dirty , lowdown thieves and blackguards  --  yelling and throwing stones  --  breaking windows  --  they ca n't even throw straight . Have ' em arrested ! Arrest them all if it comes to that . Gurlie was relieved , delighted , sat close to her husbandpI04 with one hand on his shoulder while he was eating , eagerly , hungrily , talking between mouthfuls . Suddenly he stopped . How 's the baby 's finger ? She 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head all day long . Pingh ! said Gurlie puffing her lips out , it 's nothing . Every once in a while I could see that broken nail and the blood . Sure she 's all right ? A little piece of rag around it . She 's forgotten it already . I 'm tired , said Joe , I want to go to bed . And is that all you 're going to tell me ? Well , what is there to tell ? We kept the shop open . They ca n't do anything . Let ' em try it , that 's all . And you 're going down there again tomorrow ? What do you think I 'm going to do ? Joe looked at her surprised . Expect me to run away ? But if they hurt you . I 'm going down there with you . If you think it 's any fun to stay shut up in this prison all day long while you 're down there likely to get hurt .. . Agh , they 're afraid , said Joe laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Joe left before six , pulling his hat on , bending his shoulders a little forward it seemed as if conscious of the approaching attack . The newspaperswere again full of it . Carrying on her feud with the old newsdealer at the corner , she went out for the morning paper and a noon edition . But sensing his scorn , not a word spoken , in the afternoon she walked three blocks to another news stand for the latest . It was Thursday , the girl 's afternoon off . The babies were alone for the moment . Both children were asleep . She did n't realize how long it would take her . Lottie woke on her mother 's bed where she had thrown herself and looked around . The baby in its own little wooden crib was lying on its back both arms flung wide , completely relaxed . Lottie got up and walked all through the house looking for her mother , then came back to the bedroom . Mama 's gone , she said . So she returned to the kitchen and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair to draw it and drank some . Holding the half full glass in both hands , she went in to the baby again and drank some more . Then with the glass in one hand , she pinched the baby 's outflung arm through the bars of the crib , pinched it hard . The baby waked , pulled back its arm , sat up with a struggle  --  and blinked its eyes grinned at her sister . Lottie tried to feed it water from the glass through the wooden bars . It spilled as the baby tried to grip the glass . Then the baby choked and some of the water went into Louie 's face . Lottie took some water into her own mouth and , imitating the baby , blew it out into the infant 's face in retaliation . Flossie was delighted . Lottie did it again . Great success , spitting out magnificently . Lottie now handed a rattle in to the baby which she promptly threw out again with great gusto . Now the older girl put a rubber ball into the crib between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push it to the floor again . And laughed excitedly . Lottie put it back . The baby threw it out . Each time she did so she slapped her hands together in wild excitement . So the older sister began to fetch and throw everything loose she could find into the crib to beat the baby to it . Books , an old pipe , a pillow , a paper-cutter  --  anything  --  shoes , and the baby took each thing as it was able and threw it out again looking delightedly into her sister 's face for approval and crawling all over the crib , falling , rising again , the best it was able . Till finally Lottie could find nothing else to throw in , she had finally done it so fast the baby could n't keep it up with her and had just sat back and watched  --  thrilled at so much attention . So Lottie got a chair and climbed into the crib herself , over the top , to get them and threw some of them but again , the baby leaning over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Then Lottie had an idea . She tried to loosen the movable side of the crib. pIo6Failing to do that , she got behind the baby and tried to lift it up over the top . Impossible . But she chided her little sister . Climb up , she said . And again she grasped the infant around the waist from behind and pushing with all her might lifted her up a little to the edge of the cribside . With tremendous effort , pushing hard , finally she succeededand the infant hung face down over the edge of the crib . It was n't frightened but seemed completely serious and submissive before its sister 's efforts , passively waiting . As it teetered there , Lottie a little afraid now , holding it back by the skirts its head went lower , then with a sudden slip it went all the way down with a rush over the edge  --  on its back into the chair . As it went , its marvellous little hands flew out and finding them clung desperately to the crib bars . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a little grunt and sucking of the breath on Flossie 's part as she laboured . There on its back in blank astonishment balanced on the chair hanging on to the crib for dear life lay the infant until Lottie could slide over the edge of the crib to the ground again . She looked critically at the child a moment then , leaving it , ran off instinctively to find her mother . Coming back and seeing the baby in the same position , she stood and looked at it again from both sides at a loss . Then she tried to loosen its hands . Nothing doing . The infant was n't convinced though it smiled a little appreciatively . So Lottie changed tactics , took hold of the chair , pulled it from under until one of the baby 's hands slipping , it suddenlyslid sidewise and down square on the top of its head to the carpeted floor . Lottie watched it with fascinated interest . The baby lay still for a moment , you could n't tell which end was which . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on its hands and knees and looked around . In a moment it was creeping . In another it had found something small , a button , which it picked up . Sitting downp107abruptly , it examined the strange object , then put it into It .. mouth , turned on its hands again and headed for the back of the house . What a mess when Gurlie came in . Lottie and the baby were in the middle of the kitchen floor , Lottie with an pron around her neck wielding a broom . The baby black with coal from the scuttle , her mouth as black as the scuttle tsclf . Just as Gurlie came in the baby was clinging uncertainlyto the scuttle 's edge , trying to turn her head around without falling and .. . Lottie ! shrieked the mother , what have you done ? Joe did n't come in till nearly midnight , dog-weary and Serious , uncommunicative this time . He would n't open his mouth more than to say , We 'll beat ' em . He 'd had his supr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cad hit the pillow . But next morning , the sun up and Gurlie ahead of him is time , he was ready  --  eager even  --  to talk . She was a fascinated listener . Saw the old man . I mean all the partners were there . I mean Seymour . He 's a fine old fellow . I always liked him . Kindly  --  no good in business . They 're scared this time . Means a lot to them to win this strike . What 'll they do for you , if you do win it ? Fire me , I suppose , said Joe in his old time cynical good humour . But what happened ? What kept you so late ? Moving mattresses , said Joe . Mattresses ? Yes , mattresses  --  fifty of them . The damned scabs . We got to lock ' em in . As soon as one of them went up to the hospital , they all wanted to quit . The disgust Joe put into that word " quit " contorted his whole body . So I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . Let their strike leaders  - -  y and again he emphasized the word withp108savage purpose  --  tell ' em what to do next . And he laughed his half bitter , Ho , ho , ho , ho ! What ! said Gurlie . Is it as bad as that ? Well , we 've got to get the work done , do n't we ? But is n't it dangerous ? What ? To sleep on a mattress ? Sure . You might catch cold . But what good is that ? insisted Gurlie . They have to go out to eat . Oh we do n't feed ' em so bad , said Joe . Gurlie was looking at him in admiration . We got plenty of water . Bread . A little butter , not much because there 's no place to keep ice . But canned beans . Tomato soup . Oh , they 're having a regular picnic . Gurlie shook her head silently . You 're the only one that 's going in and out then . Sure , said Joe . The bosses decided they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe left his wife at the downstairs door where she had gone with him in her uneasiness . She watched him go along the nearly empty street to the elevated entrance . His narrow , straight shoulders , the black coat , his determined even-footed walk  --  he did n't look very strong to her , smoking his cigar  --  his cheap cigar . I wonder how long it will last . I do n't think he can beat them . The third night Joe came in jubilant . The regular money order shipment had gone off on time . The fourth night he confided to his wife that in a week he would n't care what in hell the pressmen or anybody else wanted . We 'll finish the government contract then close the place down till they come begging on their knees for us to open it again . I got ' em where I want ' em this time . The lazy suckers . But Monday night the following week he was again later than usual . Gurlie had begun to relax , the strike , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along smoothly in spite of the hard feeling . The men were afraid of the police . Joe had been jostled once or twice . A boy even hitpI09him in the back with a small stone one morning  --  but that was all . But when he did finally appear this time his tie was crooked , his shirt collar mashed and blackened , his hat out of shape . They held me up , he said . He was extremely serious and low-voiced . Are you hurt ? No . Where were the police ? Oh , they laid for me , at the entrance to the Chambers St. elevated station . What did they do ? Stopped me . Put a pistol in my face . Joe ! What did you do ? Well , I 'm here , ai n't I ? Did you fight , then ? No . I did n't have a chance . Two of them . I recognized one anyhow . Who was it ? No , I 'm not telling anybody that just yet . I suppose it 's that gas house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call off the strike . What did you say ? I told them I could n't call it off . They told me I 'd have to . What did you say then ? I did n't say anything . One of them grabbed me by the collar while the other stuck the pistol against my side . Oh ! said Gurlie , I refuse to let you go down there tomorrowunless yo  --  are protected . What is the city thinking of ? The city ca n't think , said Joe . I refuse to let you . I 've got something to say about that . I do n't want you killed . What about me and my children ? Sure , the Company do n't care if you 're killed . They can get someone else . If you go , I go with you . Calm down , said Joe , seriously , however , I 'll get a cop to take me to the station at night after this . And meet you in the morning , added Gurlie . All right , said Joe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daytime.  | But what about up here , coming home late ? They 'll followyou  --  I 'll take out a licence to carry a pistol  --  tomorrow morning . But  --  but  --  but ! Can you shoot ? said Gurlie . As well as they can . But you did n't finish telling me what happened . Nothing happened , they heard someone coming and beat it . I got on the elevated and came home . But what about tomorrow ? What will they do next ? What will happen ? Nothing , said Joe . What do you expect ?  |p111HE  was a nice old gentleman with pince-nez glasses and spats , sitting in the middle stall of the only available bench in that part of the park . The other benches , though cleared of snow , were either in the shadow and icy , or in the sun , where it was warm  --  delightfully warm for December  --  and so wet from the thaw . He had several sheets of newspaperunder him . He looked up and smiled at the girl with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Better join me , he said , I do n't think there 's another dry bench in the neighborhood . She stopped a moment , looked at him  --  and she was tired of pushing the baby carriage on the uneven walks . It must be rather hard work , he commented , seeing her hesitate . Wo n't you take a piece of this newspaper ? But instead of waiting for him to get up and give it to her she sat down quickly toward the end of the bench so she would n't have to accept his offer . That 's all right , he went on , seating himself again , it 's not wet there . She turned deliberately away from him frowning and leaned into the carriage to arrange the baby 's covers . The thing was sleeping blissfully , just a little face showing between the woolly cap and the blanket edge . How old are you ? said the man , speaking very gently and quietly . Fifteen , said the girl  --  and then bit her lip for having answered him . II2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the baby ? Sure . Everyday sometimes . That 's dumb , she added to herself . About this time in the morning ? Sure . Why not ? Not many people do it , these days . The finest of the year I often think , gloomy , quiet  --  but very restful . But a personof my age is often lonesome . Do you know anything about that ? No , of course not . Young people have the better of us but they understand very little . A good thing too . Do n't you think so ? She looked at him as if she thought he was dippy . Do you come of a large family , he continued . What do you take me for , a dictionary ? she decided to be rude . He laughed . Well , maybe you 'd tell me the baby 's name then . Spider . What ? Spider . Your sister ? No , I 'm just the maid . And she started to get up to be on her way . Please do n't go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Please . Please , I 'd rather go myself . I wo n't bother you any more . So she sat down again while he leaned on a cane he had between his knees and looked the other way . She gave him a good look while his back was turned and felt sorry for the old geezer . She had nothing to do but sit there . Gee , it 's terribly cold today , she said after a while as if speaking to the trees . The old fellow turned toward her quickly with a smile on his face . Anyhow , it 's cold for a baby , I think , she said . It 's good for them , said the man , so long as they 're properlyprotected , especially from the wind . The wind is aP113baby 's enemy . It 's especially important to keep cold draughts from coming up under the carriage and blowing through the mattress . Did you know that ? All carriages should be lined with some impervious material , like oil cloth or paper , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm enough ? Sure , said the girl . She 'd let you know if she was n't . She says " mammy " and " baby . " She wo n't stay in your lap any more . You know there 's about fourteen kids in the block where we live has whooping cough . You do n't say ? said the man . Does she creep ? And with that he ventured to get up and look at the little sleeping thing . But it was n't sleeping . I let her go everywhere , said the girl . She 's very friendly , except to people with glasses . Yes , the man took her up , to an infant I suppose glasses seem like big terrible eyes . The girl looked at him as though , she thought there might be something in what he said . Yes , it 's the glasses scares her . But the baby was n't scared . So she continued , But she is n't afraid of anything at all . See ! she spoke to the baby , who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lost in wrapt attention , moving her eyes ' the least bit from time to time from point to point over the features of the face leaning above her . The man patted the blanket where she lay very gently and then sat down again near the girl . A smart little thing she seems , he said . She can say so many words . I think she can say fifteen words . What ! So many ? Well you know , they sound like words . Yea . She has four teeth , two up and two down . She fell out of bed this morning . But she always looks up smiling . She 's rather small , said the man . Does she eat ? She eats everything now  --  except cow 's milk . I 've given her cow 's milk and she vomits it . I give her a whole tomato yesterday . A tomato at nine months ! Sure . She wanted it . She sucked the middle out of it and threw the skin away . Bread . An egg sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an egg . She 's never hungry in the morning . Say are you a doctor or something ? said the girl finally , checking herself . No , no , said the stranger , but I have two little nieces of my own and I 'm very much interested in children . Well , I hope she does n't get whooping cough , that 's all I say , went on the girl . If she does , I quit . I 've seen enough of that . You would n't do that , would you ? Sure I would . I 've got myself to think of . But they 'd need you more than ever at such a time . Oh , I ai n't been working there long . Are they nice people ? Germans . The man smiled to himself quietly and cleared his throat quickly . Oh , whooping cough is n't so bad if you keep them out of doors , I guess . Yea , I heard that . But the reason I keep her out most times is that she eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty good dish of spinach . She needs it , believe me . You never seen such a skinny kid . But you ought to see the little red-head down stairs from us over by the river . He 's so dumb . Yah , yah , yah ! that 's all he says but you ca n't help loving him . You must like children . Them and talking . God give me the gift of gab  --  once I get started . That 's about all he did give me , Ma says . I make use of it though . Guess I better get moving , she added thinkingmaybe she had been getting a little bit too confidential toward the end . So long . Good bye , said the old man getting up politely . It 's goodp115of you to have let me talk to you in this way . Take good care of the baby . I hope it does n't get whooping cough . She just stared at him , once again , and left . The baby who was sitting up by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its little mittened hands and kept straining out to keep sight of the figure sitting on the bench now fading off across the snow behind them . Say Jim , said Maggie to the cop on the corner , you ought to have seen the old bird tried to pick me up in the park . You do n't say . You mean the old gentleman with the side whiskers ? Yea . The cop laughed . He was n't trying to pick you up . That 's the governor 's brother . He lives around here . Yea ? Well , he can be the Pope 's uncle for all I care , said the girl to show what she thought about men like that . The cop laughed at her some more . You better be gettin ' home , he said . It 's past noon . It was whooping cough . Lottie came down with it first and then the baby , struggling to hold back each racking paroxysm . And Christmas coming on . Gurlie was angry . Whooping cough should come in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much attention to it . The main thing was to keep the baby out of the house as much as possible . Only it started to_the vomit everything . So she told Maggie not to feed it too much . What ! said the girl . At night they burnt a lamp in its room with a smell of creosote to it . It 's fine today , said Gurlie once about the twentieth of the month , out wid yez ! Take her to the Park . And remember what I 've told you : do n't feed her any junk . And keep sway from other children , she added as an afterthought . Maggie started toward the west . But at the corner she took a good look back and went round the block heading cast then toward the river . I 'll take you to the park , she said . And away she went , lickety split , tearing along with the carriage joggling in front of her as if it were a race . I 'll take you to the park , she said again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to cough and vomited . Whew ! said Maggie all in a sweat when she had to stop and take care of the brat . If you hold me up this way , we 'll never get there . Then she lit out once more and pretty soon she arrived at the Carl Schultz Park overlooking the East River at 89th St. She went in one entrance of this , round one of the paths and out again  --  just so I can say I was in the park . At the exit she met another girl with a carriage . It 's got the whooping cough , she said . Keep away . Wait a minute , said the other , what 's your sweat ? They stood away from the carriage talking a few minutes . Do n't give her this , do n't give her that , she says , said Maggie in a mocking affected tone of voice . Aw , they make me tired . The kid 's lost a couple of pounds already . Ma says feed her anything she 'll take . Milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to see her sometimes when I pick her up , she 's covered with it . In her hair , in her eyes . And smilin ' . You got ta laugh , I wan na give her a break . I 'm takin ' her up to the gas tanks . Ma says if you walk around the gas tanks , it 'll cure her . Well , so long , said the other girl . See you Saturday night . Maggie started out again toward two red painted gas tanks that could be seen now a few blocks north on the river . As she went she walked slower and slower . She was a little scared . Suppose they should blow up ! She looked around too , to see if anyone was watching her , thinking maybe someone had been spoofing sending her up there  --  she felt kind of foolish . There might be men or boys in a place like that that would get fresh . Then the baby had another fit . That decided her , she 'd do it . Once around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the ideapII7In her mind . You got to go all the way round , she said to herself . It was a relief when she got there to see several other women with carriages and small children sitting behind a ire fence close to the tank on boxes in the sun . They d n't pay any attention to her at all . Now she could smell c gas . Gee , that ca n't be good for a baby , she thought . It Was quite strong near the enormous tank . The middle part was half way up in its frame and gave out a creaking sound from time to time as it filled . She was wondering what would happen if someone should light a match when she saw an old man in a cap sitting in a broken chair near the gate to the enclosure . He was smoking a pipe . She thought maybe you had to have a ticket or something to get in . Good afternoon , he said to her with a strong burr to his voice and with that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was quite strong in there . First she headed away from the other women who were on the sunny side of the tank intending to go aroundF ley , you ca n't go around there , said the old man . Why not ? said Maggie . There 's a barbed wire fence twenty feet ahead of you , %aid the man . That 's why . If it 's the first time you 're here , I 'll tell you you can sit there where the others are sitting or no place at all . And do n't throw any fruit peelings or waste paper around the place either , he added . The baby has whooping cough , Maggie said . Well , what else would you be here for if it did n't ? said the man . You 'll find an old box beyond , he added jerking his thumb over his shoulder and paid no more attention to her . The other women and children had been out of sight duringthis talk . Now one came with a baby in her arms and went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart in her mouth , started the carriage along the rough gravel . Now she could hear them ... I 'm not so fussy any more. pI18 You ought to see Winnie 's baby . She eats everything and honestly she 's beautiful . Then they came into view , one wiping the nose of her own child and saying , she 's getting an awfully gubby chin , sticking it out that way  --  honestly , it 's terrible . But as some of them turned to look the baby in the next carriage sort of choked and began it . My god , there she goes ! said one of the women . It was the worst Maggie had seen . While the woman was tending the child in its paroxysmshe kept talking , describing the events as they happened  --  as if to relieve herself of her concern . Maggie watched fascinated . First she gets red , then purple  --  even her legs get blue and then her face is green . Look at her put her hands back of her head . You 'd think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was . Then the baby stopped her cough and began to vomit . She vomits twenty times a day , concluded the woman . And so that emergency ended . Maggie wanted to run . But someonelaughed and the women started to talk again and so Maggie pushed her carriage past them , while they looked at her in talking , and found the old box the man had told her about . Mine sits half the time with his mouth open . I ca n't fill him up . The wall of the tank was close behind her . Though she felt a little creepy about being so near the gas  --  still the others did n't mind it and so she began to realize  --  thinking of the stinking lamp they burned at night  --  that it was the gas maybe that cured the cough  --  not just walking around the tank that did it . There were four or five women who had their boxes gathered around in a small group in the middle of which was a rosy cheeked woman with greying hair who was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much upon her all the time . By her talkp119and her looks Maggie put her down at once , like herself , for a mick . There were only two other carriages but at least three babies in arms and a few older children who kept sneaking off behind the tank whence they had to be fetched out yelling . Get out of there , shouted the old man going around the fence with a stick in his hand to some older boys who had climbed on the fence after a ball . One of the women got up and threw it out to them . Do you know what he says to me ? I do n't care how the hell sick you are so long as the kid 's all right . I had her down to Coney Island Tuesday . I think it was Tuesday . Was n't it , Rose ? Hallo , Mrs. Falori ; called out the rosy cheeked woman in the group to a big Italian woman going by . Agh ! and the one addressed , raising her hand , let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , smiling the while . Yeah , they 're gettin ' in everywhere now , said one of the women . And the funny names they have . Mrs. Magazine , I heard someone say in a store yesterday . Mrs. What ? I says . Keroseno ? I sez . And she laughed along with the rest . Then little Flossie choked and went herself into a paroxysm . Maggie felt the other women looking at her and her own face go crimson . One of the women came over to help her . Aw , that 's not so bad , said this one . My uncle told me with mine that when she goes into a kink to throw her up in the air and catch her . Are n't you afraid you might miss her ? said Maggie . No , I do n't mean so high . I tried it and honestly it brought her out of it . Spinach poisons her , one of the other women was saying , cverywhere it touches her . She likes it well enough but it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her she broke out all around her mouth . I did n't know what it was but I found out later.  | He 's got a good pair of eyes , said another of the women , speaking of one of the older children whom she had just captured and whose nose she was vigorously wiping of a chocolate smear . Yes , he do n't miss much , so long as it 's for his stomach . I 'll get money out of youse , said another to a small boy , if you do n't keep off that carriage . Know her ? Maggie heard then , why Effie and I used to stand in line to sit on the same pot when we were kids . And all the women laughed uproariously . Yes , kids is funny , said the rosy faced woman . I saw hint walking round the kitchen yesterday with the collander held up against his back side . Me 's giving me a ride , he said . And they all laughed again . Mine fell , boom ! on his bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? he asks me looking up kind of stunned . Then he gets up holding his breath and walks into the next room , where I could n't see him , before he 'd cry . They had to be put down . If they have any spirit it 's an insult to them . You do n't have to tell me . I got one too . Always up to something , a regular rip . But he has n't slept so good for the last couple of nights . They 're down like a stone , up like a cork . No , I sez . There was no money born with ye and there 'll be none buried with ye . Now he 's this way  --  he 's good in some ways . If I brought him here and you told him to take the nastiest medicine , he 'd take it . But if his father or I tried to make hint take it , nothing doing . You got nothing to kick at , said the rosy faced woman to the one who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're holdin ' there to keep you company . Oh she 's all right , the woman replied . But that other blister . . . ! Oh my ! It 's a wonder he 's still alive . I could kill him sometimes. pI2IHe wants to sit up and he 's fresh  --  he 's a sassy boy  --  but he has n't slept so good for the last couple of nights . Oh Jesus , Mrs. H ! Do n't let her get started crying . Well , they 're here and you got to do the best for them . But I 'll tell you the truth , it 's a thankless job some-'lines . You 're right it 's a thankless job , said a heavy-browed woman who had not spoken until then . My youngest was that kind . He was a wicked one . She paused . I 'm ashamed to tell it . And a faint smile crossed her thin lips . No one opened her mouth knowing she 'd go on if they waited . Maggie sat straining not to miss a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got an awful temper , she said . When it gets the best of me I 'm like crazy . I 'm afraid of it myself sometimes . Well , one Sunday morning he disgraced me . I had him all dressed for Church and he did n't want to go . So I let him downstairs while I was getting myself ready . And when I went to look for him you should have seen him . He was black from head to foot . So I took him home and beat him and even then he would n't stop his yelling . He 'd get purple in the face with it . His father had been up all night and lay asleep . I could n't make the kid stop . So I took him downstairs and threw him in the ash barrel and cut all his head . I thought I 'd killed him . My sisters heard the racket and came running . They had to take him to the hospital to be sewed up . Oh my God , said one of the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Maggie turned away . When she listened again they were talking about doctors . You 're a wonderful patient , he says . Yes , I says . And I was for the shape I was in . There 's a bride in our block is expecting sometime next month . And is she scared ! So I says to her , you got nothin ' to worry about . She 's always thinking maybe she wo n't get to the hospital in time . So I says to her , my first was born in a cab and my second in the toilet basin . And look at ' em now , I says . Did you ever hear of giving them bay leaves for gas ? said another . They cook them down with water , some woman told my husband . I want to pippy . Lord , if I had a thousand I 'd think I was in Heaven sittin ' down . His bowels were terrible , something awful . Phaugh . Sure , he climbs out of his carriage already . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief when he 's small , what 'll he do later ? So it went . Maggie listened , watched them  --  all older than herself and she did n't think much of them . No kids for her . They 'd have to chloroform her first . She looked in at her own little Flossie and decided she was n't so bad though . Guessed she 'd go home . Everyone of mine come to supper , another of the women was saying . And they are the hungriest kids ! I never saw anything like it . Good bye , dearie , said the rosy cheeked lady , as Maggie finally walked off . Good bye , said Maggie without looking at her . And as she stopped a minute to loosen the brake of the carriage which stuck she heard finally : I had it easy . You must have had a left-handed doctor , someone else answered her . Say , he was left-handed . How did you guess it ? Did n't you say it come easy ? And once again Maggie heard the women laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , said the old man there . Maggie gave him a smile but he was n't even looking at her . She hurried off . On the way she decided to try the baby on some crackers like she 'd seen the women feeding their children back by the tank . Maybe they 'd stay down better than the milk did.  |p123She  went into a store she was passing and got a few for a nickel  --  chocolate covered . She gave one of them to the baby and put the rest in her pocket . The infant was delighted . Maggie was late . She hurried . At the corner of their block she took out her handkerchief and went carefully over the baby 's face to remove all signs of the cracker . Where in the world have you been ? said Gurlie . Over in the park , said Maggie . Where did you think I was ? No impudence from you , Gurlie came back to her . I 've been waiting almost an hour for you . I want those potatoes peeled . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be starved . Has it coughed much ? Not much , said Maggie . Then the baby began . And before it was through the chocolate cracker was all over the blanket , all over the floor  --  it seemed five times as much as had ever gone into it . Then Maggie grabbed her hat and fled.  |p124H  o w did the strike finally come out , Joe ? said Mr. Lindquistlooking at his cigar as he pushed his chair back from the table and took a deep breath . Put her down , said Gurlie to her sister before Joe could answer . No , said Astrid snuggling the infant closer , let her stay here . The child was leaning forward with both hands on the littered table and reaching for the handle of a fruit knife . No , no , mus n't touch ! Aunt Astrid took it away from her . Little Spider , she concluded kissing the child . Put her down , said Gurlie . No , said her sister , I want to hold her . The others looked and laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife again tentatively . Put her down , said Gurlie . But the fat auntie paid no attention . Yes , tell us how you came out , Joe , she said . Well , tell them then ! said his wife to him . All right , what do you want to hear ? How did it come out ? Who won ? That 's it , said Gurlie . Who won ? And she laughed sharply slapping the table with her two hands . Humph , said Joe carefully tilting the ash off the end of his cigar onto the metal ashtray . He paused . Go on , said Gurlie . You 've been sitting there for an hour without a word to anybody .. You must n't say that , spoke up Mathilda . I 've been enjoying the conversation , said Joe . Tell them how much they raised your salary after what you did forp125them , said Gurlie . I want to hear you say it . Joe looked down . Well , did n't I tell everybody long ago how much I 'd get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine now . All the partners resigned in my favour . All I have to do now is find money to pay the bills with . And he chuckled to himself and put his cigar slowly to his lips . You better tell them , he turned to his wife , you know more about it than I do . And he blew a cloud of smoke gently into the air and looked at it as it rose against the ornamented Christmas tree beyond the curtains in the next room . They were all waiting . He kept them that way for a moment . Then he continued , everybody won . We finished our contracts then closed down . When we reopened last month the typographersgot what they asked for and so everybody is happy . And how did you make out ? asked Mr. Lindquist at his side . Well , I still have my job , said Joe . They did n't even say thank you , broke in Gurlie . And that man there , after risking his life . . . Nonsense , said Joe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think it 's nonsense when I sit here night after night ... ? Would you have been better off if they fired me ? said Joe . Oh you 're crazy , said Gurlie . He 's crazy . Joe you 're a case , said Lindquist . That was delicious wine you had today , he changed the subject , good stuff , do you know it ? Where did you get it ? Somebody gave it to us , Joe told them , for nothing . Yes , said the big fellow with the pleasant face and the scar through his upper lip , very good . I 'll bet it cost you a penny , Stecher . Well , one more year will soon be over , he continued . New Year 's Day in a little less than a week , think of that . Another year gone . Ow ! What 's that under my feet ? suddenly cried out Astrid . Oh , the cat . The cat came out and put his feet up on her chair then , and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretty pussy . Then thep126conversation broke in half . Gurlie and Mrs. L , with Astrid listening and shaking her head , were still at the treatment Joe had received from his employers after the strike . While Mr. L and the other couple with Joe between them started to speak of a friend who had recently lost his wife from pneumonia . Grandma , who did n't sit as high as the other ladies , sat alone trying to get the meat out of a nut . Come on with us , said Mathilda . You should n't sit alone like that on Christmas . Move over here . We young people forget that you are here , sometimes . We are so selfish , we think only of ourselves . That 's right , Grandma agreed . I was young once too . I know . But I have had my time . It 's you who have to do the work now , so you must have the first place . Things were different then , were n't they ? Yes , different . I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months ahead . What is that ? She 's a little deaf , said Gurlie . I say , they used to begin to cook two months before Christmas . Yes , I 've been cooking a little . She made the cookies , sandbackles , a month ago . They 're delicious  --  these little cakes . How do you make them ? You have to have cream and eggs , began Grandma . And they all laughed . Yes , but eggs and cream cost too much now . I can imagine , said Mathilda . In the old country they would use cream by the quart and two dozen eggs in one cake . Oh well , that 's past now , said Grandma . Perhaps it 's better so . We used to eat too much and too rich food too . I thought it was Americans who did that , said Mathilda . You know what they say about Americans : They dig theirpI27graves with their teeth . Oh ! Mathilda went on , seeeing a mark on the back of the old lady 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bad . That 's nothing . I ca n't see so well now . I forget the pan is hot . You know what they say : It 's only good cooks that get burned . Anyone can cook , just give them something to cook with , answered the old lady in her gruff voice . Sweet little Spider , said Astrid at this point to the baby , I 'm going to take her in to see the tree again . There she met Joe who had preceded her and was standingnear the tree looking out of the front window as if judging the weather . What are you doing , Lottie , so quiet here all alone ? said the fat auntie with the baby in her arms to the older girl who all this time had been in the front room without a sound out of her . Reading , said she without looking up . Oh no , said Astrid patronizingly , you 're not old enough for that . Yes , said the child with great determination as she looked up from the picture-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astrid turned away from her and walked toward the tree with the baby eager to touch everything . Come look , she called to the other ladies . Come here a minute . And she turned and nodded with her head toward Louie . Is n't she beautiful ! And the ladies all looked at Louie reading on the sofa , who smiled appreciatively and went on with her book . But look . Lottie , look up . Look at those eyes . And Lottie obligingly simpered and made big sentimental eyes . She was pretty with her long black curls . The baby by a sudden swing of its arm managed to bat an ornament at one of the branch-tips . No , no , must n't touch . But the infant leaped up and down humping itself and relaxing while ecstatic grins lit its little face  --  so the Auntie glanced covertly toward the dining room where the other ladies had returned and gave it just a taste of a candy cane . Joe , came Gurlie 's voice from the other room . Astrid jumped . What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pretty Mrs. Lindquist entering and taking him by the arm with a laugh , we missed you . Come in with the ladies , you ca n't run off like that . What ! Are we going to eat again ? said Joe . Coffee and cake . You must come . And then we want you to play the violin for us . Is n't that right , Captain ? Yes , yes , said the big fellow . You think so , said Joe . Look at this place . I better pick up a few things . No . You must come with me . You 're not going to clean it up now I hope , are you ? But we 've just finished eating . Astrid , shouted Gurlie from the other room . Coffee . Come . We want to talk to you . Give me that baby , she said then , appearing suddenly . Give her to me . And sho gathered some toys at random and heaped them on tit. floor  --  a small doll , an animal on wheels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to attract the baby . Leav her here now . And down she sat the baby in the middle of that litter . Lottie , watch the baby . Lottie looked over the top of her book , looked , cams over , took the small music box away from the baby and went back to her reading . I should think she 'd put things in her mouth , leaving her that way , said Astrid , with all those broken ornaments on the floor , they 're glass you know . No she wo n't , said Gurlic . Let her learn . Someday you may be sorry , said Grandma . Yes , said Mathilda . And I noticed a lot of pins on the floor from the packages and all that . No , said Gurlie , she wo n't swallow them . She knows . lint Gurlie . . . Oh there are pins here on the floor all the time ,  |p129I  showed her one and stuck her finger . Pin ! I said to her . Pin ! Pin ! So she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to the room and was holding up her right hand with the index nger and the thumb together and trying to look over her shoulder . Look at that ! said Astrid , as she and Mathilda almost fell over each other as they ran in to her . But it turned out to be nothing at all when they got there . h you little faker , said Astrid . She must have heard what c were saying . But is n't that cute ! said Mathilda . Is n't that tile . Think of it . Let me sit here and play with her . No , said Gurlie , from the other room whence she had of stirred . This is Christmas , we ca n't be watching babies cry minute . Come . You must come . I want to see your11ng . Take it off . I want to try it . Mathilda was obliging . With the ring on her firm finger Gurlie got up and went over to her husband . Look here r. , she said , shaking the ring on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give their wives . Oh but look what you have , chided Mathilda . She ca n't see that , she only wants ore , said Joe . You ought to be glad , answered his wife. ou need someone to make you go ahead . Oh you 're terrible , Gurlie , said Mathilda . It 's a fine ring , said Joe . No sooner had the ladies left the front room than the t walked quietly in , flopped down on the floor and began roll over with its four paws in the air for all the world like a dog . Look at that cat , said Astrid , wo n't it hurt the baby ? Gurlie did n't even answer her . 1 ' The baby sat where its mother had placed it for a long me without moving . But now it seemed to come to life . She struck right and left with her hands at the jumble of toys before her and looked up delightedly at the havoc she had wrought . But seeing no face above her she grew serious . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be an abacus . Leaning far forward from the hips until she was almost on her belly she managed to just get hold of it . Having possessed herself of the object she looked at it intently , critically , then , touching the coloured beads with her left hand she saw them move . Cautiously she withdrew her hands , then half advanced them to the beads again , stoppingand looking around into the dining room for support . When a violent . . . She stopped , swallowed hard and then held her breath as hard and as long as she could . The cough began but she would not give in till it burst from her against her mightiest efforts to control it . She bowed her head struggling and clasped her little hands tightly together before her . She made so little noise , her back to the talkers , that she was not noticed till with a stifled gasp she ended  --  and sneezed violently . Once more , everybody but Gurlie came about and the Auntie and Mathilda ran . It 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . The infant was sobbing a little but brightened after a moment in Astrid 's arms . Put her back where she was , said the mother , I can watch her from here . So back she went to the toy-heap . The abacus was still before her . She looked at it as if recalling what had happened then with one pointing finger began to move the beads one at a time , carefully . But in the end , emboldened , she struck the beads with both hands , bang , bang ! and pushed the thing away . What is Christmas in this country ? the old Captain was saying . It 's not the same as at home . You 're right . It 's to see who can show off the most with presents , and expensive presents . There ought to be a law against it , said Joe in his imitation coarse voice , frowning darkly . Yes , there is nowhere the real feeling of Christmas and all the colour and so quiet . Music and bells and real happiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't refuse the presents . Oh you , said Mathilda , you always say something like that . Why should we , said Gurlie , it 's coming to us . Then what do you expect ? said Joe . It 's because everybody wants to beat the next one , said Mathilda . There is no feeling of . . . of reality . I ca n't express it . You express it well , said Joe . No , I 'm sorry but I do n't , replied Mathilda sadly smiling . It 's because everybody wants to beat the next one , saidJoe . That 's the American way . Unless you have more thananybody else you have to feel ashamed of yourself . Oh you should n't talk like that , Joe , said Mathilda . No . He 's right , said Gurlie . So give it to us . Sure , said Joe . Give us another bottle of that Rhine wine . The Captain 's glass here has been empty for the last half hour . Come on . Think of somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindquist suddenly . Is he crazy ? Vicious , his look wild , suddenly the beast had galloped up over the back of an upholstered chair in the front room , clawing it wildly . Then diving under it he lay on his back , clawed at the bottom , propelled himself upside down sliding on the floor under it with vigorous strokes all the way under the chair and out again on the other side . Look at that beast ! He 's drunk , said Joe . Wo n't he hurt the baby ? No , said Gurlie , he just wants to play . I know but .. . It 's the booze , said Joe . The booze ? What do you mean ? Everybody has to have booze , the cats too . It 's catnip , corrected Gurlie . Oh , said Mathilda , that explains it . I see now . Booze . Yes , that 's good , said the big fellow . Everybody has to have booze . That 's right too . Very good . P132It had been five cents worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag with a red ribbon at the top and hung on a low branch of the tree . The cat had chewed a hole in it and scattered the stuff on the carpet the first thing in the morning . They all watched . The cat was now walking slowly over the carpet , his head down , his nose just touching the floor delicately , regularly as he walked , snuffing the aromatic dust . Now he found the bag again . He batted it with his paw and it disappeared under the tree . The cat stopped suddenly not having seen where the bag had gone and looked right and left a little bewildered . Then lifting his head high and cocking it to one side he saw the bag and crouched down at once , his neck stretched out , and began to tread quickly with his back feet , wiggling his haunches eagerly from side to side . Then with a dash he pounced on the object , tossed the thing into the air , rolled over holding it in his arms and biting it while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing motions . There 's the wild beast for you , said Lindquist . Look at that . And again the cat batted the collapsed bag , then with a long run and a slide , the forepaws held rigidly before him , he drove it under the cloth around the tree and as suddenlyturned his back on it and sat down , turned up his rear parts and began to lick them carefully . After which he flopped once more to the ground , completely at rest , as though nothing had happened and in another moment was fast asleep  --  his forepaws folded in under his furry breast , his eyes closed and his head sunk forward until his nose rested drunkenly on the carpet . Look at him , said Mathilda , that 's the way we all feel after we eat too much . A silly beast , said Lindquist . Is he a torn ? Yes . But I prefer a female cat every time , said Gurlic , they 're much smarter.  |p167I  'm hot , said the child and started to unbutton her coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small lake . Green threads of branches hung almost to the ground . In fact they touched the ground . While at the top the faint green was quite lost in the sky 's brightness . As Gurlie had sat down she had first brushed the bench off with bare hand . Now she saw that it was small brown flowers which she had struck away . Some had in the meantime dropped upon her lap and the air was very sweet . It was an elm . As she looked up the twigs of it were knotted with those flowers . You could see quite a distance through the trees which were no longer a monotonous and uniform tangle of bare branches . Individual trees could be distinctly made out on the general background by their green or red outlines . Small points of green which near at hand you had to look close to discern in the distance took on a shape . Lottie had spied the water and some white birds floating on it so Gurlie got up and ambled after her , thinking . Here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dozen ducks and two swans  --  more aloof  --  came thrashingto the edge of the lake as Gurlie and the child approached . Lottie was frightened and fled behind her mother . But Gurlie laughed and spoke to the birds . I have n't a thing to give you . Shoo ! Go along with you . But the birds thinking something had fallen among them as Gurlie raised her hand rushed into a struggle and then , turningabout , swam off turning their eyes quickly right and left to see that they were not being cheated . Behind them a white feather floated on the water . The wind took it and it skated toward the centre of the lake till one of the ducks bore down on it , seized it in its bill , champed it a moment rapidly and dropped it  --  to sail no more . There was nothing to do but look and walk , the place was quiet at that hour and Lottie was very good . Presentlyp168they came to some higher trees on a knoll with rocks and rhododendrons to the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to stop once more . It was dark and cool behind the rocks . Underneath one of the rhododendronsin a hollow of wet leaves was actually a small patch of fast melting snow but almost black with dirt . As Gurlie put her foot to it it fell apart , rotten . From there the two took a turn down toward a tunnel under the carriage driveway . No one was in it but themselvesso Gurlie yipped and yodelled to amuse the child . Yip ! Yip ! Yip ! It sounded loud and hollow . Lottie did n't like it and wanted to go back . They went on and came out into the sun again on the farther side where three labourers were spading up a flower bed . The two stopped to watch them . The men glanced up sidewise but kept to their work . Gurlie moved closer . Is it good soil here ? she said . I should n't think so in the city . The men , evidently foreigners , said something to each other in an undertone , glanced toward the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt . Dirty pigs , said Gurlie half aloud and went on . It was a lovely day . Lottie had some peanuts after an hour or so and Gurlie bought a glass of lemonade from which both drank a little . And so the time passed . As the afternoon wore on more and more children came out to play . Lottie watched them with her wondering eyes but she was bashful . Once a woman stopped her when she had got twenty feet or so in front of her mother and asked her who she was . The woman was smiling and old but Lottie would not answer her . I think she 's lost her tongue , the woman said to Gurlie as she came up . Oh no , said Gurlie . Then in that part of the park where they arrived children were everywhere running and rolling on the grass . It was permitted . Close to the two walkers were a dark girl and a blond of perhaps four or five years of age . The blond one , with her two arms held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and round and round . Both were laughing as the spinner went more slowly and more slowly wavering and laughing drunkenly until she fell to the ground . An older boy almost knocked Lottie down dodging back and forth behind her while another larger tried to catch him . They were out of breath and laughing . Finally the smaller one gave up and bending down the other leaped from the front upon his back and taking the first one 's head between his knees began to slap his rump with both hands . Stop that ! said Lottie . Children were lying and rolling all about them , the boys especially , wrestling and chasing each other up and down . I want to go home , said Lottie , I 'm tired . Come on , it 's too nice to go home yet . We 'll sit down again , said her mother who was tired too . Whew ! it is hot . And we 'll take another little rest . Home on the block Maggie wheeled the baby up and down but it would n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let the thing sit up and look around . It was very warm on the sunny side of the street so Maggie turned the carriage around to keep the sun out of the baby 's eyes and sat down on the steps , blocking the carriage wheels with her feet so that it would n't roll as she leaned her arms over the side of it and made funny faces at the baby . She 'd push her face forward to within an inch of the baby 's face and say , Ah there ! then draw it back again . Then she 'd put her face slowly forward once more until she was close up to the baby , then draw it back and lean it forwardagain  --  tilting the carriage a little toward her each time  --  and saying , Ah there ! until the baby got to expect it and would lean her own face forward openmouthed so that her nose actually touched Maggie 's each time the game was repeated . At first the infant blinked a little to see Maggie 's faceF* coming at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few tries she gave a little laugh and then with each new approach she laughed louder until she went into fits of laughter followed by an exciting period of waiting as the girl drew back once more . It ended in an embrace and the girl snuggling her nose down into the baby 's tummy . You 're a little darling . Whew ! it was getting hot . Maggie took her hat off and threw open her coat . The baby also looked hot so Maggie loosed the ribbon of her cap which was tied under the chin . At this the child reached up and wanted to drag the encumbranceoff . No , no ! Must n't do that . The baby looked at her and the minute Maggie had lowered her warning finger she did it again . And so this too became a game until Maggie grew a little impatient and slapped the baby 's hands . She whimpered and threw herself back on her pillow . Hello Maggie ! came the voice of another girl who had approached from up the block , she also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked . The second baby was a very small one and sleeping . But little Flossie was up again all smiles and started to chatter and cry out . Shut up ! said the other girl harshly under her breath . You 'll wake my kid . But Flossie thought this a game also . She looked at the newcomer a moment seriously and then said , Huh ! and waited for a reaction . Shut up ! I told you , said the new maid . Huh ! continued the baby . Shut up ! said the girl . Huh ! said the baby with curiosity written all over her face . But the girl did n't answer her this time so she shut up . The girl was too interested in what she was saying to Maggie to bother with the baby further . You 're making a fool of yourself over that nut . Maybe I am , said Maggie , lowering her face . Why , he 's playing you for a sucker , ca n't you see that ? You do n't think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? Maggie did n't have a word to say.  |p171Come  on with me and Jim . I want you to meet his kid brother . No , said Maggie . O.K. , said the older girl , but do n't say I did n't give you the lowdown on that cheap sport . Why , Mag , he is n't worth wasting your time on . What 'd you ever get out of him anyway ? Did you ever get anything ? Everything Maggie could think of at that moment seemed more than a little insignificant . I could tell it . Why he would n't give up a nickel without you 'd hold him up and rob it off him . He 's the worst I ever seen .. . He 's good looking , said Maggie . Sure he 's good looking , that 's how he gets away with it . Aw come on . Give him a stand-up for once . It 'll put him in his place . He needs it bad . Come on with us . It 'll be a grand dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me . You 'll have the time of your life . No . What are you gon na do then ? He 'll probably take you out in the park and give you a free seat on a bench for your trouble . Honestly I did n't think you was that weak . Now the new brat set up a squawk and Maggie 's friend had to get up and tend to him . She joggled the carriage violently a while but the baby still continuing to yell in a high maddening voice , Come on , she said to Maggie . Walk down the block with me . So the two went off wheeling the carriages side by side down to the corner . There they stood talking , rocking the infants back and forth pendulumwise as they themselves stepped back and forth one foot to the other . How are they treatin ' you ? said the friend . Pretty good , said Maggie . I wish I could say the same for the pain in the neck that 's got me hired . What a washout she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na break down and cry on your shoulder . But don't fool yourself , can she find things for you to do . She 's got the feet run off me . And that piece of cheese  --  pointing to the baby  --  you ca n't hit him with a brick and put him to sleep . I 'd like to push him into the river . A boy whistled to them from a delivery wagon which went crashing down the street on the rough cobbles . They turned their backs on him . Remember now , the new girl was saying , Saturday night . Tie a can to that piece of boloney and come on with us . I 'll remind you of it tomorrow . Good bye darling . Maggie got fed up with the kids playing ball on the block a while later and took the infant into the house . It looked as if it might rain , also . Where in hell is your mother ? she asked the infant when they had got upstairs . She 's got big ideas , that woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do n't you go to sleep ? she said to the baby . But she loved the baby and kissed her on the head when she spoke to it . Its little head was all sweaty from the heavy hat it had been wearing . Maggie got a brush and sitting in the open front window where the warm sun was still shining she brushed the child 's yellow hair out into a halo about its head . It was really very pretty with the sun streaming in on it . At the sight of the child 's hair Maggie became interested and having nothing else to do she just went on fiddling with it tying a small piece of blue ribbon around it at the back in a very abbreviated pigtail . But that was no good , there was n't enough of it , so she parted it in the middle and tried to gather it at the two sides . That was better . The effect , in fact , was striking , making the child look very much older than her one year . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hair threw the rest of the get-up out of scale so Maggie fished out an old summer dress of Lottie 's with which she further dolled up her little charge . Then seeing the child so pale she rouged her cheeks . Finally as a last touch , she took offpI73the yellow glass-bead necklace which she herself wore and putting it over the baby 's head she tied it into a knot at the back . It made a perfect baby-faced prima donna . Now grin , she said to the baby . Look . Like this . Show your teeth . The baby was n't long in imitating her perfectly  --  till Maggie almost fell over laughing  --  and again and again . But where the hell is that mother of yours ? A fine birthdayshe 's given you . Listen . She leaned down to the baby . Damn . Say it . Damn . Damn , said Maggie . Say it . Da ! said the baby trying very hard . No . Listen . Damn . Da ! said the baby . Anyhow you 're my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she took her intothe kitchen with her and began to look around for supper ... or I 'll be slaughtered . Beside the bench where Gurlie and her daughter were sittingran a hedge and by it were three children cutting up high jinks . One was a mannish little fellow , four years old perhaps , in a big cap who was marvellously showing off before two girls . Shuffling up and down and making grotesquefaces with his tongue stuck out . The girls were seriously attentive . Finally in the excess of his gyrations the little sport crashed into the matted edge which , bending solidly , elasticallybounced him back again . That was a great discovery . At first he was surprised , a bit taken aback . Then finding he was not hurt  --  much , he crashed , backward , into it again . The little girls were delighted and as he did it again and again all three began wildly laughing . Finally one of the little girls herself essayed it and the stiff hedge branches went up her coat sleeve and scratched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she looked at the offending hedge reproachfully and tears came to her eyes . Then growing angry she stood off and struck the hedge with her uninjured hand , repeatedly , blow after blow  --  so that all laughed again and she too amid her tears . The boy then attacked the hedge in earnest , pummeling it and finally , since nothing happened , he took hold of severel individual branches of it and bent them downwardtrying to break them off . This was too much for Gurlie . Stop that ! she said , naughty children . What are you trying to do ? No wonder we have no parks . Ca n't you see these things are planted to be taken care of ? Look you 're breaking all these branches . And look here on the ground all the green shoots you 've knocked off .. . The children came to with a start and backed away while she was talking . Then they turned and ran , laughing and skipping sidewise when they were a few yards off , then whispering . So Gurlie sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Baby carriages went by and then a little boy in a heavy overcoat with breast pockets and wearing a sailor hat came directly up to Lottie and stood there leering . Hm ! said Gurlie . Lottie shrank against her mother . The little boy reached out and deliberately laid his hand on Lottie 's breast . Lottie lowered her head but kept looking at the little boy under her hat brim . He crouched down and looked up into her face . A tall smiling woman came along the path and said , Ah ha ! so there you are . I told you not to run away . She looked at Gurlie , smiling . Do you like the little girl ? she asked her son . Gurlie understood at once that they were Jewish . She did not smile . Come on Sidney , you must n't bother the little girl . Come mein Kind . Nothing doing . The woman who was gentle faced and well into the thirtiestook the small boy by the arm  --  or tried to do so . Hep175shook her off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain and thunder . And sure enough dark clouds had come up . But the small boy fought his mother the more . Gurlie burst into her harsh , uncaring laughter and said , You should spank him if he does that . No , the woman shook her head , he 's a good boy . It ended in a scene . The boy struck at his mother , repeatedly , even tried to kick her . So , so , mein Kind , she said . What will the lady think about you ? But Sidney did n't give a damn , apparently . He lost himself in a blind fury , threw himself on the ground in his blue coat and lying there kicked his heels up and down and yelled . The mother tried to pick him up . Leave him alone , said Gurlie . With that the woman sat down on the bench exhausted . The child rolled over on his stomach all covered with dirt . But Sidney , look at yourself , said the woman . Ach ! that child . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to bring him up , said Gurlie . The woman looked at her as her son , finally getting first to his knees and then his feet , and with dark looks at Lottie , went to his mother and put his head in her lap . Do n't cry , mein Kind , do n't cry . But now the little boy was saying , By , by ! to his mother , By , by ! wanting to go . By , by ! All right , she answered him , we 're going right away . Sit up . So . Let me wash your face . Stick out your tongue . So she took her handkerchief , moistened it on the child 's tongue and washed his face with it . Why is it all you people always insist on staying in the cities ? Gurlie spoke again . Why do n't some of you go out in the country where there 's light and air . That 's what you need . You 've got plenty of brainy people . I should think you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman answered her conciliatingly . But Gurlie went on . You 're always blaming us for doing things to you but it 's your own fault . You crowd into the cities . You have no love for the land . That 's what makes all the trouble . I 'm sorry we bothered you , said the woman not a little frightened , excuse it please . A little sprinkling of rain had begun . With the rain newspapers came out over hats , the nursemaidsrushed off with their carriages , the children shouted their delight , holding their faces up to feel the rain  --  but scampered . It 's not going to rain hard , Gurlie said aloud , though a low rumble of thunder sounded in the distance . She did not move but gathered Lottie close to her and watched the rain . The child watched the splotches of dark colour came upon the asphalt , one at a time . But in a few moments it was over and the warm smell of it filled the air . Gurlie breathed it deeply in . April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark on the bench and started home . On the way they came to a place where sheep were going through a gate in a fence which an old man was holding open for them . There was a dog beside him as the grey bodies shuffled through , knocking together and backing up then flowing again past him . Gurlie was surprised . Sheep ? she said . In Central Park ? I did n't know that . Yes ma 'm . He was a longfaced individual with scanty sideboards and a worn hat . The last sheep went in and he closed the gate . It makes me think of home , said Gurlie . Yes , sheep make one think of home , said the man . Gurlie noted a new accent . Are you Irish ? she said . No , said the man . Scotch ? No , ma 'm . I 'm from the North of England , ma 'm . You look like the men from home , she went on . I mean Norway . I 've never been there , said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're all the same people . We 're all mixed up together  --  Norwegian , English , Danish . . . I want to go home , Lottie tugged at her.  |p177I  love the country , Gurlie added . It 's the only place to be . If you were brought up there then that 's where you want to go . Yes , said Gurlie , I lived on a farm till I was nine years old . You 'll never get over it then . There 's been little rain this season , he went on . It 's not a good thing for the country . I was hoping we 'd get a good shower today . Oh we 'll have a wet spring yet , said Gurlie . It 'll be no good if it comes all in one day the way it does here and the next day drier than ever . The trees in this place ca n't Jive . Nor the grass either . Why do they keep sheep in the park ? asked Gurlie . It was to keep the grass down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years they 'll have to plant more grass to feed the sheep . There 's no rains here the way they are in England and you ca n't have grass without it . Maybe it 's the city keeps it off . Perhaps you 're right , ma 'm , but I do n't think so . Good day , ma 'm . Gurlie shook her head gloomily and marched on . It was five o'clock when she reached home . The maid had nothing much for supper and the fat auntie had been waiting for an hour doing what she could meanwhile to get things ready . Where have you been ? When Joe came he brought a package . You darling , said his wife bussing him on both cheeks and acting the infant as she could at times . Have you brought something nice for me ? It 's a birthday present for the baby , said Joe . Be careful now you 'll break it.  |p178STAND  up , he said as she sat naked looking at him from the table . He gave her his two index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , legs apart , uncertainly . Just a year old , eh ? He tried to loose her but she clung to him tenaciously . Shall I hold her ? No , no . She should stand alone . Of course she can , said Gurlie . Come , said the doctor to the baby . Walk . And he drew it by his fingers carefully along the table . How can she walk there ? It 's too soft . Put her on the floor , said Gurlie . But the baby put out her feet one at a time , stuck her tongue in her cheek , turned up her toes and did very well . So . Now sit down . I do n't believe at all in you doctors , Gurlie started . That 's right , no more do I. But you better listen to what I tell you  --  if you want to keep your baby . Why what 's the matter with her ? How do I know ? I 'm no genius . And he turned toward a cabinet on the far side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hunchback . Gurlie stood there , looking . Shall I dress her now ? God knows what you women bring your babies here for . I do n't , was what he answered . Well , she is n't very strong and so I thought you 'd tell me what to do to build her up . You thought so . Who told you to come here ?  |p179Some  of my friends told me that you know all about children .. . So ? They told you that . A pack of fools . But doctor .. . I 'll tell you what you came here for . You came here to have your child examined . That 's what you came here for . Sit down . Gurlie sat . A gnome , a troll , a funny man . He put his stethoscope to his ears and examined the baby 's chest all over , grunting to himself now and then , stopping , tapping with his fingers here and there , then listening again . Who in your family has had tuberculosis ? No one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Has she ... ? He turned and smiled at her . When you consult a doctor tell the truth . Gurlie flushed , wanted to speak but did n't . His eye held her fixed . This is your second child , he said . Yes , said Gurlie . And the first 's a girl ? Yes , said Gurlie . You wanted a boy ? Yes , said Gurlie . Miscarriages ? No . You 're sure of that ? What do you mean ? said Gurlie . Did you have a hard labor with this one ? Very easy , she was a little premature . Did she breathe right away ? She did . And yelled too , said Gurlie . Did you nurse her ? No . The doctor shook his head . Did you try ? Yes , I tried , said Gurlie . Then you gave her the bottle . Did you have trouble then ? Yes , said Gurlie , till an old German woman told me what to give her . I had no help from you doctors . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurlie did not answer him . Carefully the old man picked the baby up and carrying it to a scale weighed it . Then he measured it , the length and round the chest and round the head . He took the temperatureand grunted . What have you been doing to her ? he turned again to Gurlie . When was the last time you saw a doctor ? She was doing very well until she got the whooping cough . So ? The whooping cough . That 's how you took care of her . I did n't come here to be insulted , Gurlie flared up . Insulted ? That 's what you mothers need , to be insulted , said the old man looking at her stonily . Here we have a female infant , he went on as if before a class . At one year she weighs seventeen pounds six ounces . She ca n't walk alone .. He ran his fingers up and down her spine . But she is straight . No rachitis . No deformity of joints or bones . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undernourished  --  he pulled the infant 's lower eyelids down  --  and anaemic . A very good child , he added . Indeed she was a good child , not making a sound of protest all the while . But now she got down on her knees and started to crawl off . Come back here , said the doctor . He felt her head . The anterior fontanelle was still open . That 's right , he said . Oh , do n't press there , said Gurlie . Wo n't that hurt her ? And a clean scalp . The integument of the limbs and body is clear . No rash . The finger nails a little pale but aside from that normal in shape and colour . He looked into the baby 's mouth . The infant gagged and cried . Gurlie rushed to rescue her . Stop that ! said the doctor . You do it once . You do it twice . And that 's the end . She 's ruined . I 'm not killing her . Let her get used to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hears . She sees . She is properly aware of things  --  for her age . You say she says a few words ? Oh yes , she 's a regular chatter-box . She sits and talks to herself by the hour . You take her out into the air sometimes ? She 's out every day.  |p181She  does n't look it , said the doctor . You mothers think that just because you put a child outside the door all wrappedup to the eyes that 's out of doors . You 're mistaken . Unless the sun gets on her body  --  it must touch the skin  --  it does no good . Someday , when you have learned sense , you mothers , the sense of animals , you 'll take babies to the sun , in winter too , every baby , like they do now the sick in sanatoriums . Outside . Is n't that the Kneipe cure ? said Gurlie . What 's that  --  the Kneipe cure ? We wear too many clothes . We dress our children up in wool like Esquimos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in caves with just the head stuck out . The skin must breathe .. . Then you think the baby 's all right , doctor ? Put on her clothes . Gurlie began to dress the baby . But doctor , what can I do to make her eat ? I 've tried to force her but she spits it out . Never do that ! he roared . Never . What is she , a goose you 're fattening for Christmas ? If she wo n't eat , take the food away . And find the reason . But I see so many bigger children . How big is your husband ? He 's not so big . What do you expect then for a child , a mastiff ? But what shall I feed her ? Feed her anything she 'll eat . Anything ? Yes . Anything she 'll eat . She do n't like milk . The worst thing in the second year of life is too much milk . A pint a day 's enough . Feed her eggs , pot cheese , fruits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby that ate raw string beans and thrived on them . My friends call me a crank . That 's right , I am . But I am peasant stock . There 's not much to eat where I was born  --  and the children eat it and grow strong . With some exceptions . But is n't it the air that does it ? Gurie questioned . Here it 's ice cream , sugar , candy , the doctor sneered . The little darling wo n't eat his dinner , mother has to give him a cookie afterwards so he wo n't starve . And another because mother does n't like to hear her baby cry . And still another after that  --  because he wants it . And a piece of chocolate . And some ice cream for dear mother  --  and the baby gets his share . The poor thing did n't eat his dinner ! Sugar . That 's what they live on . Naturally they wo n't eat . Is n't sugar food ? No . Sugar 's fuel . It takes the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course they like it . All they want to do is go . They do n't care if the engine falls apart . But you said give them anything they want . Yes , anything they want . I do n't understand you , doctor . You said give them anythingthey want and then you say , . do n't give them sugar . Sugar 's not food I told you . Fuel . Do you understand ? Oh , yes . Put the food before them , on time , regularly and well cooked . Without a word . They 'll eat it . Unless they 're ill . If they eat it  --  and want more , give them a little sugar . Sugar is the alcohol of children , to be used the same . And chocolate is their tea and coffee . Naturally they want it  --  it contains a drug . And drugs  --  are useful . Yes , but you have n't told me what 's the matter with my child . Gurlie had the baby near her on the couch . But the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Gurlie sat and listened . I 'm afraid there must be other patients waiting . Let them wait . Yes , what 's the matter with the child ? That 's what they ask me . Is n't that what we come here for ? What 's the matter with the child ? It ' makes me laugh.  |p183The  child 's alive , that 's what 's the matter with the child . But now that I 've examined her I have to tell you in three words just what 's the matter . Then I should give you a big bottle of red medicine and presto ! not only is she cured but it has made her beautiful , intelligent and strong as a bear . He laughed . That 's what they come to doctors for . And if he does n't do it he 's a thief , a blackguard and in fact killed the child . Is it any wonder the profession 's rotten through and through with cheats ? What people want to buy there will be those to sell it to them always . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give me some advice . We 'll come to that . What is the matter with the children ? They are unhappy . She 's not unhappy . Almost , one should say , they 're born to be unhappy . Every generation kills the next 's chances of being happy in its children  --  out of envy . Malice I tell you . And that grows up into wars . Hatreds , hatreds against the parents  --  that is the rulers  --  of the world . And what do we do about it ? We build schools . Schools , mind you , those factories of despair . Fools , that 's what it rhymes with . Fools who build them to the destruction of the natural ingenuity of childhoodwhich should be learning the world , the world , mind you , and not the disappointments of elderly females who are in the menopause and can not know the subtleties  --  of history  --  of mathematics . Bah . What can they know ? To venture . To penetrate . To strike home . The unfortunate little man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked up and down before her , where she sat , her strong legs crossed at the ankles , her hands in her lap , nodding her head vigorously in approval . You 're right , she said . You 're right . Yes , I know I 'm right , he answered her . But what can I do about it ? Schools ! he went on scornfully . That 's our excuse for doing nothing . What is a school ? It is a place where knowledge is forbidden . The first law is that a teacher and a pupilp184must not be intimate . It is a prison . It is a place to kill a child  --  with stupidities they drip into their heads one drop at a time until it stupefies them . Makes mules of them . And we can do nothing to prevent it . There is no knowledge to be got in schools , only make-believes of knowledge . An imitation of what knowledge is . A bad picture , painted by sick people . What kind of man is your husband ? The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bigger than I am . That 's not so small then . A German ? Yes . Well , I tell you . Whooping cough is not a good thing in the first year . I do n't like your baby 's chest , her lungs , you understand . But I ca n't put my finger on anything specific . And I ca n't say she wo n't be worse tomorrow . She seems to have a good heart . That 's good , she 'll need it . Fresh air . Sunlight . Take her away , I can do nothing for her . No medicine ? Nothing ? Nothing . Take her to the country , to the mountains . Give her good food . But when ? When must I go ? Now . At once . A summer in New York will kill her . Gurlie came to with a start . I do n't believe it . That 's your privilege my dear lady . The attendant will take care of you outside . The Second Yearrp187WELL , we 've been talking here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything yet . Are we going to stand all summer and look at her suffering ? Oh , you make me crazy , said his wife . Take her to the country , then . Have you the money ? You 're always saying you 're so poor . Next day the fat auntie who had run over to hear the doctor 's verdict settled it by saying she knew just the place , at least she was pretty sure it could be arranged . How much ? said Joe . I do n't know , as long as you keep yourself , maybe nothing . I do n't know . Wait a couple of days . I have a friend . It must be around the north pole if it 's for nothing , said Joe after she had gone . I think we 'd better look for the address of some good boarding house in the papers . A boarding house ! said Gurlie . Not on your life . What do you think I am ? I 'd rather stay here . You sure want to kill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as much sense as you have . Well , that 's what papers are for , are n't they ? To advertisewhat 's for sale . The fat auntie 's hunch proved good . She was back the next day with the whole thing written down on a sheet of lined writing paper . The night boat to Troy , New York . The train from there to a place called Shelborn Falls , I think  --  somewhere , I do n't know exactly where , but that 's the name . Then a stage or a little train , she was n't sure which , to another town about twenty miles up into the mountains . No , she had never been there but Hilda had and it was all right . Beautiful ! No need to be afraid . An easy trip . Beautiful ! Yes , I can imagine , was Joe 's comment . But what kind of a place is this you 're shipping me off to to get rid of me ? said Gurlie . I do n't want to go away somewherewhere I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe and stood up , taking out a cigar and turning his back to them . What do you think I am ? bridled Gurlie raising her voice . To go off alone somewhere with two children , no running water , no conveniences , no place where I can get help . Gurlie , you ought to be ashamed of yourself . Nobody 's trying to do anything to you . You ought to be ashamed . Send her to Newport , remarked Joe over his shoulder from the window . But just then the baby could be heard whimpering in the bedroom . With a great contortion of its body , jackknifing itself up into a sharp angle , it had rid itself once more of the foul excrement which had been tormenting it periodically for the past two weeks . Phew ! said the fat auntie when she got to it , that 's awful . Poor little Spider . Gurlie laughed at her but said , Well , what shall I do then ? Get your things packed , tonight . I 'll help you . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it on the spot . It would do Lottie good besides . But you have n't told me the name of the place yet . Where is it ? Westminster , Vermont . It was a compatriot , in a sense , a fellow Scandinavian in any case , a Swede , who had the place . Or rather it was an old couple living alone there on a small farm , kept by their only daughter , Astrid 's acquaintance , who managed a commercial laundry in the city.  |p189Wunderschon  ! High up on a hill , the finest spring water . Their own cows . Now , she can have fresh milk . The air is different . They are good , kind people . How much will it cost ? said Joe . They are lonesome . I do n't think it will cost anything except you will have to pay for what you eat . But you can give them something , a few dollars , if you want to . In the country they do n't need much money . Do n't they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat auntie looked at him reprovingly . All right , said Joe . What 's the name ? Payson . The address ? Just Westminster , Vermont , I think . E. Payson . All right , said Joe writing it all down carefully in his vest pocket notebook with the gild edged pages . And how do you get there ? By the Hudson River boat . I 'll come in the morning to help you , said the fat auntie . Oh you darling , poor little Spider , she added going to say goodnight to the baby . Now , you 're going to be fine . And in another few moments she went out the door where Joe was waiting in his shirtsleeves to lock it after her . Good night . And much obliged . He went over to the baby 's crib and wondered if it would last long enough to get there . Be sure to take everything you need , he said to Gurlie as he was taking off his collar in the stifling bedroom . Get me the tickets and give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . Where are you putting that shirt ? He had thrown it behind the chiffonier . What an idea ! What in the world do you do that for , you , a man that 's supposed to have some sense ? Schweinerei ! his wife continued . But this was n't one of the lucky times for saying things like that . A flame of anger shot into Joe 's eyes . Why do n't you put a dirty-clothes basket where I can see it then ? I ca n't put dirty things back in the drawer . I 'm not going to throw them on the floor . And I wo n't have them lying around on the furniture where I can see them . Here , give it to me . And she threw it into the closet . That 's right . Fill up the closet till it stinks . No answer this time . And do n't get up there and begin writing me to send you this and send you that . Think now what you 'll need and take it with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a milder voice . I wish they 'd send you up into the mountains . You 're the one that needs it . Yes , said Joe . You stay home and run my business for me . The next day was scorching as it so often is toward the end of June in New York City . But by the middle of the afternoon Gurlie and Astrid and the two children with all their miscellaneous small packages were on the L bound down town . The house had been left as it was and the larger baggage had gone on ahead by express . At 23rd St. they scrambled out , descended the stairs still swaying uncertainly from the departure of the train . Be careful you do n't drop the baby . Be careful now . Be careful , said Gurlie to her sister . There at the corner they took the horse-car . Then they had to transfer at West St. to get to the dock . The time was slipping by . This is awful , said Gurlie . Ca n't he make that man ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and tell him . This is too much . Do n't excite yourself , said her sister . We have time . What is the matter now ? A loaded truck was trying to pull out in front of the horse-car but the front wheels of it stuck in the tracks and it just skidded until the sweating horses stopped and would pull no longer , tossing their heads in a lather as they fidgeted about . Then a hot argument flared up between the truck driver and the old conductor of the horse-car who had gone ahead to investigate.  |p191What  are we going to do ? said Gurlie . Finally the front door slid open . The driver poked his head in . Hold on , he said . Then , slamming the door , he geed up his old plugs . They swerved suddenly , jerking the car bodily out of the tracks and had it rattlings over the cobbles on its flanged iron wheels . He was pulling out around the stalled truck . Oh ! Oh ! said Gurlie . He 'll kill us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any moment . Oh ! But they arrived at the pier finally to see Joe standing there at the entrance , his watch in his hand . Whew ! said Gurlie laughing . You see , smarty , we got here in time after all . Yes , said her husband . Thank goodness the trunks came too . They 're on board . Come on , hurry up . Hurry up ? said Gurlie . Why we have easily half an hour before the boat sails . Ca n't you take us to a restaurant or something ? You can eat supper on board , said Joe . Come on . There were not more than ten or twelve people on the boat as yet . In fact , the purser 's window was n't even open . Joe had to go and hunt up someone so as to get into the stateroom . They had to unlock the purser 's office to get the key . You make me tired , said Gurlie , bringing us to sit on these plush chairs for another hour on a day like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A hand truck would come clattering up the gangplank , stop , bang ! and off it would go again . They tried sitting outside but the heat and the smell and the noise were too much , besides the baby decided to fall asleep  --  probably as a result of the rigours of the trip downtown . So they took it into the carpetedlittle cabin and put it on the lower bunk . I 'll stay here with it , said the fat auntie . The place was stifling . Lottie was thrilled with the long curving saloon of the boat , the stair/way , the long rows of cabin doors . Gurlie and Joe went outside . I think I better go now , he said . Do n't go away and leave me , she replied in a pretended , childish voice , pouting and taking hold of his arm . They were at the head of the gangplank up which now , finally , men , women and children were coming steadily . Do n't go away and leave me . For goodness ' sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't act like a fool . He looked around to see if she had been overheard . Quit it , he added frowning and ruffled . I 'm not going to see you for two months ! she went on in her insistent childish imitation . Agh ! he answered and started down the gangplank . Are n't you even going to kiss one ? she called after him . He merely bowed his head stepping carefully over the ladderedplanking . You come back here . That 's no way to act . She leaned on the rail talking down to him where he stood three or four feet below her . Good bye , he shouted over the continued clatter of the hand trucks , the laughing , and scuffling about him . I 'll write you . Kiss the children for me . Do n't you go yet , said Gurlie . You 've got nothing to do . Agh ! he replied . Gurlie stopped one of the boat hands who was passing and turned to the rail again . The boat wo n't be leaving for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going , he called out , looking right and left to see if anybody was looking on at this disgusting scene . There was a man in a derby leaning against one of the iron posts of the pier twenty feet behind him who looked away when Joe turned . Good bye . He raised his hand . Wait a minute , said Gurlie . What 's the matter with you ? We 're not going yet . I 've got something to do up at the house.  |p193Oh  , go on then , she said and made a motion as if she were pushing him away  --  half waving . Then as suddenly she walked over and came precariously waddling down the gangplank . What 's the matter with you ? said Joe . You 've left the children alone with Astrid . The boat may be going any minute . Go back . Ta , ta , ta , ta , to ! said Gurlie laughing now and kissing him roughly on the cheek to his intense mortification . She almost knocked his hat off . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And listen .. . Go back to the boat . Listen to me , Gurlie persisted . You 're going to be alone in the city all summer . Do n't do anything naughty . And take care of yourself . Eat properly  --  and take a bath once in a while . Sh ! he said . Not so loud . Listen here , she shook her head as if to brush off his objections , if those people at the office do n't give you a vacation so you can come and see us , I 'd take one anyway . Ja , jai said Joe . A bell rang . Go on , he said starting to push her ahead of him . Remember , said Gurlie , and send your dirty things to the laundry . Do n't throw them all over the room . Joe had her on the gangplank now where she turned and kissed him again , then walked up to the ship with a final wave . But once on deck , she went to the rail once more . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk crashed as one of the hands took it up the gangplank on the run . What ? Joe put his hand to his ear . The boat once out in the river heading upstream , the air was cool , people began moving about in a new world cut off from their former lives  --  even in this river cockle shell . The baby was asleep , the fat auntie had come up on deck for a moment also . A glorious night and Gurlie , after all ,  | just in her twenty-fifth year . She remained on deck and stood by the rail watching the boats and the piers of upper New York . A tug-boat glided sighing by , a loaded ferry was loafing in the down tide waiting for them to pass . She could see the tide carry it . Then she walked across the deck to see the sun low over the Palisades and the darkness beginning to gather along their lower parts . It was magnificent , it was quieting . She took deep breaths of the river air and remained for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensing that it was time to feed the baby and perhaps eat a bite herself , she went inside . A few older people were sitting in that rather stuffy interior . How can they with all that glorious air outside ! she said to herself , with their packages beside them , people who had not taken cabins , did n't they have the price perhaps or were they too stingy ? Five or six small children were running on the carpeted floor , jumping , already half acquainted , running in and out at the open doors . A cat stretched itself and yawned . And shaken by the steady beat of the paddle wheels an old negress in a white apron and with a feather duster clasped in her folded hands was falling asleep in a saloon chair . An officer in a blue uniform passed , looking sidewise at Gurlie as she came from the deck and began on the wrong side , looking for her cabin . But she found it soon , down a little white-enameled companionway  --  an outside room  - -  and briskly opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's asleep . And so it was , in the middle of the lower berth . Lottie 's asleep too , in there . She pointed to her own cabin next door . Why do n't we eat then ? said Gurlie . I want to go out on deck again . It 's marvellous there . You go , said her sister . I 've seen it . No , I do n't want to dress again . You go and get yourself some supper . I 'll just eat a sandwich and the stewardess can bring me a cup of tea if you 'll tell her . No , I 'll stay here.  |p195Gurlie  was restless to get on deck again . She too took a sandwich from the supper they had brought , feeling that it was n't necessary to go down to the tables on a boat like this . She did want a cup of coffee , though . Go on , said her sister . You can get coffee . Go on up on the deck . You go up and get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll lie here on the lounge . Go on . So Gurlie went out , had her coffee and returned to the deck once more . It had grown much darker . In the west over the Palisades which they were still passing a cherry red sunset flared into the sky . But lights were already out in the few houses on both sides of the river . She stood in the wind watching the Palisades whose long outline was strong on the illuminated sky . Strong feelings moved in the woman 's breast  --  ships , the floating delights of sailing , the smells of it . As she stood there watching and breathing deeply of the evening air , people passed behind her talking quietly . A beautiful evening . There 's the moon . Well , we all have our fling , a deep , slow voice began , but the most of us settle down , and make the best of it later . Yes , said a high woman 's voice , me too . Gurlie raised one foot up on an iron cleat to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entranced with the scene , restless , wondering what it was all about . Sailing away . Nature is marvellous , she said to herself over and over . Mother Nature , that 's what we need . She was not at first conscious of a man a little way along the rail from her who too was leaning watching the Palisades , a man in a straw hat smoking a cigarette . Gurlie smelt the smoke of the cigarette which , in fact , passed just under her nose . She turned to look . The man also was looking . She quickly turned the other way and walked out along the rail toward the prow of the boat . Fifteen minutes later , well up the prow where she had found a place with her back to the pilot house and the lightsp196of Haverstraw beginning to be visible across the broad Tappan Zee , again she felt that someone was watching her . She did n't want to go in , she was enjoying the hard , steady breeze , dreaming , travelling through the air , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . If he speaks to me , I 'll slap his face , she thought . ' What kind of people are there in the world , anyway ? The man had done nothing so far but stand there . But now he turned and looked directly at her smiling . A lovely night , is n't it ? he commented . Yes , she said , it 's a beautiful night . He spoke pleasantly in a nice way but moved a little closer to Gurlie along the rail . Do you often make this trip ? he asked . Sometimes , said Gurlie . I have heard of the Hudson River all my life , said the man . It 's quite up to expectations . I come from Milwaukee . Gurlie did not reply . Then she changed her mind . Are you with your family ? She was going to add that she was travelling with her sister and two children but some how it did n't seem to be the thing to say when it came just to saying it . No , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you ? My children are asleep , said Gurlie ambiguously . Then wondered why she had put it just that way . Good , said the man . Have you had supper ? Yes , said Gurlie , determined to be very short this time . What time do we arrive in Troy , do you know ? We are scheduled to arrive at about seven A.M. I believe . Do n't you find the wind rather damp up here ? No , said Gurlie , I like it . Yes , but I think you really should have a coat if you intend to stay here very long . Fresh ! thought Gurlie to herself . I do n't feel cold , she replied . There was a moment 's silence.  |p197You  're sure I could n't help you  --  in any way , said the man finally , turning his face again toward Gurlie , I feel myself as if I need a nice warm drink , something to warm me up for the evening . Gurlie did n't want to leave the deck of the ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , before this intruder had come to annoy her . She did n't want to go in and she could n't tell him to leave her alone . After all , she felt sorry for the man . Agh , she 'd better go . Yes , you 're right , it 's getting cold here , she said , I think I 'll go in . I wish you would n't , said the man , looking squarely into her eyes . Gurlie 's eyes shifted , then she raised them and looked straight back at him . Hum ! she said shrugging her shoulders and turned and left him . In the morning they were at Troy.  |p198A  T Troy the fat auntie bid them good-bye , on the train for Shelborn Falls . Wherever that is , said Gurlie . Lottie pressed her nose against the window smiling and waved her hand vaguely to the big woman standing outside . They could n't open the window . What ? She was saying something . Never mind , she signalled with her hands and head , smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . All gone , said Lottie . The baby was sitting upon a seat opposite her mother , a seat which had been turned over to give them a little compartmentto themselves . A man came by selling candy . Lottiegave him a broad grin but nothing happened . And so they were off . The baby had n't done badly on the trip so far , which was quite characteristic of her , she usually did well when it was necessary . For the most part , on the boat , when not asleep she had been content to sit with intensely serious face lookingaround as if listening . It may have been the noise of the engines . She made little resistance when lifted , shifted . From the boat to the train she had felt tight holds and slipping grasps in complete relaxation . The sun in her eyes , she had blinked , screwed up her face . Going into the tunnel dark she had stretched her eyes wide open . Smells were new . Voices that were familiar were interrupted by strange sounds . She merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to sit up or stand when she was made to lie down . Now she wanted to remain lyingp199when , ill supported , she was made to stand . She wanted food when none was at hand , was attracted by new sights when food was offered  --  and looked away from it . Then ate . In the main , though , she offered no serious objections to anything . And she was dry . That 's wonderful , said the fat auntie . She had travelled well . At Shelborn Falls only about ten people got down . They were in the middle of high green mountains , a swift , shallow stream could be heard occasionally between the shouts , the shufflings and the steady throbbing of the engine at rest . Then the conductor gave his signal , the trainman took it up , the engineer rang his bell and there the woman and the two small children were left in the country . For a moment Gurlie was at a loss what to do , then seeing her trunk going off with two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , the baby in her arms , Lottie behind her . Is this where we take the train for Westminster ? Yes 'm , right here  --  in about two hours . What ! said Gurlie . The man did n't give any other answer but continuedslowly pushing the heavy hand truck up the platformto another on a curving spur which Gurlie noticed now coming in to meet the main line from the north . The man got the truck where he wanted it , blocked the wheels with a piece of cord-wood , hooked the handle upright and shambledoff to the station house in the angle between the two tracks . By the time Gurlie got there , he had gone inside . She went in also . Most of the other passengers from the Albany train were sitting around in the waiting room with their things . The ticket window was closed . Well , this is the country all right , said Gurlie to herself . Two hours ! Whew . It was already almost noon and the baby needed a bottle . No hot water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except a small shelter off to the rear with two doors in it . Men  --  Women.  |p200The  baby was fed a cold bottle which Astrid had prepared on the boat that morning . After Gurlie changed her , she wanted to walk . So Gurlie took her outside and they walked up and down . It was beautiful out of doors and as silent as the middle of a field . The shuffle of the baby 's small feet on the rough planking of the station walk sounded actually loud to the slow stepping of her mother beside her . The continual rustle of the broad shallow river rushing over its many stones served as an accompaniment . A small breeze picked up the dust . A few sparrows chirped in the roadway . Flies buzzed . Far at the other end of the platform two men walked up and down talking and smoking . The village was close by but Gurlie had no desire to go to it . Instead , she went on , then continued up the other platform , walking slowly with the baby until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really her trunk they had after all . Two or three of the other passengers were there ahead of her standing around somewhat self-consciously , saying a word now and then and smiling . As she came up , they turned their backs . There was a curious odour about this part of the platform . Gurlie stopped short . Why , that 's whisky . She went closer , then she heard it  --  drip , drip , drip ! It was coming from under the baggage . She laughed . What do you think of that ? The others turned where they were and continued smiling . But nobody made another move . So , as soon as she saw that her own baggage was out of the drip , Gurlie turned and went back the way she had come . Vermont being a dry state , this was a shipment of spirits going disguised in a burlap bag from Massachusetts . One of the bottles must have been cracked when the lot was thrown from the baggage car onto the truck . The mountains all around them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large bird , an eagle , slowly wheeled  --  not a sound once more but the river , the patter of the baby 's feet and Gurlie 's slow heel strokes , hesitatingp20Iand beginning again beside them . No , no ! The baby wanted to pick up a white button which lay upon the boards . Gurlie held her away from it by the hand . Then , without warning , the huge engine of a fast moving freight burst with a terrifying crash into the station . The children and Gurlie too were scared almost out of their wits . It was n't six feet from where they were walking . The ground shook , dust and cinders flew , the light was cut off and then rattling and thumping , clump-clump , clumpclump , it roared by and was gone . Gurlie took the children into the station again . Lottie 's eyes were half-closed with the dirt . And the baby was crying . It was cool in there and practically empty now . There was just one woman there , in fact , in a blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lottie 's age and two somewhat older . She had several small bundles at her side but one big valise which Gurlie saw her open and from it take four apples which she gave , one to each of the children . They were a poorly dressed , timid looking lot , so Gurlie , bored with waiting and looking around for something to do , went over to talk to them . Are you waiting for the same train I am ? Yes 'm , I suppose so . War be you goin ' , to Westminster ? Yes , said Gurlie . Do you live there ? Well , not exactly , said the woman , but I used to . I hai n't been thar for more'n thirty year tho ' . Thought I 'd like to go back and see the folks . Well , now , said Gurlie , that 's interesting . Are they all still alive there ? Were last time I heard of them , laughed the woman , about two weeks ago . I bin livin ' out near Chicago ever since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl . You 'll find the place changed , said Gurlie , remembering what she had heard from the fat auntie of the popularity of the pretty village as a summer resort since the narrow gauge road had been built to it in recent times.  | ' Spect I will , said the woman . Did you bring those apples from the west ? asked Gurlie in her usual outspoken manner . That 's quite a big bag to carry all that distance . Yes , ' t was pretty heavy at first . But we et ' em pretty fast . Most gone now . Do n't take three young uns long to finish a bag of apples on a trip like this . Like to have one ? asked the woman . No thanks , said Gurlie , you keep them for the children . Like the big girl to have one ? Yes , said Gurlie . They 're Baldwins , said the woman . Grew them on our own place . She your daughter ? Here you are , sis , try one of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand before handing it to Lottie who took it shyly . Pretty head of hair she has , them black curls . Must be from her father . You stayin ' in Westminster long ? Just for the summer , said Gurlie . I wish to heaven that train would get here . You 'd think they 'd plan to make betterconnections . Guess it do n't pay ' em much to bother about it , said the woman in her practical voice . Then in another half hour Gurlie heard the far whistle and finally the approaching noise of the narrow gauge train . The ticket window opened with a snap and everybody came to purchase their passes . There was the engine , then , after it , its tender , next a freight car , then the baggage car and finally at the end , a passenger coach with the name Hoosack Tunnel and WestminsterR . R. painted in gold letters in full on it and the initials only , H. T. &; W. on the tender  --  the Hoot , Toot and Whistle as some local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of backing , to get the engine shunted around . Then the passengers got in . The freight was loaded  --  with a laugh for the spilled whisky  --  and finally they got off.  |p203To  Gurlie it was at first a relief , then a source of alarm . The whole thing rocked so , and what curves ! And what grades ! It was n't more than a twenty mile run up the DeerfieldValley but at places Gurlie thought it more a goat than a railroad train she was riding . Directly below she could see the river and that 's all she could see . This is awful ! she cried half aloud fearful lest the movement of her body in the thing would tip it over . But nobody else seemed disturbedso when the little train went scuttling across fields again , she relaxed and thought , at last , we are there . The engine gave a sigh of relief after the two hour ramble and went to sleep breathing quietly on the dead end track in the middle of rows of piled up cordwood  --  until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they 'd taken off their cloth caps and put on their ordinary coats . Several tall middle aged farmer types came over to the baggage car and leaning their arms on the door edge , looked in . Another group , men mostly , quietly watched the passengers alighting , waving a hand occasionally to someoneand coming forward . There was no hurry . How are you ? They seemed shy , not wanting to make a show of their emotions . Someone took the mail bag and went off with it on his shoulder to the village . There was no one to meet Gurlie . No one paid any attention to her with baby and small child . But she was content for the moment  --  the very air was different  --  you could feel it at once . She saw a young man with a horse and carriageover by the side of the station and asked him if he knew where the Paysons lived . No , he did n't know that but , if she wanted someone to take her up there , he thought she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a dollar . There 's usually a carriage you can hire if someone else does n't get it first . Yes , I know where ' t is . Over past Ray Pond . I 'm driving up that way in about ten or fifteen minutes . I 'll come back and pick you up . I got these things to take in to the town first . In an amazingly short time , in spite of their slow movements , everyone had disappeared , even the engineer and the rest of the crew were gone , the baggage had been carted off and not a soul could be seen but one man in a blue striped denim suit . Gurlie was worried . Oh , he 'll be along after a while , the man assured her . If he said he 'd do it , he 'll be back . You do n't need to worry . Stay right where you are . So there Gurlie stayed , on that beautiful afternoon , waitingwith her children . Just back of the station was a low whitepainted wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the barn . Back of that again she could see that the ground dipped down suddenly to a small stream and in the front yard , a lawn of deep , bright green grass , was a profusion of flowers . Gurlie felt the peace of the place already a benediction . The carriage came . Gurlie and the children climbed into the back seat . The trunk was loaded up beside the driver and they were off , a little brown mare turning and trotting down the steep hill from the station , across the bridge and into the village at a round clip . It was a smooth dirt road . They turned right at the crossroads in the center of the town and now on the upgrade the carriage went more slowly . Is this Westminster ? said Gurlie . Yes , ma 'm . Just this ? ' Well there are a good many farms around here but this is what we call town . On both sides were the low , whitepainted Vermont houses of those who had made enough money to come and live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two main streets whose crossing made the business section of thep205town with its post office , drug store , bank , and general supply store , the rolling fields stretched out again rising to the near hills with other farther hills behind them  --  a house here , another there in the distance , cattle feeding  --  and dark heavily wooded hills beyond . Peaceful it was and the air magnificent . So this was Vermontof which she had heard so much from her Scandinavianfriends . How far is the Payson farm ? Oh , about three miles , I guess . What 's happened to all the people around here ? asked Gurlie . Where are they  --  ? She had hardly seen a soul since they started out , just a few shabby children chasing a dog , barefooted and bareheaded , near an unpainted house on the outskirts of the village . Working I guess . They 're around . What do they do ? Farm , I suppose . No , not much . Most work in the pulp mill . Farming does n't pay much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it these days . Gurlie could n't believe it , for there was nothing but grassy pastureland and cultivated fields on all sides of them . And they looked to be thriving too . I should think it would be wonderful grazing country , she said . I see some cows over there on the hill . Yes , most places keep a few cows . Ca n't get along without cows in the country . Cows and chickens . But is n't there a creamery here ? Yes , there 's a creamery but it do n't amount to much with the hauling and feed costing what it does today . I should think you 'd raise your own feed . I see most of the farms here have silos on them . The boy looked sideways at her wondering how much she knew . Ca n't feed more'n a few cows through the wintershere on the silage they keep . Do n't they raised beef ?  | Most people around here eats western beef . It 's cheaper . But it ca n't be as good as local beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't as good but it 's cheaper . Is n't there any prize stock ? Not much . What about sheep ? Costs too much for fences . I 've heard say there used to be money in sheep up here but nobody but a few can make anything on them now and they ca n't make much . A few raised some prize sheep . Not many though . What about horses ? Do n't you need horses ? Somebody has to sell them . There 's a few good horses but they got better ones up in New Hampshire . The Morgan horses . You 've heard of them . But is n't there any industry , do n't any of the farms pay ? Does n't anybody make any money ? Oh yes , a few make money but they ai n't making it today . Most leave and go to the city when they get a chance . What about maple syrup ? Do n't amount to much . Now , there 's a lovely place , said Gurlie pointing to a rambling white house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm , but he did n't make his money in this place . He 's a lawyer down in Boston . Had the place made over last year . Comes up here mostly in summer now . Maybe around Christmas sometimes for the children . A lovely place , said Gurlie , all admiration . It costs him plenty to keep it up . Those were his cows you saw back on the hill . Fancy stock . But did n't I see a factory of some sort down in the town ? said Gurlie . That 's the mill . They been laying off men this spring already . They do pretty well when they 're busy . It 's thep207only place aside from the lumbering you can make anything at . What about lumber ? Gurlie asked . Pulpwood . Most of it 's been bought up though by the big companies . What about real estate ? Are you interested in buying a place ? asked the young man . Oh , no , no , said Gurlie . Everything is so peaceful . Why do people live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ? Got to have money to live , said the young man . Ca n't make money up here unless you got it to start with . Oh , I do n't think you know anything about it , said Gurlie finally , laughing . There must be some way to live up here . Get up , said the young man to the mare as he flicked her lightly with the end of the whip . She shook her head slightly and Gurlie 's head went back as the carriage started more rapidly forward . Where does that road go to ? Gurlie spoke again after a moment . Down through Jacksonville and Colerain to Greenfield , about twenty miles . And where does this road take you ? Brattleboro . This is what they call the Molly Stark trail . Starts at Bennington about twenty miles west . And how far is Brattleboro ? About eighteen to twenty miles . It was an enchanting spectacle to Gurlie , rolling hills , then as the road took a turn they entered a little glen , almost a tunnel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of small balsams and heavy underbrush while to the right went off sharply a stony bank to a tumbling stream churningitself white over large rocks . A cooling air came up from this small chasm . The little mare trotted steadily on past several other forks in the road then fell into a walk . They were going sharply uphill now . It seems quite a distance , said Gurlie . Not much further , said the boy . I thought at first you might be going down to the lake . They got a fine new place down there . Regular hotel . Worth seeing if you have the time some day . Lots of city people come up here during the summer now . They can have it , said Gurlie . I can imagine . Then , unexpectedly , the horse turned to the right , leavingthe highway , and began to climb a side road all grown with grass down the centre . Just two tracks for the wheels either side . They bumped over several large rocks . Is this is ? said Gurlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can make it . What ! It 's pretty bad up a little further , I have n't been up here this year but , if it has n't been washed out , I guess we 'll get through . Oh , said Gurlie as they heaved to one side going over a large flat rock in the road , be careful . You do n't need to worry , ma 'm . The road took a steady turn for a few hundred feet then entered a grassy cleared place . Across from it was a small barn . The horse was a little out of wind so the boy stopped for a moment . Is this it ? said Gurlie . No , ma 'm . This is the Conway place . Where you want to go is right up the hill there . You ca n't see it from here . You mean we have to go up through those bushes and trees . Why I do n't see any road at all . It 's there , all right . Come on , Sally . Gurlie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . The road seemed to go almost straight up through heavy brush which switched against the sides of the carriage as they went through . The road wasP209pretty badly washed out . Finally the underbrush ended . They came into a field where the horses ' hoofs sounded soft and muffled . Ahead was the house , quite on the hilltop and , looking back , half frightened , Gurlie saw off to the north , a wide panorama of down-sloping field , undulating wooded eminences , the corner of a glinting lake and , beyond that , hill after hill and mountain after mountain as far as the eye would take her . The sky was blue , clouds hung in white patches .. . Here y'are , said the man . He had driven over the thick grassy lawn right around back to the house itself . A handful of cats flew before the equipage , turning , half way to the barn , to look back , then walking on slowly and disappearing . So Gurlie had brought the baby to the country . The little thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown back showing the frail neck , her hat awry but , anyway , here she was . She had seemed especially happy in the carriage  --  freed from the small spaces and reflected sounds , the shudder of the boat , the unrelenting clatter and shivering of the train  --  in the open air to the easy rocking as they went over the soft dirt road . The occasional bumps and jerkings left her unaffected . Now everything was quiet . She opened her eyes . P210N o B o D Y said anything . The driver had jumped to the ground and was hitching his horse to an old post in the grass at the back of the house . There was the usual woodshed , nearly empty and further on some unpainted barns . A few chickens were pecking around in the sunny place in front of the woodshed . Nobody appeared . The man began to lift the trunk off the carriage . Well , said Gurlie , they must be out . Then , to Lottie , be careful . The man came and took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them stood there as if made of wood , looking at the soft grass where they were standing . Then the baby 's legs wobbled and she sat down . Gurlie got down also and picked up the baby . Whoo hoo ! she called out loudly . Anybody home ? An old man with a bucket in his hand came out slowly from the barn and stood looking at them . He came slowly up the path . Gurlie waved her hand to him . He took off his hat , putting the bucket down at the same time and moved a little faster as he came toward them . Lottie got behind her mother . The driver had the trunk down now and was lifting off the smaller bundles . Is this Mr. Payson ? said Gurlie to the old man , speaking in Norwegian . Yes , he answered , and whom have I the pleasure of addressing ? Did n't Gudrun write you ? P211No , was the answer as he shook his head slowly . What ! said Gurlie . Anyhow , they had arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had brought them his dollar . He thanked her , tipped his hat , and drove off , backingand turning the carriage with much stamping and cuttingof the turf as he did so . ' Well , here they were . Why , you 're entirely alone here , said Gurlie feeling as if she had been dropped from the sky into some inaccessible wilderness . She looked at the carriage retreating and for a moment seemed as if about to call it back . No , we 're not alone , said Mr. Payson , we have neighbours . Let 's go inside . They went in by the kitchen way over a big slab of grey stone which seemed as if the house had started from that point in its building . On opening the door , they caused a little old lady to look up and to start hurriedly putting the work she was doing out of her lap . Gurlie went to her and kissed her . She 's deaf as a post , said Mr. Payson coming near . Then he shouted close to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mrs. Stecher . You know , the one Gudrun wrote to us about in the winter . Oh , said the old lady , smiling sweetly and taking Gurlie 's hands in hers . I 'm so glad to see you . When did you come ? They are going to stay with us , shouted her husband . The old lady looked at him , startled and serious . Why did n't Gudrun tell us ? But then she took notice of the childrenand seemed very pleased . Come , come in here , she said and took them up two steps into the cosy , sunny parlour with its smell of disuse and old furniture . Come said Mr. Payson coaxingly to Lottie who was a little bashful . Come , let us see if we can find any eggs . So shyly at first , laying off her coat and hat , she finally went off with him hand in hand while Gurlie , the baby and the little deaf old lady went upstairs where the young man who had brought them had taken the trunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first seeing it ,   1 2 as it had been built close down in a little dip of the land on the hilltop . Downstairs was the parlour , a dining room , the ample kitchen and beyond that a bedroom where the mistress , now in New York City , stayed when she was there . Then of course , by a passage which served as a sort of cold pantry , came the woodshed and so to the barns . Upstairs were five bedrooms , making six in all , two large ones and three small with low ceilings and all of them , with beds made , carpet on the floor and ready for service . Gurlie took it all in at a glance . She 'd already noticed the handpump beside the sink in the kitchen . There were wash basins and a large water pitcher in each room with a porcelain slop receiver beside them . But the air was magnificent . You could sense it even here indoors . She looked from each window she passed , the valley opened out beyond a straggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which she could see now from the second storey occupied the top of the hill on a little higher level than the house itself . Mr. Payson and Lottie appeared for a moment in the barnyard and disappeared again into another enclosure . Well , here they were sure enough . They 'd have to make the best of it now . The old lady was smiling as if she thought something had been said to her . No , Gurlie said , shaking her head , I did n't say anything . The old lady leaned closer and put up her hand . What was that ? That will do , said Gurlie shouting . I want to go outside and look around . This deafness was going to be the end of her if she had to yell like that all summer . She felt that she was running away . She had to . May be if she could once get a little used to it . Let me take care of the baby ? said the old lady . Yes , said Gurlie , with relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they went down to the kitchen . With hot water that was on the fire Gurlie mixed up a bottleP213of condensed milk , which she had brought with her fortunately , put it into the old lady 's hand , motioned to her to take the baby and went out . Whew ! Gurlie loved the feel of a farm as she hated restraint of all sorts . She had been almost ready to scream with irritation at the smiling woman before her in the house . But the minute she walked out on the grass and had a chance , alone , unconstrained to look around , she was satisfied . She knew she could make a go of it . She took deep , repeated breaths of the sweet air and went off for a few rods walking on the soft grass along the bank west of the house . There after a moment she sat down facing again the magnificent view , northward , which she had first seen on arriving . She laid bare hands on the grass , then she lay back in it stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turf . But , unsatisfied , she sat up again , took off her shoes and stockings and stood there wiggling her toes , moving her feet up and down . Way below her now she could see the corner of what seemed to be a lake . Her twitching nerves were growing quieter . She sat down again , beginning to rest , the grass was thick , thick and full of all sorts of other leafy growing things which did n't seem to kill it , strange to say , up here . So this is Vermont . With her mouth closed , as children had been taught to breathe in her day , she deeply drew the deliciously scented air of the place into her lungs . This is what I need ! Probably it would n't be any trouble in such a place to get some pine tar water to drink . Rested , she fell to thinking . After all , the old lady might be very useful , as she was this moment . It was n't Gurlie that was going to sit still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ground when she stamped on it sounded hollow , compact , resilient . Where it was turned over nearby , it looked like some sort of rich cake . These pockets of lockedinloam in the hollows of old mountains reminded her of all that she remembered of Norway . P2I4There were a number of Scandinavian families about there , she had heard . Fun to hunt them out . Some years before , there had been a land development company which had bought up a number of the abandoned farms in this region , on speculation . Good small farms with serviceable houses and barns on them , the soil rich and productive but  --  the people had left them to go west or nearer to a money market . The company had made a play of advertising what they had in the shipping cities of Sweden , the Swedes being a thrifty , desirable race who were migrating heavily to America at that time . The thing never caught on too well but the low prices asked did bring on a few families . Some even came east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one of these . She wanted to be nearer New York . As a girl her family had been well to do . She was a sturdy sort and had gone to college , taking the agricultural course , farm management . Then the family went broke . Emma never quite forgave the old people . But having plenty of determination , she came to America , set herself up at what she could do , married , unhappily , returned from the west to the big city and then , when her old parents arrived in America , sent them up there . Leaning back in the grass , Gurlie put her hand on some chicken dirt and , feeling besides a sort of dampness in the air , decided to put on her shoes and stockings again and go back to the house . But seeing the old man heading toward the barn once more with Lottie close behind him , she thought she 'd take a look there herself first . He was getting ready to milk . Have you a horse here ? asked Gurlie sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the old man looking up . What ! why how do you get to town ? We do n't go very often . We do n't need many things . We have milk and eggs and .. . Gurlie had turned and started for the house . There sheP215found old Mrs. Payson sitting by the window which overlookedthe valley holding the baby in her arms and talking to it softly as she rocked back and forth before the window , singing very quietly . It 's getting late , shouted Gurlie at her . Yes , nodded the old woman . Ca n't I help you get supper ready ? At this , the old lady stood up , placed the baby on a blanket on the floor , and turned with a rather serious face to Gurlie . We have n't very much for supper tonight , she said . I meant to tell you . We eat so little . We have six eggs and plenty of milk .. . You have some bread , said Gurlie , that 's all we need . Oh yes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a cupboard in the passage leading to the woodshed and brought out a third of a loaf of white bread which , before she could wipe it off , Gurlie saw was all mouldy on the cut end . Oh ! said Gurlie . The old lady was very much confused . Gurlie patted her on the back and laughed . That 's nothing , she said , cut that end off and we 'll have toast . Oh , we have a little butter , the old lady went on . Andthere is a jar of preserve . The truth was , as Gurlie soon discovered , that there was n't another thing in the house . Why , what can Gudrun be thinking of , she said to herself aloud , why they 're starving to death . And she began to take things into her hands forthwith . That 's all right , she reassured the old lady . I 'll take care of everything . You have plenty of wood left . Put some water on to boil again . We 'll have eggs and milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old lady laughed at such a silly question . Of course , there was salt . Then everything is all right . I have brought condensed milk for the baby . Everything is all right . And out she wentP216top speed to talk to the old man . She had to get to town . No , he did n't think he 'd like to ask Mr. Pike for his horse tonight . He was very helpful , very kind . But it would n't be wise to take advantage of him . He lived down the hill , right where the side road turned off , the small house to the left  --  but . Gurlie was gone . The first thing she did was to borrow a piece of writing paper from Mrs. Payson and compose a letter to her hostess . Gudrun : You come up here right away , she said to that person , in her decided manner . Why , these old people are starving to death . What do you mean , leaving them up here this way without a horse and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody to take your place if you have to , but come . I ca n't stay here this way . Then she took money from her purse , took the addressed letter in her hand and waving as much as to say , do n't concernyourself with me , started down the overgrown carriageway down the hill to find Pike 's farm . Half way down , she came to the Conways where she stopped and spoke to a woman she saw there , who happened to be Mrs. Conway , and asked her where she could find the Pike place . Why , it 's terrible , said Gurlie to the woman , to leave those two old people up there that way . I ca n't understand it . No , Mrs. Conway agreed , it 's been pretty hard on them , I guess . We do what we can for them but they wo n't take anything and , being foreigners , we have a hard time to find out just how things are . We look up every night to see if the light 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel they must be all right . I do n't see how they can possibly live there in winter , said Gurlie . Well , they did have a man up there last fall who filled their woodbin for them and put hay into the barn . But IP217guess things have been getting pretty low recently . You 'll find Mr. Pike 's place down at the bottom of the road . Doubt if he 'll be going into town tonight though . Gurlie got a promise that her letter would be mailed early next morning . No use taking it down there tonight , Mr. Pike told her . It wo n't go out till nine o'clock anyway you put it . Why , yes , if you can get down here early enough , the boy can take you down when he goes . Glad to have met you . You folks up here for the summer ? Guess they 'll be glad to have company up there . Supper turned out better than Gurlie had thought . Lottie who did n't like eggs , ate one fried  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nevertheless . Even asked for another , fixed so there was nothing runny about it and not greasy either as the old lady knew wisely how to preparethem . Really it was wonderfully cosy there in the kitchen where the old people were accustomed to take their repasts , the oil lamp burning , leaving the corners in dark shadows . All this we lose , said Gurlie to the old fellow , as she felt again the closeness , the intimacy , of such life in the country . Soothed , quieted , the whole small company sat and ate , the baby along with them . There was bread , too , since Gurlie brought out the lunch her sister had over-abundantly preparedthe day before . They even laughed . The cats wove under their legs after they had got used to the newcomers , but you could n't catch them . The cow mooed distantly in her stall . But the sense of isolation , of peace , of satisfaction , kept them mostly silent . Just the click of forks , the movements of chairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had finished their simple meal . I wonder if all those people we see in New York know what is here . The old man nodded his head , doubtfully . If we could be rich it would be fine to have a place here in summer . Rich ! Yes , that would be something . Oh , how I should like to be rich ! That 's why we come here , is n't it ? Would we have come here otherwise . With only a little money , I could be happy here , said the old man . But you must have money , said Gurlie . We are all the same , we that come from the other side . We did n't come here for love of the country , but to better ourselves . How can we love this country ? We are from Europe . That 's our country . That old love of home sticks to the second and third generation . That 's why America is all for greed . This was n't our land . It belonged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love for it like we had on the other side . I think it is not so strong there either in these days , said the old man . There is too much injustice . Yes , but there it 's a different feeling anyhow . Here , we do n't care . Nobody cares . If you go to jail and you make money anyhow , who cares ? But when we lost everything in Norway , and my father wanted me to work , do you think I would do it ? I should say not . Do you think I would take a job in a house or a store ? I was too proud . But when I came here , what difference did it make ? I did n't care any more . That was because nobody knew you , said the old man . No , said Gurlie . It was n't that . I saw everybody doing the same so I wanted money too . In Europe when there was no longer a place for us , we came to America . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , send him to America . America took the place of the convent . If a girl would forget herself , to America . Then it 's natural that they are the people who make the country . Sometimes it was the best people in the village who would have to go away , said the old man . But we should be fair , Gurlie went on , I never liked this country , except for the one thing . But now that I see this place , I think I could be happy here too . I suppose if we should go back there , after being here , we would n't like it . P219It 's too slow . Everything is embroidered . I think now it would make me crazy . I should want to push them . Everythingis set . Everyone stays in his own class . Here it is wider , bigger , everyone is the same  --  unless you have money . There is more opportunity to expand . I do n't think you could live over there after you get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man tried to make clear to his wife what they had been talking about . She smiled and nodded without making any comment . But I hate the city , said Gurlie . To me a tree and a bush can talk . I love nature . When the children were asleep and the old people about to retire , Gurlie determined on her part to go out for a lonely walk . The night seemed to fly at her as she left the kitchen door . Her head somewhat bowed , watching her step at the doorway , she could see absolutely nothing . She stood still . Not a sound . As she moved shuffling , feeling her way to the edge of the big stone step  --  things began to grow a little clearer . Quickly as her eyes grew accustomed to it , she saw an absolutely cloudless night without a moon . She felt a coldishwind blowing from around the house 's western corner . She went in that direction , silently , on the grass , to stand looking away down the hill again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white mist lay heavily in the valley whose black outlines of trees and low bushes along a serpentine brook stood out here and there in the patches of mist between them . But it was the absolute silence that held Gurlie in a kind of awe . Not a sound , not even an insect sound could she discover . She put her hand up to her ears as if to clear them and heard only the brushing of her fingers against the flesh . She did not move after that but stood there listening . Then far off in the darkness toward the heavily wooded mountain , there sounded a hollow but clear trumpeting , who , who , who , who ! each syllable distinct , softened by distance . Who , who , who , who ! Again . Again . Gurlie shivered and went back into the house . P221T H E next day it rained , as it can rain in the country  --  in Vermont ! To Lottie who was up early and had dressed herselfit could be seen , from her low bedroom window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it drifting and falling . Tip-toeing into the hall she got safely past her mother 's door and started timidly down the dark stairs . Suddenly a door at the bottom opened taking away her breath and lettingin the head of the old man . What 's this ! up so early . She stopped abashed . Why if it is n't my little friend ! the old man 's reassuring voice lifted her again to happiness . Be carefulnow , he said . Here . And he gave her his hand . Arrived on the ground floor Lottie breathed again , smiled and went a little shyly to the window to hide her embarrassment . But as she looked a big cat came running towards the house , swinging right and left with his tail held high . Swervingtoward the woodshed , before which three bedraggled hens and a tall rooster stretched their necks as he passed , he was soon under cover while they settled down again disconsolately . Sitting , the cat began licking his sides but seemed to hear something then and trotted off out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not move thereafter . Why do n't they go into the barn ? said she to the old man who was putting wood into the stove . They 're getting all wet .   That 's why they have feathers , he replied . She just looked at him not knowing what he meant . Hardly had the others dressed and come downstairs also when from different windows they saw a horse and buggy arriving , coming noiselessly over the streaming grassy drive to the house . It was Mr. Pike 's boy with whom Gurlie had arranged the night before to drive to town . When they opened the door , he was already standing there under a big flat umbrella . Come in , come in , Charlie , said Mr. Payson . Whew ! pretty wet , eh , today ? Gurlie began at once bustling around to get herself ready . You must have your breakfast , said Mr. Payson . Nonsense , I never eat breakfast . Just pour me a cup of coffee . Then for the first time she took a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a long narrow face with pale blue eyes and could not have been more than ten yearsof age . But he 's only a child , turning to the others . Then she thought of the steep hill just beyond the house . Do we have to drive down that steep hill in this rain ? The boy just looked at her . You could hear Gurlie admonishing him as they drove away . Now , now , do be careful . Be careful now . But after another moment they were out of earshot and soon disappearedfrom view through the bushes at the top of the hill . When he returned to the house after seeing them off Mr. Payson saw his wife shaking her head dubiously . Whew ! said the old man , what a whirlwind . What do you think of her ? he shouted close to his wife 's head . Such energy , she replied . She must be very strong and healthy . But is she a good woman ? I wonder . There was nothing malicious in the old lady 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her husband laughed out loud . What an idea ! he said . She is real Norsk , his wife went on . Some of them are very fine . P223Do you think the children will tire you too much ? he asked her then . No , no ! the poor things . The baby is so cute . And she has a will of her own , do you know that ? I must try to feed her till she is big and strong while I have her here this summer . I am so happy to have a baby near me again . They need so much . I see so many things already to do for her . Would you look at that , said the old man suddenly changinghis voice . There was Lottie down on the floor just finishing taking off her second shoe and beginning on the last stocking . Look at that . She saw Charlie barefooted and now she wants to be the same . And the baby clinging to Mrs. Payson was holdingup one of her feet also saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till you 've been here a while anyhow . You 're coming to the barn with me , young lady , but I 'm going to carry you . Put those shoes on again right away  --  and he did it for her , leaning down slowly to do so . The rain had stopped a little now so they merely threw part of an old blanket over the child 's shoulders and off he went carrying her , slopping through the wet . As they entered the barn door , it was very dark at first and the rain drummed loudly on the high roof . Then a hen burst forth into a wild cackling near them and flew madly through the open door . Mr. Payson took Lottie to the nest at the edge of the hay and let her gather the two eggs , still warm . Downstairs they could hear the calf jerking at his chain . When Gurlie returned from her shopping an hour or two later , she saw the old lady , out of the corner of her eye , putting a little stocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything they would need for the next few days , a leg of lamb , some carrots . . . ' We have carrots . And all sorts of other things  --  bacon , sugar , bread both white and rye , all things that had been lacking . The old lady watched her lay them out one by one on the table . But no newspaper ! She was disappointed in that . Oh well .. . As the old lady had been almost ready with the children 's lunch anyhow by that time , she went on with it while Gurlie got herself straightened out after her morning 's jaunt and sat down to talk a little with the old man . I grabbed the lines , she was saying in reply to one of his questions , I thought sure we were going over . You could n't see the road at all , only the back of the horse and branches swishing in front of us all the time . What did you do then ? She is so little , the old lady broke in turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . But a little baby is much closer to the heart . They had to stop and wait for her to finish , the baby also stopped drinking and looked up at her . But she is smart ! And the old lady smiled , leaning down to pinch the baby 's cheeks . What did you do then , repeated Mr. Payson . But before they could say anything further they had to wait once more . Such pretty teeth . What does she say ? turning to Gurlie . Does she know many words ? She knows words like mama , shouted Gurlie , papa , baby , book , hat , hot  --  and like that . But she talks a lot of foolishnesstoo that nobody can understand . No , said the baby , seeing they were looking at her , shaking her head hard from side to side . That 's her new word , no , said Gurlie . Yes , yes , the old lady nodded without hearing anything . I think she will talk before she walks . The baby had finished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round glass buttons down the front of the old lady 's dress , she turned sidewise to touch them . I 'm so sorry you were interrupted , said Mr. Payson to Gurlie apologetically . Let me take the baby , she answered , your wife has many things to do . P225No , no . You were saying , you grabbed the lines . . . what did he do then ? He looked at me with his mouth open as if I was crazy . So I let go and after that it was all right . The horse would almost sit down sometimes it was so steep and wet . And she laughed to think of it . But it did n't take long . Then changingher voice , Gurlie added , Pay no atention but listen to her , nodding toward the baby . The infant was talking right along with her mother at the top of her voice , a lively chatter . When her mother stopped suddenly she stopped too and looked around smiling . Fine ! said the old man , only it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . His wife had something in a pan stewing over the fire . She put the baby down . Gurlie was curious . What 's that ? she asked and got up to see . It looks like what we used to call portulak in the old country . Portulak , she shouted in the old lady 's ear . Yes , that 's right . Here they call it pussley . It 's a weed but we like it very much when it 's young and fresh . What do you think of that ! said Gurlie . Why everything we need grows in the ground if we knew it Everything . That 's what I like about the country . We do n't need much either . All my life I have prayed to God that I could have a farm . The old man shook his head . You do n't think I could run it ? Maybe , said the old man . You have plenty of courage . But not up here . Of course not , said Gurlie , but even here if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is New York ? A wonderful place . We saw it for three days when we first came here . Agh , I hate New York . You do n't know how lucky you are up here . There 's air . You can breathe . They say there 's a lot of poverty there still . The stores arc full of people buying trash . I ca n't seeP226that there 's any want . But I 'm not interested in that place . How many cows have you here ? Two , said Mr. Payson . One is no good though . What do you mean , no good ? She is very pretty . We have been feeding her for a year but she refuses to have a calf . I thought she was going to be wonderful . Are you telling her about the cows ? asked the old lady of her husband . Yes , said he , I 'm telling her about that good-for-nothing Bessie . The old lady was interested . Yes , she said , my daughter bought her at the fair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she wo n't have a calf . They tried three bulls . They even left her in a field with a good bull for three months but it was no good . And she is so pretty . Such a nice face , like a deer . What a pity . Gurlie let out a whoop of laughter . Why do n't you kill her , then ? No , no , the old man shook his head seriously . I wish we could do it but nobody wants even to sell her to the butcher . You 're fine farmers , said Gurlie . You know I think your wife is a faker . She can hear all right . Can you hear what I say ? she shouted at the old lady . Yes , I hear pretty well , Mrs. Payson answered her . Well , she hears all right sometimes , in the morning especially , her husband said . And if it 's about babies or some gossip they have . That 's her speciality . She has a friend who comes here sometimes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows . I 'll bet , said Gurlie . Some scandal , you know , something good and salty , somebody 's wife run away , some baby without a father . . . you bet she finds it out . Smart woman , said Gurlie . She 's not a true Scandinavian , is she ? to the old man in a lower voice . P227Yes , her mother was a Jacobson . But her father was a sea captain and his father 's people came from Scotland , I think  --  like your Ibsen . You see , said Gurlie , you see , I knew it . You are Celtic , she called out loudly to Mrs. Payson . You came from Asia . She is not a true Norsk . She added again to the old man , like we Norwegians . The baby was at his wife 's skirts , having pulled herself up from the floor , to stand there unsteadily . Ha , ha ! laughed Mr. Payson and chanted heartily , Ten thousand Swedes ran through the weeds , chased by one Norwegian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? I should n't think you 'd sing a thing like that , when you 're a Swede yourself , mister . Oh , said the old man , still laughing , when I was a young man , there was nothing that used to make me madder than that poem . But now that I am old I can laugh at it  --  too . And so they sat down to a modest lunch which the old lady had prepared for them . Rain . Rain . Rain . The long grass outside the window was bent down and still running with water drops . In the afternoon the rain had gathered new violence just when they thought it was over and now almost supper and no sign of a let-up . The old lady had the baby on her lap at the table once more . The infant reached for its cup and began to drink milk from it . She had it between her hands , the fingers of one of them over the cup edge dabbling a little into the milk as she drank . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom . Mr. Payson was crouched down at the hearth rubbing a small knife on the stone and Lottie beside him crouched down too , all attention . Well , it looks to me as if everything is settled here for the summer , said Gurlie , I might just as well go back to New York . ! I . I am happy , said Gurlie , I 'm always happy if the sun will come out . It was raining steadily now with a sea-like roar on the roof above them . Occasionally there would be a flash followed at a long interval by mild thunder , hollow and far away . The rain would diminish at such times then begin again heavily in reply . It died once more and there was a hush followed by a flash and deafening crash . Whee ! said Gurlie as the children looked around in uncomprehendingamazement . Quick ! said the old man , see if you can see any smoke anywhere . Gurlie went to one window , he to another . But it had grown almost night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck around here this month , said he , and one of them burned down . Some cows too have been killed under trees . There was a tap at the door . Everyone but the old woman turned to look . When they went , they found it to be two children , a lank girl of about thirteen years in a colourless dress and a milk pail in her hand . She was barefoot and had a man 's coat over her head and shoulders . Her small brother was behind her , grinning , his hair plastered to his head . They waited where they were . Till Gurlie took the girl by the shoulder and whisked her inside . The boy followed . You get in here , she said . Go stand there by the stove , to the boy , till I wipe your head . Both did as they were told leaving wet footprints on the floor . Lottie and the baby gazed at them entranced . What in the world is this ? said Gurlie . Where do these things come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what a time to come for milk , in this rain . All up that road ? You ought to have better sense , said Gurlie . We been coming all day , waiting for it to clear , spokep229up the girl . Ma said if we did n't make up our minds pretty soon it 'd be dark before we got here . She spoke slowly in a low voice . Just like us to come through the worst of it , piped up the boy looking directly at Mr. Payson . Did n't expect no such lightning as that , though . Pretty sharp , was n't it ? Scared the life out of sis , he replied . We was n't looking for it just then . Think we 'll get any more ? No , no , said Mr. Payson . That 's the end of the storm . I 'm an old sailor , you can count on that . The little fellow seemed pleased and began to look at Gurlie and the children with a new interest . As a matter of fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm did seem to be past . And now from under the edge of the heavy clouds in the west , though a little rain was still falling , the sun actually appeared for the first time that day almost on the horizon . It cast forth a strange level beam of light which struck the trees all up the adjacent hillside till they stood out against the dark slate of the sky to the north . It was very pretty but awe-inspiring to the little group who all turned instinctively to the window . How is it ? said Gurlie when the children had gone again , that you give those farmers milk ? Have n't they a cow ? How much do you charge them for it ? They do n't pay anything . What ! said Gurlie . You see , went on Mr. Payson , sometimes they bring us what they have growing . Or they take letters down to town for us . It does n't cost us anything . What 's a little milk ? And it wo n't be for long . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't beat a yankee , said Gurlie . No , no . They are good people . They help us a lot . And it 's so nice to see the children coming every day . But you ca n't afford it . We have sometimes thirty quarts a day . As much as that ? P230Gurlie grew serious at once . Yes , and sometimes more . We ca n't use all that . What do you do with it then ? We feed it to the calf . We get them for two dollars up here . He takes from five to eight quarts a meal . The rest we use for a little cream  --  as much as we need . What is left over we put in a pan for the chickens . It was beginning to get really dark in the rooms by now . We should do like they do in the old country , in the mountains , said the old man , with his ever ready smile . In winter they have what they call " cellar milk . " Yes ? said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallons , of fresh milk in a tub in the cellar and there it stands . But does n't it get sour ? Yes , a little , but it is good . I should think it would rot , said Gurlie . No , it forms a coating of mould on the top that is green sometimes , like a blanket . You lift that up and underneath the milk is good to drink . You can keep it that way all winter , they say  --  till it is used up . That 's wonderful , said Gurlie . I must remember that . But you have to have a cool cellar , said the old man , or so I am told . I never saw it myself . You know , I remember now , Gurlie took up the burden , tetter milk , did you ever hear of that ? Yes , I think so , said Mr. Payson . I think they make it from a little plant , Gurlie went on . They take some of the leaves and put them in the milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they beat it and beat it until it gets sort of stringy . I never liked that . Then when you want to make more , the old man continued , you take a tablespoon of it and add to the fresh milk and it gets the same way . In Wisconsin , my daughter told me , they sent to the old country . Some friends soaked a piece of cloth in it , then they dried it out and sent it in a letter . It worked fine . I guess I 'd better light the lamp before I go down to the barn now . P231No , not yet , said Gurlie , it 's so nice to sit this way . The children have been fed , we 'll just sit here and wait for you . Light the lamp , Emil , said Mrs. Payson to her husband . Here is a little sleepyhead I want to put to bed . So the old man lighted the lamp on the table while the children watchedhim . Give me the baby . I 'll fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurlie shouted , leaning toward Mrs. Payson . But , as Gurlie picked up the child to take her on her lap , the little thing struggled , twisting herself around in her mother 's arms to look back at the old lady . And now the other started . The old man had taken the lantern and gone to the barn when Lottie was discovered there half-sobbing , her finger in her mouth , looking at the blank door . What 's the matter ? asked her mother . He 's not going away . But Lottie was not to be consoled . She walked waveringlyto one of the front windows but did not look out , knowing it was night . Then she turned round with tears in her eyes , choking back the beginning sobs . When they spoke to her , she began sobbing as if her heart would break . But he 's coming back in a few minutes , said Gurlie . He 's only gone to the barn . Agh , children are unreasonable , she added looking at the old lady . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no attempt to undressher . You should not have bought that big leg of lamb , said Mrs. Payson , you are too good . If we had known even one day ahead that you were coming  --  She was beginning it again . But Gurlie just laughed . By the time Mr. Payson was back with the milk everything was ready and they all sat down once again at the table , the children also , as Lottie was afraid to be put upstairsalone and the baby lingered on with her . Being hungry everyone set at once to eating so that for a while silenceP232prevailed in the room . The rain had stopped entirely now and a light wind had come up . Suddenly everyone seemed wrapped in his own thoughts as if the accustomed loneliness of the house had come out of the room 's corners and possessed them all . Gurlie felt it and turned her head quickly as though someone were approaching on tiptoe behind her . Brr ! she shivered and laughed . What in the world do you do with yourselves in the evenings ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing to do and we are tired . We read a little sometimes but we have only two or three books . I should think you would play cards . Listen ! said Lottie . It was a cricket which had started to chirrup near the door . Let him stay out , said the old man , they do more damage than moths . I never heard that , said Gurlie . Is n't it true , mother , that crickets do more damage than moths ? Yes , yes , said the old lady , I have seen big holes , like that , in a coat they have eaten . Is there a cricket here ? Her husband told her that there was . Let me take the baby so that you can eat now , she added addressing herself to Gurlie . No , said Gurlie , you eat yourself . And she signalled with one hand for Mrs. Payson to stay where she was . Strange to say , the baby was n't at all sleepy but sat quite placidly on her mother 's knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely at ease . But at this point she began pushing and straightening herself out to get down on the floor . It 's such a pleasure for me to have her , the old lady pleaded , I have n't put a baby to bed for so many years . All right , said Gurlie . So Mr. Payson picked Flossie up and carried her round the table to put her in his wife 's arms . The infant looked up at the old lady , then back at her mother , with a curious expression on her face . P233I think she already likes her better than she does me , said Gurlie to the old man . Oh , you must n't say that , answered he . Yes , she does , said Gurlie , I 'm jealous . And she pouted . The old lady began to unbutton the baby 's dress . Now , up with your arms . But the dress had a very small neck which stuck about the little head so that she had a job getting it off . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push as she could but finally the old lady just had to drag the garment clear . The baby frowned a moment when it was all over and scratched her head . That 's that tight dress , said Gurlie . I remember , said the old woman , how I used to amuse Astrid when she was a child . I would take off her shoes and then hand them back to her . That would keep her busy for an hour or more sometimes . The room had grown very warm by now with them all sitting in it and the fire going so the old man went to open the door for a moment . As he did so , a half grown kitten came running in from the night , his tail straight in the air . The older cats had been in all afternoon but they were shy . This one , however , went straight to Gurlie who leaned and picked her up . Prrrr ! Prrrr ! Sweet ! said Gurlie . You 're not pretty but you 're black . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came right to me ? Good luck to him , I guess , being black , said Mr. Payson , maybe that 's what saved him . What 's that ? said Gurlie . Lottie had come around to pat the kitty in her mother 's lap . We had two of them , the old man explained . She had them in the barn . When I went there the other day , Pilka , that 's the mother , followed me asking for milk . As I opened the door , she went in with me when  --  Zip ! Smash ! Such a screaming and spitting ! I did n't know what had happened . She flew at something under the old carriage . It was all over in a second . Such a racket you never heard . I turned just in time to see her chasing a big black torn away off down through the fields bouncing away , he running and she after him , over the high grass until they disappeared . We found the little grey kitten in a pile of rubbish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . I thought he was dead too . But he came crawling out from somewhere in the afternoon . What is that ? asked the old lady . Are you telling her about the cats ? Yes , nodded her husband . And what do you think ? the old lady took up the story as if she had heard it all . The beast had the courage to come and sit here the next day and try to make love to her . What do you think of that ! said Gurlie , Did she take him ? I do n't know , said Mrs. Payson . I think so . I do n't know where he came from but maybe he has the virile strain in him . What can you do ? She has another cat here , and they are good friends , but she lets the one that killed her kitten visit her too . Can I have another cup of coffee , asked Gurlie . Everythingtastes so good tonight . A fine supper , she shouted to Mrs. Payson . You 're a smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the old lady , except the things that you bought yourself . Scraps at home are better than the finest food served in a restaurant . Maybe , said the old man , but I know a restaurant in StockholmI wish I was in right now . Do you know fish pudding when it is good ? he asked Gurlie . She let out her big wild laugh . Do n't try to tell me about that . That 's a Norwegian dish . we had it at home every week in the season . I bet you never tasted anything like that . There , broke in the old lady , pointing toward the windowP235ledge . Do n't they look like husband and wife ? The two home cats , the black mother and the grey male , were sitting facing each other , half asleep : their noses almost touching . Ya , ya , said Gurlie , apropos of nothing . If all the people in the world were like us , what a fine place it would be . Yes , I could never understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess it 's because of the original sin , like the good book says . Men have always been evil , it 's the only way they could get what they want . So it 's become a habit . I 'd rather have nothing . But I know everybody is n't like me . Well , said Gurlie , I 'm proud of my ancestors . I like to think that I come from a line of strong , healthy people . What would we be if we did n't sometimes think of those who are gone ? They are more important than we are  --  because they made for us everything we have . Yes , and they made us big fools too . If we could all be smart and healthy  --  and good looking , then we should have something to talk about . Ancestors make us proud , said Gurlie . Pride of race is what makes us go ahead . Everybody is proud of his race . I think of my father and my grandfather sometimes , but that 's all . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reached into his waistcoat pocket and took out a little box . What 's that ? said Gurlie . Snuff , said the old man . I use a little sometimes . It is very good and cheap too in this country . Let me see , said Gurlie taking the circular tin box out of his hand . Yes , it 's snuff , sure enough , said she . I did n't think they had it in this country . I thought that was only our own bad habit . The baby reached for the snuff box but Gurlie held it away from her . Come now , said Mrs. Payson approaching and taking the baby into her arms . It 's time someone should be put to bed . You too Lottie . I 'll go upP133Give him time , give him time , said Joe . He is n't a year old yet . He does n't even catch the mouse we have . If it was a female she would have caught it weeks ago . He 's stupid , he has no sense at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , he has a big head like a tomcat . The female has a much smaller , prettier face . But I think the male is a nicer pet , they are not so suspicious . He 's too stupid . He has n't such a bad temper , said Joe . And what have you been doing with yourself , Astrid , asked the big fellow with the scar across his upper lip . You know it 's five years since I 've had a good talk with you . What are you doing ? Still with the same people . They must be treating you well , you look fine . Yes , said Astrid , let me pass the cookies . How was it in Norway this summer ? Oh , we had a good time . I did a little fishing , a little shooting . But you came back , broke in Joe . Sure , said the big fellow , there 's no money there . But the country is beautiful . Wish you could go there some day , Stecher , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen of it are nothing but rocks , said Joe . You do n't know what you 're talking about , Gurlie interrupted . Wha ! said Mathilda trying to save the situation , ca n't you see he 's only teasing you ? You should n't let him tease you . Such a sweet man . Skol , Joe ! she smiled , you ought to see the pretty girls in Norway . My glass is empty again , replied the latter . What kind of a house is this ? Get it yourself , said his wife . Norway was civilized before Rome even . Everywhere in Europe you will find it , everywhere . I 'll bet that is where the race began . Which race ? said Joe .   We have Nansen , we have Grieg and Ibsen , we have .. . Well , said Mrs. Lindquist , I ca n't say that I enjoyed him much . We saw a play when we were there last  --  about typhoid fever I think . I ca n't see much in that . I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a name . Huh , huh ! said Joe , you see .. . You should n't back him up .. . Astrid , spoke up Mr. Lindquist , we 've been waiting to hear you tell us something about the people you work for . Are they as rich as we hear ? I suppose so , yes . How many servants have they ? Oh what do you care about that ? I 'm curious , tell me . Oh I suppose with the butler and the cook and the upstairs maid . Of course there 's the coachman and the stable boy . Oh I suppose they keep ten or twelve most of the time . Phew ! said Mr. Lindquist , that must cost something . Now tell us , Astrid , he went on , we 're all friends here  --  what do you do ? Well , what do I do ? I am I suppose what you call a housekeeper . Astrid is a trained housekeeper from the other side , you know that Alfred , said Mathilda to her husband . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help I get it for them . I pack up when they go away . I open and close the house . I pay the servants and discharge and hire them . Do n't make me talk about that . No , tell us Astrid , I 'd like to know how those people live . The eyes of the stout lady , the Captain 's wife , were closing drowsily . Her husband gently smiled . Look , she 's falling asleep , he laughed good humouredly . Louisa , wake up ! Well , said Grandma , I think I 'll leave you now . The men stood up . Sit down , sit down , she said . No use to be so polite . I can go alone . And slowly she left while they waited , standing , for her to go.  |p135Now  go on with your story , said Lindquist to Astrid . I 'm curious . Yes you are curious , said Astrid . That 's what 's the matter . Well , they . . . Well , what is there to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to you ? Mrs. Haggerty is a dear old lady . What do you want to know ? They have a house on Fifth Avenue . They have another house on Long Island . They go to Europe and Florida like the rest of the rich people .. . What are they doing today ? Today ? said Astrid . Mr. Haggerty had his breakfast at six o'clock as usual and then went down to the office . What ! on Christmas Day ? No , no , no . Not downtown . But he has an office on the first floor of the house and he goes down there every morningand every evening working at his business , whatever it is , and usually Mr. Tim is with him . Arbeit macht das Leben suss ! interjected Joe , when you have a couple of million dollars to shake around together . What , every day does he get up at six ? asked Lindquist . Yes , about six o'clock  --  and works until he leaves the house to go downtown . What do you suppose he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of Joe who sat at his side . He 's probably getting ready to skin more suckers , said Joe getting up and pushing back his chair . You should n't talk like that , said Astrid , you 've never even seen him . He 's a nice man . She 's so loyal she would n't say a mean thing about anybody , chimed in Mathilda . It 's stocks and bonds he has to figure out I suppose , said Astrid , he always looks at the newspaper first . Tammany graft , said Joe . He made his pile selling lumber to the people who put up the elevated railways . He 's a smart man just the same , said Astrid . Sure . If you get half the lumber in Maine from a lot of farmers and do n't pay anything for it and then sell it here for five times what it 's worth of course you 'll make money . No , he was smart . He floated it down here in rafts and saved the carfare . Everybody laughed . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke up sharply . Why do n't you listen and learn ? Because you have to be a crook to make money that way , said Joe . They 're all dishonest , every one of them . That 's why they 're what they are  --  Great men ! Master minds !  --  while everybody else starves . Nobody can make as much money as that honestly . If you 're too honest you do n't get anywhere either , said Lindquist . Agh ! What 's dishonest ? That 's nothing . Everybody is dishonest , said Gurlie . It 's the way to make money , that 's all that counts . Afterward there is time to be honest  --  if you want to make a name for that . Now children , children ! Mathilda admonished them . But Gurlie could n't be stopped that way . She continued her tirade . You should listen to what Astrid is saying , you can learn . But he 's Dutch , she went on , turning to the company in general . No , no ! he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a snoot at her husband , that 's how they make money here . Only here ? said Joe  --  and turned to go into the front room , smoking . I 'll bet he could give you some good tips on the market , persisted Lindquist . Does he ever do that , Astrid ? Yes , said Gurlie eagerly , that 's it . No , said Astrid , of course not . Why not ? Why do n't you ask him ? You must have money to invest sometimes . One good stock can make a lot for you if you know how to watch the market . Nonsense , said Astrid . No . Alfred is right , Gurlie insisted . You should ask him . No.  |p137Oh  well , then that settles it , said Lindquist . Never mind , Astrid . But maybe you 'll tell us what they eat . They all laughed . You 're funny , said Astrid . What is there to interest anyone in that ? I just want to know what makes them so smart , said Lindquist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his breakfast ? Astrid looked at him for a moment as if the whole thing were below her notice but finally she thought she might as well tell them . Well , for breakfast he has sometimes ham , bacon , three or four eggs . Meat and potato sometimes . And always a big bowl of Irish oatmeal which he gets especially for himself from Ireland . Two cups of coffee , sometimes three . Bread . Butter . Plenty of butter . Now leave me alone . Phew ! said Lindquist . What a man . But wait a minute . You mean to say he worked all day today ? No , Well ? Then Mathilda stopped her husband . Do n't you see that Astrid does n't want to talk about that any more ? Stop it . No . Just a minute . Did n't he go to mass this morning ? Yes , said Astrid , finally . His wife took him away from his work and made him go with her and the children . What is the baby doing , Joe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has bought a farm up in Vermont , said the big fellow at this point . And his wife who had hardly opened her mouth all afternoon said , yes , is it true ? The answer came from the next room . Joe laughed and said , Yes , it reminded her of Norway  --  solid rock . But anyhow she had the money to pay for it . What did she pay ? A hundred dollars down , said Joe coming into the room . You make me tired , said Gurlie . It 's a lovely , romanticplace . And the cat raised up and stretched , arching its backand yawning as it clawed the carpet lazily . Stop that ! said Gurlie . Then it lightly batted a hazel nut , which it encountered , lightly over the floor , licked itself behind then walked slowly through the room where the people were assembled and went off down the corridor to the kitchen . Look at that baby , said Mathilda . It 's incredible that a little thing like that can be so good . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , said Gurlie , getting up and going into the next room . Oh leave her alone , said Astrid , she 's so cute . But the baby , seeing her mother moving toward her immediately started to cry , and lustily too . Look at that , said Astrid . She knows . Yes , she has a good memory , said Gurlie picking her up . That 's what I thought . Now the baby kicked and screamed until it went into a spasm of coughing again as Gurlie started off toward the back of the house with her  --  but had to stop a moment to allow the infant to catch its breath . What 's the matter now ? said the big fellow . It 's the lying down , said Gurlie . She hates to be put down on her back to be cleaned . She always fights it . She likes to be dirty . I think it 's time for her to go to bed anyway . My heavens yes , said Mathilda . Look ! it 's almost dark outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Joe , do n't be in a hurry . For sure enough the light was rapidly failing and Lottie had fallen fast asleep on the lounge in the next room . Light the lights . Well , this has been a fine afternoon , Stecher , said the big fellow in his slow positive way . A fine old-fashioned afternoon . This is what I call good company . That 's what it means to have friends . Yes , I tell you that 's true , Lindquist added . Joe , you said you would play for us . No , no , no , no , said Joe . Yes you did . Get out your violin , Mathilda kept after him , and we can play something . We need music to finish it up just right . Come on now , do n't be a backslider.  |p139So  Joe very reluctantly got out his fiddle , tuned it and with Mrs. Lindquist accompanying him played his favourite Standchen very slowly and carefully while the others listenedand applauded well afterward . By God , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His brother is a violin teacher at the conservatory in Prague , said Gurlie proudly . Yes , that 's one of the reasons I 'm in America , volunteered Joe . So ? said the old Captain.  |p140I  DO N'T want another creeping baby , said Gurlie . When they creep they never seem to walk until they 're about two years old . Ca n't we get one of those things on wheels for her ? Sure , said Joe . Why not ? Do you want me to bring it home today ? he added ironically . The last Saturday in January , it was snowing hard outside , the driven flakes striking with an almost imperceptible seethingsound against the back windows of the flat as the husband and wife sat in the kitchen for Joe to drink his hot coffee before starting downtown . The baby was at his knee holding on precariously and grinning up at him as usual . It 's little hands , none too clean , rested on his pants ' knees but he did n't disturb them . When the baby put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slobber he objected . Take her away , he said . Here , he added , and placed the baby back in her chair . I think she 's getting more teeth . It 's snowing hard , said Gurlie who had not heard him . It must be beautiful in the country . Yes , I suppose it is . And plenty of shovelling on their hands before they can move , too . Work for the city 's unemployed . They should go out where there is freedom and fresh air . Why do they want to huddle all together here in their filthy homes the way they do ? They make me sick . I have no sympathy for them.  |p141Well  , so long , said Joe . I 'll see if I can find one of those roller things for the baby . Oh , she 'll be all right , said Gurlie . It 's you I worry about . What ! chuckled Joe . What did you say ? Take care of yourself , said his wife . Here put on these goloshes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a blizzardI tell you . Perhaps you 'd better stop at the Market and bring home a chicken tonight , I do n't think I 'll go out . And tomorrow is Sunday . Where 's the money ? said Joe . What money ? For the chicken . Well , if you do n't want to buy it you 'll have to do withoutit , said his wife . That 's the way to close a deal for a profit , said Joe . Look at that baby . He was out in the hall looking back . The baby had somehow slid from its high-chair and was coming , hinching itself down the hall in grand style , putting its two hands forward on the floor and hauling its body , in a sitting position with one leg bent under , swiftly after them . So long . I 've got to go . He was the first down the ten steps to the street , the snow was already deep on them so that the footing was deceptive . There was a cold wind at his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toward the elevated station . The street otherwise was empty . In the car Joe watched from a west window , the sky full of dark-winged gnats . They drove aslant past the windows of the moving train and fell white on the roofs of the houses . Everything was muffled , giving the illusion of peace , as if the city were changed rather than merely weighted down and smothered . Yet it was peaceful to the ear and to the eye from the obliteration of meaningless detail . And it was strange  --  an unreality  --  a softness which yielded to some wish  --  which triumphed and gave an exhilaration to thep142mind  --  the body ?  --  relieving unrest . The illusion of an imposed order , the cleanliness  --  touched Joe and gave him contentment watching the storm . Downtown earlier passersby had trod a narrow footpath from street to street  --  further illusion , he was walking through woods and fields  --  though at windy corners the bare pavement brought the city back quickly enough . As Joe approached his own building he had his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door and had started to kick his toes against the sill before openingand going inside . Are you Mr. Stecher ? Joe came up with a start . There was a woman standing to the left in the shelter of the doorway , grey eyes fastened steadily on his own . Yes . What is it ? Joe had his hand on the door-handle ready to go inside . Can I talk with you a minute ? Come inside . He opened the door and they went into the chilly corridor . Her shoes were soaking wet . I 'm Mrs. Carmody . Look here , said Joe losing his temper a little . I have no time to stand here listening to such stories . Do you need money ? Here . I 'm not asking for money only , the woman began . But Joe broke her off . You tell Carmody if he has anything to say to me to come here like a man and say it . It 's a cruel thing , the woman began again . She stopped suddenly and drew the shawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing quickly at them talking , went by . Good morning , Mr. Stecher . Good morning , Tom . It 's a cruel thing , the woman began again . Wait a minute , said Joe . Where do you live ? Second Avenue , sir . Where on Second Avenue ? said Joe . She looked at him suspiciously a moment . We live atp143number two hundred and thirteen , sir . The third floor in the rear . Joe took a small pad from his vest pocket and made a note of it while the woman waited patiently . Have you any family ? Five small children , sir . All right . I 'll see what I can do . But the woman did not move . We 're in great need , sir . Have you had any breakfast ? No sir , said the woman . Joe reached for his wallet . He took out a dollar bill and folding it once handed it to the woman . She took it . God bless you , sir . . . turned , opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to hell , said Joe mounting the stairs . What in Christ 's name are you gon na do about a thing like that ? During the morning he tried to reconstruct the picture Mrs. Carmody had made standing speaking to him  --  a woman almost fifty he thought , with a white , pinched face , a sagging mouth but fine eyes  --  truthful eyes . Says you . What would Gurlie say though . And what if Carmody should try to start something ? Well , the only way to find out if people are lying is to go and find out . But later on in the morning he shook his head more than once at what he had determined upon  --  for those kind of people  --  on a day like this  --  or any old day for that matter . But he had been careful not to give himself away to anyone in the shop  --  nor even to Mrs. Carmody . It was just that he wanted to see for himself  --  during the noon hour  --  just how bad things are in the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and no one be the wiser for it . He never ate much at noon anyhow , but he noticed that his cheeks were burning as it grew closer to the time and he , unusually at that hour , felt the need of a cigar . It was dark , almost , as twilight under the elevated road as he faced north up Second Avenue a little after twelve and began to watch the numbers on the glass over the narrowpI44doorways as he walked . The pulsing roar of a train overheadcaused him to look up apprehensively . One hundred and fifteen . Almost a hundred numbers more . All the houses were about the same , two or three steps and the door , with two small-paned windows to the right . The snow in the centre of the street was by this time trampled and scarred by the traffic , blackened and dungstained . But it was still falling and covering again that which had been swept off earlier . A few cheap restaurants . A Chinese laundry , the two Chinks hard at it behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . No children to speak of and only one other man going in the same direction twenty feet before him . Slow-moving steaming horses passed occasionally , dragging trucks with difficulty through the street . Joe passed the swinging doors of a saloon , whiffed the sour smell , thought he might stop . But the seriousness of the errand would n't allow it . He was hungry too now . What is it in America makes the drinking of a glass of beer just a little shameful ? He could still remember an entirely differentmood about such things , places where families sat about tables , neighbourhood cafes , no better than these in sonic ways  --  but different . Not that the beer is n't pretty good either . Of course not like real beer  --  but you have to be in Germany for that . Another saloon and a girl coming out of the side door with a can in her hand which she carried away from herselfcarefully , looking right and left at the street crossing before hurrying over . It 's the Irish of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely onto the middle of the first step at 213 in the freshly fallen snow . A child 's face was in the window at the right of the door its hands close up to it on either side shielding away grey lace curtains . It stuck out its tongue at Joe as he stood on the small platform before the door looking for the bell . The child laughed ,  |p145looked  back into the room , said something . Then another child and finally a grey haired woman came and looked out also . They eyed him up and down as he stood there and the woman gestured vaguely . Finally he realized there was no bell , only a hole where one had been , all hacked about with pen-knife whittlings and a cork shoved in to keep the wind out . As he stood undecidedan enormous woman came struggling up the three steps behind him , raised her face , looked at him squarely and went heavily by . A terrific smell of urine stood out in her wake and other gynaecologic odours which it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? she said as she held back the door without any effort at all , by the sheer presence of her body in the doorway . Then laboriously turning to him she said , who are you lookin ' for ? Where does Carmody live ? said Joe carefully avoiding to say , Mrs. Carmody . The woman looked him over . You 'll find Mrs. Carmody and the children on the third floor in the rear . Go on up ahead of me young man , I 'm slow on the stairs . Joe could hardly pass her in the narrow hallway poorly lit as it was and a smell about it , the further he got from the woman herself , of generations of filth and decay . It must be in the wood itself and in the cracks of the floor , thought Joe . At each landing there was a toilet with the door open and a sink and faucet for drawing water beside it , bare , wet , unappointedin any way , the seat raised on a little platform above the floor . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each hacked and maltreated each in a new way . All seemed to have had the original lock avulsed from them by  --  Time , it must be . While about the torn opening were remains of nails , bolts fastened in fresh places  --  wherever the wood would hold them . He could hear the slow tread of the old woman ascend- ing heavily behind him in the semi-dark . The smell of the dreadful toilets was even worse than she . He went ahead . On the third floor Joe stopped a moment undetermined after all whether to go in or not . There were three doors as a matter of fact and no mark of identification upon any one of them . He stopped and listened . A door opened on the floor below him , it crashed shut and he could no longer hear the tread of the old woman . It would be easy enough to turn and go back the way he 'd come . He could put a couple of dollars in an envelope and send it back by mail . He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was opened almost instantly by Mrs. Carmody herself , and wide . She stood with her face thrust forward as if startled and for a moment neither made a move . Then Joe felt a blast of heat coming out of the room for which the woman immediately apologized : Come in . I keep it warm here for the children . The rest of the place is like an icebox . He had walked directly into a kitchen in which a range stood with a washboiler on the top of it . I 'll take your coat . Wo n't you please sit down . Tommy bring that chair over here for the gentleman . But as Joe made a slight forward move , suddenly , from under the range half-darted , half scuttled one of those always begrimed white dogs of which you ca n't see the eyes for hair and yelping , barking furiously , launched herselfat his feet . Do n't mind her , said Mrs. Carmody , she has pups back of the stove . Shut up , Jenny ! And she reached for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering . In the first place Joe had n't realized she was so young . Her hair , glossy black , was parted in the middle and drawn into a knot behind . Her bodice , folded in at the neck and her sleeves , rolled high , showed a milk-white skin . Hm ! thought Joe . That 's different . The room was pretty clean too , as clean as could bep147expected with five children packed into it in various corners . There were several unironed patched shirts over the back of a chair . The oldest of the children appeared to be a boy of about ten , dark and thin , with grey eyes like his mother , who had been busy looking at part of an old newspaper when Joe entered . After fetching the chair he went back to his reading and seemed to pay no more attention to the visitor though Joe saw by the way he raised his eyes from time to time how closely he was listening to what was being said . There were two girls of about five or six with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose face was scarcely recognizable from something he had smeared on it and a small child which because it had nothing on but a shirt reaching to its belly-button and a bedraggled pair of shoes Joe saw to be a girl . This chubby and delightful thing came at once staggeringwith a spoon in its hand toward the visitor . It rocked and hesitated as it progressed , unseen by its mother , but kept on upon its sturdy legs until it landed full upon Joe 's knees and looked up gurgling . Instantly the mother had it , put it into a sawed off packingbox over by the window and with a moistened towel went to wiping Joe 's pant knee . Oh , do n't bother , said Joe as he looked squarely down between her breasts  --  impossible to avoid doing so  --  and was again struck by the incredible whiteness of her skin . Something to admire . Something unusual . He had heard that the Irish sometimes have skin like that though it 's often , too often , badly freckled . He took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , Mrs. Carmody , he began ... where 's your husband ? The woman looked at the children , then at Joe . He went out last night , she said , and I 'm expecting him any minute now . Joe had himself well in hand ready for anything the woman might be up to . But when she raised her face it was quiet and her eyes were not pleading . Her forehead was straight up and the hair came out of it in a clear line going off to either side smoothly and giving to the woman an almost intellectual look in spite of her obvious condition . Joe even felt a kind of protection which she had assumed over him . He relaxed accordingly . You mean , he said , you do n't know where he is . The woman nodded her head . Drink ? asked Joe bluntly . Yes , said Mrs. Carmody , but I think if you 'll give him another chance I can get him to go straight . I ca n't do it , said Joe . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmody . I 'm sorry for you . We 've got enough troublemakers to deal with in business every day but these are hard times and when you came to me this morning .. . well , something 's got to be done to take care of these children . How old is that little one ? She 'll be a year in April . Joe smiled to himself . What 's her name ? Kathleen , said the mother . Have you children of your own , sir ? Seeing you look at them that way makes me think it . Yes , said Joe , I have a little girl the same age as your daughter . God love her , said the woman , Is n't that fine now . This one 's a wonder , she went on . She has a great habit of tiptoeing , she likes to tip-toe and creep . But when I call her she always answers . If she 's under the bed she sticks her head out and says , Ah ! We have a lot of fun with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hears a train she goes , Ffth ! and she points outside and listens . That 's a nice little fellow you have there too , said Joe , meaning the one with the dirty face . The redhead ? He 's a scallywag . The greatest boy with a hat I 've ever seen . He 'll play all day with it . But Joe took himself in hand again quickly and returnedp149to business . Now listen to me , Mrs. Carmody . No use mincingwords . I see you have n't much to do with . I want to know plainly just how much you do have . If I may ask that question . We have n't a red cent to our names , sir , and that 's the truth or I would n't have been out in that storm this morning to see you . He took the last quarter I had hid in the cup on the shelf there and went off last night with it just as the snow was beginning . When I went out of here this morning I had nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help me . I 've often heard him speak your name . Yes , I can imagine that , said Joe . He 's a foul-mouthed man , my husband , the woman replied , you must n't mind that . But you can see for yourself I 'm not lying . You can come into the other rooms .. . Never mind , said Joe . There 's nothing in them but the beds and an old rag of carpet . Will you make a place for him , anything at all ? I 'll promise you he 'll work steady and cause no more trouble to you . I 'm afraid that 's beyond you , Mrs. Carmody . There 's nothing he can do there anyway and the union would n't let him take less than he was getting , said Joe his lips curling . She saw it . Neither spoke for a moment . The children seemed mesmerized by this strange visitor with an unusual accent . But the big boy continued to or pretended to go on reading the old paper . Joe looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought , as many have before him , what wonderful children sometimes come out of such places as this . She seems twice the size of our baby and as round and rosy and generally good looking as the finest in the land . Mrs. Carmody turned to look too following his gaze , nodding to the child and clapping her hands to make it crow and chortle . The two little girls went over to it then , seeingp150it had the spot light , and they too began to give it some attention . But Joe wanted to get the job over with . I 'll tell you what . If you 'll sober up your husband and send him over to me next Monday . . . now I 'm speaking plain , Mrs. Carmody . There 's no use keeping anything back in a case like this . If you 'll have Carmody come to me Mondaymorning , I 'll find work for him . I ca n't say it 'll be anythingmuch , and I ca n't say it 'll be with me . But it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll advance you a week 's salary for him right now . That 'll be twelve dollars . No . I ca n't do that , said the woman . Joe waited , the money in his hand . Maybe tho ' , she added , you could loan me another dollar till over the end of the week . Make it five , said Joe . Give it to me in ones then , she answered . Joe counted them out to her one at a time while the big boy looked up for once attentively . She folded the bills together and put them into the bodice of her dress . Until Monday morning then , said Joe . God bless you , said the woman , and a thousand thanks for your kindness . Watch the stairs . Joe was back in the pressroom at the usual time . About six o'clock that night Carmody came stumbling home to his family  --  hard to tell just how drunk he was . He wore a cap pulled well down and under it his eyes were malicious  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough face , lean , built for courage and looking anything from twenty to fifty years . The first thing he shot at his wife was : Who was in here today ? Do n't lie to me now you crooked white bitch or I 'll ... He made a pass at her but she was too quick for him and he fell across the table , rolled into a chair from it and sat upright . Gim me something to eat , he roared and as he swept his arm around he struck one of the little girls . Uncertainly hep151picked her up off the floor then and raised her to his lap kissing her with exaggerated solicitude . Your dad 's drunk . Your dad 's drunk as hell , he told the child . But do you see that dirty white bitch standing over there by the stove ? Do you see her ? Well , I 'm going to kill her ! he yelled out . And up he leaped spilling the child on the floor again and went for his wife . Leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave me alone or I 'll tell Father Reilly on you in the morning . To hell with Father Reilly ! the dirty fornicatin ' son of a bitch , the man shouted back at her . Come here till I .. . For the love of God , Mike , sit down and let me get somethinghot into you . Something hot into yourself is more like it , you white bitch you . Who was it was here today giving you money to spend down on the block , you lying harlot you . Sit down there and calm yourself , said his wife to him trying to shove him into a chair . But he was too quick for her this time and got her by the arm . Come here , he dragged her toward him and then suddenly struck her with his fist square in the face so that she went staggering back across the room and fell against the baby 's play pen . He was right on top of her when he grabbed her by the throat . Gim me that money . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one powerful grasp . That stopped him for a moment as he fumblingly counted the remainder of the money , three dollars in all . She went to the sink to wash her eye . But putting the money into his pocket he was on her once more and with a tremendous swing knocked her almost senseless-with a blow alongside the head . She fell to her knees and grabbed him about the ankles in self defence . As he struggled to free himself he lost his balance and fell backward striking his head on the edge of a chair . But he was up in a moment . He cursed and swore , burning himself on the stove , as hep152pursued his wife about the room , blocking the door though she made no attempt to go off by it . She fought doggedly trying to protect herself and the children , saying once , You fool , you wo n't know a thing about this tomorrow . But when he grabbed her again she screamed at the top of her voice he hurt her so . Shut up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she sunk her teeth into it this time and struck him in the face , scratching and tearing . You will , will you ? he bellowed and lifted his knee up suddenly into her stomach so that she folded up with a groan under the table . You will , will you ? he kept on saying . You will , will you ? rubbing his hands together as if to dust them off , panting . Let that teach you a lesson . And seemingly sobered but panting with exertion he looked at his bleeding finger and went out and down the stairs again . As his father had begun to shout when he first came into the room the ten year old boy with a white , drawn face , moved over along the table edge until he was close against the wall and kept his eyes glued to the eternal reading which he had been at again as if to shut out the world . As each scuttle reached the point of a cry or a crash he would look up with terror in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once during the fight an elevated train had gone by outsideshaking the building . The two little girls had clung together , crouched in a corner sobbing but not daring any longer to come forth . While the two year old , seeing his opportunity and profitingby it , crawled in to where the pups were concealed , oblivious to the racket , as if he had been waiting for this chance for a year . The bitch , strangely , did n't molest him but lay aside raising her head now and then yipping , yappingand barking , or shivering all over as a dog will when cut off from escape . Without knowing anything  --  save the shattering of an afternoon  --  the infant alone let go its full voice . It shrieked.  |p153Tho  ' it had grinned Da , Da , Da , Da ! when the man came into the room earlier . Now it stood with both hands on the edge of the enclosure , its feet apart and screamed . It stampedits feet , held on and with rigid neck shut its eyes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the pen she knocked the baby over . It landed in a sitting position but with great alacrity rolled over , got to its feet and was back at once in the old place hanging on and screaming louder than ever . Once it stopped to let go its bladder and for a moment seemed interested in that . But then , pulling itself back and forth , knocking its head against the cage-edge it started screaming once more . Still nothing happened . It held on , closed its eyes and rasping out its yells seemed bent by the very fury of its efforts upon gaining attention . Then a change came over it . Achieving nothing , it began to look around even while crying . Then it forced its screams but without any heart behind them as if it were listening to itself . It was losing interest in the proceedings . Then its mother went down heavily . In the sudden silence after Carmody had left the room when for a moment the whimpering of the pups was the sole disturbance the baby stood without moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its jaw , sat down and began to look around as if for something to play with.  |p154T  H E church bells were ringing in the March wind , the sound rising and falling as the gale whistled and shook the windows of the flat  --  calling the Easter crowds to eleven o'clock service . For heaven 's sake , said Joe , are n't you ready yet ? Well , what do you expect ? his wife answered him . You make me nervous walking up and down that way . Take Lottie and go on ahead , I 'll get there . Here , put on her hat and coat and get out of here . How did she get this cold ? Joe replied . She goes to the parlour window , she just about reaches the frame . And I suppose the little wind that comes in there ... Joe went to see . He put his hand down and sure enough there was a cold current of air coming steadily in under the frame . We ought to put in some weather-stripping , said he . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . They do nothing for us here . Well , if the child gets cold that way .. . Here , said Gurlie to her elder daughter , bring me your hat and coat . You 're going with your father . We 're not staying here after this winter , Gurlie went on while she was clothing the child . I wo n't do it . This is n't a life . When we can afford to buy a house of our own  --  in about ten years , Joe answered her , then you can begin to talk . Meanwhile we better get that window fixed . Huh , Gurlic answered , ten years ? You wait and see . There , now go with your father . She had dressed Lottie inp155a heavy brown coat and a cap , or hood rather , which closed snugly under the chin and left the little face with the dark hair caught at the two sides a perfect oval . As Joe , leading the child by the hand , walked along  --  with that feel of spring in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was answering the child 's small questions while his mind reverted to something his barber had been telling him the day before . Three boys , the barber had . Better than girls . You do n't have to worry so much later . That 's what I tell my wife . A boy you can put a pair of pants on and send them out . But a girl , that 's different . If something happens she blackens up the whole map . You ca n't do a thing about it . She 's the daughter of this one and the sister of that one and the granddaughter of the other one . And so it goes . There 's always some sweet tonguedbitch to spread it a little further .. . Look ! said the little girl . Gurlie came along later in a cab with the baby . They arrived long before Joe could manage it . The Captain let them in himself . Look who 's here , he said . Well ! Where 's Joe ? And Lottie ? They started to walk , Gurlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whew ! You 've got it warm here . Well , we 're glad to see you . You 're sure Joe 's coming ? Yes , he was so dumb , he could n't wait . That 's the Dutch of it , he makes me tired . So I took a cab and beat him . Gurlie ! said Mrs. Neilson bursting in from the kitchen , what a trouble , eh ? to come out for dinner to two old people like us . You poor thing . So much trouble to do with small children . We 're so glad to have you . That 's right , make yourself at home . And the baby ! What a little doll . Now Elsa ! This she spoke to a beautifully groomed Irish setter which had come waving its plumy tail toward them from another room . She 's a good dog . But so big for a little place like this . She wo n't hurt you.  | I know that , said Gurlie . I love dogs . When I am in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys to go shooting sometimes , said his wife , but I 'm afraid she 's getting too fat now to help him much . No , she 's still a good hunter after the first day , said the big fellow defending his pet . Gurlie had put the baby down on the sofa all wrapped up in its coat and with a shawl pinned over all under the chin . It could n't move anything but its eyes as it looked up in wonder at being in a new place and seeing strange faces above it . That 's a sweet baby , said the Captain . A sweet baby ! That 's something I always wanted to have . But I think it 's better so . For a young man a sailor makes a poor father . He is never at home . Well , that sounds funny but you know what I mean . And he laughed his quiet laugh while he kept his keen eyes steadily on the face of his listener  --  he did not close them for amusement . Let 's see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder what she 's thinking ? It 's funny , they will not remember one thing of it afterwards . But they look so knowing . A girl , eh ? I 'll see you later , said Mrs. Neilsen , I must go back to the kitchen . It smells good , said Gurlie , ca n't I help you ? No , no , no , no . I wish we could have had the Lindquists here too but our place is so small . You understand . It 's so nice of you to come here . Not at all , said Gurlie . It 's a lovely place , plenty big enough for two people . You must n't make excuses . I ca n't get over such a fine baby , the Captain went on as Gurlie was still unwrapping it . They are like little flowers , a flower that is just opening . When you take off those clothes it makes it look really as if it were so . The baby yawned widely , then swallowed and began to move its head around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without moving on the Captain until then , studying himp157intently , as it lay still on the sofa being mauled about by its mother undressing it . I wanted six boys , said Gurlie . Well , why do n't you have them then ? said the Captain . You 're still young . Whoops ! laughed Gurlie . Will you pay for them ? Well , said the Captain , I wish I had them too . Six boys ! Yes , that 's the old idea . And a stand in the country . But we Norwegians are wanderers still , so we think we want to buy a farm . But we are for the sea in the end . So a big man like me wants to have a baby . It 's funny . I was reading the papers just now , he went on . We have had quite a gale along the coast I understand . Yes , I read it . Come in . Come in here . We call this the dining room . But we spend most of the time here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what beautiful plants , said Gurlie . She 's lucky with flowers , I can see that . Why you have a regular hothousehere . Look at that lily . What do you call that ? I do n't know , said the Captain , you 'll have to ask Louisa . Yes , they are pretty fine . She likes that kind of thing . But what is this ? said Gurlie . I think she calls it a waxplant , or something like that . Ha , there 's Joe . The frontdoor bell had just rung , the Captain hurried off to welcome his friend . Hello Stecher . Well , I 'm glad to see you . And Lottie . Flow 's my little sweetheart ? Elsa ! he added to the setter . Charge ! But Lottie was n't a bit afraid and put her hand out to the dog who looked askance at it and turned to Joe instead . He patted the beast on the head . Come in here and look at these plants , shouted Gurlie from the next room . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good , the Captain answered as if to his pet . Just a nuisance . We pet her too much . Come in , your wife has been here a long time . You see , smarty , said the lady in question appearing through the curtains , you thought you 'd beat me . Who got fooled ? We had a nice walk , said Joe . Mr. Stecher ! burst in Mrs. Neilsen once more , How nice it is to see you here . I hope we have n't put you to too much trouble . I know what it must be to come out with children on the only day in the week you have to rest . And Easter Sunday too . But it 's so nice to have you . Come in . Do n't stay here . We have n't many rooms . Come into the dining room you do n't care if the table is all set , do you ? We like it here , we have such a nice view . Yes , the Captain added , every room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless we are unlucky and somebody builds a house next to us . Well I should say , said Joe approvingly . This is what I call a lovely room . Huh ! burst out Gurlie . So you do n't like what I give you ... But Gurlie .. . Everything he sees in somebody else 's house he likes .. . But Gurlie .. . I call this a fine , homelike room , said Joe . It looks comfortable . You could sit down here and take it easy . Well , it 's ship-shape , said the Captain . We do n't need much . With my leg and my job on the dock , what else do I need ? We have n't two fine children like you have . What would n't I give for a little girl like that , he continued lookingat Lottie . And a baby .. . He 's just a baby himself , said his wife . They all laughed . Look at these marvellous plants over here , said Gurlie draggingher husband to the window . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning outing so Gurlie decided to give her her bottle and see if she would go to sleep . That 's right , said the Captain , we 've fixed up a place for her in the bedroom.  |p159So  they put the baby to sleep . Gurlie fed it first and it went off like a Iamb . She came back to the others relieved . Lottie was wild about the dog who lay on its side under the table with Lottie right by it putting her arms around its neck and kissing it on the head passionately . How did you break your leg , Captain ? said Joe when they had been left alone a moment by the women . Oh , I fell down a hatchway like all sailors do finally , said the one addressed . That was the last time . But that finished me . I 'm just a landlubber now . And here 's dinner ! Mrs. Neilsen hooked back the kitchen door and began to bring in the food . I have to do all the work myself , she told them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Joe . We 'll excuse you by what I can smell coming . Just like a man , said Mrs. Neilsen beaming , you like to flatter us women . Vegetable soup first . Then they had a roast leg of lamb with cresses around the plate and caper sauce . The potatoes were browned whole and smothered in butter . They had red cabbage with cardamom seed . Fresh peas . Fresh peas ! said Gurlie , look at that  --  at this time of year . Why , if I had such things on the table my husband would think I was making him broke . Do you see that ? she slapped her spouse on the arm . See what people eat . Oh you must n't say things like that , Gurlie , said Mrs. Neilsen . This is a big occasion to have our friends here to see us . We do n't eat like this every day . If we do n't treat you well you 'll never come back again . And celery and olives , white bread and brown . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't eat store bread . You like beer , Stecher . All good Germans like beer . We have plenty of it in the house . I ca n't serve you Champagne like you did us .. . That was Christmas , said Joe.  | Well , we can each finish a couple of bottles and if you want more we have it outside . Come on Stecher , you ought to be able to give us a good toast in German , you must remember some from when you were a young man there . Oh , he 's not a sport , said Gurlie . He do n't know anything like that . Skol ! said Joe . That 's good Scandinavian . That 's right . Skol ! said Mrs. Neilsen and they all held up their glasses . Lottie , as usual , was no prattler but ate her meal quietly  --  leaning over the side of her chair every once in a while to touch the dog 's head where the beast sat close beside her . So they all ate and talked and drank their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Joe who had taken out his watch at the first sound from the other room , three o'clock . Think of that . And here we are still at table . That 's fine , said Mrs. Neilsen . When Gurlie reached her the baby was out from under the covers trying to push away the chairs they had put with their backs against the bed to keep her from falling out . She was picked up and taken into the dining room . Each time they wake from sleep it is as if they were just born , said the Captain . Look at her ! She does n't know what to make of us . Here ! And he jumped up to help Gurlie . He got a rocker , propped two books under it so that it stood solid , filled it with pillows . His wife let him do it . And there they sat the baby who with wide eyes still watched the big man while he took a long kitchen towel and whirled it between his two hands into a sort of rope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other across the baby 's chest he soon had her securely lashed in place . He thinks it 's a ship , said his wife . Flushed from sleep the baby continued to look unwink/ingly at the Captain in obvious wonder . The others sat watching . But now the baby dropped its look , then bent its head forward and remained that way staring down into its lap . Look at that ! the little flirt , said Mrs. Neilsen . Would you believe that , at her age . The Captain was delighted and laughed aloud . At this the baby bowed her head still lower but tried to look up with her eyes , sideways . Oh you big elephant , said Mrs. Neilsen to her husband , you 'll frighten her . She 's getting shy , said Joe . He 's frightened her , said Mrs. Neilsen . Nonsense , said Gurlie . Here , she added to the infant , do n't act so silly . Hold your head up . Of course he 's frightened her , said Mrs. Neilsen . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting his face up suddenly to her that way . You should be ashamed of yourself . Hold up your head , said Gurlie again to the infant . Oh do n't bother her , said the Captain . At this the baby began slowly to wave her upraised hands round and round at the wrists , faster and faster until they were going like small propellers . She raised her face and with an offended look fastened her eyes straight on the Captain . You see , said his wife . The poor man was crushed . Helplessly the little hands waved round and round . Then the child 's lower lip protruded . She jerked her breath once or twice . Tears filled her eyes . Then she gave in and sobbed convulsively . You see , said Mrs. Neilsen to her husband . You see ? Joe laughed . I wish she was grown up , said Gurlie soothing the baby as she placed it on her lap . I do n't like them at this age.  | But that 's when they are best , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of her then , said Gurlie . Mrs. Neilsen burst out laughing . Imagine it ! she said . But she 's pretty smart , said Gurlie . If I do say it myself . I can see that , said the Captain , like her mother  --  andher father . Ho ! ho ! laughed Joe . If she 's smart like her mother she 'll grow up and marry a rich man like her mother did . Well , you 'd better be rich pretty soon , said Gurlie , that 's all I can say . Why do n't you make enough money so you can retire young ? If I were a man that 's what I 'd do . Good for you , Gurlie , said Mrs. Neilsen . That 's the way to talk . I 'm sure your husband is luckier than many men . Yes , I 'm lucky to be alive , said Joe . With that Gurlie , tired of holding the baby , placed her on the floor where she was struggling to go anyway . Is it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Neilsen . There 's nothing she can harm . Lottie was still in adoration of the dog  --  but now more quietly , the affair having progressed to that stage . The baby was put down in a sunny spot and sat with a thumb in her mouth watching her sister . Well , here we are , said the Captain . Come on Stecher , another bottle of beer . I do n't mind if I do , said Joe . How old were you when you first went to sea , Captain ? Well , the first time , I do n't know . I must have been a baby . But one of the first times I can remember I was about six years old . . . The baby gave two parrot-like squawks and went down on her hands , eagerly watching the dog lying there by her sister . Let 's see . I was sixteen years old , went on the Captain , when I broke my leg the first time.  |p163What  happened ? said Joe . Oh you do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . That was when I got this cut on my lip too . Have one of these cigars , Stecher , they 're clear Havana filler , I get them from a friend . No thanks , said Joe , they look too strong for me . I like my cheap smokes better . The baby crawled to within reach of the dog and sat down by her tail . Look at that baby , said Mrs. Neilsen . That 's all right , said Gurlie . Go on with your story . Oh it is n't much , said the Captain . We had a small schooner that time , somewhere in the Bahamas . You know there are lots of little islands down there . We had just unloadeda cargo and were on our way to pick up another I do n't know where  --  some other place . We never got there anyway . The captain I suppose wanted to save money so he thought we 'd get there without bothering to take on ballast . That 's a nuisance to a sailor , you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking it easy and feeling pretty fine . It was a nice day but pretty hot . Just about noon it was , I think , and I was down below in my bunk . The next I knew everything was going upsidedown . I do n't know what happened after that , how I got out or anything about it . But after a while I came to and I was on top of a piece of wood , it turned out to be a hatchway cover . The ship must have turned right over . The wind caught her in a hurry I guess and over she went . I could n't see her anywhere . Or any of the crew . There had been six of us on board , I was the youngest . Everything had disappeared . The worst of it was it got so hot . That was a bad time for me I tell you . I got pretty thirsty . I do n't know how I kept on that piece of board but I did , for three days . I got sunburnt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't remember anything . I was lucky though . The wind must have blown me on a shore sometime that night . I do n't know how long I lay there , the waves must have washed me up and down quite a bit . It broke my leg and cut me up pretty badly . It would have drowned me but I guess I was pretty tough in those days . Lottie did n't want the baby to have a share in the dog and kept pushing her away , or trying to , but the baby would n't move . The next thing I knew , said the Captain , I woke up in bed all bandaged so I could n't move . I did n't know where I was . At first I thought I was in heaven .. . Under the table the children continued at odds over the patient animal . But Lottie was really in love with it , strokingit and patting it understandingly as the beast lay relaxed under her soothing gestures . But the baby had a different idea of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rump and with beaming face whanged it with her two small hands in an unrestrained delirium of joy . This both Lottie and the dog resented , the dog not so much as Lottie . The beast every now and then would throw her head back toward the baby in a more or less casual way as she might were a fly bothering her and that was all . But Lottie went into more serious action . No , she said softly under her breath so that the grownups might not hear , and frowned severely . No . Stop that . The infant looked at her astonished for a moment but soon went back to her amusement . Joe alone was watching them . With that Lottie moved over closer to the infant , covertly , without attracting attention , and wearing a perfectly expressionless face dug her fingernails deeply into the child 's bare knee . A sudden tumult occurred . The child screamed . The dog jumped up . The women pushed back their chairs . Lottie pinched her , said Joe . Lottie come here to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you ? she said to the baby . Ca n't you be quiet ?  |p165Did  the dog harm her ? asked the Captain . She could n't bite her . Joe made no further move . So after a moment the infant was put back into her chair where she kept looking down at her sister and the dog once more happily playing . We never heard the end of the story , said Joe . Oh well , there 's nothing much to tell , the Captain went on . An Englishwoman was walking down on the beach in the morning and she saw me lying there with . the waves knocking me around . She thought I was dead . But she had them take me up to the hospital anyway and that 's where I was when I woke up . That was a lucky thing for you , said Gurlie . Yes , I was in that place three months . They were good to me all right.  |p166T  H E day the baby was a year old there was a pretty card from the fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been extremely busy opening up the Long Island house but that she would stop around that evening for a little while . Joe had not mentioned the event when he left that morning . And Gurlie , as a matter of fact , had not thought of it until an hour later . The card was just a coloured picture of a bunch of daisies , cornflowers and wild roses with sanded gilt letters under it  --  Happy Birthday ! Lottie took it and rubbed her fingers over the colours as if to feel them but the roughness of the lettering made her stop and look again . It was a superb April day . All morning Gurlie kept the windows open , going restlessly back and forth among the rooms as if she might be working . Lunch was a joke . But by one she could stand it no longer and went down to the street . Take care of the children , she told the maid , I 'm going out . But Lottie was behind her . All right . Only take the baby in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went toward the Park , Gurlie with her short quick steps and Lottie running after . What a relief ! In the distance , through the veil of trees , rose the walls of the reservoir . Gurlie took a narrow path which ran curvingsouth . But after a few moments , feeling warm from the walk and the heavy clothes she wore she sat down on a bench and looked around.
