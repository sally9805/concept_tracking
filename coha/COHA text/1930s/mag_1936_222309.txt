Inspired by its success with the Wagner Ring cycle last year ( TIME , Nov. 4 ) , the San Francisco Opera Association made plans months ago to repeat it next season , again engaged Soprano Kirsten Flagstad and Tenor Lauritz Melchior , tried to get Conductor Artur Bodanzky , who had performed wonders with its ragged run-down orchestra . Last week from Vienna , Conductor Bodanzky cabled his refusal on the grounds that the San Francisco orchestra pit was too small for Wagner , that he could not do without the extra musicians whom he would have to take from Manhattan . San Francisco thereupon appointed Conductor Fritz Reiner , who proved himself an expert opera conductor in Philadelphia last year , is now at London 's Covent Garden .
