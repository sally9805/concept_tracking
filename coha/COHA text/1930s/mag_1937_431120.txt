MY INTRODUCTION to the maternity racket came when , as a novice so to speak , I shopped for maternity clothes . ( The simple expedient of buying such things in the " fashionable stouts " department had not yet occurred to me . ) An exquisite blending of the sentimen:al and the scientific permeated the maternity section of the store to which I went before my 7rst baby came . The clerks were motherly : oohing souls who " understood " and graduate nurses in uniforms who wore lugubrious expressons , evidently to agree with or impress on the customer that the business at hand was nothing to be taken lightly . The portentous theme running through the patter of the expert fitters was " at this time , my dear . " I gathered from their sympathetic flutterings that I should not permit mere materialism to mar the joy of impending motherhood . " At this time , my dear , you should indulge your every whim . You owe it to yourself , your husband , and your child to keep yourself in a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think too much about expenses . " That sort of insidious wisdom from an understanding heart accompanied the fittings of ugly dresses and trick girdles . To the same tune I Ns. as invited to be fitted for maternity evening wraps and maternity evening shoes . ( It seemed one must not neglect the gayer side of life At This Time . ) On my refusal to permit a regis:erect nurse to show me the latest in layettes and to answer any question I might have pertaming to my Condition , the very air was laden with misgivings for my child . I finally fled the place before my clerk and the officious R.N. called the local Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children . I wore a dowdy $25 maternity dress and a remarkable $Io girdle , looked ten years older , and was practically convinced that I very likely should become the mother of a future inmate of the State penitentiary . GANGWAY FOR BABY ! IN A MILDER-than-ordinary sense , I use the term racket to describe the compulsive propaganda of those who sell services , articles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are based on experience gained as the mother of three children , the eldest of whom is only seven . That is , my experience is current . It is a sweet , gentle racket and invokes erudite pseudoscientific dissertations intermixed with lovely sentimental twitterings . Coercion in the maternity racket ? Dear me , no  --  not unless you count solemn threats of social stigma and insidious suggestions of rickets , social maladjustment , colic , dementia praecox , diaper rash , inferiority complex , and all other ills and evils of infancy , adolescence , maturity , and senility . ( Those who sell things for child care can not be too emphatic in warning that the dietary and other mistakes made by parents live after them . ) Yes , that 's all there is to the maternity racket . Indeed , that 's all that 's necessary . The racket flourishes on the simple premise that parents flee in horror from a suggestion that they are not doing their utmost for their offspring , are not " modern " parents , or are not doing all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in shopping for maternity clothes was in a leading Chicago specialty store some few years ago , but the same general patter is still customary , even in departmentstore basements . Basement shoppers also may have the advice of a trained nurse . Such assistance , upstairs or down , ordinarily includes advice to buy several " belly bands , " use of which doctors abandoned years ago . Cotton shirts for babies are now preferred to the more expensive woolen garments , but many of the stores will try to include a few of these in every layette , because " baby comes from a warm climate ? ha ha ! " Another service offered by the stores is courses in child psychology and child care given by an expert on the subject . Sometimes a small fee is charged . On the way out of the store , of course , members of the class are at liberty to visit the regular maternity section and see the newest in layettes and the latest gadgets to simplify motherhood . Books on child care and kindred subjects may be rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such books are also available at the public libraries , which , of course , have nothing to sell . One may receive free of charge a series of excellent handbooks on child training and prenatal care from the government , which also has nothing to sell . It may be significant here to recall that nearly ten years ago a distinguished homeeconomics editor wrote a book on merchandising in which she predicted that in the coming year there would be born 2,500,000 babies , putting into circulation about $375,000,000 . She believed " special catering " to this purchasing power was somewhat neglected and urged druggists and department store men to " bestir " themselves . She pointed out that a few live druggists and department-store men did go so far as to hold series of informal meetings for mothers , at which doctors , nurses , etc. spoke on child care , and added that this was the sort of consumer contact in which she thoroughly believed . Contemplation of present-day " special catering " should leave the author delirious with joy . From a Los Angeles pediatrician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great department stores and a dairy , that he was invited to join . It was proposed that he conduct regular tours of the store and wind up in the maternity section , where he would deliver himself of a few homilies on the importance of pure milk for children and , ever so casually , mention the virtues of the milk sold by the dairy involved . His would-be sponsors offered as inducement many new " contacts " for the doctor . The quasi-ritualistic antics of the high-pressure obstetricians could make a separate story . I mention them here only as a highly specia ' . - ized phase of the maternity racket . For instance , I know an obstetrician who uses twilight sleep exclusively and insists on a nurse of his own selection to watch the patient during the delivery period ? something like six hours ? for which the patient is charge : $25 . If high forceps are deemed necessary , another $25 is added to the doctor 's bill . Initial examinations by the high-pressure lads are truly impressive occasions , with whiteuniformed attendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient from one room of vastly impressive equipment to another . Calcium and metabolism tests ( $Io or more each ) in addition to routine examinations make swell business with which to reduce a patient to awe and with which , in turn , the patient may impress her friends . Obstetricians who take the whole matter of reproduction casually say , however , that such tests are necessary only in special cases . Another practice gaining favor is that of prescribing sodium amytol as a nightly sedative months before and after delivery . A glass of sherry or warm milk is usually efficacious ? but that is something to be expected in any country doctor 's prescription . EVERY BABY IS " UNIQUE " ! LET US CONSIDER now the cult of the pediatrician , whose work begins where obstetrics leaves off . At various times I have subscribed to the regular " well baby " service of the pediatricians and have no quarrel with it , so long as it does not make neurotics out of mother and child through slavish dependence on it . The service does provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all responsibility for her baby 's physical welfare onto her pediatrician 's shoulders . The knowledge that advice is close as the telephone is often , alone , worth the monthly rate charged by the doctor . Another advantage in subscribing to the well-baby service is that one never need be left out of bridge-table chatter . But in pediatrics , possibly even more than in obstetrics , the opportunity for hokum is apparent . Many up-and-coming pediatricians have built up their business on a mystic elaboration of two simple truths ? that creation of a human being is a miracle and that no two babies are alike . A young mother is made to realize fully that her baby is different , different , different ! " We have here a distinct and forceful little personality , to be treated as such , " the pediatrician rumbles in bedtime-story tones . The mother is expected to perceive likewise that the feat she and her husband have achieved in creation of this personality is somewhat unique . If it is her first baby the usual result is that she is completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , that most women have little trouble in enlisting their husbands in this attitude . Both parents of a new baby commonly refer to " Our Pediatrician " in much the same reverent tones they would use in speaking of their Deity . A general practitioner in a wealthy suburban : ommunity gave me my first insight into the mysteries of high-pressure pediatrics . My five months ' old daughter had an earache which happened to have been preceded by a fall from a bed onto a thick carpet . The doctor wanted an X-ray made . When that $io photograph was presented to him he dramatically refused to look at it . He said he did little pediatrics any more and would be loath to attempt a diagnosis . The best thing was to send for a pediatrician friend from the city ( a young man of great promise , he declared ) whom he had known in school . I was a stranger in the community and so inquired whether there was n't a pediatrician here in the village . There were several , it seemed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city . I agreed , then , and spent the next few hours pacing the floor at home , awaiting him . The baby was my first , and this was her first illness , which surely must be serious , I thought , if a zeneral practitioner would not " attempt a diagnosis . " When the pediatrician arrived I was struck by his youth and his intensely serious manner . In a careful scrutiny of the X-ray picture he could find no connection be:ween the baby 's earache and her fall but , with much ado and on five or six sheets of note paper , he prescribed a diet and simple drops or ear and nose ? and charged me 81o . The fee , of course , was not more than most doctors charge for suburban calls , but I no doubt could have saved myself about $2o of the total $23 bill had I gone directly to a village pediatrician . Now that I recall the incident , that was my original intention , but , when I called the local professional building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was summarily connected with a chiropodist ! What with a screaming baby at my side , I felt in no mood for horseplay with telephone operators , so , rather than try that one again , I took the baby to the doctor of an acquaintance ? all of which rather makes it appear that what does n't happen by design in the maternity racket happens by chance . BABY EATS OUT OF CANS OF COURSE , as a new **35;27;TOOLONG , so far , I was given a sales talk on the well-baby service of the young pediatrician 's " group , " which I later learned was quite the most fashionable one in the city . During his visit the young doctor dropped the information that a certain low-priced corn sirup on the market contains the same food value and other essentials as the well-known and expensive proprietary baby food that I used . He said they gave the sirup to the poor children attending their clinics at medical school , " with gratifying results . " I think that is a fair example of the subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate . For poor children , corn sirup ? but for your children , Blah 's Baby Food . ( I subsequently used the corn sirup myself for my second baby , " with gratifying results . " ) As for canned vegetables ? surely only a moron would contend that they are not a pleasure to use , and their preparation is certainly more convenient than cooking and sieving fresh vegetables ; but I believe that is probably their main advantage over the waterless cooking methods used in most kitchens . Cooking and sieving vegetables day in and day out , however , remains purely and simply a bore . ( And what a bore ! ) Thus , when an understanding pediatrician says he believes an intelligent woman might better spend her time developing her child 's personality , attending to its social adjustments , seeing that all reflexes are properly conditioned , etc. , his words are balm to the troubled soul of the busy mother . She willingly spends as much money for one or two servings of carrots as for a week 's supply bought au @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing a baby , Mother must conserve her strength . She is also naturally a bit high-strung just now . The more rational obstetricians have their own quarrel with the pediatricians who cater to this " high-strung " condition of post partum patients , contending that they are overwilling to permit patients to abandon hope of producing breast milk and then prescribe formulas containing patent foods . CHOOSE YOUR HOSPITAL CAREFULLY UIOSPITALS harbor another interesting aspect of the maternity racket . It is common knowledge that one does not get far inside a private institution of mercy before some demanding palm has been crossed with silver and , often , a note for the approximate balance ? regardless of one 's credentials or emergency needs as a patient . Hospitals cannily assume that pregnancy is one condition known indubitably long before confinement and , therefore , that adequate financial provisions should have been made to meet their own terms without fail . Thus there is a definite scale of payment . The hospital is prepared to extract its toll before the obstetricians , pediatricians , drugstores , dairies , baby laundries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat hospital rate is equitable ? but one must not be surprised to find ergot or any other such simple specific charged as an extra in the final bill . One would do well also to determine whether the flat rate of one hospital , appearing to be $Io or so less than that of another institution , includes delivery-room and anesthetist fees and other items that might be taken for granted before the blessed event . There is also the interesting matter of the circumcision room in most hospitals . Circumcision may be performed in less than five minutes in the doctor 's office when the baby is a few weeks old . But is it done that way in the majority of cases ? Decidedly not . The little future quarterback must have the very best ; so he has it in the scientific and sterilized aura of the circumcision room , use of which costs from $5 to $20 , while the doctor 's bill may be another $ Io or more . While such hospital practices can survive because of a tenacious legend that lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can not be said to appeal to sentiment . For a nice example of tha : there is the happy custom of a famous Hollywood institution . If a patient there wishes to keep as a souvenir the identification necklace placed around the baby 's neck at birth , she may do so ? by paying the hospital $I.5o . HERE COME THE VITAMINS DURING her sojourn in the hospital , a maternity patient is bombarded by mail with much fascinating literature . All of this printed matter is embellished with storks , chubby babies in bassinettes , and the like , but there is no froth in the texts . Instead , there are scientific appeals to the modern mother ? the mother who realizes her time might better be spent on the development of Baby 's personality than on washing diapers ; who realizes how important it is that each ounce of Baby 's weight be accurately recorded ; who is intelligent enough to face facts and can understand the desirability of an insurance policy for Baby ; who realizes that Baby 's future health depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is essential to Baby 's spiritual development to have scientifically constructed nursery furniture ; who knows that no ordinary photographic methods can catch the individuality of her baby ; and who knows why , oh goodness , yes ? if Nature does not see fit to provide mother 's milk , Baby must have the certified raw , the Grade A pasteurized , or the Vitamin D milk from a remarkable dairy . The Vitamin D milk is only one item in the Parade of the Vitamins marching , in all their scientific glory , upon Mother . Besides the milk and , of course , cod-liver oil , she soon learns about vitamin-laden breakfast foods , bread , oranges , powdered chocolate , and ( believe it or not ) soap . For an interesting analysis of the vitamin D milk question one need only dicker with drivers for two rival dairies , one of whom is staking all on pasteurized Jersey and the other counting desperately on selling the more scientific vitamin D product . The sales talk of the latter may well be imagined , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no depending on a cow . She may get a dose of cod-liver oil or a series of " light treatments , " but it is too much to expect ( he will say ) that she can put the proper amount , if any , of the precious vitamin D into her milk stream . Manufacturers of proprietary foods and by needs , in fostering the helplessness of new ? thers and thus keeping them vulnerable to compulsions of the maternity racket , emsize the " consult your doctor " motif . Cont your doctor about when to start So-and. ' s canned foods ; about the virtues of a certain toilet seat or a nonirritating talcum powder or a new type of nursing bottle , and on ? ad absurdum , ad nauseam . OTHER PESTS A. FINE FLIGHT of advertising recently inaugurated by manufacturers of noncompet-ing baby needs is the Baby Box . The box including from nine to twelve samples , with folders and reply postcards , and is delivered to . me 20,000 homes in 25o leading cities each month . For the privilege of thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' e hospital and presumably are in the market ? r baby needs , each manufacturer pays $i , 000 month . The appeal of maternity advertising is ordiily to the sentimental , to the scientific , and to class consciousness . Most of it is merely amusing , but toadying to snobbery reached a new zenith recently when a chubby baby in an advertisement grew solemnly grateful because his mother was a college graduate and hence understood what laxative to give him . Complers of catalogues for institutes of higher arning should be particularly grateful . Following is a bit of deathless literature concocted by a dairy in New York : Dear Baby ? We are certainly happy to hear that you finally got here safe and sound . Mother was beginning to worry about you . She used to sit at the window for hours looking for you . The world is a very nice place . And very big . Ever so much bigger than your crib . It has sunshine ? most of the time ? which you will like because it is ; right gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are colors , too ? beautiful colors that you 'll want to eat . We hope you 'll let us come and see you some time . But , of course , we 'll have to wait until you 've met all your uncles and aunts and cousins and things . They come first . Get plenty of rest . You need it after your long journey . For your mother 's sake you must get as strong and healthy as possible . And if there 's any way in which we can help ? drop us a line and we 'll come a-running . Sincerely , THE PEOPLE . Some insurance companies , like other interests with things to sell , lose no time in offering their services to the parents of a new baby . Pamphlets and brochures replete with alarming statistics on the infant mortality rate make cheerful reading for the convalescent mother . A minor annoyance of the maternity racket is the long and tireless parade of photographers at the door and on the telephone as soon as mother and baby return from the hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . All I know is that the inscriptions on most of them are incredibly silly . POST PARTUM SOME TIME after Mother has returned from the hospital , convinced , by gladsome words of people with things to sell , that she has achieved an impressive and heroic feat , there intrudes an alien note in the beautiful rhapsody of motherhood . Unexpectedly , the postman drops in with literature describing powders , tablets , etc. , for " feminine hygiene . " Sometimes samples are enclosed . A delightful surprise . Now , if I do not assume that this occurrence at this particular time is purely fortuitous , its import to me is substantially thus : " While we know that having a baby is a lovely experience , we 'll wager it is one you will not want to repeat very soon . Therefore , study the enclosed carefully and read the testimonials of satisfied users . Of course , perhaps it 's all a coincidence .
