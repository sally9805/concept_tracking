In addition , considerable confidence was expressed concerning the technical position of the market , which was believed to have been fortified substantially by recent sweeping liquidation . ? ? ? Growing optimism about the business situation had some concrete foundation in reports from structural lines , which showed expanding activity last month , both in comparison with the preceding month , and the corresponding period last year .

However , the principal factor in this poor comparison was the heavy volume of traffic being moved at this time in 1929 when the peak in freight loadings was being approached . Comparisons with 1928 are more favorable , the decline for the week amounting to ** against 6.73% in the preceding week , and 7.65% two weeks ago . ? With the grain movement getting under way in substantial volume , car loadings should show good gains from week to week for some time .

SR Radio Corp . was a feature of special strength in the main industrial class , advancing to the best levels of the movement on a fairly large turnover . Bullish activity in the stock was stimulated by the approaching return on next Saturday from a sojourn abroad of I , i . J. Meehan , who specializes in Radio on the Stock Exchange . and has been one of the active sponsors of upswings in the stock over the last several ' years . Another factor which brought buying into Radio was the renewed attention called by the Iron Age to plans of R. C.

Bearish professionals , who have been working for lower prices in this group have emphasized the influence of lower industrial operations on utility profits , and have argued that shares of this class have continued to sell at an unwarrantedly high ratio to their earnings despite the drastic readjustment that has occurred since last autumn . However . leading bankers connected with utility projects are growing increasingly confident regarding the outlook for these companies . and have been accumulating representative utility shares on recent drives . They admit that business conditions in 1930 will interfere with the steady gains in the industry 's average earnings over a long period of years . But in making long-pull commitments they have been actuated by the logical expectation of important expansion in trade activity throughout the country when the current readjustment has been completed .

Rates in Great Western 's territory have for years been lower than for other parts with the result that the company 's earnings have suffered . Within the last year , new management has come into the road and brought about economies which caused the road to show relatively better earnings than other carriers during the recent depression . With efficient handling of the property and a fair rate basis , the road 's outlook is better than it has been for years .

It is backlogs in these departments that promise to sustain operations of the industry not far from a level of 60% , though during the summer losses of a few points may occur .

Paine , Webber &; Co. say : " An analysis of recent developments in the money market indicates that we are approaching a major turning point in security price levels . Following the current easing tendency of interest rates , the chain of events now to be looked for includes ( 1 ) an early strengthening of bond prices , followed some time later by ( 2 ) an ; upswing in stocks of investment character , and ( 3 ) shortly thereafter by advances in prices of secondary common stocks . A rising bond market , which is likely to materialize in the near future , should be regarded as a definite signal that the end of the current decline is near .

Moreover , the sharp drop in interest rates during the past six months has not yet been reflected in the bond market . In this period commercial paper rates eased from 5% to below 31 , ; : % , while bond prices gained less than two points . A further substantial advance in bond prices from current levels is thus indicated . " Another important force operating to make bonds more valuable is the matter of increased purchasing power of the dollar , due to declining commodity prices . Each dollar of bond interest , as well as each dollar of principal due to be paid at maturity , takes on added value under present circumstances of low commodity prices .
