THAT is the new engineer apprentice for the foundry department , " I heard someone say behind the thin wall in the employment office . " Better take him right over ; he 's slated to start to-night on Schmidtie 's floor . " In a moment I had left a half dozen envious individuals sitting on the benches in the waiting room , and was walking rapidly with a messenger , or clerk , through the yards , across switch tracks , around great piles of rusty pig iron and steel scrap and between many immensely long shops . We turned the corner of one of the great buildings , pushed through a double door fifty feet beyond , and I then found myself in a long locker room . The day shift had just come off , and the place teemed with men and resounded with singing , whistling , laughter , shouting back and forth , the chatter of rapid conversation in half a dozen languages , banging of steel locker doors , dropping of heavy shoes on the floor , and the swish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere and much water had been spilled on the floor . The younger men caused the uproar ; the older workmen had lighted pipes or cigarettes and were either dressing by themselves or talking quietly in small groups . Most of these people were foreigners , of many nationalities , some dark while others were fair , but they had certain characteristics in common , a broad nose , thick lips , eyes set deeply behind bushy eyebrows and an indefinable expression of alertness , even when coinbined , in some cases , with evidences of stupidity . An elderly attendant , carrying a mop stick , came toward us and , without speaking , gave me a key , for which I signed a receipt card . The messenger found the corresponding locker , and I donned my overalls and left my coat and lunch box in the locker . Then we passed into the foundry proper . I was almost frightened by the size of the building , the vast spaces aloft and the great distance to the far end of the shop , a thousand feet , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of Schmidtie , foreman in the heavy jobbing department or " floor " ; for no walls divided the building . Great bridge cranes trundled back and forth in the dim light overhead , and their warning bells clanged incessantly like the bells of trolley cars on a busy street . Along one wall stood a long row of molds , from ten to fifteen feet in diameter , looking very much like large flat cisterns except that they were made of steel and encumbered with beams , clamps , and unfamiliar paraphernalia . Some of these had been poured , and thin wisps of gray smoke rose from them as from the ruins of a recent fire . Smaller molds stood nearer the center of the bay , and all about the floor were heaps of black molding sand . The floor itself was of sand . Partly finished molds , empty flasks , long trays of cores , clamps , rails , and boxes of facing sand were scattered everywhere . On a platform fifteen feet high near the opposite wall of the shop and a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end like so many long narrow fortresses of brick and steel , each one large enough to receive a hundred men in comfort . Most of them were in operation , and intense white light broke forth through every crevice while long tongues of yellow flame reached out eagerly through small square ports . The night men had begun work and all kept stolidly at their tasks ; there was no sign of the levity we had found in the Locker room . Several handymen were building platforms around a large mold , trying the clamps which secured it , and preparing moist sand and charcoal for the pouring . Chainmen followed the cranes to fasten and unfasten slings . Laborers cleaned the floor and carried clamps and plates . A crew of half a dozen molders and helpers was completing a mold in a pit , and the drone of their air rammers could sometimes be heard during a hill in the general din . We found Schmidtie near the glass box which he called his office . I had heard much about hostility to college graduates on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here . I was cordially received and he made me feel at ease immediately . He talked to me for fifteen or twenty minutes about my tasks , the men , safety , and the relation to one another of the various departments in the shop . He was tall and stooped and his big , dark eyes and long , thin face gave him an appearance of solemnity which did not belong to him . He wore a shapeless cap , an old blue work shirt open at the throat , colorless , baggy trousers , and heavy work shoes . While he spoke his eyes wandered all over the foundry . Occasionally a dusty workman approached and asked a question . Many of the questions . I could not understand , although each of the men may have been trying to speak English . At any rate Schmidtie answered them all in English : " Nothing doing , you got a new shovel two nights ago . " " Well , do something else , the crane 's busy . " " About twenty ton . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nine hundred degrees by nine o'clock , hold there till twelve and then shut off . " When he had completed his instructions to me he called a chainrnan who was passing alone . The man came promptly , a dark-skinned fellow with fantastic mustache and a sullen air . He looked as though he were frequently reprimanded and expected to be again . He stood with his feet far apart , his hands behind his back , and his eyes on the ground . " Tago , here is your partner , " Schmidtie said to him . The man looked up , and Schmidtie must have understood the expression in his eyes for after a long pause he asked , " You understood me , did n't you ? " The man looked me over , shrugged his shoulders , turned on his heel , and went after his crane without a word . " Go along with him , " Schmidtie directed . " He 's crazy but he knows his business thoroughly . " After several hours three strokes of a bell sounded above the roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preparation , and all the men became attentive . Our crane went to the end of the shop with a pile of flasks , and when we returned a huge black bucket called a ladle hung from another crane and under the spout which projected from the nearest furnace . Two weird figures were digging away at the upper end of the spout . A faint red glow appeared , and both men jumped away . A thread of molten metal crawled down the spout ; but before it had reached the end there was a terrific burst of fierce white light from the furnace , and a thick stream of liquid fire rushed into the ladle with a resounding gurgle and rumble . A dense cloud of dark-brown smoke rose from the ladle but was soon dissipated and succeeded by millions of sparks which fell in graceful arcs to the floor . The painfully strong light of the steel strained the eyes like the lights in a picture theater when they are suddenly turned on after a long feature . It smothered the thousand-watt lamps which were suspended at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shirt of the craneman high up in his cage , although he himself had hardly been visible before . He nonchalantly watched the flow of metal while he extracted a handful of tobacco from a yellow package and inserted it into his mouth . Even the steel roof truss above him was as clear as the blueprint from which it was built . After five or ten minutes the stream of fire became thinner and more sluggish , and the craneman , his shirt buttons , and the roof truss gradually retired again into the darkness . The craneman swung the ladle away from the furnace and hoisted it higher into the air , and the crane groaned and complained under the load of forty or fifty tons . A procession formed and proceeded toward us . First came the ladle with a faint red light hovering over it . Two chainmen followed immediately and after an interval came Al , the heat pourer , magnificently alone , with his hat pulled well down , his goggles on his forehead , and long white leggings over his trousers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pours the metal . He is the central figure while the ladle is " out on the floor . " The Superintendent and Schmidtie walked abreast of each other at a distance behind him , and after them in turn straggled a motley crew of about a dozen men carrying crowbars , sledge hammers , water buckets , rods , hooks , and long thin torches . Walking close together and behind the bosses provided an opportunity for some of them to indulge in mock combat and other jokes . Al signalled the craneman to indicate the mold to be poured , and in a moment the ladle limig above it expectantly . It was a great pot , ten feet deep , ten feet in diameter at the top and eight or nine at the bottom and was built of heavyriveted steel plates , lined with several thicknesses of fire brick and a coating of fire clay . A seven-foot lever projected horizontally from the bottom of the ladle and at a tangent to its circumference . By means of a long arm extending over the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the nozzle in the bottom of the ladle and regulated the flow of the metal . The men surrounded the mold and watched Al , who climbed nimbly to a platform beside it and proceeded to " spot " the ladle , that is , he turned the ladle to a convenient position and with his arms and a whistle he signalled the craneman to adjust the ladle until the nozzle in the bottom hung directly over the gate or funnel-shaped opening through which the metal flows into the mold . The whistle was almost articulate . I did not understand the signals but almost knew what they meant . " Lower down , " the whistle shrieked . " This way a little , " it coaxed , and then cautioned , " Hold it . " A ladleman unlocked the lever by loosening a clamp screw with his hammer ; Al pushed the lever down , and a three-inch stream of white-hot metal shot six inches from the nozzle to the gate . A half dozen hollow , chimneylike structures , called heads , were built on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of molding sand in small steel flasks and the openings in them were about eighteen inches square and led into the interior of the mold . Through these heads the air and gases escaped as the mold filled with metal . In order to direct the pouring , the Superintendent and Schmidtie stood high up , looking into the interior of the mold through these heads . The metal inside lighted their faces , and as it rose higher in the mold they shielded themselves against the heat with their hands . Al poured until the metal was level with the top of the heads , but almost immediately its surface sank back into the heads as it shrunk in cooling . In order to replenish this loss in volume , Al " pumped " the mold , that is , he poured small amounts of additional steel at frequent intervals until the condition of the metal became stable . In the meantime each man near the mold had gone about his appointed task . One or two applied torches to vents in the mold and ignited the gas which streamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the mold to freeze and close off two heads , the handymen covered the remaining heads with charcoal which ignited and kept the surface of the metal liquid , the ladleman removed frozen metal from the rim of the nozzle and kept it clean ; each man completed his comparatively simple task , but together they accounted for a rather complicated series of operations . Other and smaller molds were poured until a stringy drip of slag from the nozzle told that the ladle was empty . The crew of men broke up , and the ladle was ignominiously returned to the furnaces , as dead and meaningless as a burned-out electric light bulb . I was deeply thrilled by the performance and from then on I determined that some day I should be a heat pourer and handle the huge ladle as smartly as Al did . In fact , in the short space of an hour , he had become a great hero in my eyes . I soon learned to know him better . He was a young American and had had the advantage of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern-making trade but had changed to the foundry . In his relaxed moments he had as much fun as anybody but on the floor he always appeared very much absorbed and serious . When actually pouring he looked at no one and noticed no one except the craneman and the Superintendent . I often spoke to him and asked him questions which he invariably answered completely and very kindly , but he always gave the impression that he was only half thinking of what he was saying . He was fair and tall and rangy and had a long stride . All his movements were direct , he wasted no motion . II Many months passed . Sehmidtie resigned rather suddenly , and Tony , the yard boss , took his place on the big floor I relieved Tony in the yard and spent the winter in the dark and cold , struggling with pig iron , chunks of scrap , and the frequently depressed spirits of the men . This position offered no opportunity to satisfy my great ambition , and one night in spring I summoned enough courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He chuckled . " May you learn ? More than that , you 'll have to . I might as well tell you that Al is to become my assistant and you 're to take his place on the ladle . " In due time there was attached to the yard gang a young college graduate , as awkward , bewildered and too eager to please as I had been the year before . The yard men laughed at him as they had at first laughed at me but before the first snow fell they had learned to respect him . He had learned the work , and I was spending the greater part of every night following the ladle with the Superintendent and listening to his talks on the technic of pouring different types of molds and of handling heats of various " temperaments . " The Superintendent made a deep and permanent impression upon me and stands out among all the men I have ever met . He was less than thirty years old and slight in build . At work , he wore shell-rimmed spectacles , much cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mind was always in a fever of activity . Most of the time he was thinking about his work and making plans to improve this or that operation in the night shift . But sometimes , especially towards morning , when he knew that the night 's work would be completed by its own momentum , he would launch with unabated vigor into discussions of sociology , religion , economies , politics , or anything at all There seemed no limit to his interests or the range of his questioning . He fairly vibrated with energy , but at the same time it was almost impossible to disconcert him . He understood his work and took it seriously and to him the firing of a core oven was as important and serious a matter as the selection of the site for a new automobile plant . His resources were equal to every emergency . On one occasion a heavy truck brought into the shop a load of gravel for the repairing of a concrete pit on the following morning . The dumping mechanism of the truck was found to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laborers had begun to shovel the gravel out over the side when the Superintendent came along . He whistled for a crane , secured chains to the truck , and in a moment the vehicle had been turned upside down in midair . The shop men , who were more used to this sort of thing , laughed uproariously at the discomfiture of the driver , who was still speechless with amazement when he drove away . I profited by the Superintendent 's instruction , and one evening he called me to the store room and issued to me a pair of asbestos leggings , a pair of goggles , and a shining new whistle . I was so excited I could hardly control myself and , after I had placed the articles in my locker , I went into a dark corner and gave way to a horrible ecstasy of trembling knees , chattering teeth , and twitching hands . An hour later I had donned the equipment and stood with Al on the platform high up beside the mold for a twenty-ton flywheel . My excitement had unaccountably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so near the ladle . Its great bulk seemed to fill all the space before me . I had never fully appreciated its size , just as you fail to appreciate the size of a passenger locomotive until you walk close by one in a terminal and find the very wheels as tall as yourself . Al " opened up " on the mold , and I felt the heat of the steel rush against my face . Below me , I saw the circle of white faces and noticed the men nodding to one another to look at me up on the platform . " Grab the lever and see how it feels , " Al directed , moving away from his position . " Hold it down or it will close of itself . " I took the lever from him . The graceful and slender device which he manipulated so easily with one hand was huge and clumsy in both of mine , like the pole of a wagon . I held it but felt silly because I did not know what to do with it . " Move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling faintly . I moved it an inch or two , and it was easy to move , much too easy , I thought , for the size of the lever . " Move it up and down farther and watch the stream . " I complied and saw that the stream became stronger and weaker . " Now let me have it again , " he said and completed the pouring of the flywheel . Soon we were pouring another mold and again I took the lever . " Finish this one yourself , " Al instructed me . " Hold it wide open till I yell ' Ease up . ' That means the metal is up inside almost to the cope , and if the stream 's got too much pressure it 'll strain the cope . When the steel 's up in the heads I 'll yell ' In the head ' and then slam the lever up and see if your nozzle closes the way it ought to . If it does , open up again and pour easy until you 're filled up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumbled and hissed and gurgled deep in the bottom of the mold . Al stood over one of the heads and watched the metal inside , and I fixed my eyes on his face which became brighter as the metal rose . He shielded his face with his hands , opened his lips , hesitated , then shouted " Ease up . " I raised the lever , and a dozen men cried " Hey " in warning and alarm . For an instant I was bewildered but immediately realized that instead of merely easing the stream I had shut it off entirely . Al sprang for the ladle but , in my eagerness to correct my error , I bore down on the lever too heavily so that the full stream of metal plunged into the gate at the very moment when the mold could least stand the shock . The men growled in protest and most of them stepped back a pace or two , although nothing happened except that small yellow flames appeared for an instant at the base of the heads . " Holy gee ! go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly . The Superintendent had been watching at some little distance while he talked to a ladleman and ate salted peanuts out of a bag in the pocket of his jacket . He came to our side of the mold and climbed on the platform . " What 's the big idea ? " he asked me calmly enough and without interrupting the eating of peanuts . " Are you trying to kill half a dozen men and ruin the place generally ? " He expected no answer , and 1 gave him none . I was still pouring , and the metal bad risen well up into the heads . " Now close her up and see if your stopper is working , " he continued . I complied . The stopper clicked into the nozzle , and without further mishap I filled up the heads and then " pumped " the mold until the casting had set . " Better take the ladle , Al , " the Super1 intendent directed , " the man 's had enough . " He had spoken the truth . I was worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by physical effort . " How do you feel ? " he asked me . " Fine , " I answered . " Yes , you look it , " he said laughing . Some of my enthusiasm for pouring had left me , at least for the time being , and if I learned nothing else that night I learned that pouring was not so easy as Al made it appear . My lessons continued regularly , and within six weeks I could pour successfully almost any kind of mold under the direction of Al and the Superintendent , but Al still spotted the nozzle over the gates . And then one night the Superintendent bade me try that . I whistled and waved my arms and turned the ladle this way and that until I was on edge from excitement , and still the nozzle was an inch to one side of the gate . " Do you know how long you have been fooling with that ? " the Superintendent asked me after everyone 's patience except his own was exhausted and the men were getting fidgety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I replied in desperation . " Two minutes and forty seconds , which is much too long . By this time the stopper may be stuck . It ought to be done in half a minute . " I finally succeeded in spotting the ladle and while I was pouring the mold I suggested to the Superintendent as respectfully as I could that his estimate of half a minute for spotting might be somewhat exaggerated . " Oh , is that so ? " he answered goodnaturedly . " Al , here is a young fellow who says it 's impossible to spot a ladle in thirty seconds . How about it ? " Al smiled a little . The Superintendent turned to me again . " Al will take the ladle now and you get out your watch and see how long it takes him . " Within twenty seconds after the ladle reached the next mold Al had a full stream running into the gate without unduly exerting himself . However , it was not long before I could spot a ladle in a shorter time than two minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds remained an unfulfilled ambition for a long time indeed . III During the following weeks I made steady progress but also many mistakes . On some nights I poured like a veteran . I spotted quickly , wasted no metal , judged the molds correctly , and left them " clean . " The men were interested in the improvement of my skill and on those nights they would indicate their approval after the ladle was empty by clapping their hands and nodding their heads . On other nights I spotted much too slowly and then poured the stream partly on the edge of the gate , and the hot metal splashed about . On those occasions the men 's interest gave way to irritation , and sometimes I could see a delegation waiting upon the Superintendent in the distance and I knew by their gesticulations that they were complaining about the heat of the spilled metal and the labor of picking it up and of loading it into charging boxes . About seven months after my first experience with the ladle 1 had become proficient enough to handle any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Superintendent and his staff one night during the lunch hour . " What you still need , " said the Superintendent , " is to work with a bad heat , really bad , I mean , the stopper burned off or something like that . Is n't it about time for us to have a wild night ? " he asked , turning to Tony . " We 've had no serious trouble for many months . " Tony was a nervous , impulsive little man and started perceptibly at the thought of something he clearly dreaded . Very likely the Superintendent had made the remark more to tease Tony than for any other reason . Just two nights later I opened a ladle on a small riveting frame mold . Nothing happened until the metal was well up in the heads and I slammed up the lever to try the stopper . " Try it again , " cried Al , " you 've got a leak . Clean her up , Joe . " I looked under the ladle and saw a quarter-inch stream of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladleman dug out the nozzle with his hook . I opened the nozzle wide in order to wash out any obstruction and then put all my strength under the lever and jerked it up . But the leak persisted . Three or four times I brought every ounce of strength to bear on the lever , but the stream continued . Then Al and I tried it together . Together we grasped the lever . " One " we counted , " two , " and on the count of " three " we slammed up the lever so that it quivered . But the stream was fuller , if anything , than it had been . " Never mind , " shouted the Superintendent . " Finish the job and then we 'll take it over the ingot . " In a few minutes the leaking nozzle hung over an ingot mold . The men gathered around , alert and waiting for developments . The Superintendent walked into the circle of faces and figures just as Al and I prepared to struggle with the rebellious stopper . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he calmly announced as he flung aside his jacket , adjusted a pair of goggles , and seized the lever . The stopper must have been on the point of falling to pieces , for he had tried it only once or twice when the trickle of steel suddenly became half the full stream . Thereupon the Superintendent stopped working with it and cast his eye rapidly over the floor . It was the first time I had seen him perturbed . The men watched him expectantly . " There ought to be fifteen ton left and that spider over there should take most of it , " he yelled and with whistle and arms he indicated a twelve-foot mold to the craneman and started to run toward it . Al and I followed . The crippled ladle was carried away from the ingot mold , and the stream of metal spattered to the floor and bounced back again , not like water but more eagerly like thousands of small , incandescent rubber balls . The flying metal lighted the dark foundry like a continuous display of fireworks . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another . In passing , the stream of metal fell into a small pool of water on the floor . Hiss ! Bang ! The water exploded into steam , and every man turned his back and pulled his shoulders up under his ears to protect himself from the steel and mud which flew in all directions as from the burst of a shell . The craneman maneuvered the ladle MOLTEN cleverly until the stream of metal flowed directly into the gate of the designated mold . There were pools of liquid steel all over the floor , and boards and wooden boxes were burning here and there where the metal had fallen upon or near them . We covered the spilled metal about the mold with a few shovelfuls of sand to protect ourselves from the heat and I opened the nozzle wide , while the men gathered again from the distances to which they had retreated . The mold was nearly filled when Tony shouted , " Look at that , " and pointed to a yellow flame which flickered at the base of one of the heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where I stood . I had learned long ago that a blue flame is a good flame and a yellow flame is a dangerous flame , because it indicates a portion of the mold which is weak and may give way . The flame grew brighter while Al and Tony hurried the men away from the place . Without further warning , the mold burst open beneath the head , a six-inch stream of metal rushed out , and the sticky , terribly hot liquid began to flow sluggishly but relentlessly out over the floor . Confusion threatened for a moment . Men shouted futile instructions and ran back and forth . The heat v. as unbearable , and in a moment I had to retire . Heat as ordinarily felt near a stove or small fire is uncomfortable and distressing but the heat from molten steel very quickly brings on sharp pains like a severe toothache or neuralgia . A sand box broke into flames eight feet away from the pool of metal . The Superintendent immediately had the situation in hand . " Sand , pia.9ek , sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching as near as he could , he began himself to throw sand on the pool of metal at the point nearest the ladle . Three or four men , emboldened by his courage , joined him until the flow in that direction was stemmed . In the meantime I had found long sheets of corrugated steel which I stood on end to protect my position at the ladle . I attempted to open the nozzle again to the full but found the lever so hot that I had to use my hat to protect my hands . Tony and three of his men dragged in a line of fire hose , and soon a powerful stream of water played upon the breach in the mold and dense clouds of steam rose above it . Gradually , after ten or fifteen minutes , the flow of metal began to freeze as the flow of blood from a wound is congealed by the application of cold water . A dozen men continued to throw sand on the steel which had run out on the floor while I poured sufficient metal into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the escaping metal had become a mere trickle and then stopped altogether , leaving an ugly mass of dark red steel clinging to the side of the mold . Thereupon Tony extinguished the fires on the floor and turned his hose for a moment upon the sheets of steel which protected me and which had become red hot . Then he drenched the steel on the floor in order to freeze it . Everyone felt relieved , the men paused to wipe perspiration from faces and necks with their red and blue handkerchiefs , and not long after there was a tired , heartless cheer as the slag dripped from the nozzle and the ladle was carried back toward the furnaces . " Well , " said the Superintendent as we slowly dragged our tired bodies to the office , " I told you the first night you were here that this foundry is no kindergarten . It 's seldom as bad as this , though ; we catch this thing only two or three times a year . " All this happened on a Wednesday night . Saturday morning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special fifteen-ton heat for two-thirty Sunday afternoon . I want you to come in and pour it . John Pintok will be in with one of his handymen and three laborers . Frank and his chainmen will take care of the ladle . You will be in charge and I expect you will have no trouble . "
