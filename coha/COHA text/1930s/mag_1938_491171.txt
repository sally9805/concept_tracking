MISS SATTERLEE 'S FE-MALE SEMINARY  --  for MIS ladies of respectable families ; references necessarily required  --  may not have stood upon as lofty an eminence as the engraving in the advertisement would lead a prospective parent to suppose ; but no possible doubt could be sustained of the loftiness of its moral standards , as witnessed by the six separate subjoined testimonials  --  unsolicited  --  and every one from a clergyman too . " We were gratified with the good order and decorum apparent everywhere , " said Rev. Philip Newman ; and the Rev. J. B. Cheeseman , A.M. , D.D. , of West Troy , maintained that " the gastronomic department is finely managed . " 13nt all the testimonials might be said to culminate in the statement of Rev. Isaac T. Duzenbury , late of Baden-Baden : " The peculiarenergy of the principal pervades every department of instruction and deportment , embracing four teachers , a number ( considering the small and select list of enrollment ) to embrace every subject , so that no pupil need be neglected . Many students of Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar of Christianity , and will go forth with great power ( rightly directed ) , to bless their future homes as well 11.9 the World . " In the morning parlor , Miss Satterlee , who still retained her maiden name for academic purposes , though she had been six months married , confronted her husband over the letter that had arrived by yesterday 's post . " Mr. Burbank , " she said decisively , " it 's impossible for you to go to New York . " Mr. Burbank , erstwhile professor of the classics  --  taught critically and not with a view to mere superficial acquaintance  --  composed the front . of his purple silk dressing gown and said , with something like a well-fed sigh , " My dear Grace , Mr. Peck said they 'd only hold the pianoforte till tomorrow . " He immersed the and of a cube of sugar in his coffee and sucked it gently . " You 've been saying for months we needed a new pianoforte . " " I know that , " said Miss Satter-lee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Butterworth Robinson will be here today or tomorrow to visit the seminary . Your presence is indispensable . " " They may not come today , " observed Mr. Burbank . " Besides , it might be a selling card if they saw a fine pianoforte in the drawing room . Mrs. Robinson is distinctly musical . " The peculiar energy of the principal became immediately apparent : " Mr. Burbank. it is impossible for you to go . I do n't deny the school is doing well , but it is not a success in the sense of Point Prospect Seminary . One student like a Miss Robinson would make us far more than socially impeccable . She would be worth fifty dollars to the tuition fee . " Mr. Burbank crunched the sugar and kissed the ends of his fingers . He nodded his head with dignity , " In a nutshell , my dear , it is a case of a Robinson or a pianoforte . " " Oh , Mr. Burbank ! " Miss Satter-lee cast upon him an admiring glance . " How terse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contained way . " Just the same , the pianoforte is something I hate to miss . So cheap . Not a mark on it , Mr , Peck assures me. ? rand ardor ' , harp stop and metallic plates . Used only for one season by a genteel family which has moved abroad . What shall I do ? " " Well , my dear , if you ca n't let me take the money in , you had better send someone else . " Of course , I saw that , " Miss Satterlee said somewhat crossly . " But whom can I send ? " Mr. Burbank finished wiping his fingers on his handkerchief and said , " I 'd suggest Avery Benedict . " " Mr. Benedict ? " " Yes . He is not  --  ah  --  exaetly a decoration . But I am sure he is honest ; he 's been here longer than I , you know . " " Yes . I wish he would look more presentable . I have spoken about it again and again , as delicately as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " agreed Mr. Burbank . " Why you keep him on is a mystery to me . " " He 's willing to take the salary , " Miss Satterlee said briefly . " Well , send him . He has nothing to do but hand the money over to Mr. Peck . The price is agreed on . " " If he catches the Witch , it 's possible the pianoforte will get here by tomorrow morning . Then , if the Robinsons come tomorrow afternoon , you may have both a pianoforte and a Robinson . Haw , haw , haw I " Mr. Burbank , having tried out his joke successfully , laughed heavily . Miss Satterlee gave a thin smile as she shook the silver bell on their tray . There were already moments when she found the repetition of Mr. Burbank 's little jokes somewhat beside the point . But she had to admit that to have a husband with so much presence was a valuable asset . Mr. Burbank always managed to soothe the most anxious mother . As for a visiting male parent. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a glass of wine . She looked at him indulgently as he rose to leave . " I must go to work , " he said playfully . Then he added , " But next term , my dear , we 'll have no more classes in the classics before ten-thirty . " He clicked the door firmly behind him . Miss Satterlee shook the bell more vigorously , and then reminded herself that it was supposed to be natural for the male to have an assertive personality . An Irish face with staring eyes stuck itself through the door and said , " Eh ? " " You should say , ' Yes , madam , ' Norah , " Miss Satterlee corrected her severely . " Inform Mr. Benedict that he is to come to me directly his class is over . " " Is him the man with the hole in his sleeve ? " " Never mind the hole , Norah . " " Oh , it 's terrible large . The poor man . You want him ? " " Yes . " Miss Satterlee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then . " T HE English language also , in its elements , as well as in its higher departments , receives more than ordinary notice  --  Mr. Benedict was the English teacher . Nobody thought a great . deal of him . He had been in the school for years , longer than the other members of the faculty ; probably , they thought , because he was too spineless to standup for himself with Miss Satterlee . The young ladies joked about his absent-mindedness and the outmoded cut of his coat . Certainly he did not make much of a figure . He walked with a stoop and his eyes usually were directed to the ground . His hair was prematurely gray , which led them to speak of him as poor old Mr. Benedict , but now and then they were surprised by his retorts . Then they called him a character , and for a few days were rather proud of his general shabbiness . The present retort , however , was hardly one of his best . He had been completing his lecture to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with his long fingers at the same time he was closing Doctor Leadbetter 's Guide to Epistolary Arts . Miss Thomson , a dashing miss with an engaging dark eye , lifted her hand to inquire if there were not one branch of letter writing that he had omitted . " Ah , Miss Thomson , which one , may I ask ? " " Love letters , " replied Miss Thomson , veiling her eyes demurely . Mr. Benedict , aware of the hushed smother or giggling , felt a slight flush in his thin cheeks . Oh , yes , " he said . " Love letters . " He glanced at the closed book . " There is a chapter on that branch of the art contained in this book , Miss Thomson . However , it has not seemed to me likely that either yourself or the various persons to whom you may address yourself would ever find Doctor Leadbetter 's resources adequate to your inclinations . " He debated a moment in himself whether he should call on Or Miss Thomson to prepare a five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised himself against it . Miss Satterlee would hardly have approved . He was conscious of the girls openly tittering and of Miss Thomson 's eye grown suddenly melting . It gave him a small sense of cheer as he turned from his desk . In fact , he felt almost racy . Class is dismissed , " he announced . He had no slightest premonition of the future ; not even when the underhousemaid stuck her head in the door and said , " You 're Misther Benedict , ai n't you , sir ? " " Yes . " " Her " ? angling her neck to point with the back of her head ? " wants to see you in the morning parlor . " " Miss Satterlee ? " " Yes , sir . " Mr. Benedict took his bodk under his arm and his threadbare hat in his hand and went downstairs . Norah hustled past him in the lower hall , throwing such an admiring glance over her shoulder that he wondered whether she had been listening outside the classroom , flung open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Benediet " ? Miss Satterlee did not ask him to sit down , but sat herself , in her stiff morning dress of brown silk , regarding him with rigid disapproval ? " what classes have you this morning ? " " Grammar at nine-thirty , " he said vaguely . " And then Class Three in the study of poetry at half past ten . " She was tapping the table with a sealed letter . " The grammar can be omitted today . I 'll take the poetry myself . " Mr. Benedict felt the small of his back chill electrically . Miss Satterlee speaking on Macbeth embarrassed his sense of what was fitting . And then , with a quirk , he remembered that today 's lecture began at Scene VII of Act I , and Lady Macbeth in brown silk crying : In his own reading he had developed a nice talent for omission of strong passages that was founded on his intimate knowledge of the lines . But would Miss Satterlee be sufficiently equipped ? Miss Satterlee stepped nobly up to his thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be informed of the place . Which play is it ? " " Macbeth , Miss Satterlee . " " Oh , yes , " she said , with the sublimity of ignorance . " Well , Mr. Benedict , it 's all very unfortunate , but I have to send someone in to New York with the money for that new pianoforte . Mr. Peck 's store on Broadway at Cortlandt Street . Mr. Peck will be expecting you , and the money is contained in this . You have only to give it to Mr. Peck  --  personally to Mr. Peck , please , Mr. Benedict . I should think , then , you could manage to be home by evening . In any case , please tell Mr. Peck that it would be a great favor to me if he could get the pianoforte off on the Witch this afternoon . " " Yes , ma'am . " Rather confused , he accepted the missive and stared at it blankly . " The address is written out , " she said testily . " And , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat you are wearing is not at all consonant with the standards of this seminary . The hole in the elbow of your right sleeve is a disgrace . " Mr. Benedict looked down . " It 's my old coat , " he explained . " I am trying to make the new one last . " " Thrift , " said Miss Satterlee , " is commendable , but it can be carried to unfortunate extremes . Hereafter I should prefer if you wore your best coat to class . We have , " she finished on a high note of expectation , " occasional visitors of distinction . It would be unfortunate if they saw your coat . " " Yes , I suppose it would , " said Mr. Benedict .. " I 'll wear the new one . " He brightened on his own behalf . " I 'll put it on before I go down to the boat . " Mr. Burbank , at this juncture , appeared , equipped for his daily work in his black frock coat . " Hello , Avery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trot , though , if you 're going to catch t.be morning boat . " Yes , indeed , " agreed Mr. Benedict , backing out of the room . Mr. Burbank stopped before his wife . " Poor old Avery , " he said . " I 'll bet it 's the first holiday he 's had in years . He must be all excited . " He laughed sardonically . " Who 's taking his classes ? " " I am , one of them . I 'm taking the Shakespeare arid letting the Grammar go , " said Miss Satterlee with satisfaction . elf - *JOT even Miss Sat- terlee 's comments on his old coat could dampen Mr. Benedict 's anticipation . It was a pleasant morning ; the sun shone warm ; a breeze drew up the Hudson Valley , smelling of salt water and blowing gently through his gray hair . He could not think when he had last been to New York . It did not matter when  --  to be handed a holiday in term-time was something thoroughly unique . Mr. Benedict became conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , " 1 hope I did n't hurt Miss Thomson 's feelings . " But then he remembered the melting expression of her dark eye . She was a bold young girl . Miss Satterlee had often commented acidly on her boldness ; on one occasion she had sent the girl to her room on bread and water for one whole day . Mr. Benedict could not quite remember the cause of the punishment , but he thought it was because Miss Thomson had been reading Venus and Adonis to Miss Bellknap . Walling through the sunlight , Mr. Benedict revised his opinion of Miss Thomson 's boldness . " High-spirited " was the word he substituted in his mind . He fairly trotted into the house of Mrs. Maddock , with whom he was boarding . Mrs. Maddock was a former maid of Miss Satterlee 's who had married a lazy farmer and now supported him on the small rent she drew from Mr. Benedict and the heavy washing she did for the seminary , and she had what Mr. Benedict regarded as a rather stilted opinion of Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her washtub amid the numerous little Maddocks , her jaw dropped . " Has the old besom thrown you out of the school ? " she asked . Mr. Benedict explained the circumstances with a beaming face . " Good luck to you , " said Mrs. Maddock . " But you 'll never make the boat if you stop to waste the day with me . " " What time does the Water Witch leave ? " he cried from the stairs . " In an hour ! " bawled Mrs. Maddock . " It 's five miles to Sing Sing , and you 'll never do that . " " Oh , dear , " said Mr. Benedict . He was searching for a pipe . " An hoer . " He looked confusedly at the calendar from the grocer 's in Sing Sing , which Mrs. Maddock annually tacked on his wall , and automatically noted the date : April 3 , 1332 , Tuesday . It came to him with great surprise that it was his birthday . He shouted the fact down to Mrs. Maddock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thirty-nine ! " Mr. Benedict called back happily . Mrs. Maddock felt a great uprising of human compassion in her ample breast . " The poor man , " she said ... . Larry , go down to the barn and tell your pa he 's to hitch the mare to the wagon and take Mr. Benedict to the pier . Right away . " " You 'll have double money for beer tonight if you get him on the boat , " she said to Mr. Maddock . Mr. Maddock , a small man of a scrawny appearance , whose only activities in life appeared . to be the chewing of tobacco and the begetting of children , yanked Mr. Benedict in over the wheel . " Hold tight , " he said determinedly , and larruped the mare a frenzied blow with the end of the lines . They started with a blast of wind , the little Mad- docks waving behind them and Mrs. Maddock craning from the kitchen window . Mr. Benedict caught his bat ( Continued on Page 40 ) in the nick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . immediately took it off again and held it on his knee to let the wind of their passage blow through his hair . " Do you think we 'll get there in lime ? " he asked Mr. Maddock . Mr. Maddock left off flogging , spat dexterously on the off wheel tire . " We 'll make it if I have to cut off her legs , one after another , " he said , and returned to his ministrations with the end of the lines . The mare 's machinery grumbled a good deal at her unusual efforts , but she came out above the river and went down the hill through Sing Sing village at a spanking rate . Even Mr. Maddock was surprised at her final burst of speed . He held back strongly , with a tight expression on his face , and said " Steady ! " like the driver of the mail coming down Breakneck Hill on an icy morning . But Mr. Benedict . was not at all worried . He looked out over the river at the end of the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haze against the western highlands . The Water Witch lay at her pier , a premonitory coil of smoke issuing from her smokestack . To the left , the gray wall of Sing Sing prison made a blot against the bright water . The sight brought Mr. Benedict . a sense of his own release , as though he were a convict of Miss Satterlee 's Seminary let out on good behavior , and as the mare 's hoofs pounded onto the planks , he laughed out loud . Mr. Maddock was so surprised to hear his wife 's boarder laugh that he only stared when Mr. Benedict pressed a ten-cent bill into his hand and asked him to drink a beer before he returned . The mare herself was no more speechless . He watched Mr. Benedict , but in hand , hurry on to the steamboat , heard the warning hoot from her whistle , and saw the gangplank swung aboard . He saw Mr. Benedict emerge on the front end of the upper deck and wave his old gray beaver hat . He waved a limp hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewheels threshed the shining water and swung the boat into the river . As she started downstream into the warm face of the breeze , Mr. Benedict lifted his head . Two or three gulls , loosing thin cries , swung offshore , and a flock of pigeons that had been routed from their road-scuffling made blue and white eddies over the village . In half an hour , Miss Satterlee would be walking into the second-floor classroom , Macbeth in her hand . But he was not responsible for that . He even felt a twinge of sympathy for Miss Satterlee and resolved to do her business as promptly as possible . Afterward he would have the whole mid part of the day to himself . He might go into the bookstores along Broadway and the Bowery . It was lucky , when he came to think of it , that he had had some cash on hand . Miss Satterlee had not mentioned the boat fare ; but , after all , as long Us he was getting a holiday , he did not mind spending the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of the river , the small boats sailing , a line of ten eanalboats coming upstream behind a thickset steamboat named the Henry Eckdord , which was pouring a great coil of smoke forward over her pilothouse , like a woman , Mr. Benedict thought , with her hair blown in her eyes  --  all these sights entered his conscious thoughts , distracting him . And then , for some reason he could not fathom , he recalled for the third time Miss Thomson 's eyes . " I 'm nearly forty , " he said wonderingly to himself . " What 's the matter with me ? " He had to rally himself , . and to do so , he felt for the letter in his pocket and drew it out . lair . Peck 's , Broadway and Cortlandt ; he noted the address mechanically , but gave no thought to it . It was considerate of Miss Sat-. terlee to have written it out to save him the trouble of memorizing the address . As he turned the letter over , he observed that the seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He realized at once that it would be quite possible for a bill or two , in the course of the journey , to work its way free of the folded paper into his pocket , and to avoid any misunderstanding 's arising from such an occurrence , he decided to count the money now , and then to count it again before handing it over to Mr. Peck . Carefully unfolding the sheet , he ran his eye over the stiff lines of Miss Satterlee 's handwriting until he saw the amount  --  one hundred and fifty dollars . Then he placed the paper over the . rail and proceeded to count the bills . He was delighted to find that they added up correctly . A small glow of satisfaction over his own foresight suffused him as he reached down for the sheet of note paper . It was no longer there . He glanced distractedly about and saw it half a dozen feet away , slowly sliding hark along the rail . He took a hurried pace after it and reached frantically . A veer in the breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thin fingers grasped was the free half of the seal , and the brittle wax , in the pressure of his anxious clasp , broke clean in two . The letter itself slid into space and fluttered with erratic deliberation over the side . A deathly sweat burst out on Mr. Benedict 's forehead . He stared helplessly at the wax in his hand , still bearing a fragment of Miss Satterlee 's crest , a leopard rampant . With a shudder , he let it fall and watched the paper strike the water , rise on the bow swell and disappear with a hideous glide under the churning buckets of the port wheel . " Was it valuable ? " asked a man 's voice . Mr. Benedict started nervously . Since the man , however , seemed to have a kind face , Mr. Benedict hesitantly explained his predicament . " Well , I should n't worry . All you 've got to do is to take the money to this music store and hand it over to the man . What did you say the name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Becket . Dear me , I 'm not sure what it was . " " I do n't recall a music store named Becket 's myself , " said the stranger . " Where was the store ? " " Somewhere on Broadway . That 's why I thought it was Becket , " said Mr. Benedict , brightening . " B for Broadway , B for Becket . But it do n't sound right when 1 say it . " " It will come to you in a minute or two , " said the stranger . " The way to remember a name is to forget it . " Mr. Benedict was not cheered by this dubious palatdox . He realized only that he had forgotten the name ; he had no confidence of remembering it . He fixed his eye on the walking beam above him and felt his heart beat up and down with as apparent fruitlessness . " Come , come , " said the stranger , sympathetically eying Mr. Benediet 's old-fashioned coat . " You do n't want to let a little thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lost the money . That would be something to worry about . " " No , no . I 've got the money all right . " Mr. Benedict felt a slight restoration of confidence . " I tell you what you do . When you land , you just start at Broadway and Park Row and walk south . Most of the music stores are along there , and as soon as you see the right name . you 'll recognize it . Not a doubt of it . Come along and have a glass of ale . Nothing like a morning glass to freshen a man 's mind . My name 's Porter , of North Salem . " Mr. Benedict felt a little faint and thought that a glass of ale might freshen him . It did . Afterward they went on deck and stood in the bow again and watched the river slowly widening before them . Mr. Porter seemed familiar with all its features . He pointed out the Palisades and a queer , stub-built , rather dirty-looking brig moving sluggishly toward them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , ai n't it ? Going all the way up to Hudson City . Probably it 's been round the world since it went down here , maybe two years ago . " Mr. Benedict said it was queer and looked with increased interest at the boat . Ho had read somewhere that such ships smelled bad , but he could not smell this one . It stayed well on the far side under the Palisades , looking small and gray , even in the bright sunlight . It seemed hardly to move . It was odd and romantic to think of all the long seas its bows had pressed against , now to come back to the fresh water df the Hudson . He noticed that Mr. Porter 's eye grew introspective . " That 's one mammal I 'll never be able to handle in my business , " he said . " What is your business , Mr. Porter ? " asked Mr. Benedict . " The circus and menagerie business . We control most of the circuses in this state . I 've often thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior , if we could handle one . " Mr. Benedict was stirred at the thought , but Mr. Porter quickly dropped the subject to come back to the river . They spent a pleasant hour and a half together before the boat brought the city into view . " Well , " said Mr. Porter , " good luck with your pianoforte . " He smiled at Mr. Benedict 's sober fate . " Cheer up . sir , " he said . " You 'll find the place easy enough . And if you do n't , you 've got the money anyway . It will only mean a few days ' delay to your principal . " Yes , that 's so , " Mr. Benedict replied , with a shiver . Mr. Porter , he realized , had never made the acquaintance of Miss Satterlee . But he was surprised how quickly that cold shiver left him . Perhaps It was the ale , perhaps the warm sunshine , perhaps the bustle of heavy wagons , shouting teamsters and city cries . // 341 Ordinarily , ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young daffodil , he thought . Yes , " daffodil " was the word for the tight waist and the yellow complexion . " Daffodil , " Mr. Benedict said aloud , and marched straight south into State Street . He felt considerably stimulated . It was no doubt a problem that he was confronted with , but he would solve it . It seemed to him , however , that he might have had a little too much ale , for he was not very well accustomed to it , and that a little walk would do him good . He would walk for an hour , he told himself , seeing whatever came in his way . Then , with his mind refreshed , he would try Broadway again , and without any doubt the name would leap into his mind . He was not tempted by the Battery or Castle Carden . He decided he would much rather walk along the wharves . Mr. Benedict , like many shy people , enjoyed walking in a crowd . In that way he could feel himself one with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to it , and pick out receptive faces to nod to . It was like a game ; one point when he got a nod back , two if he got a smile . Mr. Benedict got several smiles . He had crossed Whitehall Street and turned up Water Street . Two blocks brought him out on the end of Coenties Slip , where he paused for a moment to look at the canalboats in the basin . He had read pieces in temperance papers about canallers ; how coarse a life they lived , and how they hired the women who lived with them , and were almost continually drunk . But the stout fellow mending his harness acted sober enough , and the girl hanging out wash on the line stretched from two poles at either cabin of the boat looked fresh and healthy . Her wash , loo , looked remarkably clean . A great many boats had their wash out , so that they looked like ships coming from a long voyage with their pennants hung from stem to stern . Side by side , red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corset , blue bird's-eye handkerchiefs  --  they made a flutter of color over the fleet . " Looking at the boats , uncle ? " The fat man was testing his stitches with a hearty pull of thick arms across his chest . " Yes , I was , " said Mr. Benedict . " Ever seen a canalboat afore ? " " Not close to , " said Mr. Benedict . " I 've seen them on the river , naturally . " " Maybe you 'd like to look at the inside of one ? " " I should like to immensely ! " " Well , come on board . " The fat man did not move . . . . " Nelly , give the gent a hand . The plank 's kind of sway-like . " The girl left her wash and came up to Mr. Benedict smilingly . Her hand on his wrist was solidly reassuring . " The cabin 's hardly cleared up , " she apologized . " But if you 'd like to see it , it 's all right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat man . " Mind your head , sir , " said Nelly , vanishing down the steep narrow steps and showing a good round of bare leg as she did so . Mr. Benedict ducked his head in the nick of time and found himself in the smallest kind of a room . It looked very neat , with a small iron stove , two chairs , a hinged table and 1 the walls all covered with cupboards . There seemed a specially designed spot for everything in it . " It 's awfully nice , is n't it ? " said Mr. Benedict . " It 's a nice enough cabin , " the girl said , letting down the table to show Mr. Benedict how it worked . " Luke painted it for me on the way down from Albany . I kind of always wanted to work in a rose-pink cabin . " " It 's a pretty color , " said Mr. Benedict . " I like it , " she admitted with a heavily suppressed air of satisfaction . " I have n't got many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , it takes time to get things started . " " Yes , " said Mr. Benedict , forgetting to make allowance for the lower ceiling under the side and bumping his head in consequence . Rubbing it surreptitiously , he said . " I think I 'd enjoy living on a canalboat . " " Would you , now ? " The fat man was leaning over the hatchway on his folded arms , his round face looking down like one of the old Olympians examining the world and picking out a place to have some fun in . " Why ? " " Wiry , ' ' said Mr. Benedict. , " it must be pleasant , just going back and forth through the country . " " It 's all right going through the country , if it ai n't raining or snowing . Or if the sun ai n't out , or if the wind ai n't blowing , so you wonder if your towline 's going to hold . The hugs get bad if it 's hot , too  --  mosquitoes , I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him and a horsefly in here is bad business . I generally have to get into hed to avoid being killed . Maybe you 'd like to see where we sleep ? " Mr. Benedict could n't help smiling at the notion of the fat boater and a horsefly together in the tiny cabin , but he was curious to see how one slept in the place . The girl lifted a curtain and showed him a bunk set against the rear wall in the low space under the rudder deck . " Me and Luke have this one . The steersman has the other one . The driver boys sleep with the horses . " She raised a corner of the old patchwork quilt casually to show a brand-new blanket underneath . Mr. Benedict smiled at the gesture . " Et 's a beautiful blanket. , " he said dutifully . Luke bought it to Lent 's store yesterday . On William Street . " she said in an offhand sort of way . " Your husband must be fond of you , " Mr. Benedict observed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now what 's he up to ? " She tilted her head . Luke had disappeared from the hatch . They heard him on deck , bawling to a man on the wharf . " Let 's go up , " said Nelly . She went ahead of him up the steep little steps , barefooted and spry as a bird . On deck they found Luke listening to a small fellow in a seaman 's hat , who was talking in is voice loud enough to be heard over the entire fleet . " Yeah . They got kind of an auction going on on the ship . Anybody can go onto it . I guess the Owners has gone out of business or something . You bettor come along . " Luke said in an equally loud voice , " Well , I 'm coming . . . . Hey , Nelly , you want to come ? " " I ai n't hardly decent , " she said . " Put your shoes on . " " All right . " She flashed down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke persuading Mr. Benedict to come along , and Mr. Benedict agreeing in a willing daze . Mr. Benedict found his arm seized in Luke 's paw and felt Nelly take the other arm . Behind them , people were popping up out of boats and scrambling over the complicated system of planks that connected even the farthest one to the wharf . " Friend of mine , " Luke was explaining . " Visiting Nelly on the boat . This here 's Jeff McCarthy . " " Mr. McCarthy , I want you to be acquainted with Mr. Benedict. , " Nelly said correctly . She had found time to put on 11 bonnet , and the ribbons dressed her face nicely . Mr. Benedict went with her and Luke up Front Street , while Jeff McCarthy urged them on from ahead and fifteen or twenty canallers hurried in their wake . He felt a little muddled . The pink and yellow faces of the buildings , with their steep brown roofs sloping to the street , confronted his eyes with glancing windowpanes . Over his head the bowsprits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheels and the clop of horses on the cobbles , the shouts of men and the high , sky-tossed crying of the gulls rang in his ears . The ships all carried the smell of the sea , a little acrid , queerly distinguishable from the or raker harbor water . He could not sort his thoughts at all , hat Nelly 's firm young arm in his seemed to communicate a lighthearted confidence . Mr. Benedict had no very clear view of the boat until he found himself standing well up front , close to an auctioneer who was pounding the top of an empty hogshead . The auctioneer had a glib quick voice . He was like a professor lecturing his pupils . Mr. Benedict felt like a student in his first days at Columbia College . " This genuine Madagascan lion was purchased by the owners at a liberal expense . It is a fine male ; I repeat , a splendid male specimen . You 'll seldom see one in such fat condition after the voyage over . The gentleman in the yellow neckcloth makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no manes . He doubts m3 , statement that it is a young and healthy specimen . I offer him Let him examine the lion 's mouth . 1 offer him . " Retreat of the yellow-neckelothed gentleman amid derisory hi tighter . " A hundred and thirty dollars I am bid ! One hundred and thirty dollars ! Anybody make it one hundred and forty dollars ? Hundred and forty dollars ? Has n't anybody a hundred and forty dollars for this fine specimen of Leo Africanus ? " Mechanically , Mr. Benedict started to raise his hand . " Huh ! I am bid a hundred and forty dollars ! Any bids ? A hundred and forty dollars ' Going ! Going ! One hundred and forty ! Gone ! Sold to the gentleman in the old-fashioned coat ! " His eyes met Mr. Benediers . " You 'll have to get him off the wharf by five o'clock . Customhouse orders . " Mr. Benedict understood that the auctioneer had been referring to his coat , when he said " Old-fashioned . " IL was his best coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt Nelly squeeze his arm and , glancing sidewise at her upturned face , he found her staring at . him with awed admiration . " Oh , Mr. Benedict ! I think you 're wonderful . " A R. BENEDICT stared at Nelly . .1 . VI " But I did n't ? " His voiee eluded him . Before he could recapture his powers of speech , however , Luke burst through the crowd with a kind of kite-tail of excited canallers in his wake . " Just walked right in and bought a lion ! " Nelly said , " He did n't even say anything . He just lifted his hand . " " Honest to God ! " Luke said , seizing Mr. Benedict 's hand . " You did n't lift it more'n a fraction . " But I do n't want a lion , " Mr. Benedict said feebly . " I did n't mean to buy it . Its not my money . " " Beg pardon . " A young , smartly dressed fellow shoved his way up to Mr. Benedict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me the money . The receipt 's all made out except the name . " " But I have n't any money ! Not of my own ! " expostulated Mr. Benedict . At least not here . I 've got some in the hank . I mean , I could pay part of the price . " " Sorry . We ca n't accept drafts at an auction . " The young man dropped a supercilious glance at Mr. Benedict 's rather scuffed boots . " I do n't want to make any trouble . There 's a constable down the wharf , " he added casually . Panic seized Mr. Benedict so obviously that the auctioneer 's assistant knew he had judged his man correctly . Luke . also , innocently , added to Mr. Benedict 's fright . " Do they put you in jail ? " " Depends on the magistrate . " said the assistant in a bored voice . " He 'd be held overnight in the city prison , anyway . " Mr. Benedict shuddered . He thought of Miss Satterlee . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced desperately round . But there was no escape . With a shaking hand , he reached for his wallet . The canallers guffawed , and Luke said , " He 's a cute article ! He had the little twerp figuring he did n't have no money . . . ? You had me fooled too . " Mr. Benedict tried to smile . " Did I ? " " Honest . " The assistant counted the bills , said , " You 've got to take him away by five o'clock , remember , " and turned on his heel . Mr. Benedict 4t stood there . " What you going to do with the animal ? " Luke asked curiously . " I do n't know . " " Well , you ca n't leave him here . " Mr. Benedict had nothing to say . " Where do you live ? " " Five miles out of Sing Sing , " said Mr. Benedict , at Miss Sattorlee 's Female Seminary . " Luke whistled . " It 'll cost you plenty to cart him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Benedict said dismally . The deck seemed to be swaying under him . " I 'm going to be sick , " he thought . Then Nelly gave his arm a squeeze and said , " Do n't our tow have to stop at Sing Sing , Luke ? " " We 're picking up Lance 's boat . " Luke rubbed the top of his head . " We could tie the crate on top of the stable . We can get it off all right . " Mr. Benedict said , " It will be a lot of trouble . " " Hell , no . I 'm pleased to do it . I 've carried hogs and cattle , but I never carried no lion . It wo n't cost you a. cent . " " We 'd better get a carter to take him to your boat , " said Mr. Benedict . Luke ejected a long spit along the deck of the ship . " Hey , . Jeff ! Round up some of the boys and help us lug this crate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of superior forces , as Nelly pulled him gently back and a dozen volunteers came forward . Jeff McCarthy seemed to take over the proceedings . He found two poles and some rope aboard the ship . The crate was lashed to the poles . Three men laid hold of each free end , the crate swung up unsteadily and began a rocking progress down the gangplank . " Get him on your shoulders , boys ! " yelled McCarthy . " Get in step and he 'll ride easy ! Hup ! Hup ! " Luke glanced back . " You come along after us , " he said to Mr. Benedict . On the dock , the eanallers began stamping their feet to get the step . The lion made a faint sound , a kind of moan , and crouched down on his belly , legs spread-eagled . Bringing up the rear , with Nelly still holding onto his arm , Mr. Benedict looked at the beast for the first time . He thought the lion looked sick . It was n't so big an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't think it looked much like a king of beasts . The brown coat seemed rather dull . In fact , the hide even showed bare in places . " Dear me , " said Mr. Benedict . " I wonder if it 's got the mange . " " Luke has a good mange medicine , " Nelly said helpfully . " You just rub it on twice a day for a week , and it stops . " She was walking with a little bounce in each step . Mr. Benedict thought she must be enjoying herself . " I 'll get . Luke to give you a bottle , " she said . " He 'd be glad to . " " Thank you . " She looked up at him . " What 's the matter , Mr. Benedict ? Ai n't you having a good time ? " " Oh , yes . " He did not sound very convincing , even to himself . But Nelly seemed not to hear him . He began to wonder what in the world he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eh ? " " I asked you what a person fed a lion on ? " " Why , " said Mr. Benedict , " meat , I suppose . They 're carnivore . Their family is felidae . " " Felidae ? " " Yes , felidae , feline , cats . " " Feline , " exclaimed Nelly . " There was a girl called me that once . I got Luke away from her , you see . Her name was Arabella Peck , but she did n't look as good as her name sounded , I tell you . ' ' " Peek ! " Mr. Benedict 's cry was like a wounded loon 's . Peck ! It was the name of the pianoforte man . He felt elated at having remembered it . He thought perhaps he could run sip to Broadway and find the place and explain to Mr. Peck . He asked , " When does the boat leave ? " " The tow ? " asked Nelly . " In about an hour . " " I 'd have time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been trying to recall all morning . " Oh , " she said . Then she gave a little gasp and pulled him forward . " We 'd better see what 's happening . " Mr. Benedict realized that a terrific hullabaloo had broken out round the corner . He remembered in a dim way that Jeff McCarthy had been shouting all along , " Here comes the lion ! Look out for the lion ! Hold your bosses ! Hold your bosses ! " That voice had ceased . Profanity mingled with the whinnying of horses . Just as he and Nelly reached the corner into Front Street , a queer , high , moaning sound became audible . It ended in a sudden cough , like a man suffering from catarrh . It was the lion . Something had upset it . It stood in the cage , lashing its tail and glaring at a team of heavy black horses . The horses were dancing in their harness while the teamster on the seat whipsawed desperately on the lines and cursed urgently . Just . as Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wagon , loaded high with kegs , whipped after them like a feather . The teamster was pitched back on his seat and the whole rear tier of kegs shifted , tottered and came crashing down on the pebbles . They made a sound like thunder all along the street . People stuck their heads out of windows . Other teamsters rushed to startled horses . A second wagon took after the first . In its cage , the lion stiffened . The tail became a rod . It raised its head and roared . For an instant , in Mr. Benedict 's astonished sight , the entire water front seemed to freeze  --  all except the runaway team . Far in the direction of Whitehall , kegs could still be heard occasionally crashing to the street like some academic exercise for artillery . But then the lion 's roar came echoing off the brick walls . Men with confidence in their teams sprang to their heads too late . Horses that had been steadfast against the outlandish lion smell could not withstand its jungle roar . Half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hub crashed io huh . A light chaise containing a stout , mercantile-appearing personage in a dark green coat and a shiny high bat went past Mr. Benedict and Nelly like a blown leaf behind a tugging , overfat and lathered mare . A black coachman in dark red livery , whom rolled eyes looked even wilder than the mare 's , braced himself in a spasm of helplessness . They took the corner into Front Street , but the mare , unwilling to waste an inch of ground , heedless of traffic and pedestrian laws , cut up on the footwalk . Mr. Benediei never knew what became of her . lie had a momentary vision of a varnished wheel solemnly rolling across the street . He heard a confusion of uplifted voices . Then the ever-present Nelly was tugging at his sleeve . " I think we 'd better got away from here , Mr. Benedict . " He looked bark for the eanallers and the lion . Under McCarthy 's direction , they were moving smartly , and practically unnoticed , along the dock . They swayed aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable roof and stood back , sweaty-Faced , to stare at the lion with a kind of holy awe . The lion returned them look for look . Then again its tail stiffened , and McCarthy said , " It clone that just afore it made that noise . " " Throw a canvas over it , " said Luke . Willing hands laid hold of one of the pit covers and draped it over the crate . Tho lion 's voice broke off at the beginning of its roar . Luke wiped his brow and turned to meet Mr. Benedict , whom Nelly , breathing fast , was at that moment hurrying onto the boat . " aepers , Mr , Benedict , " he said . " That 's quite an animal you bought . " " It was the noise done the damage , " McCarthy observed . " There would n't have been no trouble except for that team with the load of kegs . I told the twerp to hold his bosses too . ' ' Luke said , " You bezahors better get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pella 47 ) notice the crate , now it 's covered . Maybe the tow will make up before they catch on . " The canallers said maybe it would . " I 'd offer you some drinks , " said Luke , " only I do n't want to take a chance of my friend Benedict getting arrested for the damages . " He grinned . " There 'd be quite some . " They filed off the boat , casting admiring glances at Mr. Benedict , who dazedly watched their departure . " I 'm much obliged to you , " he said to McCarthy . The little man gave a brown-toothed grin . " Ai n't seen such a time in New York since I used to run with Fire Company Number Five , " he said . " I 'm pleased to have met you , mister . " Mr. Benedict shook hands and turned to Luke . If I 've got time , " he said , " I 'd like to go up to Broadway and look for that pianoforte man . I 've remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange stare . " Say , " he said , " do n't you realize there must have been three or four hundred dollars ' worth of damage done out there , even if nobody got killed ? And it ai n't stopped yet . Pretty soon somebody 's going to remember how this business happened , and then , if you 're around , unless you 've got an awful pile of money , you 're going to have a bad time . " He caught Mr. Benedict hard by the shoulders and forced him down the steps to the cabin . " I can keep you out of sight , " Luke said , " but . I hope that fool lion keeps his mouth shut . " Mr. Benedict was made faint by the sudden dizzy hammering of his heart . He realized that what Luke said was absolutely true . He was legally liable for every broken keg , for every damaged horse , for the wheel that . had come off that chaise  --  heaven knew what had happened to the mercantile old gentleman . Nelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders . " Do n't worry . The Commerce is coming in for us and we 're the first boat in the tow . " She giggled . " But it surely was exciting , was n't it ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Benedict . " My , you were wonderful , Mr. Benedict . I never seen anybody act so calm . " " Calm , " said Mr. Benedict . Be shivered , then he started up as feet pounded overhead . " What 's that ? " " Do n't worry . They 're tying onto us . " Waves slapped the hull of the boat . She shifted sluggishly . Through the cabin windows Mr. Benedict saw a pair of legs , hanging over the end of the dock , pass slowly . " We 're clear , " said Nelly , after a moment . " We 're out in the river and they 've brought out the next boat . We 'll be going in a little while . " Mr. Benedict 's spirits lifted a little . He summoned courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck , " said Nelly . " But you can look through the window . Here 's a chair to stand on . " He mounted the chair unsteadily , while she braced him with a strong and friendly hand . The slip looked to be well out over the water . Already three boats were in line . " 1 think we 're going to get away , " he said nervously . " Surely . " ? After a moment he got down and leaned himself against the wall . Nelly stared back at him . They waited until Luke suddenly squeezed down through the hatchway like a kind of compressible walrus . " We done it , " he said . " There 's a mess of people running all over Front Street , looking for us . . . Nelly , where is the bottle ? Hai n't you sense enough to leave it out ? Get it . Get it in a hurry . " Ho eased himself onto a chair . " Did n't she give you nothing either ? Mat a girl ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too , " Mr. Benedict took a last look through the window . The canalboat was moving . Black smoke drifted past from the tugboat Commerce . The river was blue round them . Behind , one after another , came the canalboats , like dull docile animals . In the bow of their own , the lion , under the canvas , was silent as the grave . " I guess we 're safe , " he said . Luke was pouring whisky into two glasses . It was a local product , made in Rome , New York . Mr. Benedict felt the need of something , and he found the smell of the whisky not unpleasant . He accepted it glass . Luke said , a little self-consciously , " Here 's health and wealth . " " Thank you , " said Mr. Benedict . " To you both . " He made a still small bow to Nelly , who beamed on him . He tilted his small glass and swallowed . The liquor hit him somewhere under the wishbone . He felt as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a gun-shy dog . Luke watched him complacently . " This stuff gets there the first try . Does the same with me , only you ca n't see it on account of all this fat between it and you . " Mr. Benedict agreed , had another swallow , and recoiled . It was extraordinary . He smiled uncertainly at Nelly . but she was n't minding him . She was bent down at the tittle stove , her thin calico dress stretching over her supple back , the hem of the skirt lifting a little behind . Mr. Benedict felt himself uplifted . Sing Sing ; he reflected , was a long way off . Luke 's voice , for that matter , sounded a long way off : " Well , mister . Now you 've got him , what . do you aim to do with that there lion ? " Mr. Benediet 's own voice sounded a long way oil also : " Lion ? Lion . Oh , yes , the lion . Why , Luke , I have n't really thought it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to eat , maybe . " Luke eyed him dubiously . He had had moments of thinking Mr. Benedict a little twirly in the head . Then he gave you the idea he was a cool customer . But a man could n't help liking him , either . " Say , Mr. Benedict . Maybe you 'd like a chaser with that whisky . " " Chaser ? " echoed Mr. Benedict . " Oh , no , thank you . I find the whisky ample . " Wordlessly he extended his empty glass . And , wordlessly , Luke filled it .
