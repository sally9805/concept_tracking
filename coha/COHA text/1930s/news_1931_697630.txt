txt Controversy between the Senate and President Hoover and a deadlock which long bore the menace of an extra session of Congress ended today when the Senate and House adopted the Interior Department bill , carrying an appropriation of 520,000,000 for loans for farm rehabilitation , inclusive of food supplies for humans , and the President signed the measure . The President signed the bill containing the compromise between his demands and those of the Democrats and insurgent Republicans at 5:30 P. M. , soon after the Senate , by a vote of 67 to 15 , had ended its sixday opposition to the report of the House and Senate conferees favoring the amendment to the Interior Department bill which provided for the S20,000,000 loan appropriation . The House had previously accepted the conference report by a viva voce vote . There was no formality at the White House when the President appended his signature to the measure that has caused one of the most acrimonious controversies of his ad-ministration , Borah Leads Forlorn Hope . But the victory of the compromise forces was not achieved without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revolt , led the hostile battalions in a last desperate sortie and in one of the most impassioned and moving speeches of his career appealed for government assistance for those unable to obtain loans under the terms of the compromise . With him at the front of the fray were Senators Johnson and Couzens , Republicans , who denounced the relief plan and Senator Barkley , Democrat , of Kentucky . The latter attacked the leadership of his own party for acceding to the demands of the administration and scathingly assailed the attitude of the President toward relief for the hungry victims of the drought . Senator Borah pictured the sufferings of the starving , depicted alleged neglect of the Red Cross to provide medicines for the sick and declared the attitude of the administration was to avoid placing any burdens on th ' heavy income tax payers .. The policy of the administration , he exclaimed , was that " only those who have security are entitled to live . " Senator eouzens , almost equally eloquent , said that the farmer must admit himself a pauper before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Secretary of Agriculture were more rigid than similar practices under the Russian Government . Hostile Forces in Minority . L:ut desp1te the die-'reaf front of the rebellious Democrats and insurgent Republicans , it was apparent when the debate was resumed that they had lost support as the result of Secretary Hyde 's statement that loans under the relief plan could be made for food . The foes of the compromise dwindled finally from thirty , their strength on Friday , to half that number , with eight Republicans , six Democrats and one Farmer-Laborite finally voting against the amendment . The vote sustained the leadership of Senator Robinson and in the opinion of Republican leaders removes the chief danger of an extra session . Thirty-six Republicans and thirty-one Democrats supported the compromise amendment . Nevertheless , both insurgent Democrats and Republicans maintain , ' Senator Borah 's speech left the door open for a renewal of the demand for a direct Federal appropriation for the distressed in the drought area before the session ends on March 4 . Senator Borah began by saying that fox At ; Pat 118 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or another for the relief of those unable to take care of themselves because of drought , flood or earthquake . Never up to this time in any debate had there been any reference to a dole . There must be some reason back of what he called an effort to convince the American people that a dole system was being sought . He did not believe it was sincere and thought the falsity of it was recognized . He particularly protested against an attempt to establish a " clear demarcation in the treatment upon the part of the government between the man who has security and the man who has no security . " " The life of those who have no security , " he exclaimed , " Is as sacred as the life of those who have security , and ought to be so regarded by the people of the United States and by the government of the United States . " Questions Report of Hoover Agent , Denouncing what he termed a policy of refusing all government help to those who had no security and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not adequately caring for the hungry . Referring to a report of an agent of the President that in sixteen counties in Arkansas , which he covered by airplane , he found the people adequately cared for , Senator Borah asked how a man flying over a number of counties and several States in three days could learn about " the actual grinding suffering of those who are hudled in their homes and are not in a position or condition to meet the , delegate from Washington and explain their condition . " The Idaho Senator next read a let : . ter from a District of Columbia philanthropist who said he saw in Kentucky " little children picking up grains of corn dropped from the mouths of horses and eating them , " and exclaimed : " A few kernels of corn for the hungry child , the drippings from the mouth of the merciful mule . " He read newspaper accounts to show that pellagra and smallpox were breaking out in the drought-stricken States and that Dr. William Kleine , Red Cross medical director , had told Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply medicine and medical services to drought sufferers . Asks What Lincoln Would Do . " Who is going to furnish it ? " he asked . " Is the government of the United States unconcerned ? We have just passed another period of paying lip service to the memory of Abraham Lincoln . Can any one imagine Mr. Lincoln saying , ' You people who have security may be helped , may have aid , but you people who have no security , unless charity happens to find you and take care of you , may die . ' " My friends , that is precisely what will happen if they have no security and must depend upon those charitable organizations , particularly the Red Cross . Hundreds and thousands of them will lose their lives or become so afflicted that life will be worth very little to them in the future . " Those people are going to suffer beyond the power of human language to portray , he cried- in his peroration . " I can not vote for a proposition which embodies as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to live . " Senator Glenn of Illinois asked whether any of the twenty-one States in the drought area " has made any appropriation to relieve its own people . " " Mr. President , " retorted Senator Borah , " I do not care two cents whether they have or not.  --  When we undertook to help a great municipality in Massachusetts , did we ask Massachusetts to exhaust her re-sources ? " When we undertook to aid the people who were suffering in California from an earthquake , did we say to the great State of California , ' Exhaust your resources ' ? When did these picayunish technical objections first appear with reference to feeding the hungry in the United States ? They appeared when the income tax payers became afraid of an increase in taxes . " Barkley Condemns His Party Leader . Senator Barkley attacked the administration , the leadership of Senator Robinson and Congress itself for obtaining an interpretation of the compromise from the administration . He thought it was better to have an extra session than to pass rapidly , to avoid such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had favored a one per cent reduction in income taxes and thereby aided the rich and now was opposed to helping those who needed Federal assistance the most . " We have witnessed within the last two or three days the most humiliating spectacle that could be brought about in an intelligent legislative body , " he exclaimed . " Either through our own stupidity or dishonesty , we were unwilling to write into a law which we are framing what we meant . We were forced to resort to the humiliating spectacle of passing a resolution and asking a Cabinet member to tell us what we want to do . We have been asked to sign on the dotted line because we desire to adjourn , because we desire for nine months to leave the American people at the mercy of some bureaucrat who has already misinterpreted the laws we have passed for the benefit of the American people . " I am reliably informed that the Cabinet member whose interpretation we asked in advance , whose assistance vie asked by resolution in order that we might interpret our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $45,000,000 which we appropriated not $20.000,000 would ever go to the American farmers . Whether he did or did not make the statement , I am satisfied it is true , because he has thrown around the loaning of the fund such brutal , such harsh , such arbitrary restrictions that the average farmer who needs the money will never receive it . " I wish that William Shakespeare might come back to life and write another ' Merchant of Venice . ' If he did so , he would change the name of Shylock to Uncle Sam . Attacks Big Taxpayers . " I am unwilling to give approval to the selfish and narrow and bigoted and arrogant theory that the great Government of the United States owes a greater obligation to a man who has property than it owes to a man who has no property . That is the question which confronts us . " We are told that somebody 's face must be saved . Well , I am not interested in anybody 's face . I have served in the House , I have served in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces around the White House , and I am prepared to say that all the political faces in Washington are not worth saving compared to the pallid face of a single hungry woman or child in Arkansas , Texas , West Vir7 grinia or Kentucky .. " We have gone forth as a lion and put amendments on Hpuse bills , and then we have crawled- back like the lamb , every time yielding because we did not have the courage of our convictions , because we were too craven to stand up here and assert to the end ot the row ' .. that the Senate is a , part of the government . . A/1 through there has heena deliberate ' and designed effort to discredit this body . Not only have certain branches of the government been used to that end but a great charitable institution has been used for the purpose of undertaking to discredit the Senate . " Then the Senator referred to Senator Robinson 's program for accord with the Republicans and went on : " After that action , I felt that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that we had the courage to stand by it . But it turns out that we are like the master 's dog who rushes to the front gate , rears up on its legs and barks and then when some opposition comes in his direction tucks in his tail and goes under the floor . We are still barking , but we are under the floor just the same . " Senate Vote on Conference Report . The Senate vote on the conference report was : FOR THE REPORT-67 . Republicans-36 .

AGAINST THE REPORT  --  Blaine , Brook-1 FOR THE REPORT , BUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Couzens . Senator Couzens compared the government 's treatment of income taxpayers and that accorded to poor farmers by Secretary Hyde in his administration of the $45,000,000 seed loan . " There is no publicity for the income tax returns of the rich taxpayer , " he said , " but every sort of publicity is given the financial condition of the poor farmer . " He read the " Confession of Pauperism " which , he said , the Department of Agriculture was requiring the farmer to sign before he could obtain a loan under the seed appropriation act . Not only must he make such an affidavit but must show it to a committee of neighbors and then to a county committee who must " certify to his abject and impoverished condition . " " Not only that , " the Senator added , " but the government charges interest at the rate of o per cent on the loan and this interest is deducted from the principal in advance .

" Johnson Recalls California Quake . " I want to emphasize that I can- ' not by my vote assist in establishing an infamous policy such as is endeavored to be foisted upon Congress today in this report , " said Senator Johnson . " I once went through a California disaster . I went through a time when the earth rocked under us , and when people in the city from which I came went to the public squares of the city , where they were hungry , where they were not clad , where they were cold , where they were suffering and where disease hung over them . " When the United States Government came to the rescue of those people , when it fed them and when it clothed them during that period , no man living then in that disaster thought of a dole , of security for relief expenditures . None thought , the most hardened would not have dared to suggest , a policy would ever be adopted on the part of our government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed its destitute and its hungry citizens , and when it would decline to succor those who needed succor . Such a policy , openly declared now , I decline to subscribe to . " " I shall vote for the so-called compromise , " stated Senator Walsh of Massachusetts , " solely because the attitude of the administration and the other branch of Congress makes impossible a more liberal plan . Even this miserable compromise has been reluctantly consented to by those who are at present in control of the treasury . It has taken weeks of long and protracted discussion , debates and threats to get a few million dollars appropriated for the homeless and hungry , while in a few seconds we appropriate hundreds of millions of dollars for battleships and monumental buildings . Surely there must be a limit to the patience of our people when measures that affect their welfare are so subordinated and minimized . " To my mind the provisions of this compromise are analagous to crumbs falling from the tables of the rich . The poor must take the crumbs or suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must furnish security before the crumbs are distributed to them , and they must be prepared to pay back the price of the crumbs to the Federal Treasury . at an early date .

In signing the Interior Department bill President Hoover dispensed with the usual formality of sending the measure to the . Budget Bureau and the Interior Department for their perusal and approval .

This was the first to reach the President of the nine regular supply bills which must be passed before March 4 . The interior bill carries a total of almost $90,000,000 , of which more than $20,000,000 will be available immediately for public improvements in government projects in the West . In the House Representative Cramton presented for passage the Interior Department bill as approved by the conferees and carrying the $20,000,000 loan amendment .
