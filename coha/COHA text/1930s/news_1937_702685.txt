txt The Securities and Exchange Commission last night made public a set of proposed rules for regulation of over-thecounter markets of unexpectedly wide application . The purpose is to define practices considered " Manipulative , deceptive or fraudulent " within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . Copies have been sent to stock exchanges , organizations of brokers and dealein and securities commission for comment and suggestions prior to final adoption . One unexpected provision is that the rules would apply to brokers and dealers in securities exempted from the Securities Acts such as government , state and municipal bonds . Such dealers are exempt from registration with the Commission if they deal exclusively in exempted securities . Solicitation of Purchases Another regulation deals with solicitation of purchases on a stock exchange to facilitate distribution of securities . This is the first time the Commission has , by rules , proposed prohibiting certain practices on stock exchanges as " manipulative and deceptive practices and contrivances . " Only the law 's prohibitions have applied so far . The proposed rule would prohibit making payment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers ' men , for inducing a third person to buy a particular security on an exchange . It would also prohibit making such a payment for purchase on an exchange , except when the purchase is for the account of or the person paying the compensation . Another significant rule would prohibit a broker or dealer from offering a security for sale " at the market " or from representing that the price of a security offered for sale is the market price unless he has definite knowledge of the existence of a market other than that made , created or controlled by himself , his customer , or someone with whom he is in a relationship of control . Another of the new requirements which the rules would impose is that a broker-dealer , except when acting solely as a broker and for only one customer , make disclosure before effecting each purchase or sale as to the capacity in which he is to act in the transaction . Applicable Sections A broker-dealer who controls , is controlled by or is under common control with an issuer would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance of the time when he effects a transaction in securities of that issuer for a customer . This disclosure could be made orally provided it were followed by written disclosure before the completion of the transaction . Control is a question of fact to be determined according to the circumstances of each particular case , and may result from the operation of any one of a number of different factors . Following a purchase or sale , but before the completion of the transaction as defined in the rules , the broker-dealer would be required to furnish the customer with a written confirmation which would disclose the capacity in which the broker-dealer acted in the transaction and , if a brokerage transaction , the name of the person with whom the transaction was effected as well as the date and time of the transaction , or a statement that these facts will be furnished upon request . Also , in the case of a brokerage transaction , the confirmation would disclose the amount of every commission or other remuneration received in connection with the transaction and the source of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer from inducing the purchase or sale of any security by any act , practice or course of business which would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person , or by any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary to make other statements , in the light of the circumstances under which they were made , not misleading . Misrepresentation as to the effect and meaning of registration of a broker or dealer would be prohibited . Other Disclosures A broker , who is financially interested in the distribution of a security , or a dealcie having such an interest and at the same time receiving a fee from a customer for giving investment counsel , would be required under the proposed rules to disclose to a customer his interest in the distribution prior to effecting each transaction in such security for or with the customer This disclosure prior to purchase or sale could be oral , but a written disclosure would be required prior to the completion of the transaction . An interest in a distribution is defined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the Commission , is broad enough to include ownership of the security or of an option to purchase the security if such ownership or option is related to either a primary or secondary distribution of such security . The terms " primary distribution " and " secondary distribution ' are used in the sense in which those terms are employed by those engaged in ' he securities business , and do not include ordinary trading activity Under the proposed rules , a broker or dealer managing a discretionary account would be subject to all the requirements of the over-thecounter rules and would also be subject to a special limitation against effecting trades for the discretionary account v.hich are excessive in size or frequency in view of the financial resources of the account . He would also be required to make a record immediately after effecting any transaction for such an account which should include the name of the customer , the name , amount and price of the security , and the date and time when the transaction took place .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
