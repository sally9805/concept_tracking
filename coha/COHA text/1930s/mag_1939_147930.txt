A shocked voice at the British War Office one day last week gasped : " Are you by any chance referring on a public telephone to the fact that a certain well-known personage has left these shores for a certain destination ? " <P> A disgusted news correspondent at the other end of the line replied : " I 'm talking about the King 's visit to France . . . officially known to the press for two hours . Do n't you know ? " <P> The War Office 's wish to keep the visit secret had been firmly overridden by George VI , who said : " My people have a right to know where I am , and I do n't wish the first news ... to be reported by Lord Haw-Haw of Zeesen . " <P> His Majesty crossed the rainswept Channel on the bridge of a destroyer , with destroyer and airplane escort , but care was taken that Lord Haw-Haw ( Germany 's super-accented radio propagandist who kids the English in English ) and other Nazis should not know he had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition of what occurred recently when the President of France " secretly " visited the front , saw-across the river on the German bank-a banner with letters ten feet high , reading : <P> " Bienvenu Welcome , M. le Prsident ! " <P> In a staff car with standard camouflage ( netting over the roof ) , King George motored to the chateau , in a provincial town well back of the British lines in France , where lives Britain 's field commander , Viscount Gort . The King was accompanied by his brother H. R. H. Major General the Duke of Gloucester , who is Lord Gort 's chief liaison officer ; also Equerry Piers Legh , Private Secretary Sir Alexander Hardinge , a Scotland Yardsman carrying the royal gas mask and red dispatch case . Lord Gort spent the next few days arduously escorting his sovereign house guest hither &; yon through the lines for His Majesty 's quick edification and for the pepping-up , which was real and welcome , of His Majesty 's armed forces . It was planned that every Tommy should get at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ungloved hands blue with cold , his boots splashed , King George , unflagging , visited airdromes and pillboxes , reviewed regiments , watched anti-aircraft rangefinders work , trenches being dug , marched in places through ankle-deep mud . As well as with soldiers , he chatted with newsmen , who were permitted to accompany him in rotating groups of five . To oldtime Correspondent Sir Philip Gibbs , he said : " I suppose you feel as I do that this war is a continuation of the last . " <P> At one airfield , His Majesty spoke the order , " Go into it , " over the radio-telephone to a triad of fighters standing alert with propellers idling . When the ships shot aloft and whizzed back over the field in tight formation , he telephoned to their pilots : " That was a beautiful take-off . "
