Into the Moose Temple at Detroit one day last week surged some 350 strangely assorted visitors . Conspicuous on many a lapel was the button-of-the-week : <P> " UAW CIO " <P> " I 'm for Homer Martin " <P> The wearers of this puckish slogan were delegates to the convention called by <P> Homer Martin to reorganize and purify the United Automobile Workers of America . Inasmuch as Mr. Martin had publicly quit C. I. O. ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) , and all delegates to his convention had just been read out of the Congress of Industrial Organizations , the buttons had a touch of whimsey . <P> Homer Martin refused to regard it as such . He proposed somehow to detach C. I. 0 . from John Llewellyn Lewis and denounce the man without denouncing the body . He cried : <P> " There has been a deliberate and diabolical scheming . . . for making our union subservient to . . . a partnership between the dictatorship of John L. Lewis and the Communist dictatorship of the proletariat . We must win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Whatever effect this had on the honest membership , it achieved a Labor paradox . A so-called C. I. O. audience booed &; hissed every mention of the name of John Lewis . <P> Thus disorganization was crowned with confusion . Having kicked out U. A. W. 's five vice presidents and all but nine of its 24 executive board members , Mr. Martin had just been deserted by five more boardmen and so many local officers that everybody lost count . The deserters , of course , went over to Acting President Roland Jay <P> Thomas of U. A. W. 's other wing , whose reorganization convention in Cleveland March 27 has the blessings of Mr. Lewis . <P> No one knew where this left Homer Martin . That it left him somewhere in the minority , only Homer Martin questioned . C. I. O. 's Thomas claimed the support of locals representing 315,236 of U. A. W. 's 380,000 . Homer Martin , finding it wise to deal in round numbers , said he had about 200,000 . Delegates on hand at the weekend demonstrably represented 64,300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his minority . One way might be to take it back into A. F. of L. While Mr. Martin 's delegates wore C. I. 0 . buttons his convention publicity was handled by Chester M. Wright , onetime A. F. of L. publicist , now the Washington representative of professional Press Agent Carl <P> Byoir . Hovering near Homer Martin all week was A. F. of L. 's Detroit representative , Joseph Cummings . <P> Yet another clue to Mr. Martin 's varied connections was afforded last week by his former Secretary-Treasurer , Loren I. Houser . Having gone over to C. I. O. , Mr. Houser declared that Mr. Martin recently received from Manhattan two checks totaling $25,000 . In Manhattan is Mr. Martin 's friend David Dubinsky , whose rich International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union is also out of both C. I. 0 . and A. F. of L. and might well welcome company as a Labor independent .
