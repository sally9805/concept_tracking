One rainy night last month William Zielsdorf , a serious little German who keeps a nursery in McLough , Kans. settled down to listen to the radio . Soothed by the music and the rich , fruity tones of announcers , William Zielsdorf dozed . Suddenly he sat bolt upright . An exciting voice had just said : <P> Are you the heir to $10,000 ? <P> Are you the heir to $50,000 ? <P> Are you one of America 's missing heirs ? <P> The excited voice explained that a circus performer named Edward Lusein had died in Chicago leaving $16,000 and no apparent heirs . Then radio actors , MARCH-OF-TIME fashion , enacted his life and death . William Zielsdorf packed his bag for Chicago , for Edward Lusein was his uncle . <P> Nurseryman Zielsdorf was apprised of his good fortune by " The Court of Missing Heirs , " a bright radio idea of Skelly Oil Co . Aimed by Skelly Oil point-blank at that immense and sanguine section of the U. S. public which succumbs to bank night and sweepstakes tickets and dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet two months old but is already a radio success . Skelly filling stations are confined to the Midwest , so Skelly 's Court of Missing Heirs is confined to 29 Columbia Broadcasting System and other Midwest stations . Dramatized each week are two cases taken from the files of probate courts . Listeners are told to go to the nearest Skelly station and get a copy of the Court of Missing Heirs Bulletin for more information . For the last two weeks a print order of 500,000 copies of the Bulletin has been exhausted within a day of publication , but William Zielsdorf is the first authentic missing heir to be discovered by Skelly . <P> Said William Zielsdorf last week : " I 've been lucky all my life . Why , I won three turkey raffles . "
