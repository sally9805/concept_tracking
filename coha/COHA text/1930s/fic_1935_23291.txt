VOLUME 170 JANUARY 1935 Harpers 0A4ffazine THE HOME PLACE A STORY BY DOROTHY THOMAS W AKING , before she was aware of Ralph 's heavy breathing and the warmth of his body beside her , Phyllis thought first that she was in her own blue bed in her father 's house , and then that she was in the big maple bed in the house that Ralph had built for her when everything was fine . Heavily reality came over her like the " billows down over the soul " her mother-in-Iaw was always singing about . She opened her eyes and saw the eight gray squares that made the windows in the winter dawn and knew that she was in the old four-poster bed in Grandma Young 's room in the little house on the Young home place . Overhead , in Edna and Tom 's room the alarm stopped its muffled whir ring and she heard the thud of a window being let down . Tom was up and Edna would be up and on the stairs in a minute , stumping down in her stock-ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phyllis put a hand on her husband 's shoulder and began to give him gentle shoves , saying in a sharp whisper , " Ralph ? Ralph ! " He drew away and mumbled , " Whata you want ? " " Get up , " Phyllis whispered ; " the alarm 's gone off . Tom 's up . " " Oh , Lord , " Ralph moaned , and with an elbow drew the covers well over his head . Phyllis kept at him until he woke and sat up . He swayed backward and forward , his hands hanging limply over his parted knees . " What time is it ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " Phyllis said . " You wo n't drop off if I get up to see ? " " No , I 'm awake . Seems like I have n't been asleep . " Phyllis slid from the bed and felt with her toes for her mules and when Copyright , 2934 , by Harper &; Brothers . All Rights Reserved . she found them went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the middle of the room and reached up to turn on the light . Ralph heard the click of the light chain against the bulb and laughed shortly . " How many times you going to try to turn on that dead light ? " " No telling , " Phyllis said . " I ca n't get used to their being off . " She was at the far side of the room , cautiously moving a chair . " What you doing over there , " Ralph wanted to know ; " is n't the light on the dresser ? " " Be still , " Phyllis whispered , and a moment later he heard her fumbling among the things on the dresser for the little gilt slipper that held the matches . She struck the match twice , leaving long phosphorescent streaks on the sandpaper cat match-scratcher before she got a light . She turned the wick low . " I was fixing a coat so the light would n't shine in Betty 's eyes , " she said . Ralph got stiffly out of bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he came and stood behind Phyllis  --  she was beginning to comb her hair  --  and picked up his watch from the dresser and squinted at it . " Quarter a five ) Good God ! " he said . Phyllis was drawing the comb rapidly through her long black hair . " Betty fretted so , " she said ; " I was up with her a dozen times , could n't keep her covered . " " So ? " Ralph said . " Did n't hear you . " He was getting into his clothes and burring his lips noisily . " I tried to be quiet . You were restless too , kept groaning . " " I was dead . " Phyllis was coiling her hair , frowning into the dim and speckled-looking glass . " Ralph , I 'm going to say something , " she said . " I ca n't stand it any longer ! " " Huh ? About the boys ? " Phyllis drew the combings from the comb , wound them about her finger , held them gingerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the china hair-receiver , whirled about , and put her hands behind her , gripping the edge of the dresser . " Yes , I am , " she said , " and I do n't care if it brings the roof down . We 've as much right to this house , to peace in this house , as Edna and Tom have . The boys tease and tease Betty until she cries in her sleep , ' Do n't George ! Quit , Tommy ! ' There 's no sense in boys their size picking on a little thing like Betty . They keep her scared and cross all the time . She was never like that at home . You know she was n't ! " Ralph was wrestling with a broken suspender buckle . " Better go easy , " he said . " Edna 's so sour now she do n't even look at me . Never says a word . " " Then you talk to Tom ! " Ralph sat down on the bed , stamped a foot into a shoe , and hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have him blow a fuse , " he said . " I 've got to work with that sorehead all day , and that 's no cinch . " " All right then , I talk to Edna , " she said and turned away from him , her teeth on her under lip . Ralph slid his watch into his overall pocket and went across the room and looked down at his little daughter where she lay on old Grandma Young 's sofa . Even in sleep her little fists were doubled up tightly and her face , white against her brown curls , was tense . " Sure she 's comfortable ? " he asked his wife . " If this old sofa 's as hard as it was when I used to get sat down on it when I was a kid , it 's hard . " " There 's the down comfort under her . " " Tell you what , " Ralph said , " if she complains they bother her to-day I 'll talk to Tom . But let 's not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phyllis sighed and looked quickly into his eyes as though she would say she was sorry to have plagued him with any trouble in the world . She took hold of his hands and lifted them , palms upward , and drew him to the light . " How 're your wrists ? " she asked . " Oh , sore . " " Bad as yesterday ? Did n't the lini-. ment help any ? " " I do n't know . They 're stiff . " Phyllis drew his hands up and pressed the wrists gently against her cheeks . " Well , well , " she said softly , " got me a big old stiff corn-picker . " Ralph clasped his hands behind her neck and drew her head against him . " Stiff , all right , " he said ; " ca n't begin to pick with Tom . Never could , even when I was home . " He spoke as though home were some other place . " You 're not used to it , that 's all , " Phyllis said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out there . " She drew away from him , and he put out his hand to open the door for her , but the door swung open before his hand touched the knob and his little old grandmother gaped up at him with her head atrcmble . " Young man , what are you doing in my room ? " she piped , clasping her hands over her little round stomach and straightening up as well as she could . " Oh , dear , " Phyllis sighed and struck her hands together with a hope-less little pop . " Hello , Grandma ! " Ralph bawled , cupping his hands close to the old woman 's ear , " you know me . I 'm Ralph ! You gave us your room , do n't you know ? Your bed 's in the kitchen . " " Oh , " Old Grandma Young said , " that 's right . I forgot , I guess . A-course . But who 's this woman ? " She drew back , tucking down her chin and wrinkling her old forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on his wife 's shoulder , and pushed her toward his grandmother . " Phyllis , my wife ! " he yelled . The old woman grinned foolishly and spatted at him with a quavery hand . " Do n't try to fox me , " she said ; " you ! Your wife ! She is n't any such a thing . You ai n't big enough to get married . Is my bed ready ? " " Now , Grandma , your bed 's out in the kitchen , " Ralph said . " Go on , ' t is not , " the old woman said , still playfully , ducked under his arm , tottered across the room , then made a feeble attempt to lift her bony old leg up on to the bed . Ralph came and picked her up , put her in the bed , and tucked the covers up under her chin . " There ! Go to sleep ! " he yelled . Phyllis was quieting Betty . Ralph blew out the light and motioned for Phyllis to go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went through the door . " Oh , why 'd you let her get in bed ? " she asked . " Why not ? " Ralph said . " Ca n't let her stand in the cold all morning and argue . " Phyllis stopped to spread the covers over little Tommy 's bare legs . Edna 's boys slept on the folding couch in the dining room . " Edna 'll have everything done , " she said . " Well , let her . Get up this time of morning  --  like we had a crop to pick ! " In the kitchen there was already a good warmth and the smell of burning cobs and hot grease and coffee . Edna stood at the stove , a crock of pancake batter in one hand and a case knife in the other . She scorned the pancake turner Phyllis had brought from her home . She did not turn or speak . " Tom and Papa out at the barn ? " Ralph asked cheerfully . 1 " Acout se , " Edna said . Ralph and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind the kitchen door and went out . Phyllis , left alone with Edna , took a loaf of bread from the tin box and began to cut slices . Edna turned from the stove to say , " That 's enough . We got cakes . " Phyllis put the bread on the table and looked about for something else to do . " Ai n't your girl going to school today ? " Edna asked . " Yes . " " Then had n't you better be putting up her lunch ? " Phyllis looked at her sister-in-law 's broad back , her rising anger nauseating her a little . She had learned to wait to put up Betty 's school lunch until Edna was out seeing to her chickens . She knew it irritated Edna to see her fill the thermos bottle with chocolate or soup and put an orange or apple into the child 's pail . Edna 's boys thrived on thick sausage sandwiches and cold mincemeat pie . Phyllis set the butter in the warming oven to get it soft enough for spreading sandwiches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little Betty in her arms . She had wrapped the child in a blanket and was hugging and kissing her , making quite a fuss over her . " There , there , " she was crooning , " was Grandma 's girl scared ? Was her scared of Old Grandma snoring ? " She opened the oven door , pulled a chair toward the stove , and sat down with the child on her lap . She held the little feet toward the oven 's warmth , her sturdy pink hands clasping the ankles . She paid no attention to Edna 's angry shove of the pancake griddle to the far side of the stove . Phyllis , watching , saw that Mama Young was not going to let her eldest boy 's wife 's sulks disturb her . The old woman put a hand on the child 's forehead . " Phyllis , " she said , " this child 's caught cold . I believe she 's got a fever . " " I do n't know how I 'm to tell , " Phyllis said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna turned and looked at Phyllis , her small blue eyes bright and belligerent . One of her boys had broken Phyllis ' thermometer playing doctor , and Edna had not offered to replace it with a new one . Neither of the women had forgotten . " Well , I do n't need a thermometer to tell when a child 's feverish , " Mama Young said . " Look at the fire in her cheeks , and how dry her lips arc . Do n't feel a bit good , do you , Sweet ? " Betty laid her head against hcr grandmother 's soft bosom and sighed a whimpering sigh . Mama Young carried her to Old Grandma Young 's bed in the kitchen corner and covered and patted her . " You sleep a while longer , " she said . Then she went in the pantry , came out with a glass of jelly in one hand and a jar of jam in the other , and went to the table with them . Phyllis , watching her , liked the soft roll of her mother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong about it . The old lady was smiling to herself . " Arch 's mother 's in Phyllis 's bed , " she said to Edna , ignoring that young woman 's gloom . " I heard her runtin ' around in there and Betty acrying . Seems like Old Grandma ca n't get used to sleepin ' out here in the kitchen , even if it was her own idea . One day she understands it clear enough and next day she 's all mixed up and wants back in there . Do n't know where she 's at or anything . Thinks Ralph and Phyllis are strangers , and do n't belong here . " A loud breath that was almost a snort came from Edna 's direction , and Phyllis thought that Edna might as well have said , " Is n't the old lady right ? " " Ai n't it time you got your boys up , Edna ? " Mama Young asked . 1 " I 'll get ' em up , " Edna said . " Mind the cakes , will you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phyllis to do anything , but if she saw her empty-handed her very back showed her disapproval . She went into the dining room to wake her boys , slamming the door . Alone in the kitchen Phyllis and her mother-in-law smiled at each other . There had never been anything but a good feeling between them in the three weeks Phyllis and Ralph had been in the house . Whether Mama Young liked her just because she liked her or because she had borne her her only granddaughter , Phyllis did not know , but she was very glad of her good will . The men were heard in the porch and Mama Young said , " Put the butter'n syrup on , will you , Phyllis ? " Phyllis , when the old woman moved in her path , put an arm about her plump shoulders and gave her a squeeze , being careful not to tip the syrup pitcher . The three men came in , dipped water from the reservoir to the wash pan , and washed in turn , Tom first . " Ah-ah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel , just as he always did . Phyllis watched first Tom then her husband stoop down to see into the little looking glass to comb his hair . She wondered why the glass had never been hung higher on the wall . " Why have n't you hung the glass higher ? " she asked Grandpa , and was surprised to find herself speaking her thought aloud . Grandpa Young laughed . " Hung for Harvey , " he said , with the fondness in his tone that the Youngs dropped into when they spoke of Harvey , their baby . " Yes , sir , brought that mirror home about the time Harvey put on long pants and begun to spruce up to spark the Drier girl ; did n't I , Mama ? " " ' Bout , I guess . Only you got your boys mixed , Papa . It was Tom here liked the Drier girl . " Mama Young seemed a little embarrassed making this correction and smoothed a kind hand down her eldest son 's arm , and smiled without looking into his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " liked the Drier girl ! " and looked angrily at her mother-in-law and suspiciously at her husband . Phyllis had not before heard any of them speak of the Drier girl , yet she felt the name 's importance . Papa whistled thinly as he combed his hair . It was plain he realized he had said something he should not have said , Edna 's boys had come in and were making a great racket . The middle one , George , had on only one shoe and was running limpingly around the table with the other two boys after him . Edna held the shoe in her hand . " Will you fix this , Papa ? " she asked ; " the sole 's loose . " " Sure will , sure will , " Papa said , " soon as I 've had my breakfast . Breakfast ready , Mama ? " " Yes , Arch , " his wife said ; " it 's up and on the table . Come on . " Edna was seeing to her boys ' washing and combing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very little spirit when he saw them scuffling over the towel . Phyllis felt that his halfhearted efforts at discipline were mainly for her benefit . He really did not mind their din and got cross with them only when they fought or when they disobeyed him " out and out . " " Where 's Betty ? " little George yelled . " Ai n't she coming to the table ? " " She 's sleeping in Old Grandma 's bed ; do n't wake her , " his grandmother admonished and put a hand on his shoulder and pushed him toward the breakfast table . " Your Grandma 's waiting on you , " she said . Tommy , the oldest boy , ran to the bed to look at his sleeping cousin , and his Grandma said , " Come on away from her ! " " He 's not touchin ' her ! " Edna said sourly . Grandma got them all quiet at the table at last , after much chair scraping and some scuffling among the boys , and when all the heads were bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking voice , " Our Father we thank Thee for this Thy hand 's bounty . Bless this food to our use and us to Thy service . Forgive us our sins . Care for our loved ones , and lead us in the paths of righteousness . Amen . " The plates were turned over and Edna got up from her chair and brought the crockful of cakes from the warming oven , then took her place at the stove to fry more cakes and have them ready . They ate without talking . " Let me fry a while , " Phyllis offered when she had eaten her cake . Edna did not answer for the space of time it took her to turn the three cakes on the griddle . Then , " Better get your girl up , had n't you ? " " No , I 'll let her sleep to the last mi nute . " " That 's right , " Mama Young said . " Betty sick ? " Tom asked . " Did n't sleep well , " Ralph said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She did n't have biscuits , " Phyllis said , trying to keep her rising anger out of her voice . " I do n't give her hot biscuits for supper . " " That 's right , " Edna said . " Got your stomach , ai n't she ? " " There 's nothing wrong with my stomach or hers , " Phyllis said . Ralph looked at her warningly . " That 's right , " he said casually . " You can eat anything , ca n't you , Baby ? " " Baby , babyl " young Tommy crowed loudly , his mouth full of cake and syrup , and began to choke . His father struck him smartly between the shoulders ; he swallowed , rubbed the tears from his eyes , and finished . " Uncle Ralph called you a baby , Aunt Phyllis ! " " Shut up , " Tom said , " and watch what you 're doing . " Phyllis got up from the table and went to get Betty , who had waked . Old Grandma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held trem . blingly before her , and announced from the doorway , standing in her nightgown and Phyllis 's good coat , " There 's a raw wind ; it 's again ' to blizzard . Have you seen to the stock , Arch ? " Ralph got up and went to her , took Phyllis 's coat from her shoulders , and put her shawl round her and yelled , " Want your breakfast , Grandma , or do you want to go back to bed ? " The old lady considered , puckering her lips and plucking Ralph 's sleeve with her dry fingers . " I do n't know , " she said plaintively ; " never slept a wink . I was worryin ' about George the whole night . " " Dream about him ? " Ralph yelled . Phyllis wondered why Ralph cared to spend so much time humoring the old woman . He seemed to like especially to hear her " go on " about his Uncle George who had run away to the Klondike and never been heard from . Ralph led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat her down . " Yes , I did , " she said , much pleased , " but I ca n't remember it good . All that 's clear is , he came in that door , with a bucketful of gold , a milkpail full , and I said , ' Georgie boy , what have you there in that pail ? ' and he said , ' Milk and honey , Ma. ' and I looked , sure enough , ' t was gold , pure molten gold . " She said this last in a sad dreamy voice and fingered the edge of the blue-veined oilcloth . She looked up and round at them . " Have you had the blessing without me ? " she asked . " Guess so , " and held up her plate with both hands , like a child , for the cakes her daughter-in-law brought . Grandpa Young got up from the table and went to the cellarway , where , on a ledge , he kept his cobbling kit . He sat down near the kitchen window and adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While he was trimming the edge of the sole with his knife he put out his tongue and ran it slowly from one corner of his mouth to the other . Little George , behind his grandfather 's chair , put out his tongue in a mocking gesture , and the other boys giggled . Phyllis wished for the right to slap them soundly . She remembered her patience of her schooIte aching days and wondered why she could not keep from being annoyed by them . " Well , let 's get moving , " Tom said , and got his sheepskin and cap from behind the door . " Let 's have those mended gloves , Edna , " he said . Edna brought the gloves and he took them from her absentmindedly and without thanks . Phyllis was laying Betty 's place at the table with the blue-and-yellow Mother Goose plate and mug that had been a gift from her father to Betty . Ralph went to her , his cap under his arm , and kissed her . " Where 's the girl ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other room , " Phyllis said . She was the only one to call Mama Young " mother . " Ralph took a step toward the dining room door , and Torn cried , jerking his cap down over his forehead , " Oh , for Pete 's sake , let 's get going ! " Ralph swung about and followed him . Edna , putting cobs into the stove and frowning over the heat from the coals , said to no one in particular , " Be time to come in by the time they get out to the field ! " Phyllis wondered whether her bitterness was all for the time that was lost . She had never seen Tom kiss Edna or show her special attention of any kind . Grandpa Young had finished with the shoe . " There you are , there you are , " he said after he had felt carefully to see that there were no tacks to hurt the little foot , and handed the shoe to George . The boy took it and hopped to the bed to put it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother 's . She was dainty , with her hair nicely curled and the pink ruffles of her neatly ironed apron under her chin . Phyllis lifted her into her place where a mug of milk , an orange , and a bowl of oatmeal were waiting for her , and tucked a napkin under her curls . The orange was a right but a shameful thing . Phyllis knew that even Mama Young , much as she adored the child , thought oranges for every day in the winter time a real extravagance . Even Ralph , she knew , thought an orange for breakfast , with things the way they were , " pretty steep . " Phyllis stood between the family and the orange , hoping nothing would be said . " Just the juice , please , Mother , " Betty said ; " I do n't want to eat it . " Phyllis felt tears come to her eyes . Her hand closed on Betty 's little shoulder . " Eat it , " she said sharply , and the child , alarmed , ate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast table with her plate full of pancakes . She did not look at Betty but Phyllis knew that she had seen the orange . Grandpa came and tapped Phyllis on the arm with a gnarled forefinger . " I 'm going to town , " he said . " If you do n't mind Betty 's going early , I can take her . " " What 's wrong with the boys riding ? " Edna asked before Phyllis had time to answer . The old man raised both hands in an unconscious , soothing gesture . " Sure , " he said , " all of them , sure , " and to Phyllis , " if you do n't mind . If the teacher ai n't there yet , I 'll see there 's a good fire before I go . " " All right . That 'll be nice , " Phyllis said and then pictured with dread little Betty alone in the schoolhouse with her three ornery cousins . " Here , here I Do n't do that , " Grandpa said , and Phyllis turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chasing the other two with her good coat over his back , the corners and the sleeves dragging on the floor . She ran and snatched it off him and went with it into her bedroom and came out with Betty 's wraps . Mama Young was very dubious about letting Betty go to school at all . Old Grandma , canny as she always was when there was a word of sickness in the air , said , " It 's a raw wind , the kinda wind to bring a child home with a rising in the head might cost her her hearing . " " I want to go , " little Betty said . " I feel good now , " and Grandpa picked her up and smoothed his cheek against hers and said , " I 'll keep her wrapped good , " and carried her out to the wagon . Phyllis stood at the window and watched them drive away , Betty in the high seat with her grandfather , the boys scuffling in the wagon bed . Edna went out to see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I wish Old Grandma could have her room back . She comes in almost every morning and thinks it 's still hers . " " I know , " Mama Young said , " all she keeps her wits for for sure , seems , is the weather and sickness . " " What about the room up in the al ? " Phyllis asked . " Is n't there room up there ? I could put all the stuff in one end and set up a bed in the other . " She asked this rather breathlessly , not wanting her mother-in-law to know how very much it meant to her to have the room , Mama Young had been so nice about moving Old Grandma and fixing the little bed for her in the kitchen . " Why , Child , you 'd freeze up there , " Mama Young said . " There 's no fire under , you know . We 've never set up a stove in Arch 's and my room . And there 's no floor laid up there . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . We were goingto lay a floor up there once , even took the lumber up , but Tom and Arch 's used a good half that floorin ' , I wager , for one thing and another . I do n't know how many times they 've come down carryin ' a board or two for this and that . And the walls ai n't plastered , you know  --  just the walls , not even lath . There 's no light acourse . We did n't wire in there , but it do n't matter acourse until we can afford to run the light plant again . " " I 'd like to go up and look at it , " Phyllis said . " All right , all right , soon as we 've set up the dishes . " They went up the narrow stairway , Mama Young ahead , past Tom 's and Edna 's room to the ell room door . With her fingers Phyllis turned the bent nail that held the knobless door closed , and they went in . The front part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes , a discarded set of driving harness , broken chairs , and dis- membered bedsteads . Onions and seed corn hung from the rafters . Phyllis stood with her shoulders hunched and shivering , her hands in her armpits , and looked at the room through her breath . " There 's enough boards to floor half of it , " she said ; " more than half . " " Well , ' spect Arch would lay it for you , yes , I 'm sure he would , first day he ai n't workin ' . " " I can do it myself . I can nail down boards , " Phyllis said . " May I have it ? " " Why , bless your heart , Child , a-course you can have it if you want it ; but it 'll be cold sleepin ' up here . " " I 've plenty of bedding . Are there nails enough ? " " Oh , I 'm sure , of one kind and another . Let 's get the oil stove up here if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear the place . " Between them they carried up the big oil stove and , while the room was heating , Phyllis tidied Old Grandma 's bedroom and the dining room . Edna watched her hunting nails in all possible places but she asked no questions . Phyllis found Marna Young , her shawl about her , sorting boxes of stored-away stuff and filling a cob basket with papers and rags to be burnt . " I 'll wear down this pile of junk , " she said , " so 's there 'll be more room- Old magazines and letters and stuff the boys saved . " She emptied a paper sack of old photographs and snapshots into her lap and began sorting them , throwing some into the cob basket . Phyllis cleared a place nearest the doorway , laid two boards , and felt happier than she had felt in months when she had nailed them down . Mama Young was blowing on her hands to warm them and saying , " My , my , " over picture after picture . " What fools women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " but a pretty girl , she 's pretty still , no matter how she 's fixed up . " " Have you found a pretty one ? " Phyllis asked . " Yes , the little Drier girl . " Phyllis got up from her knees and came to have a look . " Why , she 's lovely , " she said . " Does she live around here ? " " Can you read the German under it ? " Mama Young asked . " I ca n't , but I remember what it says : ' You 're a flower ' . " " ' Du bist wie eine Blume ' , " Phyllis read . " Yes , that 's right . Her father wrote it there . She ought a been Tom 's wife , by rights . Woulda been , but Drier , he was pro-German , they said , and he moved down to that little German town , corner of the State , I forgot its name  --  they 've changed it since  --  and that winter got the flu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt bad about it this morning . Papa bringing her name up like that , gettin ' things mixed and thinking it was Harvey was interested in her . Tom was such a his " place " too , Edna hated Ralph and Phyllis , and Tom carried a scornful , silent grudge . " Want to see Edna in her wedding dress ? " Mama Young asked . " She looks a lot the same , " Phyllis said . Somehow she had expected a wedding veil to make a different woman of Edna . " Her shoulders are so heavy . " " Yes , yes they are . That comes from workin ' in the fields . All those folks do , right along with the boys . She 'd be out there pickin ' corn now if Tom would let her . It takes the delicacy out of a girl , I think . I never did a thing outside when I was a girl , and Arch has never asked it of me , except acourse if there were more cows fresh at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ye liked me to do more gardening , I think ; but my , the house and the babies arc enough , seems to me , with the chickens and canning and all , for any woman .

Yes sir , one day she said to me , ' That happened when you was a baby . Or was it before you was horn ? ' she says . Yes , she 's forgot altogether how she felt against Arch marryin ' me . " Mama Young went downstairs to help Edna peel vegetables for dinner , and when she came up again she leaned against the door and stood smiling . " She 'd give her eyes to know , " she said , " Edna would , what you 're up to up here , but she did n't ask and I did n't tell her . " " I 'm done ! " Phyllis said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ? " She chose the biggest of the bedsteads and they set it up . Phyllis had to saw two new slats from a remaining badly warped piece of flooring . " I know well what became of those old slats , " Mama Young said , tenderly . " Little Harvey made ' em into stilts . He wasthe slightest child I had , and to think the size he is now ! Six foot three ! To think of him playin ' football all four years and steppin ' right into such a good job . This maul es.s is a little old , but I guess you wo n't feel the lumps much when you got a couple of feather ticks over it . " Phyllis brought up bedding from her trunks in Old Grandma 's room , and they made the bed , Mama Young exclaiming over the beauty of the blankets .

All those towels too you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody in mind , " she said , " until I got my school and met Ralph . " " I think it 's nice . " Mama Young said . " He wrote home about meeting you , and he never wrote about girls when he was in school , not one those two years , though he had ' em , I guess ; they all do . " They made a little bed for Betty of a folded feather bed in a great packing box set on two chairs . They were done , all but sweeping up the sawdust , when they heard Tom and Ralph come in . Mama went down for the broom and came up with two red-and-white quilts over her arm . " There ! " she said , and took a ball of cord and a ring of safety-pins from her pocket . " Nail up nails and tie the cord across and we 'll hang the quilts for curtains to shut off the junk end of the room . " " Stay out ! Stay out ! " the old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stair . " We 'll call you when we want you ! " The quilts , hung on their safety-pin rings , made a gay and handsome curtain . " Looks pretty spiffy ! " Mama Young said ; " now , do n't it ? I thought you 'd like the red . I 'll go down and send Ralph up . " She went out , walking on her tiptoes and holding up her hands in mock surprise . Phyllis had not guessed she had so much fun in her . Almost at once she heard Ralph 's step on the stair again . She tossed the hammer into a box behind the quilt curtains and waited , her palms cupped round her elbows . Ralph came in and stood a moment with his mouth open , looking round . He looked helplessly , almost reproachfully , at her . " Ours , " she said , and felt her eyes fill with tired tears . Dimly she saw him go to the bed and sit down with his hands hanging over his knees . She knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her father 's house , the big room with the maple bed in the house he had built for her , the house he had lost that Tom held so against him . So many times she had seen him sit like that , after supper in the kitchen downstairs , sit and slowly shake his head . If she had fixed up the room when they first came he would have said something , would have protested against her working in the cold . Now he said nothing at all . She went to him and sat beside him , resting her clasped hands on his shoulder . She was tired too and leaned against him . " Wanta know something nice ? " she said , in a voice they kept for foolishness . " Your big brother Tom does n't love his wife Edna , and he never , never did ! Is n't that a sweetly solemn thought ? " " Ya , I guess that 's right , " Ralph said . " He wanted the little Drier girl . Like to never got over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid it against her cheek . " How 's mold corn picker ? " she asked . " Ilow 's the wrist ? " " Oh , sore . " He lay back on the bed and shut his eyes . " This is  --  nice , " he said . Phyllis rested her hand on his outfiung arm . " And Old Grandma 'll never find us here , " she said . Ralph laughed in his throat and drew her to him . " I do n't mind her , " he said . " I like to hear her go on . " " Ralph ! " Tom 's voice came in exasperation up the well of the stairs . " Come on down here and eat . We got to get out there . " Mama Young put her head in from the dining room . " Would you carry that boiler of water , off the stove , in here for me , Ralph ? I 'm going to give Grandma her bath . " Ralph carried in the boiler of water and emptied it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold for me to take a bath , " the old woman was protesting . " Mamie . I never bathed you or any of you children on such a cold day . You 'll see . " " It 's not cold in here a bit , " Mama Young said patiently , " and I 'll bathe you under a blanket . " " Oh , all right , " Old Grandma said . " I suppose I ca n't help myself , but you 'll see . " In the kitchen Grandpa Young was slowly eating his dinner , his head resting against his left fist . Phyllis thought he looked very tired and much , much older than Mama Young . " It 's too cold to go out and pick , boys , " the old man said , " and anyway , what there is you can pick in two days . Let it stand . " When he had finished his dinner Ralph sat still at the table , looking at the old man . Without thinking what he did , he kept touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate with food and then let it go almost untouched . She was very tired from her morning 's work , and now that they were downstairs again she felt some anger with Ralph , felt he might have said something , might have felt something more than sadness and shame at his own inability to furnish a better place for her . " I went in to see Walter , " the old man said in the stillness . " He said last spring , he thought he could let me have something , but now he ca n't . I do n't know how we 're goin ' to feed , the winter . " The boys looked at him without saying anything . They were both surprised that their father should have thought that Walter or anybody else would lend them money . " I helped Walter out back there , I helped him twice . " He looked sadly out the window toward the cornfield , as though he looked down rows of years . " And he 'd help me if he could . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better write Harvey . " He took a large bite of pie and shook his head . The sight of the pie , eaten in such sadness , made Phyllis feel sick . She got up from the table and went upstairs . In her room in the ell she took off her shoes and got into bed , not between the sheets but between the blankets , and lay shivering , her feet curled like a child . All the Youngs , in great need , waiting months and months to ask their baby , their darling , who had a good job , to help them out ! Grandpa had chosen a moment when Mama Young was out of the room to suggest to the boys that they write . There had been some little trouble when Harvey was home last , just what the Youngs had kept to themselves , but they all felt touchy about asking anything of him . Phyllis had seen her younger brother-in-law only once  --  at her wedding . Ah , the wedding . She remembered how pretty her father 's house had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local banker , marries Western ranchman at brilliant wedding , " the foolish little hometown paper had said . How silly to call Ralph 's wheat farm a ranch ! Now the farm was gone , the house they had built and all , and her father 's bank  --  it was n't really his , of course ; he just ran it  --  was an empty building . She could see it as it had looked when she had stopped to see her father , the windows streaked with Halloween soapings . A cousin had given her father a room in his house where he could sit and look down on the street . Would Harvey , with his good job and his bachelor apartment and his car , help them ? A lot he cared , not to have written ! He could n't help but know how things were in Nebraska . The bed was warmer and her stomach felt better . Crying , she fell asleep . The squeaking of the door wakened her and she put out a warm hand and curled it in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " is it late ? I must have slept a long time . " " It 's clouded over , " Ralph said , and sighed deeply . " What 's the matter ? " " Oh  --  plenty . " " What ? " He sat down on the bed beside her . " I had it out with Tom . " " About the boys ? " " No . We did n't get round to that . About the place . " " What place ? " " Both of them , his and mine . Edna started it . We were writing to Harve . I was writing and Dad and Tom were telling me what to write , and Edna put in her say . . . . Ah , I do n't know what she said , but something like ? ' Why do n't you tell him why we have to ask , why we got in the hole ? ' and I said , Why did we ? ' and she started in , and Tom took it up then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it worse . Said if he and Dad had n't mortgaged Tom 's place to start me out they 'd have his place yet . Why , Tom himself was all for me buying that combine ; you know he was . Lord , I guess I worked as hard on this place as he did . Threw it up to me about those two years in ag ' school . Lord , he coulda gone too if he 'd had the gumption . Dad wanted him to go . That combine ! " Phyllis , looking up into his face , remembered a night in their living room on their own farm . He had been writing a letter to a school friend . She had caught him grinning , and he had quoted from the paper under his hand ? Ralph was shyly proud of his wit , " And , I 've settled down now ; I 've got me wives and combines ! " " What did you say ? " she asked . " Oh , I blew up , I guess . I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his and Dad 's say I bought that packing stock ! Lot better'n any of us got sucked in . Did he think I wanted to come back here ? Stick you off up here in a hole in the wall ! He 'd never a tried the wheat farm , himself . He had his chance . He was scared . " " Then what ? " " I hit him . " " Ralph ! " " Yeah . I socked him . Only thing I 'm sorry for it was n't out in the field . " " Ralph ! What 'd he do ? " " Nothing . He got up and came for me , and I hit him again . Then Mama came in . . . " He laid his head down on her shoulder . There was something about the smell of his hair that made her think of her teaching days . More than one hot head had cooled against her shoulder after schoolyard scraps . " Well , " he said , " he had it coming to him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I did n't think about her . " He turned and laid his cheek against hers . " You sore ? " " No , but it was bad for the folks . What about the letter ? " " Dad 's finishing it up , I guess . " Neither spoke for a while . " Do n't you think you ought to go for Betty if it 's going to storm ? " Ralph did not answer . He had gone to sleep . She waited a little , slid her arm from under his head , got up , put on her shoes , and went down stairs . Mama Young was alone in the kitchen . " Edna 's gone out to shut up the chickens , " she said calmly . " Arch thinks it 's going to storm . " " Do n't you think someone ought to go for Betty ? " Phyllis asked . " Arch 's gone , " she said . " Took the wagon . " The old woman was standing at the kitchen window , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needle from her hands and threaded it . " Thought I might as well mend gloves , " Mama Young said ; " have ' em ready . " " Did Ralph hurt Tom  --  bad ? " " Oh  --  I do n't think so . They were both pretty ashamed of their selves , I think . Did he tell you  --  they were writing to Harvey ? I was gettin ' Grandma dressed after her bath and did n't know till I heard ' em scuffling . I hate for ' em to bother Harvey , but I guess it has to be . " Phyllis looked at her mother-in-law 's face bent over the glove on her hand and wondered whether the boys would be relieved or disappointed to know that their coming to blows impressed their mother less than the letter to her baby . " He 's such a boy ! " the old woman said . " He 's got on well , but he 's a free spender too . I doubt if Harvey 's got it to send . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he makes . A boy not married , you know , he ca n't lay by much there in a city . Too many places for it . He 'll be put out if he has to disappoint them . " " If he ca n't help , what 'll they do ? " Phyllis asked . " God knows , " Mama Young said , and added " ? I trust . " There was the rattle of wheels on frozen ground , and Grandpa drove into the yard , got down over the wheel stiffly , and put up his arms for Betty . Phyllis opened the door for her , and the child threw herself into her arms and began to sob loudly . Edna came in , her shoulders hunched under her shawl , and said sharply , " Now , what 's the matter ? " The second of her sons began to ex-plain loudly and the other two chimed in . Phyllis listened , looking from one to another of them , her child 's arms tight about her neck . Betty was wearing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree ! " the child sobbed . " George did , and they would n't get it down . " " Ah , we could n't ! " George said , " the little old bawlbabyl We tried and tried to get it down . Tom was up in the tree when Grandpa come along . We got let out early . I just tossed her old cap up there and she started in to bawl ? " Tom had come in . Phyllis noticed that his face was a little skinned but not swollen . He heard only the end of his son 's explanation . " You can get right back down that road and get that cap , " he said hoarsely . " Get . " George began to whimper . " Go on ! " his father yelled ; " get that cap and no back talk . " The boy pulled on his cap and went to the door crying . Edna stepped between him and the door . " Hang up your cap ! " she said . " You 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get away from that door , " Torn said . " You make me ! " Edna said , her head drawn low between her shoulders . Phyllis clasped her arms more tightly about Betty . Tom took a step toward Edna , and the child , frightened , screamed sharply . Tom swung about to look at Betty , and the door opened suddenly behind Edna , and Grandpa came in . " Going to storm , all right , " he said ; " glad the stock 's all up . " Edna moved away from the door and said again to her boy , " Take off your things and hang ' em up ! " The boy obeyed , looking sullenly from his mother to his father . Tom went to the table , sat down , and folded his arms . Phyllis let Betty down and stooped to take off her overshoes . Her sobbing had not stopped . It filled the kitchen . Phyllis looked up at the clock and saw the white rectangle of the letter to Harvey behind it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little boys were very quiet . Phyllis heard Tom 's angry breathing between her child 's sobs . " Never mind , never mind , " she heard herself saying and realized she must have been saying it over and over . " Come help me get in cobs , " Grandpa Young said , and little Tommy went out with him . Mama Young was cleaning a lamp chimney with a piece of newspaper . She held it up to the dim light , blew in it , and wiped it with her apron . " There , " she said when she set the lighted lamp on the table , as though she had fixed everything . " Now , girls , what 'll we have for supper ? " Neither of her daughters-in-law answered her . Edna went to the stove and put cobs on the fire , rattling the grate noisily . Grandpa and little Tommy came in with cobs . " Let 's milk early , boys , " the old man said . Tom got to his feet , " That somebody yeliin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard something , " Phyllis said . Tom turned and looked at her . She felt he was not angry with her at least . " That 's right , " he said ; " sure is , " and went out on the step . " Ca n't hear anything in here , " Edna said , looking over her shoulder at the still crying Betty . " It 's somebody comin ' in from the road , " Mama Young said , peering out . " Man and a woman , looks like . " " Car stalled , I expect , " Grandpa said ; " it 's droppin ' fast . Bet it 'll be plenty cold to-night . Spitting snow now . Sharp as sleet . " The stair door opened and Ralph came into the kitchen , and almost on the same instant the outside kitchen door swung open and Mrs. Young came forward , smoothing her apron , to welcome whoever had come . " Harvel  --  why , you old ? " Ralph said loudly , and Mama Young cried , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's neck . Grandpa came in , and *He they were all greeting their youngest and dearest , Phyllis had time to take as good a look at the girl with him as the lamplight would allow . She was a small , very slender girl in a short gray fur jacket . Her slim , thin-stockinged legs were red and shivering with the cold . She moved toward the stove , took a violet handkerchief from her sleeve , and wiped her small nose . Yellow hair fell in disorderly crinkled strands over her cheeks . It was Mama Young who reminded her son of the girl 's presence . " Oh  --  this is ? Villa , " he said , and turned back to his brothers ; " my wife , " he added as an afterthought . Mama Young put her arms about the girl and introduced her to Phyllis and Edna . Little Betty , through with crying , sat on the edge of her great grandmother 's bed in the corner and stared . The boys , all three , climbed into the woodbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harve rubbed his hands above the range and said , " Sure did n't expect to see you here , Ralph . Driving back ? Well , guess you 'll have to wait till after the storm . Radio says it 's going to blow a good one . " Before Ralph could answer , Old Grandma tottered in from the dining room , trailing a quilt about her shoulders . She came slowly round the table , one hand held out in front of her , her head thrust forward . " George ! " she squeaked happily , " Georgie ! " and let the quilt fall and held out her arms . " Hello , Grandma , how are you ? " Harve said and gave the old woman a hug . " I dreamed it , " she said ; " I dreamed 1 you was here . " She patted his face . " That 's Harvey , " Grandpa Young said in her ear . " That ai n't George , Ma , that 's my boy , Harvey . " He put out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a child of three or four years . " Harvey , my boy . " " Oh , " the old woman said , loosening her arms from about Harvey . " And I thought you was George , my boy George . Went to Alaska , you know . So you 're Arch 's boy  --  you 're Harvey ? ? You are not ! George , you 're foolin ' . " " Nope , I 'm Harve , Grandma , sure am . " " Well , well , " she stroked his hand . " I 'd a sworn , if I 'd swear , you was George . You favor him . . . Who 's this you brought home , Son ? Who 's this woman , George ? You got a wife up there ? " She came close to Harvey 's wife and peered into her face . " I declare , girl , " she cried , " what you done to your mouth ? " " That 's make-up , Grandma ! " Harvey yelled ; " paint ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old woman tucked down her chin , folded her hands on her stomach , and said , sternly , " George Young , have you brought home a strange woman ? " Harvey laughed . " Just a little strange , Grandma , " he said , and at the horrified look his grandmother gave him he added , " she 's all right . " Phyllis was helping Harvey 's wife out of her coat . The lining was torn in the sleeve . When the girl took off her hat her half-length yellow hair fell about her shoulders . She twisted it up with tiny , red-nailed fingers . Ralph led his grandmother to her bed and made her sit down . She seemed much shaken . " Sure did n't expect to see you here , Ralph , " Harvey said again . " Sure nice . " Then , " Tom , you folks over for supper too ? Regular family reunion . " Edna snorted . " Ya , we 're all here , " Tom said loudly . " Better know it first as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost his . We 're all here . " " That a fact ? " Harvey said , looking from one to the other of them and then at his father . " That 's right , son , " the old man said guiltily ; " it could n't be helped . We 've got just this place . Corn 's better'n most around here , but it 's not much . I do n't know how we 're going to feed the winter . I wrote you to-day . " " You 're flat , Dad ? " " It looks like it , Son . Well , it 's not quite that bad . I 've still got my place here , and that 's more than most around here . " The girl , who had been shivering by the stove and had said nothing at all , stepped suddenly into the circle of lamplight and cried shrilly , " Damn you , Harve Young , you do this to met " She was crying , with sudden sharp , angry sobs . " You drag me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , shut up , Wil , " Harvey said , took her by the arms and tried to quiet her . " Yes , we 'd go to your folks , " she screamed ; " they 've got a farm , a big house , plenty of room ! " Harve put his hand over his wife 's mouth . " Shut up , " he said evenly . " Shut up yourself , " she screamed against his hand , struggling , sobbing . Tom placed a chair for her . " Sit down , wo n't you ? " he said , and Phyllis was surprised at his concern , his politeness . The girl dropped into the chair and rested her sharp elbows on the table and cried the louder . Mama Young started to go to her , to put an arm round her , and Harve said , ' , ' Do n't touch her , Mama ; let her go . " He backed toward the stove and stood near it , rubbing his cold hands up and down his legs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said ; " I 've done everything I could . She 's carried on the whole way . " " Did you have car trouble , Son ? " his mother asked , trying to comfort him , trying to get away from the weeping girl and the tragedy , for all of them , her outburst revealed . " I have n't any car , Mama , " Harvey said , like a child who wants to confess everything and he forgiven ; " I have n't a thing . My job blew up four months ago . Wehitch-hiked . " " Yes , " the girl screamed , " in all this cold , rode in trucks  --  everything ! You lied , Harve Young  --  you said ? " " Shut up , " Harve said again . Tom stepped forward and put a hand on the back of the girl 's chair . Phyllis saw his hand waver before it curved round the top of the chair back , as though he would lay it on the girl 's bright hair . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey . " Is that any way to talk ? " Mama Young touched Harvey 's sleeve with her hand . " It 's all right , " she said , her voice trembling . " Ralph , will you get the boards out of the cellarway and help me widen the table ? We 'll get supper right away . Harvey , you 'll feel better when you 've had your supper . " Grandpa could n't quite take it in . " You mean you 've lost your job , Son ? " he asked gently . " Lost it ! " Harve said , " the whole concern went under . Wil worked in the office . . . . I  --  we got married . " Ralph had brought the table boards and his father helped him pull the table apart and put the boards in . The girl had quieted a little . She half turned in her chair and rested an arm on the back of it , against Tom 's hand , and sobbed . " He said to come here  --  he lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove , groaned . " Better get those galoshes off , " Tom said ; " looks like they 're soaked . " He came round in front of the girl , knelt awkwardly , and unfastened the small buckles . Edna , at the stove , was slicing potatoes into a sizzling skillet . In the dim light Phyllis saw her small eyes glint and her head lower between her thick shoulders . Phyllis felt sick again . She moved toward the window , laid her cheek against the cold pane , and felt a little better . There was no more doubt about it now . In her mind she counted the winter months and then March and April . In May  --  not a good time for a farm baby , Edna would think . Grandpa was saying something more about money , as though he were talking to himself . Old Grandma got up from her bed and came toward the table . " You 're not to worry , Arch , " she said soothingly . " It 's all yours . I said to Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Leave it every acre to Arch . He 'll take good care of it . ' " She looked around on them . " George ? " she said , " did you bring a bucket of gold , or did I dream it ? " Tom set the small overshoes back of the range . " Better move up , " he said to Willa ; " better move up to the fire and get warm . " Phyllis , at the window , shut her eyes . Now Ralph came to her , saw she did n't feel well , and put his arm about her . She let her weight rest against him . " Look , " she said , nodding her head toward the lamp flame reflected in the window . " When I was little Father used to say , when I 'd ask about it , ' t was a fire to warm all outdoors . " His arm tightened . If he would only pick her up and carry her upstairs and put her in the bed , cover her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his people and the smell of food frying . " Anyway , we 're all here together , " Mama Young was saying , as though she were speaking to little children , " and supper 'll be ready soon . " Old Grandma had come close to her son . " Arch , is that the wind I hear ? " she asked , " is that the wind blowin ' like that ? " Ralph turned and shouted to her over Phyllis 's head . " It 's the wind , Grandma , but you ca n't hear itl " " I can feel it , " the old woman said , " I can feel it to the bone , in this house . Is there fuel in , Arch ? Weather like this do n't clear overnight . "
