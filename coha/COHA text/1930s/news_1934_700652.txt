txt Due to the drought and to the growing impatience of business elements with many of Washington 's measures and methods , the Administration is facing the possible necessity of having to reform its budget . plans . Many of the well informed are beginning to doubt seriously whether the President will be able to make good his determination to taper relief and recovery expenditures during the fiscal year 1935. which begins July 1 . and to balance the budget during the fiscal year 1936 . The total of drought relief expenditures can not now be accurately forecast . Estimates of from 6500,000,000 to $1,000,000.000 over and above any previous expectation for farm relief output are being discussed . Large as the sum may be . it probably could be fitted into the somewhat elastic budget plans if at the same time the Administration did not find any , .. ifficulties in the way of getting private enterprise to take over reemployment througn expansion of business and industry . Business Enthusiasm Wanes Unless this is accomplished as President Roosevelt hoped it would be when he made his budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and increasingly through the next winter , will have to add to drought relief continuing large expenditures for relief and made work efforts in the industrial centers . Information which reaches here through wholly reliable channels clearly indicates a waning enthusiasm on the part of business toward many of the new deal plans and policies . The attitude extends to those quarters which were quite friendly to the Administration a few months ago . Well informed and highly placed officials within the Administration recognize the sentiment . Some of them who have had previous business associations want to do something about it . Others sseir to 3s.lcirth ; attitude that so long as the Administration has a majority of the country with it , as they believe is the present case , there is no need for the Administration to be concerned . " Lack of Certainty " the Cause Those who would like to meet the situation naturally are at some disadvantage in presentmg to the White House what appears to be a touchy subject . The task of the other school is somewhat easier , for they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasons underlie the apparent business unrest . These include labor difficulties growing out of the NRA . program , the monetary tampering , the insistence on reform measures at this time and the unwillingness to abandon methods which have obviously impeded recovery . Included in the latter category are denials of adequate amendment of the Securities Act or 1933 and the attempt to strengthen various features of AAA . Sooner or later all the complaints boil down to one of " lack of certainty , " and this lack seems to grow out of the Administration 's refusal to concede that strategy which has proved politically successful is not at the same time economically helpful . Strategy of Administration Through the campaign of 1932 and since , this Administration has proved itself expert in the strategy of surprise attack and concealed objectives This is apparently based on the theory that if political opponents do not know what is to be done next , they can not prepare opposition Consequently , a number of Administration measures have been hammered through before those who might oppose them had any chance to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden plans is the Wagner industrial disputes bill . At this w sting , the Democratic leaders in Congress claim to be without direct word as to whether the President will insist on passage of that legislation before the adjournment of Congress . That the President is friendly to it . they know , but that is something different from insistence on passage . This strategy also keeps business and Industry in the dark as to what measures will be passed and what conditions they may have to face . Increasingly bitter complaints on this score reach Washington . Stronger Resistance to New Deal On its side the Administration never has regarded definiteness of outlook as a prime requisite . In this connection the President 's comparison of himself to a quarterback calling the next play after the outcome of the last one had been revealed is recalled . This desire to keep all roads open has always conflicted with the pleas of business for information as to the immediate future at least .

The Administration program is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the program are now very much inclined to regard the requests for statement of policy as a form of hidden opposition . In other words , they believe that business elements want to know future plans so that they may be in position to frustrate those plans . Until a very short time ago , Administration officials were inclined to scoff at the idea that business needed reassurance . They believed that the usual summer slump would not occur and that instead of the seasonal shading of commodity prices a gradual price increase would take place . That attitude no longer is held . However , the elements in the Administration which desire to drive through reform legislation at this time without much regard to the effects on business recovery still appear to be the dom.nating force . It is suite clear to some administration officials that a tapering of federal relief expenditures and budget balancing depends on business TCCON cry . However , the reform element is not primarily interested in balancing the budget .               @ @ @ @ @ @
