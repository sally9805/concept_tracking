txt Assessment Inequalities . To the Editor of The New York Times : The article in THE TIMES outlining the proposal suggested by the Institute for Public Service seems particularly appropriate right now . In making up more than 10,000 equity searches on all kinds of properties in Greater New York during the past year , it is very apparent that inequalities in assessment are the outstanding fault , and any movement which would serve to improve the conditions would be most welcome . We have just checked over about twenty blocks in Manhattan , and it is astounding to find such wide differences as we did in the reductions this year . We have not made a careful survey of the staff used in the Tax Department , but we believe that by reallocating of work it would be possible to make such a survey as has been proposed without adding employes to the payroll .
