txt In spite of the absence of official data on Chrysler Corp . ' s 1931 production and shipments to date . it becomes increasingly evident , from figures on March operations , that the company is experiencing an upturn in sales which may run as high as 50% over February . It also is likely that the corporation is earning its dividend by a comfortable margin . At the same time the cash account is showing a sharp increase . Chrysler division will ship 7,500 cars and Dodge Brothers 12,500 cars and commercial vehicles in March . The corresponding figures for February were 5,000 and 7,500. respectively . When March shipments for Plymouth and De Soto are included , total shipments of the corporation for March will reach somewhere between 24,000 and 25,000 units which will compare with 16,000 for February and 10,000 in January . In March 1930 the corporation shipped 33,778 vehicles and in February 1930 , 23 , - 105 units . Outward appearances at the plants and a conspicuous increase in the number of driveaway and carrier trucks on the highways confirm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nothing sensational in the corporation 's affairs , but inquirers are told " that business is becoming progressively better each week . " Began to Show Profit in February Following a minor loss in January it is understood that operations in early February began to show a fairly satisfactory profit . Under new conditions of reduced overhead and other costs , former methods of calculating profits by multiplying unit sales by profit a car must be revised , but of one point there is no doubt . That is that the so-called " pay point " in volume of output is much lower than it was prior to the readjustment of costs which took place in 1930 . There is little doubt in the minds of those who have long been familiar with the corporation 's affairs that the two principal divisions , Chrysler and Dodge Brothers , can make money on the volume of business handled in February . It also is believed that an average of $50 a car profit , taking sales of all divisions , can be used in estimating February and March operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would indicate net profits , after all cliaiges , of $800,000 . Sales of 25,000 units in . MarCh would indicate net profit of $1,250,000 ? ' or $2,050,000 for two months from which would be deducted the January loss , if any . With the first quarter dividend requiring $1,103.661 at the rate of 25 cents a share on 4,414,645 common shares , the net for the quarter could shrink almost half , and still cover the dividend . The thing that intrigues Chrysler enthusiasts here is a forecast of what profits may be if the current volume of business is bettered in April and if delayed replacement demand develops a straight run of business into October and November . It would be surprising if total sales in April and May did not exceed the 25,000 record for March . In the " recovery year " 1926 both the production and retail sales curves continued upward into May and later in the year they moved out of their normal trends and made still higher marks in August . In 1925 , after the let-down of 1924 , sales curves continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak for the year m October . Corporation 's cash holdings have increased about $6,000,000 since the turn of the year and now approach the $50,000,000 mark . When inssentories were declining as in 1930 it was not surprising to find cash increas:ng fast enough to offset operating losses . bu , this is the time of year when inventories begin to swell and the increase in cash is taken as tan almost sure indication that the profit curve is again running in the right direction . In the quarter ended December 31 , 1930 , Chrysler reported net profit of $234,155 or 5 cents a share on 4.414.645 no-par common shares . In the quarter ended March 31. 1930. net profit was $180,717 or 4 cents a share on 4,431 , - 575 common shares .
