txt The men of the Byrd Antarctic expedition were scattered all over Dunedin today , reveling in the shops , walking the hard pavements with joy at the unaccustomed sensation of not sinking in at every step , eating enormous meals and generally having the time of their lives . It seems too good to be true to be ashore again and dodging automobiles . Nothing could exceed the generous . hospitality of the New Zealand people . They literally turned the city ove .. to us ; and one must be careful of expressing a Avish for something , for it is immediately produced . The action of one man was typical . " My place is yours ; if you need anything until you get settled  --  clothes , money , anything at all ? it is waiting for you , " he said to a group of the men . That is Dunedin and New Zealand . The sincerity and warmth of the welcome are unmistakably real and deeply touching for men who had been so long without the pleasanter things of life .

Just when and how the return is to be made are questions yet undecided , as the ships need some overhauling , particularly the City of New York after her hard southern trip , A big reception was held last night in the City Hall , at which Mayor Black , P. A. de la Parrelle , the Minister of Internal Affairs , and Commander Hotham of the British Navy spoke in welcoming Admiral Byrd and his companions back from the ice . ? Admiral Byrd , replying briefly , said that he had merely followed ' in the footsteps of Mawson , Shackleton , Scott and Amundsen and others who had been the real pioneers and that he had greater admiration for them than ever before when he realized in the Antarctic what they had done without planes . What he had accomplished , he added , had been due to his men , sitting there behind him .

Z. , Tuesday , March 11 ** plaudits of civilization were received today by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and his party after fourteen months of exploration in the Antarctic , during which they flew the American flag - over the South Pole . All day crowds swarmed about his two ice-scarred vessels , the Eleanor Bolling and the City of New York , which yesterday entered Dunedin Harbor accompanied by a procession i of welcoming vessels . Not only Admiral Byrd , but every one of the forty-one men who with him braved the hardships and haz- ards of the polar regions , was warm1 ly greeted by this city of 85,000 , which often in the past has sent forth expeditions into that unknown region guarded by a barrier of ice encompassing mountains more than 114.000 feet high . Representatives of the New Zealand Government and members of the Dunedin committee of welcome paid tribute to Admiral Byrd as the . first man to fly over both the North and South Poles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' air . Admiral Byrd replied briefly . Although Admiral Byrd continued to stress other achievements , popular fancy clung to his flight with three companions over the South Pole . This flight , begun Nov. 28 from the Bay of Whales at the base of the Great Barrier , lasted seventeen hours and thirty-nine minutes . With Bernt Balchen at the controls , Byrd 's airplane forced its way over mountain tops and circled the pole , which is at an elevation of 9,069 feet . Unable to land at the Pole , the trimotored plane flew back to a depot at the Queen Maud Mountains , refueled and continued on to the Bay of Whales , Little America , Admiral Byrd 's main camp . Asked how it felt to fly over the South Pole , Admiral Byrd said : " Very much like flying over the North Pole , except the North Pole was bumpier . " His comment on the accomplishment of the expedition was brief . He said : " Surely the South Pole flight was not more important than the flight during which we discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the Ross Dependency . This I have named Marie Byrd Land ( in honor of his wife ) . " The six scientists with us worked seriously and the results should ( prove very useful . We surveyed 1280,000 square miles of hitherto unmapped country . "
