" Sure . But what about brains ? She actually believes everythingMother tells her . " " Lorene 1 " " Now , Dad , do n't pretend with me . " Bly tried to draw his lips to a stern line , but they broke intoa smile . " There ! Is n't it a relief to be yourself for a minute ? Makethe most of it , for I 'll soon be gone . " " Have you told your mother what you are going to do ? Admitting , of course , that you mean what you say . " " No . I 've been her thorn in the side for a long time , but Ica n't jab it into her heart . " " So I 'm the one to tell her . " " No other . That 's why I 'm letting you know . " " You little coward !

Oh , I know you are as pure as thedriven snow , but what about that rake-hell grandfather onmother 's side  --  the one that she never talks of ? This country was n't wicked enough for him . He had to make Paris hot . " " You and Bliss wait a little , Lorene . There is something else your mother has to learn about that will hurt her more than anything you can do .

" " And did n't tell me . " " I kept thinking that Martin would stop it . That he 'd get his fill . He 's not a rake , nor a fool . " " Lorene , you are a fine girl . Why could n't you and Raines Hamilton hit it off ? " " Oh , he 's going to be a bank president and an elder in the church . I could n't think of it . " " Well , dear , give me a little time . " " If you do n't spin it out . You see , we 're in love , and with bad blood on both sides  --  " " Oh , get along ! " She pressed his cheek in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but gently cool . Bly sat alone , not caring to smoke . Strangely he began to regret the dead peace of the morning . He had been driven from his vacuum , his last refuge . Refuge from what ? He did n't know . But sometimes the thing , the unnameable thing , crowded into his breast and packed his heart in ice . Sometimes it took him by the shoulders and made him peer over a precipice , bottomless and sheer . Verna 's Sunday nap was usually deep and long . Her room was on the same floor as Bly 's study , on the opposite side of the hall , a little farther back . When Bly came out he saw Lorene and Martin before her closed door , with Evelyn huddling behind them . " I 've got to wake her , Lo , " Martin was saying , " and take her on that drive . I 've got to get her out of the house before Harold Hamilton 's mother gets here . " " No good , Martin . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over . " " I 've got a scheme . You 'll all have to help me . " " Help you lie , Martin ? " asked Evelyn , desperately protesting . " Oh , the little Christian is here ! " Martin turned on her . Evelyn thought she was dying . That could n't be Martin ! He404 1saw what he had done and put his arm around her shoulders . " I did n't mean a thing , Ev ! Not a thing . You are a little Christian , you know , and we ought to have at least one in the house . Say , presh , I 'll tell you how you can help me , and no lying . Run down to the big room , leave the door open , and play Jesus Lover of My Soul ' with the loud pedal on . That 'll wake mom and we can go for the drive . There , wipe your eyes and run . " He dried her eyes for her , and she was off . " What does make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves are not right , or something . " Martin looked as if his own nerves were each contemplating a separate journey . Bly advanced . " Derry is coming down soon . He 'll get at the bottom of it if anything is wrong with Evelyn . What is your scheme , Martin ? " " You know what I 've been up to , dad ? What a sneak I'vebeen ? " " Yes . We 'll talk it out later . What is your immediate plan ? " " I want to get mother out of the house and keep her from seeing Ada Hamilton . Then I 'll persuade her to take me to Charleston tomorrow . We 've talked about going to the Gardens . Harold 's mother can blow off to you , and I 'll keep mom out as long as I can . We 'll go to Charleston , and when we get back folks will be ' tired of talking . I can confess after I'veI 've  --  " " Reformed ? " Bly was aghast and disgusted . His incredulity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boy ? " It 'll give us a chance to ease her down , Dad . She 'll take it better from me , and it does n't kill anybody to look back on dangers passed . " " And I 'm expected to uphold you in this  --  this  --  " A loud ring of the doorbell cut through the strains of the hymn coming from tilt living-room . It echoed like thunder to the little group in the hall . Martin was pitifully pale . " Worm ! " thought Bly . " I 'm not a coward , " said Martin , as if he had heard his father 's thought . " I do n't care a damn for the thing itself . I 'm not so ashamed of it either . I just ca n't hurt mother . " 42 " Kill her , you mean , " said Bly . The bell was rung a second time . Unexpectedly Bly found himself giving directions . " Lorene , take Mrs. Hamilton into the library . I will go down and keep her there until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to Martin . " Tell your mother that I have a welfare call from a sick family and ca n't go driving . Get her mind ready for that trip . You will leave early tomorow . Hurry her out , and do n't let her blunder into the library . " By the time Lorene was downstairs Liddy had shown Mrs. Hamilton into the living-room . Lorene swam up to her with graceful arms held out . " Oh , Mrs. Hamilton , how dear of you ! I suppose you heard that mother was ill and we are sending her away for a little while . " " I 've heard nothing of the sort . Is she really ill , Lorene ? " How very vulgar an angry mother can be , thought Lorene . " Martin thought a drive might help her , and persuaded her into the car . Father wants to see you . He 's anxious to talk to you , Mrs. Hamilton . If you 'll just come into the library where you will not be disturbed  --  " The library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into from the hall . Lorene , swimming around , before , and behind Mrs. Hamilton , got her into the more retired room . " In fact , Father thinks you can handle this situation as ably as Mr. Hamilton . Oh , here he is ! " Lorene vanished , closing the living-room door , and Bly was standing before the lady . He dropped to a seat beside her . " It 's a pleasure to see you , Ada . I only wish the occasion were happier . You have come about Harold ? " " I have come about Martin , " said the mother , leaving him under no delusion as to which boy was the more criminal . " Verna is overcome , " said Bly , gently . " She would be . You know we were in boarding-school together , Bly . " " Yes , I remember . " " I know Verna perhaps as well as you do . I am sure she would be overcome . " " When did you learn about it all , Ada ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been suspecting it for some time , and ferreted out the whole mess . Martin is the ring-leader . Harold has high ideals , but unfortunately is easilyinfluenced . I have n't been as careful about his associates as a mother ought to be . Of course the gambling will be stopped , but Harold refuses to give up Martin as a chum , and I have cometo ask Verna to see that her boy keeps away from mine . " Mrs. Hamilton unfolded her grievance . She unfolded it fortwo hours . At the end of that time Bly could succeed only in being numbly polite . As he took Ada to her car he revivedslightly , but relapsed when she said as she seated herself , " I may drive around after church tonight to tell Verna good-by . I hope the trip will do her good . As for myself , I could never run away from anything . Martin must be taking her for a very long drive . I 'm sorry that I could n't wait until she gotin . I intend to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not struck down . And I 'll come around afterwardsif I can . " " That will be very good of you , Ada . " She bethought herself , her hands on the wheel . " No , I can'tdo that . I promised Enoch that I 'd drive him around to Martha 's . He likes to play with that new baby . Well , I hope Verna will come back in better spirits and be able to do something with Martin . So long , Bly . You 've been comforting . But I 'm sorry I could n't see Verna . " When she had driven off Bly sat on the steps , dropping withfatigue . He was still there half an hour afterwards when Martin drove up with his mother . She was radiant , and talked toBly all the while Martin was putting up the car . " What do you think , Mr. Emberson , of my taking Martindown to the Gardens ? The lad seems fairly sick to go . " " What 's the matter with his going alone ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilgrimage tobeauty one always wants a companion . It doubles the pleasure . " " You feel well enough for the trip , Verna ? " " To be perfectly frank , Mr. Emberson , I never felt better inmy life . " " Fine l " 44 " I know it is hard to get hold of money now . . . " She waited for him to contradict her . " I can get the money , and I think you 've the right to a little pleasure . " " I ? It 's for Martin , you know . But of course I shall enjoyit too . There 's nothing that gives me more delight than to see my dear ones happy . " She went up to her room , softly humming , " Sun of my soul , my Savior dear . " Perhaps it was worth it , thought Bly , but he felt sucked out . He was an empty suit of clothes . When hegot up he thought he ought to fall back and lie on the stepslike a pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something alive . On Sunday evenings Liddy brought sandwiches , tea and milk to the living-room and left the family to serve themselves . Thisevening , when they foregathered , Verna was still glowing . She talked of the drive , pouring out vivid details . Dear Martin had refused again and again to bring her home . Positively refused , she repeated , reaching over with the intention of pattinghis cheek . He stooped to tie his shoe-lace , apparently , and received the pat on his head . " But I do feel selfish , " she said , " going again to the Gardenswhen I 've been several times already . Do n't you think you ought . to take Lorene , Martin ? " " There 's only one girl for this trip . " " It would n't be me anyway , mother . It would be Fairinda Ferrabee . " " Oh , that mill-girl ? Just because he was kind to her once and picked her up to save her a long walk . He could n't have done anything else , my boy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an act of chivalry , Lorene . " She smiled at her daughter , her spirits having risen until she could again take her into the family circle . " But is n't it time to be starting forchurch ? Who is ready ? I know you are , Evelyn , darling . " But Evelyn was still feeling her headache . Lorene declaredthat when she signed off for the morning she had signed offfor all day . Bly confessed to not feeling well , and his appearanceconfirmed it . Martin suggested that as father was notwell they all stay at home and have a little old-fashioned singing , 45with mother to read a chapter afterwards . Bly said he would like that , and Verna ran , like a girl , to bring her Bible fromher room . Bly groaned , and Martin said , " Darn shame ! But what elsecan we do ? " When Verna came back she selected a song that Evelyn couldplay . How sweet the name of Jesus soundsTo a believer 's ear ! Martin , Verna and Lorene sang . Bly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . He felt so weak that it was difficult for him to sit up in his chair . Verna selected the musical fourteenth chapter of John for reading , but she was barely on the first line when the doorbell sounded . They waited , and Liddy opened the door to Ada Hamilton . She walked into theliving-room talking crisply . All of her vim was in her voice . She did n't have Verna 's dignity or figure . Below the waist sheexpanded suddenly , like an old lady of the ante-bellum days , when food was meant to be eaten . Flat bosom , pinched shoulders , but a voice never discouraged . " Well 1 All here ! I found that I had time to rush by theLodge before the service , and I felt that I could n't let Vernaget away without a word . " Verna had advanced with bright welcome on her face . Shewould n't tell Ada about Harold and those boys . Not tonight . That could wait until she was home again and she could see Ada long and privately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of statuary , and that Ada 's voicehad a high , accusing ring . " You know about my going ? " That dear Martin , she reflected , must have had ' it all planned and told Harold about it . " How news gets around ! I was intending to slip away . Martin , you know , has never seen the Gardens . " " Oh , is that why you are going ? I see . You had to havean excuse . I used to envy you , Verna . You could always put forth such a plausible , indisputable reason for doing what you 46wanted to do . But how well you are looking ! From Bly 's account , I thought you were on the verge of prostration and Martin had dragged you out in an effort to revive you . That drive must have helped you wonderfully . I was expecting to find you wilted and weepy . Overcome , ' as Bly said . But I like your way of taking the blow . When disgrace strikes onemember of a family that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . That 's what I 'm doing . Nothing could keep mefrom the service tonight . I see you are having yours at home . " She glanced at the open Bible , and at Evelyn transfixed onthe piano stool . But she kept on talking , because no one else seemed to have any desire to speak . " I do n't believe in being too hard on young people , but I 'm not going so far as to give Harold a trip . We are not supposedto reward evil-doing , even if we do n't punish it . And if any of those boys deserves punishment , it is Martin . Youled them off , Martin , you know you did . Raines said so , and  --  " " Harold wo n't say it ! " cried Martin , making the first explosion . " I  --  I  --  " Verna began , " I do n't understand . " But she did understand . Her mind always worked in keen flashes on what immediately affected her . Back and forth it had flashed till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't understand , " and drooped faintly . Bly rose and put his armabout her . " Sit down , dear . Sit down . " She let herself be pressed to a seat . Evelyn crept to her side . " What do you mean , Ada ? Disgrace ? Martin ? Tell me ! Oh , what is it ? " Ada 's countenance passed from incredulity to belief . What a family ! They had actually contrived to keep the story from Verna and were going to spirit her away until the storm wasover . Martin , the most guilty , would be her companion . Ada 's admiration rose . " You precious people ! You make me regret that I spoiled such a perfect plan . " She looked at Bly , haggard and helpless . " I 'm sorry for you , Bly . You were an interminable liar this afternoon , but you were a gentleman too , and I know Verna. 47Well , I 've got to run along . Must n't make my entrance so latethat it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver , leaving you this way , with all the mischief I 've done . " The door closed upon her . Verna 's head lay on the back of her chair , her eyes staring at the ceiling . Her hands were motionlessin her lap . Her whole body was motionless . God ! she 's begun , thought Bly , wishing he could go to bedand sleep . " Mother ! " called Martin , from the corner where he had retreated . She closed the staring eyes . Another moment of waiting , and her lips moved in a whisper , " The Bible , Evelyn . " Evelyn got the Bible . " Eleventh psalm , " came the whisper , and Evelyn read in a voice that made queer broken sounds of thelines , In the Lord I put my trust : how say ye to my soul , Flee as abird to your mountain ? For , lo , the wicked bend their bow , they make ready their arrow upon the string , that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " Close it , " said the lips , almost without sound . Evelyn softlyclosed the book , glad that her stumbling voice could be still . Verna shut her eyes again , and after a moment repeated in acold , glassy , even tone , that gave the room the chill of a vault : " If the foundations be destroyed , what can the righteous do ? " " The ice-woman , " murmured Lorene . " Shut up ! " said Martin , fiercely . A flicker went over Verna'sface . Martin was defending her . " Father , " begged Lorene , " go upstairs . You simply wo n't befit for the office tomorrow if you do n't get out of this . Go , and take Evelyn with you . The child is run ragged . She'llbe sick . Martin will help me get mother to her room . " Bly came to Verna and touched her hair . " Do n't ! Don'ttouch me ! " Her voice was so bitter that he started away . " Go on , Dad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takeyour father to his study . " Evelyn took Bly by the arm and led him to the door . Verna , between her lashes , watched their retreating backs . Did Lorene think she could take charge in such an hour ? She 'd find out . " Come on , Martin . Get your arm around her waist . " Verna cried out that no one must touch her . But she knew that she had to get upstairs . " Very well , " said Lorene , hastily picking up a scarf . " Wrapthis around your arm , Martin . That will prevent contami-nation . " Verna was able to speak . " Lorene , leave the room . I will not take a step until you are out of my sight . " The words took all of her strength . She sank back on the chair as if life were gone . " You 'd better get out , Lo . " " Oh , pick her up , bub . You can carry her . " He tried to get Verna in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't , " he gasped . " A hundred and fifty pounds , and her like melted wax . Leave us , Lo ! Get out ! " He shouted it like a madman , and Lorene darted into the library . " Come on , precious ! Come on , beautiful ! " said Martin , leaning over her and pulling at her shoulders . She rose , pressed against him , and together they stumbled up the stairs . In her room , Martin lifted her to the bed . She stretched herself out , corpse-like , every line of her body a rigid protest against all externalmanifestation . Lorene had followed them into the room . " Is there anything more I can do for you , mother ? " Her voice was annoyingly capable , and the " more " was an insult . Had she done anything yet ? Verna kept her opposing rigidity , and Lorene spoke again , in the soft voice of consideration , unendurablysuperior . " I think we 'd better leave her , Martin . She does n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I turn out the light , mother ? " No answer from the chiselled figure . Out went the light . " You can reach the bed light if you need one . Andyour little Testament is right by you if you want to read . " Martin leaned over to kiss her good-night . They meant it ! They really were going . She would be alone . They were tiptoeingout . " Martin ! " came a faint voice from the bed . He hurried backto her . " Turn on the light , " more faintly . Then a dying whisper , " Call your father . " Lorene saw it had to be . " I 'll get him , Martin . " She went to her father 's study . Bly was in a dressing-gown , sitting by the table , waiting . Evelyn was lying on a lounge near him . " Quiet , " he said . " The child is asleep . " " I see you are waiting for the summons . I did my best , dad . " He rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lorene broke out . " It 's a damn shame ! " " Lorene , you are too hard on your mother . She has devoted her life to you children . " " That 's the whole trouble ! " At the bedside , Verna permitted Bly to take her stiffened hand . He rubbed it gently and laid it against his cheek . There was no response . As if no listener were in the room , she began to murmur , " Deceit ! Deceit ! And I am his mother . His mother . " Bly bent lower . " Darling , he deceived you only because he loved you so much . " The murmur continued : " Save me , 0 God , for the waters have come into my soul ! I sink in deep mire , where there is no standing ; I am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me . . . My boy ! Oh , how I have prayed over him ! I have held his hand in the great Father 's . I have prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has deceived me , his mother . I can pray no more . The sky is brass . The sky is brass . . . " Her voice sank , but the rigidity was gone . She was melting into the bed-clothes . Bly signalled Martin to come nearer . He came heavily , and knelt by the bed . " Forgive , Verna , " said Bly . " Forgive , as God commands us . As He himself forgives . " " Oh , I am human , human ! I am not God . I can not forgive . " But Bly felt her hand quiver . He knew she was longing to lay it on Martin 's bright head , and , lifting it , he placed it there . " My boy , my boy , " she whispered , " promise me  --  prom-ise  --  " " Oh , I do , mother ! I do ! I have touched cards for the last time . " So " Of course , Martin . But promise me that you will never deceive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obediently . " Oh , my son , I believe you ! " She put her arms around his neck . Bly breathed relief , unwisely loud . Verna withdrew her arms . " You may go to bed , dear Martin . Your father will stay with me . " " Please , mother , " said Lorene , " let me stay . Father has to work tomorrow . " " I think , Lorene , that your father is the one to decide which comes first , business or his wife . " There was vibrancy and strength in her voice that made Bly shudder . He would have a long , long night . For the first hour after Lorene and Martin left them together , he listened to Verna 's half-whispered recital of his shortcomings as a father . She had prayed in vain that he would take more interest in his children . Martin would never have strayed away under a father 's restraining hand . She had been left alone with only her prayers to help her . Self-exonerated , she summoned Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief from utter loneliness . There followed hours of struggle before she felt His presence and could say , " Oh , I know He is with me , Bly . He keeps His promise to the helpless . " But in her relief , it was her husband that she clung to , as if she confused him with the true Comforter . This was the hardest moment for Bly . He loathed himself in those twiningarms , meeting those full , passionate lips , that he loved only as the arms and lips of the woman who had borne his children and in some incredible , fleshly way walked in the footsteps of a vanished bride . At last she was sleeping , sleeping like a child , drawing strength for the battle that would be renewed with the day and for many days to come . Bly untwined her arms and hurriedly dressed . No house could hold him . In a few minutes he was out in open country , on his way to Clear River . The morning air was like a friendly touch on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven , were almost colloquially reassuring. 5 ' BRITT HENSLEY and his wife walked together about their new home . They had the lifting hearts of explorers , in spite of the feeling of familiarity always lingering about a place where generations have trod from birth to death . Those generations were easily adopted by Britt . He softly rubbed the weathered facings of doorways , and leaned against ancient apple trees with restful attachment . No lineal descendant of Jacob Holderness , shot by a Tory squad in one of the pre-revolutionary skirmishes of 1771 , could have felt more at home under the great oak in the barnyard or on the rock seat by the old well . The months in town at a carver 's bench had been torment for him . He had earned his money stolidly , neither swift nor clever at his work , longing to exchange his nibby tools for an axe that he could swing as high as his head , a hoe to bite the earth with , a plough whose handles he could grip while the loam crumbled and furrowed under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely on a chosen way , subject to none but wide-lapped mother earth and an indulgent father sun . Ishma turned twilit eyes on him in a way that warmed life and made it seem secure . " You 'll not be honing for the mountainsnow , will you , man Britt ? " " What you mean ? They ai n't been botherin ' my mind . " But she knew he had yearned his heart sore . " There 'll be room to turn your plough here . " " Ay , a feller 'll not be fallin ' out of his field , as they say of us up there . " His eyes roved the land , which was by no means level but variously undulating , with tucked-in surprises and unexpected horizons . Piedmont land . " A man can stop here an ' his feet not be wantin ' to run from under him . Lucky for us , Jim Holder 's wife would ruther be runnin ' a boardin ' house in Denver . Jim did n't much want to leave the farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An ' all I 've got to do is to pay the taxes an ' take keer of the land . " " Till they come back . " " I 'll not be lookin ' for ' em . It 's a long way to Colorado . We wo n't make any money , but we 'll live good . We 'll not be afraid to ask folks to our table . They can put up for a week if they 're a mind to . Some o ' yore friends , now , out of a job  --  we 'll clean up that big , back room an ' let ' em come an ' go . " Ishma caught his hand , her eyes eagerly smoldering . " How do you always know what I 'm wanting , Britt ? " " ' Cause I know you , I reckon . You do n't s'pose I 'm just thinkin ' about pleasin ' myself on this old farm ? " " You do n't mind when folks say you are too good for me ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook the white buds above their heads , making a showery scandal in that delicate congregation . " I 'm not going to get so good I 'll have to die . You need n't count on that , big girl . " She gave his hand a tighter squeeze . " Do n't talk about dying , Britt . That 's something I ca n't joke about  --  your leaving me . " He turned his head away , abashed by his rush of feeling , and his eyes , searching for an indifferent subject , caught up the old barn . " That roof 's got to be tidied up , but it 's risky to tear at the moss on it . The whole sky will fall in . " But this was criticism , and he hastily covered his lapse . " What a big , cool place it 'll be on hot days I " To Ishma it looked like a rat nursery , where bigger and better rats might feed happily on Britt 's industry . But she said hopefully , " Let 's look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to throw the big doors open . They sagged , and hugged the ground disconcertingly . And if he was n't careful he 'd tear them to pieces . " The hinges have to be re-set , " he said lightly , as if that were only a minute 's work . " And ai n't they big ones ? That old shack up the road used to be a Quaker blacksmith shop . I bet these hinges were made there fifty years ago . You ca n't find their like now . " 53CHAPTER IIIHOLDERNESS She looked at the years of rust on them . " Will you ever get those screws out , Britt ? " " I 'll put oil on ' em for about a week , to make ' em willin ' . " He ceased straining , and the doors were wide . But the win- dow openings , long free of glass , were covered with boards . There was no scurry as the doors opened , but they knew the rats were there , cunningly hidden . Ishma could feel their beady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited a little before burrowing deeper to safety . Their odor mingled with reminis- cent smells of hay , shucks , corn , rye , and old leather . She was enveloped by a blanket of mouldy air from the cavern inside . Britt went in and began tearing at a window . " Gee ! The rats smell like patriarchs . My neighbor , Tom Jeff Ferrabee , has got a dog that 'll thin them out quicker ' n poison . " Ishma tried not to cough as the mouldy air struck her and tightened her throat . The dark mouth of the barn was like an opening in dead time . She lived so much in her prophetic world that the present sometimes seemed half unreal . And here was the past , ready to swallow her . But Britt was in there . She was about to follow , when he came out saying they would let the thing air . There was plenty to look at besides the barn . " You have n't seen inside the well-house yet . " " But I see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides , meets above the roof , and makes a thick , green thatch over it . A living thatch , Britt . The vine on the chimney at Cloudy Knob was n't so big and old as that . " They crossed the yard to the well-house , and Britt threw open the doors proudly . The floor shone , likewise the water-box . He had carried out the rotten planks and rebuilt the falling sides of the box . The bottom was made of white pebbles , six inches deep . " Cover that twice a day with fresh water and you could n't keep milk sweeter . I 'll draw the water night an ' mornin ' . The well is so deep the water 's like ice , and you ca n't draw it out with lookin ' at it . " Ishma lifted her wrists to remind him of her strength and the years when she had wrestled with a mountain farm for a living . " But if you 're goin ' to work in town , " he said , " that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face shadowed over , and a dark line ran upward on each side of his young mouth . It did n't suit him for his wife to " work in town , " but they had talked it over a hundred times and there seemed no other way . Some one must make a little money to get the things that the farm could not supply . " If you make the living , Britt , " she told him ; " if you give us food and bed and shelter , and do all the work , you 'll have to let me buy our clothes , and anything else that we must have . If you do sell a bit of stuff now and then , you 'll have to pay the proceeds right out for tools and repairs to keep the farm going . " " Maybe , the first year , but after that  --  " She did n't discourage him . Hope was his chief asset , and she must keep it alive . " That water-box is the sweetest place I ever saw for milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' after Cloudy Knob . " " I 'll be putting up shelves for you the first rainy day . " " Do n't hurry with everything . We can take our time , my man , " she said tenderly . Britt 's clear skin flushed , as it always did whenever his wife spoke to him with that special music of love in her voice . He ought to be over that , after so many years , but the tingling color always came . It was a sort of happy game with Ishma , making his " skin breathe . " " Did you go to see that cow ? " This in her most efficient voice , and Britt 's flush subsided . " We do n't want her . She 's twelve years old . " " But cheap . And still a heavy milker . We can raise a young one from her . " " Tom Jeff Ferrabee ought to be comin ' over . " " You 've said that three times . What 's behind it ? " " A young Guernsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . " " But the price , honey ! We have to spend carefully . Our pile would n't be more than a few inches high if it were all in pennies . " " She 's not costin ' a dollar . " His wife 's face grew serious . It was so easy for Britt to fall55under an obligation , helped to it by a kind neighbor . He understoodher look , and hastened to explain . " Ferrabee has lost his farm to the bank . He 'll lose his cow too if I do n't take her . And he likes his cow . She was n't born when he gave the mortgage on his farm and stock . He ' lows she 's his , and so do I. If they go to town , they 'll have only two rooms . He takes it as a favor , our keepin ' the cow for him . He 's that kind of a man . The calf he 's givin ' ' me for keeps . It 's a little bull , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rye for him to get fat on . You ought to see my rye field now . Jim Holder sowed it last October , ' fore he left . It 'll be for mowing in July . I can show it to you from that little rise there . " They went to the top of the rise and saw the rye field stretchingaway , throbbing with the wind , like the green heart of April . But Ishma looked farther , into the winter , and could almost smell the rye bread on the hearth . " Have we got a hearth oven , Britt ? " " I 'll show you , " he said , with reserve . He was keeping the kitchen for the last thrill . " Oh , I see you 've got that big field ploughed ! " " Planted too . " " And there 's a horse in the pasture I " " Ay , that 's Ferrabee 's . He brought him over and asked me to plough him . He 's young , and was gettin ' so frisky he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he use him ? " " What for , when he 's losin ' the farm ? He 's givin ' the bank enough without throwin ' in a lot of ploughin ' . He got this colt from a man ' tother side of Dunmow after the mortgage was signed . The bank ca n't tech that horse . But Ferrabee wants me to keep it over here so he 'll not be bothered with questions . " " And you 've been ploughing him . " " Me an ' Tom Jeff . He ploughed a good lot o ' that field , and would n't take a cent . " Ishma 's misgivings were renewed , but she kept silent . " If I had a doubt in the world as to Tom Jeff 's rights to that horse , I would n't give him standin ' room on my place . " 56 " No , you would n't . But I wonder if that old morality is anything to be proud of , Britt ? Crystallizing injustice till you have to shape your bleeding soul to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech him either . " " I do n't suppose I would , " she admitted slowly . " We 've all lived in the old trap so long it seems a part of us . But  --  " " But look there ! ' He gestured to the woodland beyond the pasture . It was not a far-reaching wood , though it looked deep and extensive . Twenty acres at most , a strip much longer than wide , with one end touching Clear River which formed the north boundary of the farm for half a mile before turning east and away from Holderness . It was a clean , cool wood , full of darting birds and shadows . Nearly all the timber in the countryhad been devoured by Dunmow 's furniture industry . Jim Holder had persistently refused to sell this last bit on his farm , saying that the measly little pile of money offered for it did n't look so good to him as the trees . They were safe in Britt 's care , for much of his pleasure in the place lay in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ishma 's gaze kept coming back to it and resting there . At its edge was a Judas tree , still a vivid pink , though it was late for such a show . " I never saw a red-bud as big as that in the mountains , did you , Britt ? " He told her that she would see lots of things down here masterous big . " There 's a vine out there as thick , where it comes out of the ground , as my thigh . I thought it was a new sort of tree till I looked up and caught it twistin ' around an oak like it was huggin ' its mammy , and then runnin ' away to the tops of three or four other trees . I do n't know what it is , but you 'll find out , I reckon . It 's got a tiny purple flower , but not many . I picked one up where it had shattered off , an ' it smelt like poplar honey . There 's lots to see down here , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see how you 've got so much done , Britt . Shall we go back to the house now ? " " We 'll go through the orchard . There 's a trail right to the kitchen door . " They took the path through the grass that was already a foot high . " I 'll have to cut this with a scythe . Ca n't get the mower in here , the trees are so close . " 57 " A mower , Britt ? A mowing machine ? " " Tom Jeff is goin ' to set hisn right over here . We wo n't have to bother about not gettin ' to cut the hay at the right time , waitin ' to borrow . " His wife gave him a helpless look . " It 's all right , big girl . A man died who was owin ' Tom Jeff , an ' his widow begged him to take the machine off her hands for the debt . It do n't figger in the mortgage he gave the bank . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right or wrong . And we do n't mean to let ' em find it . " Ishma began to laugh . Her laughter flowed over Britt , catchinghim up in a musical gale . She did n't stop until his forehead was a frowny network and he had begun to dig the ground with his iron-tipped shoe heel . " Come on 1 " She took his hand . " Let 's look at these wise old apple trees . They are as old as Granpap Frady 's . Did you ever see lovelier moss-gray bark ? " " What made you laugh like that ? " " Two old conspirators  --  you and Tom Jeff . I hope you save your necks . " " I swear , Ishma , we h'ai n't the faintest notion of cheatin ' the bank . " " Of course not . " " You said ' conspirators . ' " " Ca n't you conspire for right as well as for wrong ? " " It 's nothin ' to laugh at . A man losin ' his only way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How much family ? " " Two little boys  --  babies , just about  --  a wife  --  and a girl by his first wife . She 's goin ' to work in town . " " And live with them in the two rooms ? " " She 'll stay with an aunt . But there 's an awful big family there , and the man out of work . Her board money will help out . " They walked toward the house under a tall grape arbor where the air seemed thin and acid after the thick pockets of orchard fragrance they had pushed through . Out of the arbor they stopped by a short row of little bee houses , each ' painted white , 58and with a green cupola . Britt did n't care for the society of bees , but Ishma held out her hands and let two or three stragglerslight on the back of them . She liked bees . They knew how to work and fly too . It was n't true that they toiled senselessly , ever mass-driven . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching it and leaving it , coming back and flipping it at a new angle , trying every point of the compass on its petals , before settling down to drink of its heart , or perhaps fly away in contemptuous , loitering circuit , disdaining a feast unfit for a bee 's royal taste  --  how could anyone watch that , and then talk of its slave life ? The greater part of a bee 's life was spent under the sky , on wings , and alone . And did one ever hurry ? " Ned is not afraid of them , " said Britt . " He laid down on the grass yesterday and let them crawl over his face . I give you and Ned the bees , and welcome . But I 'll make the new hives when we need ' em . Tom Jeff says he 'll show me how to make these modern ones , two-story and a roof-parlor . They 'll be swarmin ' next month , and I 'll have to be ready . We 'll get at it the first rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind because of rainy weather , but you 'll be out of luck if it is n't a rainy season , you 're laying out so much for the wet days . " " Tom Jeff will help me  --  if he stays around here  --  " " But he has taken two rooms in town , has n't he ? " " He do n't have to keep ' em . " Ishma moved on , but stopped by every bush , making her smiles and comments more frequent for Britt 's sake , as she found it more difficult to accept her happiness and keep her mind from the struggle she had left behind her in the town . " You cut the grass with neighbor Ferrabee 's lawn-mower , I suppose . I see it leaning against that pear tree . " " I did n't ask him for it . He brought it over in his car , with the potatoes . " She decided not to register " potatoes . " " He 's got a car , has he ? " " Awful old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " 59 " There 's a lot of parts that Joe Cunliffe gave Tom Jeff when he patched it up for him . He 's goin ' to keep them . It ai n't likely the bank will want the rest of it . " They were at the kitchen door . There was only one step  --  a slab of rock  --  wide and hospitable . Britt turned the door knob with an unsuccessful effort at nonchalance . Ishma saw his nervous grip on the knob and prepared to be enthusiastic as he threw the door open . But no preparation was needed . Her enthusiasm was unfeigned . The length of the kitchen was double its breadth , and that was more than generous . There were large windows wide open letting in waves of sweet air . At one end was a cook-stove , but Ishma 's eyes were on the big fireplace , with a real ingle-nook and bench , and such pots and pans ! " We 'll get an oil stove for the summer , " Britt hastened to assureher . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and bread from that oven ! I wish Granny Stark could see it ! " " Run your hand over this table , honiest ! It 's more'n a hundredyears old . Two hundred , maybe . Not a bit of varnish on it , and polished like glass . And so big you can have all your mill buddies out for Christmas dinner . " " Oh , Britt ! And that little one by the window is just right for us three . We 'll have supper there . " " Ned is sure to bring some fish . I 'll make a fire in the fireplace and cook ' em . " " How did you get the kitchen so clean , Britt ? " She was opening the pantry . " Mrs. Holder must have been a wonderful housekeeper . Look at these empty jars . Hundreds of them , and shining like sunlight . " Britt looked embarrassed . " Did you wash them , sir ? " " I had some help . " " It was never Tom Jeff . A man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deely . His wife . " " Oh ! She 's been here too ! That accounts for the rooms all swept , and the windows without a speck on them . And I 've been thinking of you as my miracle-man . " She sat down in the kitchen rocker , and Britt sat on one of its stout arms . " Ai n't we lucky , big girl ? " " I 've never heard of such luck , Britt . Or such neighbors . " " There 's a room upstairs I did n't show you . " " I noticed that . Have you got Deely locked up in it ? " " No . Fairinda fixed up that room . The girl , you know . " " The girl I do n't know . She has a lovely name . I supposeit suits her . Gold hair , blue eyes , and a fluttering angel figure ? " Britt stared . " You do know her ? " Ishma rose up , laughing . " Come on , old helpless ! " The upstairs room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sunlight came through the window . At the end a stupendous white pine stood far enough away to admit the air , and near enough to supply cool shade . The furniture was old , massive , dully gleaming . There was nothing like it in the other rooms . Here was treasure . " Why did n't Sue Holder sell these things if she did n't want them ? I know what it means , Britt . She 's coming back . " " Oh , this ai n't Holder furniture . It 's Fairinda 's . It belonged to her mother , and she left it to Fairinda . Tom Jeff could n't sign it away , ' cause it was n't his . He wanted me to save it for Fairinda , and how could I refuse when we had so much room ? They said we could use it . This 'll be our room . " " I do n't want it , Britt . I do n't like dark , heavy things . I like that other big room across the hall where that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it dance . I 'll paint it rose-pink , and the walls sky-blue . " " Fine ! I do n't keer for this either . " " We 'll let Deely and Tom Jeff have this room . " " Honest ! What you mean ? " " Would you mind , Britt ? " Her smile was so sweet that he did n't suspect her of teasing . " Why , I 'd like it . The house is so big they would n't be in the way , and they wo n't cost anything , for I 'll make plenty to eat . " " Cost ? With their cow for milk and butter , their calf for beef , and their horse , and all the other things to save us from buying ? And I know Deely counts on doing the canning bythe way she washed those jars . I 'll not have to stay away from work next week to help get settled . " " You will too , by golly ! You promised me a week . " The look he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes with a crescent of bloom . Britt did n't have to do all the blushing in the family . They heard Ned whistling , and moved together to the window , as eager as if a beloved guest were arriving . Their child was not just a small person to be put off and on with familiar tyranny . He had been staying on the farm with Britt , riding the bus in to school . His mother had kept at her work until Saturdaynoon , and all the week he had not seen her . There had been a struggle in his mind between staying at home for the afternoon , watching her discover the place , and the maturer conclusion that his daddy ought to be sole showman of the day . Besides , fishing was good , and what about providing the first family supper in the new home ? He saw them at the upper window and waved his catch , a rock fish and two bass , that flashed in the sun . Ishma 's eyes met his in silent greeting , and Britt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Twelve inches ! " called Ned , and went on to the well . They began talking of him in the usual way of parents where there is only one child , finding freshness in the thousandth repetition . " I 'm glad he likes to wear shorts , " said his mother . " He outgrowsa pair of trousers in two months . " " Ca n't come under my arm now by an inch . " Britt gave his arm a horizontal stretch to show her that her son was tall indeed , though she knew his height to the fraction of a millimeter . " When I told Ferrabee that Ned was only twelve , he said , Come on , farmer , put three years to that ! ' What you think about his school now , Ishma ? Better satisfied ? " " I 've found out that it ca n't hurt Ned . He will always do his own thinking . " " You mean he 'll do yours . You 're just alike . " " Why , Britt , you know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes , and your ways and thoughts . " " Well ? " 62 " Golly , I 'm satisfied ! " He caught her in both arms and kissed the red to her cheeks . But his compelling blood did not keep him from making sure that his son was not in sight . Ned had drawn water and was cleaning the fish . If you were making a " tan-bark stew , " you would put the fish through seventeen waters , according to Sam Woods , the revered local authority , whom no one contradicted because a taste from his pot silenced all dissenters . But for simple broiling , three waters was enough , and Ned soon had the fish ready for the pan . Britt kindled a small fire in the fireplace , which was so big and black that they could easily imagine they were around a campfirein the open night . He broiled the fish , while Ishma stirred up corn cakes with buttermilk brought from the Ferrabees . There was lettuce , there were tomatoes , from the Ferrabees . She toasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with peach preserves  --  from the Ferrabees . " It 's a good way to get used to them , " she said . " We 'll hardly know it when they arrive . " " They 're not coming until Monday , " said Ned . Ishma was down before the fire inspecting the fish . She lifted her head quickly . So it was all settled before she came . Britt looked guilty , but Ned was serene . " We told them we knew exactly what you would do without waiting to ask you . They were awfully worried  --  standing mighty nigh on their heads  --  were n't they , dad ? Fairinda wanted to go into town and see you , mother , but I told her she did n't have to , and she 'd know why soon as she looked at you . " " You 're pretty sure of me , are n't you , son ? " Her low laughterstarted their own and made a harmony in the room . After supper they sat long at the table . There was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comfort of being together . There would be time for talking in the days ahead . Ishma forgot that she was not to be a constant presence in those days . She forgot the town , that burning face of consciousness revealing itself through a mesh of struggle , perplexity and pain . The soft dusk fell like a great cushion between her and life that ached and starved . Could any future for mankind offer more than the daily , fulfilling touch of love ? She knew better , but63she played with the belief , more abandoned to the moment because she knew its brevity . She was tired , and when Ned began to talk contented herself with the sound of his voice , hearing his words as an indistinguishableflow . But he had a keen audience in Britt . " I ca n't catch any more fish where I got our supper . There 's a kingfisher 's tunnel in the bank , and he kept on guard all the time I sat there . His wife was inside and he warned her not to come out until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she flew out . I 'll not fish there again , but I was wanting to try a new place anyway . " " How 's the tackle Tom Jeff gave you ? Good for bass ? " " You bet it is . " Ned rose from the table . " He 'll want to bring Mrs. Ferrabee 's chickens over tonight . The bank 'll get ' em Monday . I 'd better shoot across and help him , dad . " Ishma heard that . " How far is it , son ? " " A mile and a piece . " He stepped off , so untroubled by his mission that his walk became a casual saunter before he was out of sight . " He did n't ask me to go , " said Britt . " Did you want to ? " " You know I did n't . " " He knew it too . And do n't think it will be a lonely walk for him . He is looking for everything that moves or flies in the dusk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The swallows were dipping low , but he had already learned from Tom Jeff that this was no sign of rain on the farm , because the air was heavy along the edge of the wood and over the slow stream where the birds were circling . Gnats and flies , and slight winged things did not rise high there at any time , so neither did the swallows that fed on them . He hoped he would see an owl . Owls were the keepers of the wood , and when one ruffled leisurely and unafraid across his road he took it as a welcome to their quarters and was no longer a trespasser . He loved the night , so full of life that one could know nothing about so long as the great lid of the sun was clapped over earth . The woods , the fields , the banks of64the stream , were suddenly peopled , almost crowded . From every direction came voices of little creatures trying to tell him who and what they were . He played a game with himself in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , he gave himself a point . Those that he did n't know were scored for the woods . It was a good game . He 'd teach it to Jim Vesy and Art Cunliffe when they came out for Saturday nights . His school pals , who regarded the farm as partly their own acquisition . Deely had fifty fine Rhode Islands , and three bunches of young ones " nigh ready for the frying-pan . " After they were safely sheltered at Holderness , though it was late , Tom Jeff and Britt decided to bring the cow and calf over . " When it 's a case of savin ' a cow , it do n't go against the Almighty to take a little time from Sunday , " said Tom Jeff . " Do n't you know , " asked Ishma , after she had taken his ready hand in friendship , " that farmers out West are getting together and stopping such sales ? Is n't it time for Southern farmers to find their back-bone ? " " Lordy , go against the banks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt was a debt , and Jim Carter did let him have the money . He 'd save as much as he could though . The cow was his , the horse was his , and the mowing machine . He 'd get that later . It was safely hidden under a pile of straw innocently heaped up until you could n't tell it from the other big stacks around it . Ishma looked despairingly at Britt . He was one of the local farmers now . Why did n't he help organize them ? Britt tried to look away , but she made him face her . Well , he was too new , he said . He 'd have to get a foothold in the neighborhood before folks would listen to him . Could n't she see that ? She did , but she felt there was more than that to his hesitation . He was wanting her to let him alone  --  let him keep the peace he had found  --  above all , to come into it with him . His little sixteenth-century peace , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better for the cow to be milked by a familiar hand on the first day in her new home , and said that he , or Deely , would be over by milkin ' time next morning . But it was Fairinda who came . Everybody rose late that Sun-6Sday at I-lolderness . Fairinda petted and sleeked and milked the cow , not hearing a stir or seeing a soul . She strained the milk and decided to leave it in the well-house without drawing fresh water for the box . That would be a noisy process and disturb the sleepers . She was carefully closing the well-house door when she heard a step behind her and turned to see Britt . He gave her a merry greeting and began to let the bucket down into the well . " Wo n't you wake Mrs. Hensley ? " " Wake her ! We 've been awake for an hour , lyin ' up there talkin ' about the fortune we 're goin ' to make on Holder farm . You slipped in quiet as a weasel comin ' for chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-house door . I meant to help milk . Here , keep your hands off that chain ! " Fairinda , in her embarrassment , had started to pull the bucket from the well . He took the chain from her and drew the water up , his hands playing with the task while he looked at her . What a slim little thing she was ! And cheeks as pink as the weigela buds behind her . She looked as if she were flowering out of the bush . Ishma , watching from an upstairs window , was thinking the same thing , and a little more . The young face upturned to Britt 's seemed related to the sky rather than earth . But earth would put up claws and draw it down ; smudge it with salt tears , the stripes of toil , the clay of too early graves . Work in town ! Nothing could protect that slight figure from its losing fight with the machine , wasting hours of overwork , the crude hands of passion , the heavy load of unpreparedand bewildered maternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting god , and no doubt ready to interpose himself between her and any dragon that might dart forth on her path . Ishma loved him so much , she wished she could give him a daughter like that , on whom he could spend his protectiveimpulses . Neither she nor Ned would ever fill that particularwant of his . But what of the day when he must find that he could not protect that beloved fragility ? However he shouted and waved his arms , she must become food for the dragons . Yes , Fairinda was lovely . Ishma found another metaphor . 66Children like that were thrown to a changing world as chips to a boiling sea . She thought of the sea-going duck that carries its young far on the water , safe on its back , then glides from under them , leaving them to the waves . How secure they were compared with the children of men struggling in this strange , encompassing element of change ! And the old were as helpless as the young . What could Tom Jeff do for Fairinda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now would not work  --  would not build the ark of rescue or saving raft ? Fairinda did not see Ishma at the window . Her father had said no more to her about the whispers concerning Ishma , whispersthat might or might not be unjust . He had forgotten them , wrapped in his sudden friendship for Britt . Everything connected with his new neighbor must be all right . But Fairindahad not forgotten , and she was tenderly sorry for the gorgeous Britt , troubled with a wife who could , maybe , do him wrong . He had finished pouring water into the milk-box , and she prepared to go . " Tom Jeff said he 'd come for you all in the flivver by the time you are ready to go to church . " " Church ? Oh , we 're not going . " He was amused by the reproach in her eyes . " We 'll take a long ramble , I guess . Maybe go as far as Buffalo Bridge . I want to show my wife the river along there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My wife was n't here then , and I felt lonesome . But I never go when she 's around . " Fairinda felt frightened . Was his wife a demon-woman , destroyinghis soul too ? She picked up the bucket into which Britt had poured the greater part of the milk , and was leaving with a mumbled good-by , when Ishma came out to the well . " Wait , Fairinda ! We must get acquainted . " Fairinda turned , and was looking at a graceful woman nearlyif not quite as tall as Britt . Her eyes were big and slate-gray , but you saw they were kind before you knew their color . Herhair was dark and short . It lay in flat ringlets as big as a silverdollar , close to her head . Her forehead was broad and white ; 67her mouth tender , and ready to smile . Fairinda saw all that before she set her bucket down and moved toward her . She wanted to touch this woman 's hand , or dress . She wished that she would stoop and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly more than a squeak , she said , " I am glad to meet you , Mrs. Hensley . " " You mean Ishma , do n't you ? We are going to be one family , are n't we ? " Fairinda felt more comfortable . Her voice returned to her . " It 's perfectly wonderful , your taking us in . Father would die in two rooms . " " It 's a great piece of luck for us . " Fairinda was about to cry . She grabbed her bucket , and explainedthat she had left the flivver down the road , afraid that she might disturb them if she drove up to the house so early . Britt began to draw water for breakfast preparations . The well-chain caught on a projection inside the rock frame that protectedthe well . Leaning over , inside the frame , to unfasten the chain , his foot slipped . Fairinda was watching him , standingwhere the full light fell upon her . With Britt 's sudden loss of balance , she gave out a cry , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor thing , thought Ishma . The poor little thing ! IN the kitchen , happy with cooking maneuvers , Britt once more opened the sore subject . Would n't Ishma stay at home , now they were getting so much help from the Ferrabees , and nothing to buy for awhile ? " No , Britt . " " You would n't stay if you could . " " You are right . I would n't . You know we 're going to change the world so that young things like Fairinda wo n't have to fight a death battle for a living . I have to be where I can help the most . " " Looks like we could keep Fairinda out of it ourselves . She would n't cost nothin ' at our table . " " She 's all they have to depend upon for money , Britt . " " Well , she need n't stay in town at night , crowdin ' in with 68that big family . She can stay out here , and go with you in Minnie Landers ' car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed up . " " No , Britt . She 's so young --  so eager  --  ready to be loved  --  ready to give herself in love . It would be easy for her to lose her head about you . " " Ishma ! That 's the only crazy notion you ever had . I 'm an old husband  --  married eleven years  --  and she 's  --  she 's  --  " " Oh , she 's dew and morning ! But young hearts are not tough hearts . A hurt goes deep . And what 's the use of that , even if they do get over it quickly ? " " She would n't think of me that way for a minute . And you know that I  --  I  --  " " Yes , I 'm as sure of you as the earth of its sun . But let 's think of her , Britt . I 'm right , big man . " Suddenly he remembered the look Fairinda had given him in the starlit field . " Ay , you know best , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine company without saying a word , and made the table ready . When he spoke it was about Fairinda , " She 's good fun , for a girl . Is she going to stay with us ? " " No , " said his mother . " She 'll stay in town . " " Ay , " confirmed Britt . " She 'll stay in town . " THE late breakfast over , all three helped to tidy the kitchen . " Is that a neighbor ? " asked Ishma , looking out as a young man passed down the road . " Ern Starbo . Fairinda 's friend . He 's goin ' to take her to church . " " He walks a little queer , does n't he ? Fast , and then slow , then fast again . " " I guess that 's because he hates to go to church but has to , " said Ned . " For Fairinda ? " " No , his mother . She 'd die if he did n't go , Tom Jeff told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to borrow a singletree . He did n't want to go there for it , but ever'body else was busy ploughin ' and needed what they had . He said he did n't like to look at Mrs. Starbo . Said he got sort o ' sick whenever he saw her . " 69 " What 's the matter with her , son ? Is she sick , or just ternpersome ? " asked Britt . " Neither one , I reckon . She 's grievin ' . Sits all day by the window lookin ' over to the hill where Rafe Starbo is buried . He was her other son . Older than Ern . " " Ever'body dies one day or another . Kai n't she take it like the rest of us ? " " This was different , the way Tom Jeff told me . It was n't just dyin ' . Rafe was a jolly feller . He 'd go to dances , and was learnin ' to play the fiddle . He could sing too , better'n anybody around here . He 'd sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd let him dance at home too  --  do his clogs and fancy steps . They had a good time . " " And she ca n't give him up , " murmured Ishma , hanging a pan on its nail and turning to feed her eyes on Ned . " He was drowned . In Charm Lake , on a Sunday night . A lot of young folks went out there to go swimmin ' . Mrs. Starbo went along to look after the girls , and I reckon she liked to swim too . She was gay , and right good-lookin ' , Tom Jeff says . Her man had been dead ten years . She could have married again any time , but she said she 'd wait till her boys stepped off , and they need n't hurry on her account . She thought a master sight of her boys . But some of the church folks felt she was leadin ' ' em wrong , and they talked to her about , it . She told them that if it was right to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was goin ' to see that her boys did n't lose their chance . " Ned paused to put up a broom , and looked out of the door . " Tom Jeff 'll tell you the rest of it . Ai n't this a fine day for goin ' to the river ! " But Britt would n't let him off . " You tell it now . Do n't leave us hangin ' up . " " It do n't go good . Rafe took the cramps or something , and was drowned all of a sudden . His mother fainted , and was hours comin ' to . Then she got up and made a big funeral for him . Mortgaged the place for it  --  car and everything . Got the finest casket in Dunmow , and filled the church with flowers . Paid a preacher with a big name to come up from 70Raleigh . He was a man , they said , who could bury the devil and persuade God to take him to Heaven . Mrs. Starbo was afraid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she answered them like she did . And they 'd talked a lot about her jollyfyin ' with the boys . It might have gone all right , but they got madder than ever when she called the big preacher in . They made up a delegation of the best people to meet him and let him know how it was . They told him this wicked young man had been called by God as a warning to all the other young people who were rushing to destruction . If he really wanted to do God 's work , he 'd preach a sermon that the young people would never forget . " " And the mother hearin ' it ? " " Yes , dad . They told him they 'd get him to come back and hold their union revival in the fall , and they had a lot of good citizens who would see that he was paid what he ought to get for his work . They told him he need n't mind hurtin ' the mother 's feelin 's , ' cause that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong and bring her back to God . If a boy could live like Rafe Starbo , and then get the biggest funeral that ever was in the country  --  except old Senator Renfrow 's  --  the church might as well go out of business . They put it a little different to him , I reckon , but that 's what they meant . And the preacher said leave it to him . He 'd take care of it . " Ishma felt that she could n't listen any longer , knowing what was coming . But Britt must have the end of it . " Tom Jeff said it was a terrible sermon . He said it made even the old Christians , that already had their haloes ordered , shake in their seats . He opened hell right there in the middle of the church and put Rafe Starbo into it , with all the flowers and ribbons and fine casket . He could talk , Tom Jeff said . The girls ' faces were all smeared with tears and their hats fallin ' off . The boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's face was a pale remonstrance . " Oh , how could they ! Would nobody stop him ? That poor mother ! And it drove her crazy . " " Not like you think . She looked mad at first , like she was goin ' to fly at the preacher and kill him , but when he went on71she got still and white , and at last she began to believe him and fell in a faint worse than the one she had when Rafe was drowned . She did n't know anything till next morning . The preacher stayed over , ' cause he said she 'd wake up converted and want to see him . And she did , just like he said . She sent for him and he sat by her and told her she was saved , that God had worked this wonderful plan to save souls , and it was up to her now to see that her other boy went right and help all the young people in the community . And that 's why poor old Ern has to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff says . " Ishma was too angry to cry . " And she sits there by the windowlooking at his grave ? " " All the time , except when she 's asleep , and sometimes she sleeps all night by the window . When she 's got her eyes on his grave , she can feel more like he 's there , and not in hell . It seems to help her a little . She sits there with her Bible in her lap starin ' out at the grave . She had his body taken up and his grave made on the hill where she could look at it . " His mother had risen . " I 'm going to see her . I 'm going right now . " Ned caught her hands . " No , do n't , mother ! You ca n't do a thing for her . I saw her . When she looks at you your blood runs cold and you ca n't say a thing . You get away as quick as you can , and wish there really was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it forever and ever ! Do n't go today , mother . We 're going to the bridge . You promised . " She assented . " I 'll not go to see her today . But soon . " She moved to the door , as if about to run from something . " Let 's go into the garden . " But when they were out she left Britt and Ned and went on through the orchard , then up the little rise of land to where she could see the rolling , green rye , the dark , stirring woods , the fields beyond the fringe of river , and get back her wide , escaping world . " It 's hard on old Ern , " Britt said soberly to Ned . " They lost everything , and he 's workin ' in the mills . The man she mortgaged the place to says she can stay on till she dies , ' cause she 's a good woman now , and he wo n't have long to wait . " " Ern wants to marry Fairinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't ask a girl to live in the house with his mother . But they 'll marry some day . He 'd ruther they would n't , for Ern has got to be kinda gloomy . " " Gloomy , by golly ! I 'd think he 'd be blue-pickled . Tell you what might help him . If he 'd go down to Raleigh and beat up that preacher , he 'd feel lighter in heart . Beat him up good . I 'd take the job o ' squaw-waddlin ' him myself . Not that I 'm against preachers , son . Your grandfather was one , an ' a mighty good one , too . I 'm not against ' em , but they 've got to be kept human . " It was afternoon , and they were not yet started on their long walk . There was so much that Ishma had to hear and see on this first day at the farm . Britt had to lay all his plans before her , for when she put her mind to it she was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starbo was drawing her thoughts away , but she forced an interest that satisfied her glowing guide . " Yes , my man , I 'd do that . You can put rutabagas here when you pull up your tomato vines . ( Why did it take mankind so long to pull out of this last pit of superstition ? ) They 'll be fine for our winter table , and you can leave enough in the ground to feed those few sheep that you say you are going to make fat for family mutton . " She screwed her mouth goodnaturedly , to indicate her dislike for sheep-killing . " You ought n't to keer . The house 'll be full of yore friends most of the time , and they 'll have to eat . They 'll take mutton an ' not ask what it is . " " Yes , " she said , near to sighing , feeling the clutch of all the hungry that she could n't feed . ( And the rulers of the world sweatingly ploughing the sea , ploughing the sea ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before " Taller than a young calf , and the girth of that ! " He squeezed three fingers together . " And what bunches of buttons ! I 'll plant them in June . They 'll make an acre of onions . For your mutton stew , " he teased . ( Britt , setting his feet on Holderness farm , to meet the onslaughtof all the barbaric conglomerate of forces queerly called civilization ! ) 72 73 " Everything that 's to eat 'll grow on this place . I do n't see how the Holders could go away and leave it . It was the wife though . " Ishma suggested that probably Sue Holder wanted to do something besides eat . But Britt was attentively examining a blighted currant bush and deciding on a remedy . The remark fell unheard . " Nobody 'll ever pass my gate hungry , " he said , when he looked up . ( Britt by his little gate . Come in , come in , ye weary millionsI Here is rest and food for all ! ) Ned came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge and back before night they 'd have to make a start , and his parents agreed . The bridge was five miles from the farm , but Britt had learned of shorter routes through fields and woods that took off two miles of the distance . It was fun losing the trails and finding them . There was one wire fence , several hedges to be pushed through , and little streams to be crossed . Little streams feeding Clear River . Britt liked trails , but he had another reason for keeping off the main road . There , particularlyon Sunday , they were likely to meet homeless boys wandering in search of work or food . Or perhaps a whole family would be dragging along , with a tale to tell of a closed mill and no work . Sunday was a good day for the jobless to travel . The chances of meeting people were greater ; people out to enjoy the day and with a little money in the pocket which they might share . Also the farmers had more time on Sunday , more tolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask a weary body into the kitchen for bread and milk . Ishma , too , was glad to escape the patient faces and dazed eyes . She had only one day of peace . But she could not keep herself from thinking of the long road of time that the human race had so yearningly travelled . It had been so many years since it was written , " The poor and the needy seek water and there is none . . . I will open for them rivers on the bare heights , and fountains in the midst of the valleys . . . I will put in the wilderness the cedar , the acacia , the myrtle and the oil-tree ; I74will set in the desert the fir-tree and the pine . . . " So long since the promise ; yet every year more and more millions were tramping the roads with throats that were parched , with feet that would never be healed . For them no fountains in the valley , no oil-tree and myrtle in their desert . Was it because men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait ages on his humor ? But now . . . it would be different . Their cry would be from their own mouths . They would not wait for an unmoving God to translate their vision into life . Britt led them through a field where meadow-larks fluttered not a dozen feet from their steps , singing recklessly . And on through a wood where the breath of April grew more sweet and ground warblers got almost under their feet . " The dumb things ! " said Britt . Not so dumb , thought Ned , watching them shoot their beaks under leaves and sticks and into bits of moss , on murderous hunt for tiny enemies that if left alive would find their way to the roots of the strongest trees . Along the river path Ishma forgot everything outside the beauty that lay around her . She stopped and spread out her hands . " Is n't this enough , Britt ? " " Maybe , but let 's go on . We 're in half a mile of the bridge . " He was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tone should conceal the fact . They left the river and for a few moments followed a higher trail that was without fascination . Ishma began to think that Britt 's indifference might not have been affected ; they were merely going to a bridge ; but when they reached the top of a little knoll and he said , " It 's down there , " he could n't hide his eagerness . The trail entered a dirt road large enough for motor-cars seeking a woodland detour . Another curve , and they caught a glimpse of the high railings of the bridge , but no sign of water , for the river banks were high and the trees lofty above them . They had to go out on the bridge to see the stream that crept twenty feet below it , making a sinuous lane under the curved boughs of the black birches , thick-girthed as old oaks , but looking more slender with their smoothly rising height and branches of grace that made a forest roof for the long , cool track of the water . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning over the railing in an attempt to follow it to its unseen but surely enchanted destination . " Now come to the other side , " said Britt , putting his arm around his wife and drawing her across the bridge . " Look at that ! " " That " was a wide expanse of water , where the river gathered like a small lake before it reached the mill-race farther down . And it still kept its curving fringe of trees . At one side , barely seen through the boughs , was a great wooden building , the color of earth . This was the mill . " We 'll walk past the race , " said Britt , happy and important , knowing there was better to come . He called to Ned , who had seated himself under the railing to swing his legs and stare up the lane of water . Here would be fish ; but yonder was the hidden house of dreams . He rose and followed his parents toward the race and the gigantic old mill , which in Quaker times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now was in disuse except for a small corner housing a grist mill for the convenience of local families . It rambled up the cliff , so close that it seemed to be climbing the rocks . " We 'll have to go through the flour mill and out on the river side , " explained Britt . In the mill they stopped to greet the miller , Heck Moore , lank and skinny , with somber , challenging eyes . " Not a bit like a miller , " Ishma said afterwards , and Britt asked her what she thought he looked like , an escaped revolutionist ? Which happened to be what she had been thinking . If she were hiding for her life , she would n't be afraid to hide in Heck Moore 's mill . As they passed through she looked up at the great beams rising over one another until they were out of sight in the cobwebbed darkness , and imagined herself climbing up there , above and above , on the dozens of little ladders , until she reached the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid ground . Leaving the mill , they walked under the cliff along the water 's edge . After the tumble over the race , the river spread into shallowpools and channels , making foamy splashes as it slapped76rocks and fell over ledges of drift . Ned took off his shoes and began to leap along on the rocks in the river . The cliff began to slope gently and take on a ferny covering . They turned a place where it jutted in a curve , and Ishma , expecting open country , walked around it into a little waterfall made by a small stream plunging down to the river . Britt had n't warned her . " I knew that you would n't mind a little shower like that , big girl . " Ned was laughing too , with danger to his balance on a rock . Now that his mother was wet , maybe she 'd come into the river with him . But it was Britt who followed him first . He took off his shoes , tied them to a dogwood bough , high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , her dress pinned above her knees . She was more agile and made fewer slips than either of them . Many times in the mountains she had raced along the rocks in the Nantahala just for the joy of feeling her body rise and bend and balance as easily as the water slipped over the smooth , curved stones . She had never enjoyed dancing . She felt too large out on the floor with smaller girls . But in a place like this she belonged , as the river belonged to the forest . . There was a peninsula of rock ahead of them . It was narrow near the bank , and midstream spread into a ridgy lap of stone covered with mossy growth . From a crevice in its side rose an old ash that half shaded it . It was beautiful with bits and ruffles of gray and green . Ishma said they would bring their dinner next time and cook it on the rock . " And have a swim , " proposed Ned . " The water is deep and clear below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it would be fine , " concluded Britt . " I 'll take one while you 're cooking dinner . " Ishma took her way to the rock and began to climb up the side . She made her last leap to the top , then stood still . On the lower edge of the rock lay a man . His eyes were shut , but she did n't think he was asleep . He was stretched out , entirelyat rest , with a look on his face as if he had sought peace and had found it . Ishma knew that he was Bly Emberson . She worked in his mill. 77 " What 's the matter , mother ? " shouted Ned , as she did n't move . His voice rang above the sound of the water , and the man opened his eyes . Afterwards he remembered that he had not been surprised , and he knew why . The woman was the spirit of the place , and a part of the peace he had found . He sat up , speaking as gently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether I am host here or invader . In either case , wo n't you sit down ? " Without embarrassment she unpinned her skirt and seated herself on a shelf of the rock . Ned clambered up to her . " Hello ! " was his surprised greeting . " Hello ! " smiled Bly . Ned called to his father to come up , but there was no answer . When Bly had told them who he was , and Ishma had given her own name and Ned 's , she added , " I work in your mill . " Again he was not surprised . Anything might happen here . " I thought I knew all of my employees , " he said . Then an inner light flashed . " I know you now . You are the friend of my cousin , Derry Unthank . " " Yes , we are friends . " Bly felt that she might have added the word " eternally , " since it was in her voice . Ned again called to his father . " Here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , and looking down they saw the naked , beautiful body of Britt in the water . He was swimming smoothly back and forth , turning with swift , easy strokes . Bly leapt to his feet . " He must get out of there ! It 's the most dangerous spot in the river . There are bottomless places , and cross-currents too . Superb , but he must get out ! " Ishma turned pale , but it was n't necessary for her to scream . Britt caught sight of the stranger , and turning quickly swam to the upper side of the rock , where he got hastily into his clothes . A moment later he stood before them , apologetic but unabashed . His wife was still trembling . Bly explained the danger , and retailed legends of disaster in that very pool . Britt looked incredulous , but he took Ishma 's hand and held it with uncalledfortenacity . " Anyhow you should n't go into the water so early , " admon-78ished Bly . " You ought to wait until June , or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , " said Britt . " I 've gone swimming in March  --  colder places than this . " Bly shivered . This fellow made him feel like a weakling , yet he considered himself a man in good health and of fair proportions . Without insolence , he looked Britt up and down . Handsome . His wet hair seemed to take fire in the sun . His eyes shot at you in a way that would have hurt if they had n't been kind and merry . A proud sort , and would take care of his family . Yet she worked in a mill . The man did n't , that was evident . They slipped into talk , which was easy for all four , with only nature to overhear . No reminders of life divided into masters and workers . Only flowing , human interchange . Bly learned all about Holderness . Under Britt 's eager expatiation he felt half a farmer . The sun dropped , and when their rock was in shadow Ishma thought they must go , though Bly pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill-race . Britt hoped that Mr. Emberson would drive by his farm some day , and Bly had a sudden wish to do that now . " I 'll drive you home , " he said . A slight cloud of refusal was on their faces . " You do n't want me to ? " he asked . And Ishma answered . " It 's the walk  --  through the fields .  --  in the dusk  --  we like it . " " Then you must have it , " said Bly , and they set off , leaving him on the rock , his fancy following them through the fields in the dusk . He forgot that a car waited for him , that EmbersonLodge was waiting. 79CHAPTER IV " THERE SHALL BE LIGHT " DUNMOw was an emitter of beams . A city with not one but many founts of lumination . The early Moravian glow still lingered , throwing out more than a sunset brilliance , and Dunmow , though somewhat distant , was within the circle of radiation . At Easter , every year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open air to renew the torch of spirit in the actual rays of the rising sun . So strengthened , for twelve months thereafter its gleam pushed mellowly through the tangle and stress of community life . Even those not scripturally entitled to it felt its presence ; a back-drop of serenity giving a reliable glow to the tremulant stage of existence . The sun-worshippers of old , who gathered on the hills to await the flaming god , might have thrilled with more eager anticipationthan the modern thousands brought together to celebrate a resurrection that they believed some day would be their own ; but the twentieth century ritual memorialized something more intimately miraculous , the triumph of a god both divine and human , to whom the globe of fire itself was subservient . Not until the later cult shall be as the first , ambered in history , may one write of it with equal lack of bias . But one can say with truth that this fount of religious light was a welding , not a disruptive one . As gently as it enfolded its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nurturing warmth the great tobacco factories and textile mills where human battalions surrendereddream and life-blood in the making of fortunes which they would never share . Another glow , companion to the mellow Moravian flame , was a heritage from the Colonial Quakers . Partly from England , partly an offshoot of the Pennsylvania body , the two branches of Friends had become one in the fostering soil of Carolina . They cast a light as undeflected and simply spiritual as the8olight in the eyes of the substanceless apostles . But this had not interfered with the gathering of earthly goods under the protectingaegis of Jehovah . There were serene souls among them who felt that His sanction was sufficient to condone traffic in flesh and blood , if the flesh was darkly pigmented . Not all , however , yielded to Biblical arguments in favor of the iniquity . Ezra Milburn , ninety-three , could point you to the exact spot where the barracoon of the trader had stood . The barracoon was a collection of small buildings , fragrantly covered with vines , in which the human stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the square , protected from the summer sun by lordly magnolias , the trader 's mansion could be seen . In one of the little buildings the refractory slaves were confined until they could be sold to planters farther south , where all disciplinary duty was left to overseers . The overseer was a rare animal in the Piedmont of that day , before the introduction of mills and mass-slavery . Here , the owner of slaves had to come more or less in contact with his chattels . As a " gentleman could n't be whippin ' his niggahs , " the qualities most in demand were obedienceand good-nature . With the winnowing out of independent elements , Piedmont slaves , like their white successors , became noted for docility and loyalty . The Honorable Ezra , three times in the State Congress , liked to adjust his polished boots on his equally polished office table and talk of the golden days when a man could " be a gentleman without havin ' to prove it . " Hanging on his wall were three great-brimmed hats , a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made when honesty was the first requisite of workmanship . They had been worn by his Quaker fathers , and each possessed a gentlemanly and Christian history which Ezra could relate in detail . He had a ground-floor office with windows shaded by a great water oak which he constantly challenged the authorities to cut down ; but they were generously awaiting his demise and continued to repair the sidewalk uncomplainingly . The old man 's profile was still good , his silver beard a thing for admiration , and he usually sat so as to proffer a side view of himself to all who passed under the oak . Sometimes he sat for hours alone , 8ikeeping his portrait-like pose as he slept , but at other times a circle of " boys , " all over eighty years , gathered around him , and he would talk of things that they knew quite as well as he . " Yes , gentlemen , the barracoon stood right there not forty feet from where that oak tree throws its shade . When I was not more than ten years old I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buck niggahs bangin ' their chained wrists against the wall , mutterin ' and screechin ' as if Africa was outside waitin ' to bust through . Sometimes I could look through the barred windows and see their big eyes shinin ' in the dark . These were bad niggahs that had been turned over to the trader to be sold out of the country . We believed in good niggahs in those days , and we had ' em too . In the other little buildings the trader kept the peaceful niggahs until somebody took a fancy to ' em . Once a year what was left over were taken off and sold , but he tried to favor ' em by sellin ' ' em to people who needed house or yard servants , or men to take care of horses and barns . The bad ones always went to the planters . " " What about that gal that Squire Bernitt got rid of for young Sam Bernitt 's good ? " " Nobody ever got word back from her . That was the same year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em , but I may have got ' em mixed up , they 's so much of a favor . When Judge Arnold died his son could n't afford to keep the pickaninnies till they grew up . He was real softheartedso he let the mammy go with ' em . She had a name through the country as a tasty cook , and families around here wanted her , but Arnold could get more by sendin ' her off , and he was losin ' on the young ones . He had no guarantee that they 'd be sold to the same master , and he could n't follow that up , but he did what he could . This community , gentlemen , tried to do right by its niggahs . We never sold any so long as their labor would pay their way . That year old Milly went the prices were good in New Orleans and Mobile and other market centers , and the trader took off quite a lot . We all joined together to give them a fine send-off . Got up a band among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let all of ' em come out of the barracoon and dance on the square . Dance 82anything they 's a mind to . Some of ' em laid around on the grass sort o ' mopy , but the main chance was lively , and danced as happy as Sat'day night . Most of the folks hated to part with their niggahs , and when the procession started off there was a big crowd of us followin ' ' em out of town . In front was the big wagon covered up tight , holdin ' the bad fellers in chains , then come the other wagons , not covered up , holdin ' the good ones . " " An ' they kept singin ' , I reckon , an ' playin ' banjos , an ' that kind of fiddle they could make out of corn stalks ? " " No , they banned that instrument . It was a wailin ' thing . The banjos were heartsome . I did n't notice more'n half a dozen or so cryin ' , mostly women . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads and gray frizzles edgin ' out , who kept lookin ' back and holdin ' out their hands to their old master . He was a good man , and he felt so bad he finally turned his back on ' em so he could n't see ' em . " " That wench o ' Bernitt 's left a niggah beau behind her , did n't she ? " " He went along till the guards turned him back , walkin ' by the side of the wagon . He kept whisperin ' to her and she kept whisperin ' back . I reckon he was makin ' big promises about buying himself free and finding her again . He was right finelookin ' , but he turned out bad and ran away ' fore the year was out . They found his body in the swamps . He did n't make it out to that gal . " " I 've heard it hit his master , old Anniston , right hard . That was the grandfather of our Judge Anniston , you know . They said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Anniston said he 'd have brought more on the block than Sam Bernitt any day , and there was hard feelin 's between the two families for a long time . But that day we were all soft and friendly . We followed the wagons a full mile out of town . Then we stood there listenin ' to the music dyin ' away . It got to be a little thread and hung in the air mournful , though we 'd meant to make everybody feel fine . When we could n't hear it any more we all went home . Some of the folks felt a little lonesome . They liked their niggahs. " 83 " How long was it ' fore the trader 's wagons came back ? " " About six months . And were n't they full , gentlemen ! Woolen goods for the tailor , felt for the hatter , plenty of things for the young ladies  --  Morocco leather to make their shoes , laces , feathers , brocades from France ; kegs of fine wine from New Orleans , candies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piedmont . The trader 's family lived high , but they could n't use a tenth of what he brought back and it was parcelledout at a fair price . My grandfather had a new hat , and that one on the east wall is the one he retired . I can tell you a story about that hat . You see  --  " But to return to the founts of radiance that rescued our city from the darkness of nineteen hundred and thirty-two . The unquenchable Presbyterian fire , brought to our country by the fleeing Scotch-Irish , was still fed and fanned by the descendants of those stout-hearted fugitives . Before there was a foundation laid in Dunmow , there was an organization of this faith in the Piedmont wilderness . The parent flame became many flames , and intensity born of persecution enabled it to carry through in the new country until no corner of obscurity needed be withoutthe relief of its light if men would have it . A score of years , perhaps , after the Presbyterian organization was set up , the Lutherans arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the dauntless rays of the German Reformed Church . For the disciples of Ulric Zwingli and MartinLuther , when first they reached the gentler climate of Carolina , were able to reconcile their differences as to the real presence in the Lord 's Supper , so far at least as to build , and worship in , a single church . But later the Calvinistic rays refused to coalesce with the Lutheran , and in Dunmow of our day they were resolvedinto two centres of radiance . It was not until the first year of the Revolution that the Methodists of the Piedmont erected places of worship , but long before that they had been gathering in the hospitable houses of believers and the unwalled temples of nature . The riders of the circuit , as the world knows , labored for love of Christ and man , with infinitesimal worldly pay . In one instance where it was necessary to know how much of the minister 's salary for theprevious year had been paid , a pair of socks was exhibited as the sole contribution . In the journals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedication . . " We worshipped under the trees . The sweet air was a constantbenediction . My soul was so filled with love that I could not restrain a flood of tears , and all the dear ones present wept with me . " " Last Sabbath at sunset we gathered in a grove of ancient oaks . A brook flowed near , and notes of birds came liquidly from the trees . It was difficult , I perceived , to hold the minds of the congregation to the text , but I made a great effort , and God gave me my reward . Let those massive boughs , ' I said , bring to your mind the hovering power of Jehovah ; let that little brook remind you of the fountain filled with blood into which all who would be saved must plunge . Remember that sweeter than the song of birds to the ears of the Almighty , are the cries of the repentant at the mercy seat . I persevered , I felt covered with power , I won the errant from the seductions of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved and the groans of the penitent . " The Lord does reward his faithful , one must conclude , looking at the shining temples of Methodism that today dot the city of Dunmow . But the Baptists surpass them in numbers and in fanes of lumination . From the time , more than two centuries ago , when Shubeal Stearns , of the New Light order , with eight families from Boston , formed the first Piedmont organization , they have multiplied in membership and variety , and their faith-built steeples , fundamentalist and unshakable , now outnumberall others in Dunmow . The Episcopal church , the only sect coming from the Old World with undisputed credentials , should have had an easy way into the ring of radiance . But it was not so . There was help from the law-makers , all they could give . Through a legislature loyal to England , if not an obsequious one , the country was laid out in parishes , and a poll-tax imposed to provide the salary of a minister for every parish . Each minister was to have a mansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dairy and neathouse . Also a glebe of two hundred acres , which he " need not84 85personally cultivate , it being the intention of the act to make him free of worldly cares and avocations . " In levying the ample poll-tax there was no discrimination against the poor or servile class . In fact , they seem to have been preferred contributors . No white male under sixteen was subject to the tax , but the age was lowered to twelve for negroes , mulattoes , mustees , and all who intermarried with persons of mixed blood . Here , too , was an early instance of equality of the sexes before the law , as all females of mixed blood ranked with males as tax-paying subjects ; though the law was narrowedby the utter exclusion of white females . This privilege was not graciously accepted by Scotch Presbyterianswith the glint of the persecuted still in their eye ; by Methodists of such divinely simple needs that a temple of trees contented them for worship ; by Calvinists who held to their faith with the rigidity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by Palatine descendants of men who had seen city after city , village after village , farm after farm , of their beautiful Pfalz country wasted and ashstrewnrather than suffer an imposed faith . The " salaries " were not forthcoming , the " mansions " did not materialize , the " glebes " remained a wilderness . More than once when compelled to elect " two wardens " for a parish , the result was the election of the two most fiery Presbyterians in the community . It is sadly written of these times , " The clergy were not only dispirited , but in most cases were obliged to turn their attention to other objects in order to procure the necessaries of life . " There were instances of ministers attempting to cultivate their own glebes ! But time passed on to the brighter days of the Reverends Empie and Judd . " A day-star from on high visited us in mercy . These two heaven-sent heralds of the everlasting gospel came to us and laid the foundation of the restoration of the Episcopal cause in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only two generationsthereafter , when villages and towns had begun to nucleate in the Piedmont , no church in Dunmow could throw farther or higher the glittering flame of belief . The centers of luminosity became too many for this list . One86could not quickly name all the lights that crossed and mingled until labels faded and one walked in a friendly amalgamated glow . But the Holiness church should be given its distinctive name . Though too stern for human conformity , it possessed a flame irresistible to sinners . Drawn into its purity , they reflecteda brief sanctification , often followed by retreat to a less austere refuge , or a dropping back to burnt and dark negation . The Salvationists , too , en the religious periphery , held their constant penny candles high for the road-weary and the outcast . The Dunmow vagrant could bathe in gleam , the most vicious or despairing face could lift itself at least temporarily into the sacred light . With all these emanations , one had to agree that if any city on earth was prepared to keep alive the fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it possessed other , though unchurchly , sources of illumination . There was a new college in Blairwood , the city 's richest suburb . All agreed that the buildings , beautifully poised on a tree-decked ridge , were in the right place , if only they were paid for . The president was wisely selected for his unquestionablebusiness sense . He would take care of the debt . The instructors were carefully chosen from the ranks of the safe and sane . The institution , though loyal to the Democratic party , had a happy flexibility that enabled it to support vigorous measuresof the industrialist faction . This faction , rich and powerful , was gradually transforming the political convictions of the state , giving them a manufacturing rather than an agricultural base , and naturally it sought allies among the colleges . Professor James Conroy Bigrose held the chair of economics . No one could hew more closely to the good old line of reasoningput forth by the great economists dead and gone . If the world was running away on a new road , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reins . If pulled to pieces , they would die doing their duty . But Professor Bigroseknew that he would not be pulled to pieces . He knew that traditional instruction in New College would remain in honor for at least his lifetime . The gatherings of intellectuals at his home were sometimes spiced with advanced views , but the spice was provided by his87wife , Amy . She enjoyed playing with fireworks when convinced that the surrounding vacuum insured safety . More frequentlyshe gave herself another pleasure , that of teasing her husband , the elderly professor . Good looks and , at bottom , good nature , made it possible for her to get by with both diversions and retain the fond admiration of her circle . On taking residence in Blairwood as the wife of a newly elected professor , Amy had swept a measuring eye over the masculinity of Dunmow and selected Bly Emberson as interestingmaterial for her necessary flirtations . A man of such charm could n't possibly have inconvenient notions of loyalty to a wife like Verna . It took Amy about three minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had looks none could question , and she moved through any Dunmow gathering with the easy air of one who knew her royal place . Bly had no reason to wince for her unless some one attempted to draw her into conversation not related to church and home . Then , in spite of his resolve not to care , his neck and ears would begin to burn . He liked an occasional evening out if his favorite cousin , Derry Unthank , was with them . He would always take care of Verna and leave Bly to enjoy himself quietly . " You stick to me , Vern , " he would say , " and we 'll swing the party . " And keeping her at his side , he would play any gatheringas if it were his special instrument for making noise or harmony , seeming not to care whether he was chief entertainer or the prime disturber of the feast . Family resemblance was strong in the features of the two men , but Bly 's face was sunnier and undeniably handsomer . Women looked guardedly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Bly their smiles fell with ready pleasure . Warmth would have been the word if Bly had been that sort . He was n't , and however brightly he might respond , the hand he gave the advancing lady was always cool as honor and discretion . Amy did not like to recall her discomfiture after her first confident approach to Bly , though she had covered her retreat with the sincerest of smiles . Bly would never be her victim , but88what a friend he would make ! An idealist in actual life . Hitherto unknown to her among males . In some way she must creep into comradeship with him before he knew it , but that would have to be by way of Verna , and could she make that deadly circuit ? She could . And within three months Bly was receiving her outstretched hand with no cooling thought of caution . Amy took care of that . He was something she did n't want to lose . In Blairwood an aristocracy still made its polished gestures . Lured by the gleam of new money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from Carolina rice-lands . Its religion was usually Episcopal in form . In contentit was fixed and delicate as blown glass . Deluged all about by religious fervor , it kept its shining calm . There were not many to represent it . They had moved out of old houses into new , where they practised unobtrusively the modern technique of living , with no clash between it and the old ideals of gallantry and grace . Doctor Schermerhorn declaredthat they helped one recall the Persians of the great age . Intrenched in the Iranian temperament , they were still breathing the days when the silver moon and the golden lion of Darius were fit emblems of politics and government . Pagan gods were still chuckling in the bushes , smilingly tolerated by the eternal Hebrew in the skies . It made a human flowering of certain charm , this ancient psychology in its modern settingof beauty and ease . " If the earth rocks , " they could say with high courage , " do not ask why . See how splendidly you can balance yourself upon it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a flourish that sets physical bravery on a moral pinnacle , and refuse to dig cowardly for causes and motives . Marry glamorously , though judiciously withal , and set your family at your world 's proud center . If the industrial rabble growls under your feet , spike your shoes and trample . When the morning paper carries news that gives an acidulous flavor to steaming pancakes and coffee , leave it scorned on great-grandmother 's wing-backed chair . Or , if you must read it , ignore the labor obstinacies , and corruption in the high and holy places of finance , and concentrate on the editorial written for your daily reas-89surance , giving a complete view of the human situation from your own side of the fence . " Thus for the Iranian temperament , according to old Schermerhorn . But , as we have said , its representatives were few . The great majority of Dunmow 's inhabitants moved unillusioned by a silver moon and caught no glimpse of a golden mane on the guarded horizon . Some there were who suspected there might be justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so strainingly the gleaming edifice of Southern society . There were indeed some who could have seen significancein so slight an incident as happened on Wrenn Street the first hot day of summer , nineteen hundred and thirty-two . Oscar Tetherall , a recent unemployed , and Jim Turnbrook , so long unemployed that he was now in the hobo class , were resting on a low stone wall . A broken blister on the bottom of Turnbrook 's foot was stinging relentlessly . He took off his shoe and readjusted the bits of newspaper with which he had lined it . His eye caught a headline . " Read that for me , " he said to Oscar , handing him a bit of paper . Turnbrook could read , but he had no glasses , and would never have any . He had once spoken of glasses to a relief worker . A twenty-five-cent pair would do . " We are out of grand pianos , " said the young woman , who had practised up on smart answers with which to sting the undeserving . Then she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beans , which he had no way of cooking . He had tried to cook the beans in a tin can by the side of the road , but a farmer came out and scattered his fire . Then the farmer gave him a good meal . One meal . And he needed three hundred and sixty-five a year , the least he could do with . " Read that , Oscar , " he said . " That headline is sorter interestin ' . " Oscar read . " The depression is buried . The man who does not recognize that , the man whose forward-looking face does not announce it to all whom he meets , is guilty of treason to his race , his country , we might say to his God . " " By gum ! " said Turnbrook , and sat very still . At the end of five minutes he repeated with finality and fatalism , " By gum ! " Then he put the bits of paper back into his shoe , 90got up , and slowly limped down the street . Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all he 's got to say . By gum ! ' I reckon it would n't be any better for him to run amuck and get beat up . I wonder how many out-o ' - works will die this year that ought to have By gum ! ' put on their tombstones . They wo n't have any tombstones though , they 'll be in the pauper'scorner . The By gum ! ' corner . " Oscar laughed . Then he was taken with an idea . " If all the By-gums would run amuck at the same time  --  what ? B'lieve I 'll hunt up that organizin ' feller that 's come to town and hear what he has to say , if the police have n't picked him up yet . No harm in listenin ' . I 'll take Turnbrook too . " He whistled , and Turnbrook waited for him . Dunmow , with its sudden leap to city proportions , was sparkling electrically with lodges and clubs . The people seemed to fear that they might leave behind them the friendliness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gregariousyearning before urban growth had comparatively lessened their individual stature . The club , or lodge , of whatever name , was their old neighborly street , their fondly remembered village of " Hello ! " and " Come around , boys ! " But there were no freak societies . If one sprang up , it did not last in the purposeful atmosphere . Benefit of some sort must be the intention  --  financial , artistic , domestic , musical , literary , vocational , civic , social . Service was the heart of them all . Service . The Chairmanof the Chamber of Commerce made that clear at every annual banquet . On the occasion of the last one , where fiftythreeorganizations were represented , he had said : " Do not give lip-service to your ideal . Do not enter your club doors with a smile and a hand-shake for your competitor , thinking that this social gesture keeps you still generous when you knife him in the back . Do n't let the fact that you are a good fellow within your lodge be your warrant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fellowman even if that man is your rival . Do n't be a victim of self-deception . Be honest with yourself , and it must follow as the night the day you will not then be false to any man . " The sincere chairman sat down , and a banqueter , with blush due somewhat to corn , responded . " Do n't be hard on us , Bill . Nobody wants to knife anybody . Nobody wants to be a hypocrite . God , would n't we like to be ourselves ! We 're not mean by nature , take the most of us . We 'd be proud if we could be good fellows in business as well as out . But we ca n't . We 've got to do the other fellow . It 's not us  --  it 's the  --  the system . But we 've made the system , and by the Lord Moses , it 's gettin ' time to make it over , if it has n't already made us too mean and little to tackle it . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him . The Chairman had been attempting to stop him with a stare that ought to have removed him to Greenland 's icy mountains . The banquet master was calling for order . Half a dozen banqueters had left their seats to pull the speaker down . He sank quietly , feeling sleepy from corn and emotion . Oratory and harmony were restored for the evening , except that never once did a kindly eye rest on the man who had so impulsively and forever discredited himself among goodfellows . It was often said of Dunmow that the merely rich were not considered of such coruscating importance as residents who had attained a modicum of national distinction . One of these in particular was Judge Anniston , of the Federal Court of Appeals , whose circuit covered five States . His legal knowledge was fathomless , and in the rare instances when an appeal had been taken from his judgment the Supreme Court had sustained his opinion . He lived on a hundred acres that lay partly within the limits of the city , which had gratefully made them almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his estate and look up the lane of proud oaks that wound and curved for a mile before reaching his door . Judge Anniston said that the secret of his success lay in his never having decided a case except on precedent . His close study of historical precedents probably deprived him of interest in the modern scene . This he would admit , with the smiling candor of which he was proud . When Unthank asked him what he thought of the Mooney case , he blandly confessed thathe had never heard of it . Derry briefly enlightened him , and added the hope that the Judge would live long enough to have to study the case as a precedent . The Judge , smiling again , pointed to danger in that direction . Infallibility must take norisks . There was another resident whom the citizens regarded with more love and less pride . In a battered mansion that dripped with royalist and colonial memories , old Doctor Schermerhorn had his pleasant though somewhat freakish way of speech and being . Kindness obscured his vision , people thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his babblingsthey could smile at what in him would do no harm . The word " communism " that dropped from most lips like a spat-out fire-coal lingered familiarly on his tongue , causing no panic in the breast of the listener . He lived in the house of his fathers , the first to be built on the site of Dunmow , when the forest was unsubdued and deer came to drink from the family spring . Clapboards had replaced the old logs , and the one story had become three . But still it was " the old house , " where the Palatine great-grandfather had lived and died . And it stood in modern Blairwood . The subdivisionhad been mapped around it when he had refused to part with an inch of his eleven acres . His face was old . The eyes flashed youthfully from under heavy , curling eyebrows , without ransoming his face from the long years that held it captive . But if seen walking about his grounds , his broad hat clamped down concealing his white hair , one was likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoop , and his body was flexibly slim , with movements following his mind , quick or slow , as youth in thought . In his library were rows of empty shelves . He had given all of his books to New College that bore a date earlier than nineteenhundred . " I know them , " he said . " I 've lived a long time with them . Now I want to spend my days in my own century . " But it was hardly his own century in which he lived . His mind had moved on into the future , and only occasionally turned back to the children who sought his door . They liked92 93to come , for humor went with his monitory wisdom . Only youth , he said , could be unmitigatedly serious . He was old enough to smile . He liked to splash about in rainy weather . " Everybody , " he said , " should get his shoes full of mud occasionally . It will help him at the last to fit down comfortably in earth . " He regretted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no part in the new life , when every man would work enough to keep him fit and happy , and no man would work too much ; the era of industrial leisure on which the human race was enteringwith so much turbulence , befuddlement and pain . " The debate , I take it , resolves into this , " he said one day to Bly Emberson , who had dropped by to return a book and listen to one of the old doctor 's monologues . " Into this , my boy . Shall we continue the dictatorship of capital to preserve the status quo , or shall we have a dictatorship of workers to abolish the status quo ? But what is the status quo ? If we are to choose between prolonging or abolishing a certain thing , we should certainly know what the thing is . The status quo is not easily discernible because it is so near us and about us . We might almost say that it is ourselves . But if I were compelled to apply a single descriptive word , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But if we are the status quo ? " " Precisely . We ca n't get absolution for ourselves by shouting about our progress , by pointing back to early man  --  the Rhodesian , the Predmost  --  with a brain life hesitant at the fissure of Sylvius . The point of difference , or guilt , we may call it , between us and the originating fathers is that we know what we are doing . Thanks to our frontal expansion , we know . And we could not only do something about it , we could do everything about it . We could remove every discomfort , every anxiety , every anguish attendant on economic life . " He thumped the book that Bly had returned . " Here we have it . Tender children wait in quivering lines for puffy bread , weak soup , and blue milk , out of which meat-packers , glorified bakers , and milk magnates have sucked the profitable substance that they may build estates for capering , sub-normal progeny. 94That is not the status quo disclosing charity and benevolence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quo  --  ourselves  --  voicing inhumanity . " He picked up the daily paper , and his eyes shot fire as they fell on the front page . " When three thousand prisoners that we have penned in cells built for only twelve hundred , are driven by the torture of it to rebellion , and we club them unconscious , or starve them into insanity , the status quo is not discoursing in terms of investigation , of crime waves , or the political wires running from the prison to the Governor 's mansion . It is announcingitself as stark inhumanity . When men entitled to trial by their peers are seized and beaten and twisted and flayed and roasted to death , and we decide to forget it because the loveliestnocturne that Debussy ever wrote is creeping in over our excellent radio , the status quo is not revealing itself in the miraculous voice of science , nor in our desire to exalt the artist within us . It is trumpeting stark inhumanity . That is the word that vibrates to the holy hill and clouds the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to gather strength . " We endow churches to preserve this thing . Universities are concrete adulations of it . Across seven hills and valleys from where we sit , a great institution of learning rambles expensively over the landscape . Two generations of workers in tobacco mills have given it body and blood . If a boy with sunken lungs and jaundiced eyes gets out of the stogie room long enough to roam over the brilliant campus , is he received as a scion of the founders ? Do the professors take off their hats ? Do the swaggering students acknowledge their debt ? No . They know nothing of the invisible ledger where the account is kept . They are scrambling for an education that will conceal its deceptive base . If here and there an instructor drags up the drowned truth by the locks , he is turned out to grass before her hair is dry . Professors , even the most conscientious , have no stomach for grass . I myself am disinclined to wild diet , though Truth is my dear lady . " Bly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of humor , would end with a smiling flourish . But he swerved back to the white fire of emotion. 95 " Every time I come in sight of the gleaming walls of that universityI am reminded of an old church , long in ruins , in northernEngland . One standing wall has lost its outer coat of stone , revealing on the innermost coat a hollow which is , in shape , the figure of a man ; a man built into the wall that a human sacrifice might preserve it . Centuries of frost and rain have exposed the inhuman superstition , and we shudder beholding that record of our past . But where is the frost and rain that will tear down this modern coat of injustice and arrogance , and lay bare the bodies that quiver in slow , living death behind it ? " The doctor 's white head was bowed , and Bly knew that it meant dismissal . But he was a bit nettled . It was so easy to talk in a library . So easy for age , that could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rose , then shot his question , " What are we to do ? " The old head was up , and the eyes flashed . " Find out . Find out , my son . And do n't wait until discovery will not help you . " His eyes followed his guest to the door , and they were filled with shadows . He knew that Bly would do nothing . He was too confused , too entangled , too helpless . Verna was at the door , in her car . He went out , not to a world waiting to be resolved into a livable place by the thought and act of ready men , but to his wife 's cheerfully suppressed impatience . " You were not as long as usual , " she said , with approval . " I suppose he was n't in a lecture mood , though the mumble that came through the window sounded like it . " Bly looked at his wife and had an intense desire to treat her as a companion . She might be as unresponsive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning frying-pan ; but if he kept trying , some unused level of intelligence might be awakened . At her age , doctors said , one should expect slight cerebral changes . He noted with the clarity of intellectual yearning that she was physically exquisite . " I wish , " he said , " that you had gone in with me . " " Not I ! It was enough to hear that guttural river from the outside . " 96He shrank back , curled small , like a touched snail . Verna felt his silence . " Please do n't be glum , dear . You 're always grumpy after going to old Schermerhorn 's . I 'm glad it 's only once or twice a year . I do n't see why you think it is necessary to go at all . I am sure he was well paid for bringing you into the world . Of course it 's fine of you to want to cheer him up , but  --  " Bly roused . " I do n't go to cheer him up . I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You look it ! What did you get this time in the cheering line ? " " Reality ! " Bly snapped , amazed that he could be ungentle . " There 's no other place in this damned town where a man can get a smell of it . The whole place is sham  --  a house of cards  --  and we run about in it , making speeches , waving flags , cheeringfrom the windows , as if it were ribbed in steel and founded on granite . " Verna was interested . She had n't had a contest with Bly since that affair of dear Martin 's , and she needed one occasionally to give zest to a life so persistently domestic . Such encountersdid not tire her . Being built like a fine animal she could hold out for the most lagging victory . " A house of cards , " repeated Bly . " And a storm rising from the center of the earth . " " You mean old Schermerhorn 's mouth , " laughed Verna . " I 'm not afraid of storm from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , you may lose it any day . " Cruelly blunt , but for the moment he did n't care . He would repent later . Had n't he tried to bring her to a gradual realization of the critical condition of business ? Verna lost color . She had meant to enjoy herself in the exerciseof her undeniable dramatic powers ; but this was serious . Lose Emberson Lodge ? A glance at Bly 's face assured her that he was not merely playing with a contingency . " But it is mine , Mr. Emberson . I own it . How can I lose it ? It is in my name . My share of our partnership , you called it . " 97 " Yes . And if the business goes on the rocks , do n't we gotogether ? " " But I am not in business . It will not be my doing if youfail . " She said it before she realized the terror in the words . IfBly failed ! It could n't be possible . " You will always make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will always protect your family . " " But if the business through which I protect you is smashed ? I will do my best while I live . That is all I can promise . " While he lived . And if the dear God took him , there would be the insurance . But it was for him to mention that . Whydid n't he ? " That is enough for me , Bly . Your promise . " Bly shuddered . When she called his name in that liquid , honied way , she was getting ready to sting the very quick ofhim . " And if you go before me , dear , if you should leave me forGod 's mansions , I could use the Lodge to make a living . Icould take boarders . " He wanted to laugh . It was no sting after all . No womanalive was better fitted to be a boarding-house queen than Verna . It was her perfect metier . She needed work , for her physical salvation if nothing more . In a circumscribed sphere she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her limited powers fully and be happy . He knew that down in the bottom of her heart she knew it too . She had tried to sting him . Though she had failed , he would sting back , and no doubt fail too . " Then you would n't give up the Lodge if we crashed ? You would n't be honest ? Could n't you get that much out of yourreligion ? " " But you inherited the Lodge . It was your father 's . It hadnothing to do with your business . How could it be dishonestto keep it ? " " I inherited my father 's business too . And it was that whichmade the Lodge . " " I see , " she said , as if in thought , and suddenly yielded atthe point of grace . " I , of course , was thinking of Evelyn . The 98darling will always be somebody 's care . Such an exquisite , tenderchild . The rest of us could battle through if we lost you , dear . " Now he would speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Evelyn , and his heart was waiting for the clutch of something nameless . That fear which he could n't recognize . He was in a circle of dim light , and beyond that , all around him , was a sphere of dancing dark , where the fear was . Evelyn was dearer than his life . Right now , with the unseen thing on diabolic watch , he could feel her arms about his neck , her lips against his cheek . And what could he do to save her ? " Verna , what do you think of Derry 's decision about Evelyn ? " He asked it , unready for a conflict , but knowing it must be fought . She was silent . " Did n't he talk it all out with you ? He told me he would . That was why I left you together last night . " " Yes , he talked . Derry is more impossible every time he comes . " " But I must know what he said , Verna . He is a physician . We sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medically . And he says there is nothing the matter with her body . She is perfect except ... " " Yes , except ? " " She vibrates too easily , he says . Impressions go deep . We must be careful what we say to her . But we knew all that . " " Careful what we teach her ? " " She accepts truth . She is a believer . In the middle ages she would have been a saint . " Verna laid her hand on Bly 's . " Oh , we have a trust from our Maker in Evelyn ! " " But what did Derry advise ? " Her voice turned cold . " It is hardly worth while to repeat it . He said she should be placed in a normal family . Normal ! Our tender flower thrust into a coarse garden of weeds ! That is how much he knows . Only a mother 's heart can understand and protect Evelyn . I do n't underestimate your love for her . But what can a father know of the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her child 's being ? Her child . . . her own creation . Who can understand as she does ? " 99 " Yes , Verna . But did n't Derry say anything else ? " His voice was hopeless . He knew what Derry had said . How could he have imagined that Verna would accept it ? Thebattle was slipping from him . Where was his strength ? Why could n't he be a man ? The dim circle about him had lessened , the sphere of dark was closer . " He said that if she remained at home , we must take her outof Sunday school for a time , and keep her away from church . We must let her swim , dance , ride horseback  --  take fencinglessons . " Verna 's voice mounted ironically as she enumerated the pleasures . Bly knew that Derry had thrown in the fencing lessons for good measure . If he advised a trip around the world , perhaps the patient would get as far as the gate . " Above all we must teach her that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . You do n't believe it , do you ? " " Mr. Emberson , are you asking me if I believe the word ofmy God ? " Bly shrugged his shoulders and let his hands slip on thewheel . He was exhausted . He ought not to be driving . " You are making it very hard for me , Mr. Emberson . I didnot know I had given my children an atheist for a father . " Bly gripped the , wheel . " Now , Verna , let us both be reasonable . We love each other , do n't we ? " She melted , and dripped to him . Of course he had not meantthat about hell . Her lover could not be an atheist . Bly felt more exhausted . The car would be in the ditch soon . " Well , was there any further advice ? " " Plenty . But we 've had enough of Derry 's nonsense . " " We 've got a swimming pool . " - " So he knows . But he said it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill it with boys and girls . Evelyn in a bathing suit frisking with boys ! Can you imagine that ? " " I can , my dear . All modern girls do it . " " Evelyn is not modern , thank God ! You are undersexed , Mr. Emberson , and I say it as a compliment . But it limits your understanding . I too am undersexed , " she lied grandly , " but my intuition keeps my eyes open . There are some things I00Evelyn must know nothing about until she is mature enoughto keep her balance . She is not going to play in the water with boys . " " Well , what are you going to do ? " " Just what I 've been doing . Watch over her , teach her divine truth , and leave the rest with God . " " Could n't we let her go occasionally for a week-end with gentle , nice people where there are young folks ? There 's asimple home out on Clear River . You know farmer Ferrabee . He has lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen Fairinda . She 's there on Sundays . Almost asflower-like as Evelyn , but strong and happy . These neighbors , the Hensleys , a man and wife , are both young , and one never sees a finer couple . It would n't be like throwing Evelyn with these know-it-all young moderns who would get her bewildered . Only a little change for her might prove magical . Did n't Derry say that ? " " It does n't matter what he said . But this might be a plan worth considering . The darling is a constant care , and I  --  " " Yes , it 's too hard on you , Verna . We must find some way to lighten this dear burden for you . " Verna was pondering . " I might go out there with her . " And discover the boy , thought Bly , sinkingly . " Grand of you , mother ! Only the point is to let her swing out a little for herself . That 's the point . You ca n't be holding her in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , if I only could ! I would n't care . Do n't talk about ease for me . But I will think over this suggestion of yours , Bly . And , dear , let 's get back to the subject of your business . I do n't want you to be so worried . If it 's really as serious as you 've intimated  --  " " I 'm hoping to pull through . But we must be prepared . " " And you are prepared , I am sure . You would neglect nothingthat concerns your family . Your insurance  --  oh , I mustnot think of that . Yes , turn into the lake road . I feel liketaking a long drive tonight . Was n't Ada Hamilton 's dinner a bore ? " " My insurance , Verna , is another thing that I ought to speak IOIof . The payments are heavy . Heavy enough on the property . I 'm afraid I shall have to drop a good part of what I 've got on my life . " " Drop it , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bly would n't speak like that unless he felt thathe must . " I 've been raising money on everything I could to keep thebusiness going . I do n't know where to look next . But maybeI can find a way . " Verna had never stared into the face of poverty . But nowa hand with fingers of cold wind seemed to be stripping those horrible lineaments bare for her eyes . The chill hand gropedfor her heart . " One thing is settled , " said Bly , firmly . " Martin must goback to college . I 've got to find money for that , even if I dropthe insurance . " Instantly Verna felt better . The cold fingers relaxed , thelarge hand faded away . Martin need not go back to college . His soul would be safer with her . She had already decided that . Now she saw her way . The insurance could be saved , and Martin too . It would be easy enough to work that out through Martin himself . But she must mark her line , and movealong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , and enjoy the drive . I wish there was a moon . You must relax now . Let me have the wheel . Your fingers are actually trembling . You know I just love togive you a rest . " He got out willingly and changed places with her . Shestarted off gaily , her strong hands sure and light on the wheel . Martin had varied the monotony of many a drive by teachingher . Bly called himself a beast for not wanting to kiss her as sheturned her face brightly to his . The expectancy in it was a reproach . " Happy , dear ? " he asked , as her eyes wrapped himvelvetly and filled him with loathing . " Why should n't I be happy ? I 've got you , whatever comes . If only Lorene  --  but let 's not think of her now . " " I 'm afraid we ought to . " IO2 " She 's the only person in the world who can make me lose my temper . You take a risk when we discuss her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ought to be . " " She loves Bliss . " " Never , never will I consent for her to tie her life up with Bliss Rantelor 1 It is n't because he has no money . That has nothing to do with it . He has no character . " " As much as Raines Hamilton . " " Raines had enough strength to get on in the world . " " Yes , he has money . " " I tell you I 'm not thinking of money . I 'm thinking of my daughter 's happiness . " " Where is it ? " " Where ?  --  Oh , do n't be exasperating . Whenever it comes to saving our children I am the one who must exert myself . I might be gentle with Lorene 's obstinacy , but not her impudence . She came to me tonight and asked if she might telephoneBliss that he could come to see her while we were out . While we were out . " " It strikes me that would be a good time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused , as she knew I would , she said that she would go out to him . " " What happened then ? " " Nothing . I let her go to her room . Then I locked her in . " " Verna ! A girl of twenty-one ? In this century ? It 's  --  it 's Elizabethan ! " " I do n't care if it 's Adam-and-Eve . She 's locked in . " " I 'm perfectly ready to drop the subject , Verna . Yes , Ada'sdinner was a bore . Think of her having old Ezra Milburn there 1 " " I enjoyed him . I like to hear of those dear old days , when people were simple Christians . " " With slaves at their elbows . " " Be disagreeable if you like . It 's a lovely night . Cool and starry . " " Do n't run over that couple . Why , it 's the Hensleys ! Stop , Verna ! " 103Verna was surprised into halting the car . " What luck ! " said Bly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and held the car door open . " Do get in . We 'll take you home . " They took the rear seat , and Britt explained that they had gone in a neighbor 's car to spend the night with a sick woman , Essie Starbo . But they had found others with her and decided to return home , making a walk of it . " But we like it , you know , " added Ishma . " I do know , " said Bly laughing , suddenly happy . " How 's farming ? " Britt told him about his big tomatoes , and the rye ready to be cut . The soya beans and cane he had put in that week . And one fishing exploit . Ishma said nothing , but her smiles were ready , and Bly gave her an occasional contented glance . " I saw Mr. Hamilton tonight , " he said , when they had stopped at Holderness gate . " He agrees with me , so you 'll get the place . But what about the necessary car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five dollars . Anothertwenty-five will fix it up . We saved so much by his coming to live with us . The money that we thought would go for a plough-horse can pay for the car . " " Then you 'll come in tomorrow , and we 'll start you off . " It was Sunday night , and Fairinda came out to the gate . Her face , in the starlight , was like an up-gazing lily . Verna noticed it particularly , and spoke to Bly about it on the way home . " She 's a sweet girl . I 've met her several times at union church meetings and suppers . She makes money at a candy table . What is the place you are getting for Mrs. Hensley ? " " Hamilton and I want somebody to take care of the welfare work in both companies . By doubling up , we can afford to hire somebody , and the city will pay a third . She 'll work under Annie Campbell , who 's taking charge of the city relief . The Council has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hensley is just the person we need . She 's wasted in a mill . " " I think I like her , " admitted Verna , slowly . " Maybe I 'll try letting Evelyn go there over Sunday . It would n't do her any harm to miss Sunday school just once . " 104 " Maybe it would n't , " said Bly meekly . " And Derry will be pleased . " Her voice was deliberatelyspiteful . " Who is Ned ' that the Hensleys mentioned so enthusiastically ? " " Ned ? That 's their child . " " Oh , they 've got a child ? " " One . " " Evelyn likes little children . There 'll be three with the Ferrabees ' two babies . Who was that tall boy standing over by the well with Ferrabee ? " " I did n't notice . " " Ferrabee has n't got any boys , has he ? " " Only the two little ones . Fairinda is his first wife 's child . " " That was some neighbor boy then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hensleys ' little boy attractive ? " " Very . He 'd have to be with parents like that . " " Mr. Emberson , how long have you known that woman ? " " A few weeks , I think . " " Well , " she again slowed , up her voice , " I believe I like her . Perhaps I 'll try it out with Evelyn . Derry says I must let her learn to stand up without me . " " Maybe she wo n't come . " " The darling will do whatever I say . If only Lorene were aseasy to control , my path would be clear . Mr. Emberson , just look at that car parked out there ! " " I do n't see it . " " In the dark , under those trees . Is n't it disgusting ? " " I do n't know . " " You can pretend that you do n't know what that parked car means , but I never deceive myself . " As they passed the car Verna looked at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn her own car around . " What are you doing ? " asked Bly in amazement . " That is Bliss Rantelor 's car . I know it well enough . He is in it with some girl , I do n't doubt . I 'm going to see him with my own eyes , and tell Lorene . That will settle her . " IOfBly caught at the wheel . " You ca n't do that , Verna . It'sindecent ! " She brushed his hands away . " I 'm saving my daughter . Ifthat does n't interest you , keep out of it . " She turned and sped back , her head high and war-like , thehandsome face almost Roman in its righteous cast . When near enough she swerved the car and threw a full light into the parked vehicle . It was Bliss Rantelor , she saw with exultation . Then the girl in his arms raised her head , surprised by the invadinglight , and Verna looked into the face of her daughter , Lorene . Io6CHAPTER VLOOSE BELLY-BUTTONSANNE FERRABEE WRENN was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frail hands plunging in and out of the foamy suds doing the family wash ; when she wrung the clothes with a deft turn of the too slim wrist , and with a graceful flip pinned them to the clothes-line ; you knew it when you saw her moving immaculate about the kitchen stove preparing the almost invisiblefood , or laying the table for an almost imaginary meal . And in the bedroom , where it was necessary to place three fullsizedbeds and a cot , her talent shone with complete triumph over poverty . Never could one find a wrinkle on the pillows or a smudge on the covers . No odor of too crowded human bodies , or the musty smell of dust and old lint , came from the scrubbed floor and walls and painted ceiling . " It takes a lot of soap to keep house like you do , " complained her neighbor , Moodie Benn . And Anne did not tell her of her friend , the corner meat-man , who let her have bits of tallow and fat and bones for the asking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned out creamy cakes of soap , flavored with essence made from boiled sassafras roots which her little boy , Robbie , dug for her in the old fields that he passed through on his way to fish in Blue Creek . She wanted to tell Moodie about her friend on the corner , but she was afraid she would have less soap , and it did take a lot . Anne was not well . So far she had kept on her feet , with her house wearing its usual gleam ; but she felt herself sinking . Her disease was pellagra , sometimes called " mother sickness , " because mothers usually ate less than others in a family where the supply was uncertain . Their stomachs became adjusted to hunger until they could ignore it , and thus undernourished they were easily subject to attack . Jeffrey Wrenn , whom she had married twenty-five years before , was a bookkeeper , or had been a bookkeeper , for thatI07vocation was being written in the past in Dunmow , due to the many small failures and the narrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own books , if they had no ready member of the family to do it for them . It had been seventeenmonths since Jeffrey had very gently been asked to give up his desk at Brendon &; Sons , who retailed desks for the Alta Desk Company . Alf Brendon said he would write up his own ledger , if by the grace of God and good luck there should be anything to write . Jeffrey , being an intelligent man , knew that if Dunmow business had to lay him off , Dunmow business could not take him on ; but he set out the next day , and the next , and for thirty successivedays canvassed for a job . After that he stood on the road and hitch-hiked into neighboring towns . These also were vainly canvassed . At the end of five months he sat down to save shoe-leather and what was left of his pride . By the bitter road of self-denial he had put away three hundred dollars in the bank . His family was not so large  --  he had only four children  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and hisjob , and Jeffrey was giving shelter to him and his two little boys . There were two girls , Alfa and Myrtle , eighteen and twenty , who worked in the Sleicher Silk Mill . But they sometimessat in the mill for four days out of a week with nothing to do . Checks for an entire week had been as low as $I.39 , a slender resource for a family of eight . Jeffrey 's savings were fearfully dribbled out to the end . As long as Tom Jeff Ferrabee kept his farm he could make them gifts of meal , vegetables and fruit . But not nearly enough . Eight people , twenty-four meals a day . But it was n't twentyfour . Twice a day was as often as they gathered at the table , and after a time it became only once , with a thin slice of bread all around for the other meal . Jeffrey sat in his chair and read . He liked to read , but the library books left him dry and empty . They were like very old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid that his mind , too , was turning to very old hay . He had managed to get the girls through high school before they went into the mill . Theywere pretty , and maybe would marry . But suppose they marriedmen who were like his son , Vance ? Men who lost their jobs , and came back to him with their children ? Vance had been such a good boy . Left high school because his family needed an extra pay check . And he had helped the girls through . Then he had fallen in love , deep and distractedly , and his father had said , " Get along , son ! Marry her ! " They ought not to have had children , Vance told himself . And they had intended to have only one , but it turned out to be twins . And what darlings ! Vance shut his eyes and saw his pale , pretty wife lying in bed with a twin on each arm , smiling as if she had done something to be proud of . She had too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Bible said so . Then why did God make it so hard for him ? Take away his wife and his job and leave him helpless with two little babies ? No use to ask Dad about it . He would only sit still in his chair and look up at you with eyes boring at you like two hot augers . Guess he was asking himself things too . Only mother tried to comfort a body . She kept praying , and telling him to pray . The hardest thing he ever tried to do was to pray with his stomach gnawing holes in him . Yes , there was one thing harder . To pray , and know that his little boys were in bed and could n't go to sleep because they were so hungry . How could he be humble then , and thank God for his blessings ? Anne and Jeffrey had another son , Robert , nine years old . He was happy only in the fishing season , when he almost lived on the creek banks , catching now and then a red-horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and baked . When he caught a fish he was always careful to pick up enough sticks in the woods for the cooking . But there were long months when he had to be in school , with scant clothes and scanter food , and could only dream of a summer day when he might taste fish again . Two years before , he had been a healthy , lively lad . Now he was wistful and white-faced . He had stopped playing rough and getting dirty , Anne thought sadly , as she pressed out his thin shirt and neatly patched overalls. io8 109But Robbie had not lost his love for singing . He had a sweet tenor voice , and the two girls , with Fairinda to make a quartette , often sang with him , to the delight of the neighbors or anyone who dropped in . It was into this family circle that Fairinda came with her board money as a life-saver . With her also came one quarter of her father 's little hoard of field-stuff ; five bushels of corn and three bushels of wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got , F'rindy , " he said , " because Britt 's stuff is not comin ' in yet , an ' I do n't want me an ' Deely an ' the kids to cost him anything in lay-out . " Fairinda went into the silk mill with Alfa and Myrtle . There were others out of work who ought to have been preferred before her , but the foreman knew that she worked well , was trustful and unquestioning , and would give no trouble . He could put her off and on as he pleased . Some of the hands were beginning to look as if they wanted to kick up a row when he laid them off or forced them to sit around for days with no stock to work on , paying them by the piece . There were several of them that he intended to replace with the right kind , the kind that took what they could get and thanked God and the Sleicher Mill for it . The kind like Fairinda . Ishma taught the Wrenn family how to make a bushel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tender . Then if they could get sugar and milk to go with it , they had a full meal . It took fuel for the long cooking , but they prepared a great potful at one time , and daily re-heating kept it from going sour . And what a relief always to have something in the pot for the children . " Why could n't the Government buy up all the wheat the farmersca n't sell , and give it out to the hungry ? " asked Anne , naively , thinking of the stale sacks of yellow flour stingily doled out to the family of eight by the relief committee . " The government has already bought millions of bushels , " Ishma told her . " Oh , that 's fine ! That 'll help the farmers and us too . " " They 're not giving it away . They 're holding it . " " But wo n't it spoil ? Get weevils in it , or something ? " II0 " That would be a good solution for them . They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know ? When people are hungry ? What did they buy it for ? " " To keep it off the market and put the price up . " Anne dropped the subject . This Mrs. Hensley sometimes said things that nobody in their senses could believe . She was an awfully good woman , but she did have queer ideas . The Governmentwould n't use the people 's money to buy up wheat and let it spoil while folks were starving . But Vance and Jeffrey , who always listened , began to get a new gleam in their eyes . Ishma did not like her job . She had known that she would not like it . But the opportunity to make friends among the workers and be welcomed at doors which she could not otherwiseenter , was too important to be put aside because of distaste for the work . As her loathing grew , every day became more difficult than the day before . She had n't realized how effectivelythe position would hobble her tongue and seal her mouth . Bringing temporary relief to a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the living truth to them ; something that would wipe away forever the necessity for " re-lief . " " It was more endurable back in Winbury , " she said to Derry . " Winbury at its worst . " " What particular time was that ? " " When I came down from the mountains after the colony was attacked and the sheriff killed . When we were hunted through the woods and fields , and hid wherever we could . " " And this is worse ? " " We talked there . We could make people believe . When we were caught , we talked right out , on the street as they took us along , in jail , in court , everywhere we talked . " " When are you going to tell me about that time , Ishma ? You know I was up in Yancey trying to die with pneumonia . I only know that you came down from the mountains and flung yourself into the cockpit . But what really happened to you ? When are you going to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to tell it as it would be to live it again . There 's three weeks of my life that I 'll never make cheap with words . Words ! " " It was months before I could get to Winbury . Then they told me that you had been there , and had disappeared . " " Britt found me in a farmhouse very ill . As soon as I could be moved he took me back to the mountains . When I got well I was contented up there . You see  --  I had been so terribly ill . I 'd lost something that I could n't get back . And I did n't care . I was happy there for two years . " " I always meant to run up and see you . Wish I had . It would have been great to see you happy . Something to re-member . " " You 'd have seen it . " He did n't ask her why she had left that happiness , why she had come back to the mills . He knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to throb with thought . She had to come . There was no other life for her , being what she was , a woman with vision and a conscience . She could n't live a drugged life , even if the drug was happiness . Later in the day , when she met Bly , she was as frank with him about her job as she had been with Derry . Being frank with him had made it possible for her to keep on longer with her work . " I 'm going back to the machine , " she said , when he had turned to walk with her . It was perfectly correct , as Amy Bigrose said , for him to be seen on the street with a communityworker . " What machine ? There 's none for you to come back to . You gave yours up . You do n't expect me to put somebody out for you ? " " Could n't I exchange with some one ? " " Not easily . There 's Hamilton to consider . I had a time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put over another person so soon . And there 's the city  --  it 's paying a third of your salary . No , you 'll have to stay where you are . Everybody is satisfied but yourself . Miss Campbell tells me you are going to be the best case-worker on her staff . " I12 " That 's an insult . If I please her and the city , you can be sure I 'm only marking time . I feel it is worse than that . I 'm working backwards . That hurts deep . You ca n't know how deep . The machine is hard , but I love it . It might kill me , and I would still love it . It is something that is going on forever . The world will have to come under its power and adjust itself to it , as it does to the sun and the tides . Then it will be the best friend that man ever had . We say it makes us slaves . So it does . But that 's its revenge for using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting it work out its own nature . Oh , I love the machine ! " " It 's own nature , eh ? " " Yes . Men have considered the machine only as a goodsmaker  --  " " I thought profit ' was your complaint . Goods-making ' is all right , is n't it ? " " That 's the outside of it . Essentially the machine is a maker of leisure , and by way of making leisure it produces goods . We 've looked at it in action and have seen only the outside , a thing making goods . We 've let it ramp along doing just that . There was some excuse for us . It was so new . We did n't take time to reach to its heart and read the purpose for which it had come into being . " " You do make it personal . Quite one of the family . " " We must n't say that a machine makes so many yards of cloth , and how shall we sell it ? We must say that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be divided , and what shall be done with them ? Then we shall have started on our problem . " " And we 'll solve it , of course ! " " We 'll have the right start anyhow . " " And if we do n't solve it ? " " That 's what I 'm coming to . The machine will do it for us , if we do n't do it for ourselves , and it will give us the roughest deal humanity has ever had . Sometime before this century is out , men will find that , regardless of them , economics has been formed anew . The machine will have forced society to adapt itself to its inner , not its obvious , value . It will have absorbed113the whole world into its ultimate function  --  the trebling of every man 's lifetime . " " My ! He 'll have to find out what to do with it ! " " How can he till he gets it ? " " I see . Well , that trivial matter disposed of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't stand it  --  this merely keeping people alive , never looking farther than today , or next week . Doing it over and over , with no plan to end it , never thinking that it might be possible to end it ... " " Do you know my grocery store on Blinn Street ? " " I ought to , with all the orders I 've made on it . " " I 've done a lot of crediting since the lean years came , and before too . And this morning I made the emptiest gesture of my life . I sent out letters to everybody on the debit side of my books , saying the account was balanced . " Ishma stopped dead still and looked at him . The color flashed to her face , and light rushed from her eyes . " An empty gesture , " he repeated contemptuously . " You know it . That 's why I can tell you . I 'm a little ashamed of myself . I knew perfectly well that I 'd never get a cent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seigneur and cancel them . " He was sincere in his disdain , but the hot tear on Ishma 's cheek was like holy dew to him . " Mr. Emberson , if you had heard  --  " " Bly , please ! " " If you had heard men and women say , as I have , that they could live if they did n't have to drag their debts , you would n't talk about a gesture . They say , If I was n't in debt , I could sleep , ' or If I was just even I believe I could stand it . ' Last night Emma Wells told me that it was being in the hole so deep that discouraged her most . She felt as if she would never get up where she could see daylight again . " " It did n't cost me a thing except the stamps on the letters . I thought you 'd help me make fun of myself , playing the benefactorwith a postage stamp . " But Ishma 's response had fed a hunger in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border into a circle " 4of contentment . He wondered about it , for he knew that whether silent or ir . speech her mind was always driving on her one idea , a new economic life for mankind , and that ought to have been particularly upsetting to him since he agreed with her and could do absolutely nothing about it . There was no place for him to begin . He was in a cage whirling round and round toward a precipice . He could n't open the door , he could n't stop the cage . He had to stay in and go over . But in her presence there was a magical touch on the cage . It stopped whirling , and rested on a spot of green , cool ground , with the precipice so far away that he could forget it . Howeverhe argued or quarrelled with her , his heart was smiling . By her side he was a free man . " You look as if business were going better , " she said . " Are the orders coming in ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new cut in wages ? " " I 'm keeping the old scale . I 'll keep it till I go over . I 'll pay as long as I can get hold of anything to pay with . When I ca n't , there 'll be nothing to do except shut down . " " And let them starve ? " " Wo n't I be starving too ? " " No . You wo n't miss a meal . " " I 'll worry a lot . " " And they wo n't , I suppose ? Would you turn your mill over to the workers ? " " No . If I ca n't make it pay , they ca n't . " " But you know that owners are going to be eliminated finally . Why not be a shining first example of how to do it without friction ? " " You know what would happen . My fellow owners , if they did not see my throat nicely cut , would at least put the mill out of existence . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is only one way . All of the workers must take all of the mills at the same time . " " And they 'll be a long time learning that . " " No . Even here they are learning . This new wage-cut , for II5instance . They ca n't possibly live under it . That 's going to teach them something in a hurry . " " You ca n't stir up a labor war in Dunmow , dear woman . Our workers are high-class . They 're middle-class mostly , like their employers . Many of them have earned their own homes in the last twenty years . They 're not like Winbury workers . Do n't you think that . Their fathers and grandfathers have lived around here . Half of them have had a little high school , many of them got through . We 've been prosperous , turning our great trees into furniture and our cotton into cloth . Now that hard times have come , the workers accept privation as the common lot . They keep on praying and going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a few whom you might get stirred up , but the majority wo n't budge . Winbury was different . They had the communists there , and the rag-tag and bobtail of three states floating in and out . Do n't get your hopes up here . The workers wo n't move a peg . They 're fastened down , tight in the grooves . They 'll pray and wait . " " Hunger will move them . You 'll see . " " All right . We shall see . And good day to you , dear lady of hope that dieth not . Remember you ca n't have your machineback . Stay on your job , and do n't talk . Keep your beautiful mouth shut . It 's no use to tell a hungry man that all he 's got to do to be full is to stand up with every other hungry man in America and make the world , including severalgood-sized armies , come to taw . Just a little thing like that . " " You 've seen Derry today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you 've noticed . " They reached the big gate of Bly 's mill , and he went in , takingon burdens both palpable and imponderable . And instantly he was weary . His strength was going on up the street with Ishma . She was no more light of heart than he as she turned a corner and started down a long hill toward " the flats . " It was n't so much the privation and suffering of the people to whom she was supposed to minister that caused her heaviness . It was116the fear growing within her that they would never get the vision of a better earth . Get it clear enough to act upon it . Christian patience was grounded in their bones , flowed sluggishly in their blood . Above the bog of pain they lifted yearning eyes to an unknown shore . She had read of dervishes who burnt out their eyes that they might see more spiritually . All around her were people who might as well have been blinded for all that they saw of reality . That morning she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not ordered by God , and the woman had burst out weeping . " Oh , do n't tell me that !

The only help I get is when Brother Easton comes in to pray . " At Beryl Cruden 's it had been worse . Beryl , wife of Ben Cruden , was thirty-eight , and since she was eighteen had worked for the Jimison Veneer Company , her long , quick fingersdelicately busy in the cross-banding and core-stock rooms . This was a small company , but Jimison had steady customers among the piano and furniture manufacturers . He was content with fair profits , knew his employees as friends , and his wage scale was as high as business could bear . Ben was a shipper for the Milburn Home Company , and saw that bed springs , cots , cribs , couches , etc. , got out on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived on Ben 's salary , while Beryl 's was put into a pretty , graceful bungalow ; one in a row of pretty , graceful bungalows on Bourne Street . When visitors in Dunmow wanted to see the town , their friends always drove them up Bourne Street and back again to show what workers could do with their money if they had a mind to . For three years the consuming public had not been investing in pianos and furniture calling for veneer work , and Jimison 's steady wholesalers had become so unsteady that his small business was pinched out , leaving him dazed before a locked door . Ben and Beryl had their home nearly paid for . They had worn good clothes too , and gone about some ; belonged to clubs , and did n't blush when the church ledger was open for inspec-I17tion . They decided to cramp down into half of Ben 's salary , and put the other half on the house debt . They did manage to squeeze along for a time until the Milburn Company " rationalized " its operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a judgment on me , Mrs. Hensley , " said Beryl . " It 's God 's judgment . Ben and I both love children , but when we were married we knew we could n't pay for a home and have children too . We had to make a choice , and we chose wrong . I 've been a Sunday-school teacher for eleven years , teaching little children the word of God , and all the time going against His will . Now we 'll lose our home . It 's a judgment . " " But look at the people who are losing their homes and have houses full of children . Why has God punished them ? " " If you 'll study into it you 'll find they have sinned in some way . Not like us , but some other way . " " No , when I look into it I nearly always find that they 've done their best  --  drained their lives out doing their best  --  trying to make a home for the children . Do n't you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and then deprives them of a place to live ? The little ones are innocent . Why punish them ? " " But the Bible says that the sins of the parents shall be visitedon the children . What do you think of that ? " " I think it is terribly wicked and unjust . I would n't worship a God like that . " Beryl was frightened . She turned pale , and looked at the door as if she expected the devil to enter and carry Ishma bodilyaway . " Oh , Mrs. Hensley , I 've never had talk like that in my house ! " Ishma rose and moved to the door . Beryl could not concealher relief . " I wish , " said her guest , " that you and your husband would come to the meeting at Jim Conover 's tonight . It 's a meeting of the unemployed . " " But Jim still has work . " " Yes . And he 's interested in keeping it , as well as in helping others . We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is n't something we can do about them . The world is fullof everything we need , and we 're not getting it . Maybe it 's because we are not doing our part . You would n't say that God is keeping it from us , would you ? " " Do n't you think that He is punishing the whole world , as He punished the Israelites when they disobeyed Him ? Last Sunday the lesson was about that . " Ishma caught her breath . Those old Levites again . " I must go , Mrs. Cruden . But I wish you would come to the meeting . " " I ca n't . It 's prayer-meeting night . We have ours on Saturdaynight so that everybody can go . You ought n't to have other meetings on prayer night . You are good , and Ben and I both like you , but we 've talked about your not being minded toward the church . We 've prayed for you . We 'll pray for you tonight . We workers will never get anywhere without God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starvation with Him , have n't we ? " " Oh , do n't talk like that ! It makes me afraid . We must keep close to Him . You know what happened in Winbury three years ago , when a bunch came down from the North to run a strike and told the people to fight their own battles and not leave them to God . They killed the sheriff , and were run out and scattered over the country . Nobody would give them work . The leaders were caught too , and tried and sentenced to the penitentiary for twenty years . But some of them got away . The scoundrels ! Getting poor people into trouble like that . Such folks need n't come to Dunmow . We would n't listen to them for a minute . Not if they stayed a thousand years . Oh , in times like these , we could n't live without the One on High ! " Tears were running down Beryl 's cheeks . She clenched her hands over her bosom . " Though He slay me , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the " flats , " thought hopelessly of Beryl and the many of her kind in Dunmow . She recalled Winbury , and the strike so distorted in Beryl 's fearful mind . In Winbury she had been known as Rad Bailey 's wife , though she had no right to his name except through the love and shelter that he gave her . The solid , asserting substance that had been Rad was now only a faint unreality . The only part of those four years that seemed true was the time when she had foughtI18 I19side by side with the workers in a great mill , struggling for the right to live . She had learned then that she was a vital part of an emerging social power , and the thrill of it would never leave her veins . She must go on growing with the great , new body that was making at last a home of the earth . Those Winbury days , shared with Rad , were unsmirched in the light of understanding . What could be too much to pay for the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made her a part of life so long as life could be ? Ethic 's first law was not a troubling matter between this individual and that . It was the righteous adjustment of self to the social whole . What a load of dry dust would be blown from library shelves with that breath of truth  --  that cleansing of bookish air ? But in Dunmow it was not easy to feel the rising surge of life . On the struggling , newly organic pulse lay the inert weight of belief , static for centuries . There was nobility enough , and high desire . Enough to save the world surely , if that could do it , right here among the Dunmow workers . But it was wasted in prayers against an unanswering sky . A dead god left them moving self-isolated , self-destined , toward the abyss . The mildest unionism was vigilantly fought . Organizers from so conservative an association as the American Federation of Labor had been escorted out of the city and advised not to return . When she had come to Dunmow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women toiled together would be the seed-ground of life . There had been no possibility of obtaining work in Winbury , where she was known and black-listed . An appeal to Derry Unthank had resulted in an offer of work in his cousin 's mill . Her record would not be looked up , no disconcerting questions would be asked . And she had come . Now she was asking herself if she had not made a mistake . There was so little one could do here , and to that little she was unable to find , or make , an approach . She did n't know enough . Perhaps she ought to have gone to New York when Frances Quayle had made that step possible . Frances was a New York girl who had worked in the Winbury strike . She had written Ishma to come north and attend the Workers ' School onI20Eleventh Street . A friend would give her a room , another would provide meals , and the School would grant a scholarship . " Just a few months of it , " wrote Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most backward sections . You 'll know how to grow into conditions anywhere . " But she did n't go . Her heart had got in the way . Such a move might divide her again from Britt . She had only to think of those four years away from him to know that the wound of that separation was still raw , and would always be . Could it be that she was not a revolutionist at all ? She was only a wife ? The day was warm , exhausting . It was easier to walk without reflection . She gave up trying to think . At a distance before her , on the other side of the street , an old woman was walking steadily along . In her right hand she carried a covered pail . Under her left arm was an enormous bundle of switches , their ends tapping the air as her feet padded the pavement . Willow , probably , for making baskets . She had entered the street from the fields that stretched away from it on that side . Where Ishma was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of clinging to the last rung of respectability . In the front window of the best room there would be something set out to show that all was not lost . The window which she was passing had a little table drawn before it  --  the only table in the house , she knew , from having called there  --  and on it was a vase of paper flowers . Lace curtains , very ragged , but white , were parted to show the vase , a sign of undefeat . The next window had no curtains , but the little stand was courageously there , holding up the model of a ship . At the next house a single book was exhibited . The Bible . Visitors in Dunmow were never driven through the " flats . " The least desirable part was the bottom of the cup-like valley where two streets crossed . As one descended , gradations in poverty could be noted . Each house was a little more dingy , a little more hopeless , a little more the abode of the submerged . Ishma thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keenest wit , the lordliest heart , the most revered characterin the community . But up there , man 's first fight was with Nature , who was companion and teacher as often as enemy . I2IHere , your claws were after your neighbor 's job , which meant his flesh . Before one of the poorest houses , where not a flower grew , where the yard remained unswept , and not a scrap of wood or kindling lay around to indicate that sometime or other there would be cooking again , Ishma suddenly halted . A man was coming out of the house carrying a bunch of lead pencils . He saw her , and stopped as suddenly as she had done the instant before . Then he slouched into the street , looking at the ground , and was passing her without raising his eyes . " Job ! " He looked up , and his crooked mouth straightened to a smile . Job was a man of principle . His mouth was crooked because there were no teeth on one side . " Ishmer ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Job Weygood . It 's three years since we parted in Winbury . " " Hai n't it ! Three years since they scattered us like sheep . " " We 'd have won that strike , Job , if the sheriff had n't comethat night with his guns and deputies . " " He paid for his meddlin ' , pore feller . " " Yes . " " You wuz n't there . You left before the worst come . " Ishma flinched . " But I went back . I went back as soon as I heard what had happened . I tried to help . " " Hep us hide . That was all we could do then . " There was nothing accusing in his voice . Merely acceptance of unalterable fact . Ishma was silent and grateful . " Sixty of us arrested right off . I 'll never forget them three nights in that punky jail , no water , an ' stink bombs breakin ' on us . I can taste that air now when I think about it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " She died of it . " He was n't going to continue that subject . " Of course you could n't get work . " " Not a thing . Finally I took up peddlin ' . Nobody asks who I am up here . Nobody knows . I get along . A few pennies a day . And the folks in this house let me stay . They do n't pay no rent , an ' I pay the same . You 're doin ' fine , I reckon ? " Ishma did n't answer . " I knowed you 's up here . I saw you on the122street one day , an ' I says to the feller I 's with , Who 's that ? An ' he says you 's Mis ' Hensley , wife of a farmer about eight miles out , an ' you 's workin ' in the Emberson Mill . " That was Job 's way of assuring her that she need n't be afraid of anything he might disclose . " I 'm married to Britt Hensley , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Job , and we 'll talk . Come sometime and stay a week if you want to . You 'll like my man . " " I 'll shore come , " he answered , and moved on up the hill . The old woman was still ahead , taking slow , regular steps , but plainly weary . Ishma overtook and passed her , without crossing the street to talk to her , or carry the bucket , as she ordinarily would have done . She was in momentary rebellion , having had all the poverty and ugliness and hopelessness that she could walk under . But a block beyond the old woman she paused and turned back . " Why did n't I stop ? " she asked herself . " I knew I would turn back . " She greeted the old woman and took the bucket . The weight of it surprised her . It was heavy on her own strong arm , and she wondered what was in it . The woman gave her no hint , and gave the bucket no attention after Ishma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the matter of the switches was open . Ishma could talk about that . " Yes , they 're for baskets , " answered the woman . " My man makes over old shoes an ' peddles ' em . He goes around an ' gets all the shoes folks are ready to throw away . He used to be right handy makin ' ' em over , but his hands are trembly now  --  he 's nearin ' eighty  --  an ' he sells most of ' em without fixin ' . He ai n't gatherin ' up many now . Folks are wearin ' their shoes plumb out , an ' cobblin ' fer themselves . But Jim makes enough to feed himself . An ' I feed myself . I 've always done that . I never took a penny from a man , an ' I 've had two husbands . " Her head rose proudly . " Lucy Boardman ai n't never took a penny from anybody . You 're workin ' for the welfare , ai n't you ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' around . Miss Annie Campbell , she 's head up at your office , she sent me word to come up , she had a dress123for me . But I did n't go . An ' I ai n't goin ' . I 've worked all my life for what I got , an ' raised two families . " " Where are your children ? " " Ever'wheres . I get letters from ' em . They say it 's hard times all about . So me an ' Jim we make it for ourselves , an ' do n't ask them for nothin ' . They say children do n't pay for their raisin ' . Who wants ' em to pay ? If parents ca n't give their children raisin ' they ought to be ashamed of it . I did n't have a single one go out for hisself ' fore he was thirteen . " There was something queer about the old woman 's figure . Ishma noticed . Her abdomen seemed to hang low and was protuberant in the lower part rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came to a house where a woman was standing on the steps . She was young , and not utterly despairing . " Howdy , Aunt Lucy , " she said . " Howdy , Emmer . Has Tom got work yit ? " " No . But they have n't cut us off relief . We 're thankful for that . " She looked guardedly at Ishma . It would be wiser not to complain . Ishma knew about her . " You have two small children . Are you getting any milk for them ? " " Not a drop . They eat fat-back gravy . It ai n't agreein ' with the least one . " Ishma looked so kind , she dared to say it . " It 's too swampy here for a garden , is n't it ? " " You said it . But there 's a hump by the kitchen door , and I 've got a tomato vine on it . We got three tomatoes off it today . " She was still tasting the juicy tomato , one could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Aunt Lucy ? " Mrs. Boardman laid her switches down . " Yes , but I ai n't so tired . No use holdin ' them switches while I 'm standin ' still . " " You 'll die sayin ' you ai n't tired , Aunt Lucy . She 's been a hard worker , Mis ' Hensley , " said Emma Burke , betraying the fact that she , too , knew who Ishma was . " Been ! " protested Mrs. Boardman , and Emma patted her shoulder . " You 're a hard worker yet , only there ai n't so much a body can get to do . " Mrs. Boardman accepted the apology , and Emma turned toIshma . " I 've heard people talk about you , Mis ' Hensley . They 're all glad you 're doin ' relief . They like you . " " I 'm giving up the work , Mrs. Burke . " Ishma had made her decision . Emma 's face fell . " But I 'll try to get you put on the milk list before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wo n't you come in ? " She had been ashamed to invite her into the bare house , but now she was ready to show the worst . " No , we ca n't stop , " Mrs. Boardman answered for Ishma . She wanted to go on , and she wanted help with that carefully ignored bucket . Emma had become cheerful . That milk ! " You 're carryin ' her bucket . Make her sing you a song for it . Aunt Lucy knows ever ' song that ever was . " The old woman threw back her head , her eyes bright with happy fire . Her face was a patch of wrinkled smiles . " Singin ' has kept me alive . But I ai n't goin ' to do none of it now . I 've got to get along . " " Would you think she could work and her like that ? " said Emma , touching the old woman 's abdomen . " She 's worked twenty-five years and had two children since that happened . " " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All her insides are outside her skin . " " I ca n't believe it 1 " " There they are . Just tech ' em . " Emma grabbed Ishma 's hand and pressed it against the old woman 's swinging " insides . " She would never forget the touch of that shaking , jelly-like bag of living substance out of place . It was as big as a half-bushel measure . Could a person live like that ? And work ? And smile and sing ? Lucy saw her consternation , and was proud of being the cause of it . She had swung along for so many years with her affliction that her familiars had ceased to be interested . " How  --  how can you do it ? " " I do n't do it . It 's the Lord . He does it . It ai n't me at all . " She eyed Ishma triumphantly . Here she was . A bride of the Kingdom . " Folks might say I 've had a terrible life , " she continued . " My first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nearly broke my back over an iron bedstead . My two oldest boys got smashed124 125in a wreck  --  smashed till they was n't more'n a patch of blood on the ground . My second man was always mad about my first man 's children , ' cause I 'd help ' em whether or no , an ' kept cuttin ' up about it , an ' I had to support ever ' one of ' em till they 's old enough to get out . Then my house got burnt , with all my quilts an ' beds an ' things , an ' the furniture I 'd got from my mother . But the Lord has been with me ! Praise His name , He has been with me all through it ! " " With you ? And let you be served like that ? " She was amazed at the spark her words set off . Lucy Boardman'sface flamed , and her eyes seemed to shoot murder . One could sense her tremendous vitality , the full source of her endurance , as she directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might possibly be out to cheat her of the reward of faith . " Do n't you say anything about my God ! I 've worked for Him all my life , I 've took poison out of the devil 's hand , I 've stood ever'thing a human bein ' can stand , an ' I 'm goin ' to have what I 've worked for ! I 've got a place waitin ' for me in heaven , not at anybody 's feet either ! I 'll be right up in the row with Jesus ! An ' you ner nobody 's goin ' to take that away from me . My God is a just God , an ' He 'll give me my rights ! " " I only meant that you deserved more in this world . Why should you have to wait until you die before you can have any of the fruits of your toil and faith ? " " Because it 's God 's way , that 's why . If He wants me to wait , I 'll wait . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him till I kai n't turn in my bed an ' death 's a-rattlin ' in my throat . I 'm not goin ' to take any chance . Heaven is mine ! I 've bought it over an ' over , day after day , year in an ' year out ! I 've given up everything but that . I ai n't had nothin ' . " And that was the thing that was burning her vitals . She had had nothing . " I know you 'll get heaven if anybody gets it , Mrs. Boardman . " She was fire again . " You ai n't hintin ' that nobody 'll get it ? " The look in her eyes made Ishma want , above all things , toreassure her . " You need n't worry about what you are going toget . Not for a minute . You rest easy about the future . You'll126have the best there is . But I ca n't help wanting you to have a little more comfort right here . " " I do n't need any . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better I 'll have it there . I can hold out . I can hold out to my last breath . Sometimes I wish I could make it easier for my Lu Ann  --  down in the swamp country , with thirteen children , draggin ' along with malaria . I wish I could make it better for her . That 's my temptation . Then I pray the Lord to forgive the sin of my mind , and he does . " They walked on in silence . After a block or two , Ishma said , " I want you to go to Miss Campbell and get that dress . " " You do n't think it 's wrong to take something I never earnt ? I ai n't ever done that . " " You earned it twenty million times over 1 You go and get it . Make them give you a pretty one . The prettiest one there . Mrs. Hamilton has sent in half a dozen dresses . You get the very best one . " " Mis ' Hamilton ? Ay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , only for a different reason . Over-eatin ' , maybe . Her dress 'll fit me . " " Do n't let them put anything ugly on you . Look them all over , and take the prettiest . " " A purty one . " The seventy-year-old eyes dropped like a girl 's , looking at a pretty dress  --  on herself . Then she resigned the picture . " I 'll take it , " she said . " A purty one . An ' I 'll send it to Lu Ann . " Lucy stopped before a tiny two-roomed house , both rooms fronting on the street . One of them was a living and sleeping room , the other a kitchen and workshop . Ishma could smell worn shoes . Looking through the window she saw a decrepit old man fumbling about . In one shaking hand he held a coffee-pot . She saw him lift it uncertainly to his mouth and drink from the spout . Turning her head quickly away , she said good-by to Lucy Boardman and her bucket . Down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " flats " livedthe Negroes . It was Saturday afternoon , but there was no signof gaiety on the streets . There was hardly a sign of life . Per-I27haps most of the dwellers were over on Main Street , roaming up and down , hoping for a chance to earn a " coke , " or a loaf of bread to take home . The day was full of the first unbearable heat of the season , but desolation was like a chill in Ishma 's veins . It did not help much that overhead was the bluest of blue skies , and around her the air glittered with summer . The flowers before some of the unpainted shacks did not help . Flowers that hungry hands had not forgotten to tend . Bees and humming-birds were darting and sipping as if Creation , with no thought of man , existed for them only . They made the sense of emptiness more acute . The street was a husk that human life had abandoned . Human life can not survive without hope , and hope was dead in the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hidden backyard , came the sound of a young Negro voice . It was plaintive , it was near to quavering , but it was clinging to life . On a feather of life it rose , drawn by a yet living hope . " Harlem water is like sherry w  --  i  --  n  --  e  --  " Ishma became aware of eyes at windows and half-open doors , of drifting figures about the rear sheds and wretched back lots , where a burnt and unfertilized vegetation attempted to bear food . Life was still here . It had n't been utterly starved out . Turning a corner she saw an old Negro woman out in her yard counting the astonishing number of blossoms on a tall , yellow-flowering stalk . " How many , Auntie ? " she stopped and asked . " Be 's like they 's sixty-six , an ' all ' from one seed that I put in the ground mahsef . I got it from Mis ' Walker , the lady I work fuh . I kaint say I works fuh huh now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But somebody must be working , Auntie ? " " No , we 's jest perishin ' . That 's all . We 's jest perishin ' .

Evah whah you goes there 's nothin ' movin ' but yo'sef . It 's been six months since Mis ' Walker told me she could n't give me no mo ' work. 128But she lets me come an ' scraps to bring to de of man an ' my granchile . I ai n't had what you could call work in six months  --  not a tap at a snake . I tell you , honey , our bellybuttonsair jest hangin ' loose . " She was hungry , one could sec . And she was not the kind of negress who looks plump and young at any age . She looked as if her bones had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips could be crushed between two hands . The wrinkles of her face lay on one another in little piles . " Are they cuttin ' white folks wages agin ? Dat 's what I 've heard . " Ishma hesitated before the old eyes that begged her to say the bitter news was not true . " Is dey sho ' null cuttin ' white folks ' wages some mo ' ? " " Yes , they 're cutting again . " " Lawd hep us 1 What we goin ' to do ? " " Do you know Sim Wiggins , Auntie ? " " Dat cullud man ? Sho ' I know Sim . " " There 's a meeting at his house tonight , for those who are out of work . " She was not too starved to chuckle . " Law , his house wo n't hold ' em . Dey 'll have to go to de fields fo ' dat meetin ' . " " They 're going to talk things over and decide what to do . You be there , and tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us cullud folks ? " " There 'll be one or two white people , to help you talk . " " You be dere , honey ? " " No . But I 'll come next time . " Ishma knew that she had no business in the " flats . " " The Negro section is well taken care of by so-and-so , " she had been told . " You are not expected to go there . In fact , you are expectednot to go . " Next week she would not be a city employee . Her movementswould be unrestricted . She needed the money that shewas earning , but more than that she needed her freedom . Shewould find real work somewhere , and forget these days of constantinner humiliation . She knew many more people , she had129made contacts of psychological value , but at too dear a price . One could not feed at the trough of the dead and escape poison . She turned back up the hill , for she wanted to be at Holdernessbefore night . Derry was coming out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . Evelyn was to stay at the farm from Saturday night until Monday morning , provided she was happy . Ishma , so secure in Ned , was already yearning over Evelyn . IT was sundown when Derry drove up with the child , and Ishma had not yet reached home . Tom Jeff was milking . Deely was putting supper on the table . Albert and Walter stopped their play under the table and toddled out to meet the guests . This was a good beginning . They were fat and pretty . Evelyn wanted to cuddle them at once , and they liked to be cuddled . Uncle Derry rolled them in the grass , and Evelyn tried to pick them up . Tom Jeff called to her from the barnyard . She must come and see his cow . There was a little calf , too , as fat as the boys . The calf let Evelyn stroke him , then butted her in the stomach . She screamed , but saw that Derry , Tom Jeff and the boys were laughing . So it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was nice . Not a strange place at all , and she was n't the least bit excited . Deely came out and said that if they wanted a hot supper they 'd have to eat right away and not wait for the family . The family being everybody by the name of Hensley . A tall woman came up in a neighbor 's car and got out . She had short , dark curls , and big gray eyes with lashes the color of her hair . They made her eyes look dark until she got close to you . Her mouth was big , but her lips had nice curves . Her teeth were so beautiful that when she smiled you wanted her to smile again so you could make sure they were as beautiful as they seemed to be the first time . Uncle Derry talked to her as if he had known her all his life , but Evelyn knew that he had n't . Nobody had known her all her life . She looked like that . " Hello , dearish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is the farmer and his lad ? " 130 " I have n't seen them since the middle of the afternoon , " she answered , in the most comfortable voice , thought Evelyn , that she had ever heard . " I left the car for them , and told them I could come out with Mr. Landers . I thought they would get here first . " " I vote for an undelayed supper . If something has held up Britt , it may hold him up for a long time . " They washed their hands in the yard . There was a bucket of water on a long bench , and two or three pans . The tall woman  --  she was Mrs. Hensley  --  went into the house and brought out fresh towels . Uncle Derry kept laughing , and calling her " dearish . " But Mrs. Hensley did n't seem to mind . Evelyn got the idea that she would n't mind very much whatever happened . That is , she would n't faint , or scream , or quarrel , or say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind and beautiful , and try to help you with her comfortable voice . She had big hands , but they were lovely , and Evelyn wished that she would keep on cutting bread until the loaf was cut up . They had loafbreadfrom town , but there was hot cornbread for everybody who wanted it , and Mr. Tom Jeff ate a lot of it . Evelyn had a boiled ear of corn , young and tender , with butter on it , and a big bowl of wheat and cream . The wheat grains were cooked whole , and she thought she had never tasted anything so good . Mrs. Hensley ate the same as Evelyn . There were potatoes , and a big platter of beans , and fried side-meat , the streaked kind , for anybody who wanted them . " No tomatoes , Deely ? " Mrs. Hensley asked . " Not ary one . Mr. Britt took ever ' single one that was ripe into town . " " Stingy with us , is n't he ? But they were fine tomatoes . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After supper Mrs. Hensley washed the dishes and told Deely to take the boys to the big front porch and have a game before they were put to bed . They 'd better not play on the grass becausethe day had been very hot and there was a heavy dew . Derry offered to help her with the dishes , but she told him to walk under the trees and smoke . When she was through in the kitchen she did n't come where the children were playing , nor131to the trees where Uncle Derry was . She went to the gate , and after standing there a little while she went along down the road . In about ten minutes a car drove up and three people got out . Mrs. Hensley , with a big , good-looking young man , and a nice , tall boy . The man and boy had on overalls . Evelyn had pretendedthat she was n't afraid of boys , but in her heart she was ready for flight if one of them came confidentially near . Now she stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " called Derry . " ' Lo , Ned ! " So that was Mr. Hensley and Ned . Tom Jeff had heard the car and hastenedfrom the barn . " Hello , radio ham ! " he shouted , and Ned waved a large envelope . Tom Jeff gave a very clumsy hop into the air , and called again , " You got it ! Got yer license ! " and Ned waved the envelope again . " Had a break-down ? " asked Derry . " No . Was held up at the police station . " ' " Sounds bad . How much did it cost you ? " " Not a brownie . It was Ned who had to go . " They had come into the kitchen . Evelyn followed , her heart jumping . Police ! Deely was taking the boys upstairs . She stopped halfway up . Police ! Lord ' a ' mercy ! She hurried on , so that she could speedily get down again . Tom Jeff was sputtering . " Let 's have it , boys I Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Ishma . " And they can tell us after supper . " But Tom Jeff made them begin as soon as they sat down to eat . " It 's Ned 's story , " said Britt . " He can tell it . " But Ned would n't , and Britt began . " He was walkin ' down Wrenn Street with Ralph Barnet  --  " " Oh , I know Ralph Barnet ! " cried Evelyn , from her corner , where her excitement had driven her . " Hey , who 's here ? " said Britt . " It 's Evelyn , I reckon . Come here and we 'll shake hands . You see I ca n't leave my supper . " " But Ned can , " said Ishma , keeping Evelyn protectively in her corner . " Come and meet Evelyn , Ned . " Ned walked over and they genteelly shook hands , Evelyn trying to be casual like Lorene . " Evelyn Emberson , " laughed Britt . " There 's a name for you 132right out of a story book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to like him a lot . As to Ned , she had alreadysuccumbed . And not without reason . He was a boy that people liked to see . Anxious men , passing him in the street , wondered what it was like to feel so unbewildered as he looked , and began to think that maybe the world was n't in such a bad fix after all , with youngsters like that on the way . His bright , clear skin seemed a transparency of his good-will and a mirror of your own . It was like his father 's , that seemed to need no attention , whatever his rough work might be . " The angels wash it for you , do n't they ? " Ishma had teased her husband . " You do n't have to do much about it . " Evelyn , instead of blushing and looking at the floor , had no trouble in meeting Ned 's eyes . They were his one real beauty , which his mother had given him . Evelyn thought they were peaceful eyes . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift , sly glances of Peter Welles were apt to do . Tom Jeff was impatient with the civilities . " But what about it ? " he urged . " Ned was walkin ' down Wrenn Street ? " " Yeah , an ' that colored school-teacher , Lee Haines  --  you know him ? " " Shore ! What about him ? " " He was drivin ' along in that little roadster he 's so proud of , though it was on the road ' fore Ned was born , I reckon . He 's had it all slicked up , and was drivin ' along on his own side of the street , mindin ' his business all right , and two girls were drivin ' down the street toward him on the wrong side  --  " " Gee ! " " They were talkin ' fast an ' not noticin ' anything . Ralph Barnet had a newspaper he was takin ' home . He opened it out like he was readin ' , an ' says Fool girls ! Goin ' to drive right into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wo n't see it . We might have to go to the police station an ' be all mixed up with a nigger . ' " " Uppity , ai n't he ! " " No , " defended Ned . " His mother 's awful particular . " " Ned thought the girls would shorely stop , but they come right on , drivin ' fast , an ' Haines went off onto the sidewalk133tryin ' to keep them from hittin ' him . An ' was n't the gals surprised ? They 's jolted bad . One of ' em was jumped right into the wind-shield an ' broke it . " " Hurt ? " asked Derry . " She was hit on the head , an ' fainted . But she come to in a minute . Both cars were torn up pretty bad . Ned ran to the wreck , it was about a block off , an ' by the time he got there a man had come out of a house . He was a friend of the girls , an ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were parked right here , ' they said , and this nigger ran into us . We had the door open and were starting to get out . He ran right into us . ' " " I 'll be pickled an ' et ! " said Tom Jeff . " Were they as smooth as that ? " " The man friend let in like a busted hose an ' give Haines a stream o ' cussin ' . A policeman had come up by that time , and the man told him how it was . The girls had parked their car and were starting to get out . . . an ' so on , puttin ' in a little hooey of his own where he thought it would fit . " " Wha 'd Lee Haines say ? He ai n't the dumb kind . " " He started to explain , an ' the policeman told him to shut up . He did n't want any lies out of him , he said . But he 'd let him off if he 'd agree to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' says the gentleman friend . You 've got to pay for her car . ' " ' And mine too ? ' says Haines , an ' that tickled the man . If it 's fixed you 'll pay fer it , ' he says . I 'm not able , ' Haines told him , an ' the policeman says , You 'll get able ' fore we 're through with you . ' " " What was Ned doin ' ? " " He was waitin ' for things to get a little quiet . Then he says , This man did n't see the car hit . He was n't here . ' " ' What you know about it , cub ? ' asks the policeman . You 'd better hold yer tongue . ' And Ned told him again that the man did n't see it . The girls were comin ' down the street on the wrong side an ' they hit the other car . ' " Would you dispute a lady 's word ? ' says the man friend . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Ned . " Then the policeman ' lowed he 'd better take ' em all to thestation , an ' the man friend called Ned a little liar an ' said he needed a good whippin ' , an ' he meant to give him one . " Evelyn had come forward and was standing with her hands clasped and her eyes on Ned , all shyness forgotten . Ishma moved her chair until she could put her arm about the child and draw her to her side . Ned was looking steadily at his plate . " Let 's cut it short , Dad . " " Take yer time ! Take yer time , Britt , " said Tom Jeff . " Do n't hold out on us . " " Well , Ned said to the policeman If it was Haines ' car that ran into the other one , what was he doin ' with two wheels on the sidewalk before they struck ? You can look at the tracks an ' see where he turned off twenty feet ' fore they struck him . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . An ' Ned says , If the girls were gettin ' out of their car an ' had the door open , why is the lock broken ? It had to be smashed when it was shut to tear the catch like that . ' The policeman mumbled some more , an ' took ' em all to the station . Ralph Barnet , who knew where I was , had scooted for me , an ' I got there as soon as the rest of ' em an ' heard the whole thing . " " And it was fairly and squarely settled , I suppose ? " From Derry , who had listened with unusual silence . " The poor young ladies had to pay for a miserable black man 's miserable car . " " Oh , no ! " " You surprise me ! " " Ned made ' em believe him . He never got a bit rattled , though the magistrate got mad and tried to make him give in . It was finally settled by lettin ' Haines off an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the fair , white ladies were relieved of all blame ? Chivalry still lives ! Let justice bow to it ! I suppose Haines was duly grateful for being let off with a ruined car ? " " He looked like he was . He got out of there as quick as he could . An ' he said to Ned as he went out , Buddy , you 're white . ' " Ned was very hungry . His appetite was always ahead of meal-time , and he was now two hours late . But he was eating nothing . He resented praise and was very uncomfortable . His134 135mother was the only one that succeeded in looking indifferent , and Britt felt that he must impress her . " Wife , you 've got a boy that looked three men in the eye an ' made ' em back down . That magistrate , the policeman , and the gentleman friend . " Ishma turned to the cupboard with some dishes , as if she had n't heard . " Deely , please take the butter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Oh , Derry , I 've got some notes on my work for this week  --  " She took her hand-bag from a nail , gathered some papers from it , and handed them to Unthank . " You said you 'd make my report  --  if it would be the last one  --  and it is . I 'll need it early in the morning , so you 'd better get busy . " Derry tried to look injured , then laughed and went to his room with the papers . Ishma reminded Tom Jeff and Britt that the water-trough in the barnyard was dry . They had more time to fill it at night than morning . Then she took Evelyn upstairs , and Ned , the kitchen cleared of admirers , happily attacked his supper . Evelyn undressed and got into bed . Ishma moved gently about the room , speaking of this and that in a soft , matter-offacttone . " The child must sleep , " she was thinking . But Evelyn was looking up with wide eyes . " I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin was going to be one . He had a workshop full of things , in the garage . But he got tired , and did n't learn the code and never got his license . He let me into his shop once . And I learned four lettersof the code . " " Ned will show you his workshop tomorrow . " " Oh ! And I 'll tell him I know four letters , and what R. F. means , and P.D.Q. " " If she spends a wakeful night , " thought Ishma , " she might as well go home in the morning . Derry 's experiment will fail . " " My door will be open , Evelyn , and I 'll be right here if you wake up and want anything . On the other side of you is Deely with the babies . " " Where does he sleep ? " " He will sleep downstairs with Uncle Derry tonight . " She covered Evelyn , all but her head , and sat down by her . " Now , 136while you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moonlight . . . and hear the wind swish . . . swish . . . out there in the trees . . . . " After a moment she thought Evelyn was asleep , but her voice rose lazily . " I think . . . he 's splendid ... " " Yes , dear . He is splendid . But he is only a little boy . He looks big , but he is really only a little boy . " " Ralph Barnet tries to talk to me in Sunday school . I do n't think I 'll speak to him again . I do n't think ... " The wind began to swish louder than her thoughts . She sank into the moonlight too deep to hear the wind . Next morning when she awoke she could n't remember any dreams . Usually she had queer , tangled , unhappy dreams , that made her feel hot and achy in the morning . She remembered that there had been a beautiful voice in the room before she went to sleep , a voice that got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and close to her bed it said something about the swishing wind and moonlight . . . and she was asleep . . . and then awake . She felt rested , and all quiet inside her head . Maybe her mind was gone . Was that why she had n't dreamed , and why she was n't thinking about anything ? Well then , it was nice to have it gone . A little laugh bubbled from her lips , so loud that Mrs. Hensley heard it and came into the room . She was laughing too . " I see you are ready for a big day . Do you know what you are going to do ? " " No , Mrs. Hensley . Do you ? " " You are to take a tramp with Ned and go for a row , miles of it , on the river . " " Did Uncle Derry say I could ? " " He said you must . You do n't have to decide at all . " Evelyn sprang out of bed . " Oh , I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying to do ! " Then she stood still , between two desires . " But when will I see his workshop ? " " When you get back . Or , if it is late , tomorrow , before you go home . " Home ! She had forgotten about home . Well , she guessed part of her mind was gone , but it did n't matter. 137After washing , dressing , and breakfast , she stepped out into the yard where Ned was waiting for her . His mother handed him a basket filled with their dinner . A spy-glass lay on top . " Do n't you want your net ? " He told her it was in the boat . Uncle Derry was n't anywhere in sight . " Hello , Evelyn , let 's go , " was all that Ned said to her . She knew that she was looking pretty , but he did n't notice , and as they tramped off she forgot about herself . Derry appeared from behind the well-house . " She went like a lamb , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures . " To Sunday school , " he added , with a little solemnity . " How long did it take her to go to sleep last night ? " " Two minutes . " " And no tears ? " " Evelyn is n't a baby . " " No , but it 's the first time in three weeks that she has n't cried herself to sleep . " " As bad as that ? We 'll have to be careful , Derry . " Her eyes were still on the disappearing figures . They had reached the old field beyond the rye . " He 's only twelve , " she said , wistfully . " But fifteen in mind . Body too . " " Yes , body . It 's not fair to him . " " You need n't worry . I know Ned as well as you do . " " Oh , no , Derry . " " I do . And he 's all right . He 's a hundred and fifty per cent okay . " " Of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little vehemence . " But it 's not fair to him . " She turned to the house , and he followed . " I know what you are thinking . You are asking yourself what is Verna Emberson'sdaughter compared with your Ned . A summer fly , gone with the frost . But he 'll not get hurt . It is strange , my dear  --  " She had gone into the house and was shutting the door . " You wo n't mind , Derry , if I want to be alone for awhile . " The door was shut , and he finished his sentence loudly to its wooden face . " Strange , my dear , that there is one thing not to be found on the top-side of earth  --  an impartial mother ? " NED and Evelyn , tramping through the old field , had reached the talking stage . " See that rabbit ? " said Ned . She looked all about and gave it up . He told her to look toward an old stump , nearly rotted down , a hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at the rock beside the stump , " he directed . And still no sign of a sharp little head and gray hump . Ned whistled and threw up his arm . A ball of earth seemed to fly from the side of the rock , grow slim in the air , and speed toward the woods , lifting a short , white flag behind . Evelyn shouted that she saw him , that he was going through the fence , that he was running into the woods . " Making for his trail , " said Ned . " I 'll show it to you . " When they were past the fence and at the edge of the woods , he stopped . " Right here , " he said . But Evelyn could see nothing resembling a trail . She was distressed . He would think she was only a girl , as Martin did . Maybe she 'd better tell him about knowing four letters of the radio code . Ned pulled the little bushes and long grass apart , showing her a burrow-like trail about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubs of grass and briars sticking up from the soil . " Oh , a little hidden road ! Can I walk in it ? " " It wo n't be as easy for you as for the rabbit . And pretty soon you 'll come to a briar thicket where you ca n't walk at all . You 'll be in as bad a fix as the deer when the rabbit fooled him . " " Is that a story ? " " A Cherokee story . " Now she 'd want him to tell it . A girl would . " Mother 'll tell you if you want to know it . She can crack out a lot of stuff like that . " " You tell me this one . But first where does the rabbit trail go ? " " Round an ' round and across an ' across , till it gets to the river , where we are going . It 's laid out to bother the dogs , and goes through plenty of briars . The dogs have to go around the thicket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while they get scratched up . " " I thought bunnies were foolish . " " Nothing is foolish that lives in the woods .
