SOME time ago , at a meeting for the discussion of foreign affairs , the chairman who introduced me said that whatever I might know of the subject on hand , I had at least been able to transform myself from an American into a French lady . I confess that this introduction disconcerted me , for I was much more anxious at the moment to pass for an authority on foreign affairs than for a lady of any kind ! On reflection , however , I saw that the chairman had rather aptly described a change which I really had tried to effect during my years abroad . Can an American adapt herself so thoroughly to the French as to become one of them ? This question became vital to me when I married a Parisian who spoke almost no English . It is true that many Americans make their home in France ; but for the most part they merely adapt themselves to the outward manifestations of a spirit which they never penetrate . It is the picturesque aspects of a foreign country which they enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live abroad , they arc travelers still and never really become part of the French world . Circumstances demanded of me a greater adjustment than this . France was to be my home , and if as a human plant I was to take root and thrive , I had to Iearn to think and feel with the French and enter fully into their life . For an Anglo Saxon such adaptation is difficult . The Latins arc more subtleminded than we are , and they needed no Einstein to demonstrate to them the philosophy of relativity , for it is inherent in their outlook . They do not indulge in the over-simplified conceptions by which we escape from reality 's infinite complexity . To them a spade is never merely a spade , but a complicated object whose history is connected with that of all the gardens of the world . They have a different set of values , another moral code , and to understand them one must develop new standards and a new inner life . In my case the metamorphosis was particularly hard for I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enthusiastic , and full of uncritical optimism . I once read a book called Lady into Fox and I am inclined to feel that the transformation described in it , while certainly more radical , was hardly more difficult than the one required of me ! Fortunately my chosen companion was eager to help me , but before he could do so it was necessary to interpret him . My Parisian husband was ever courteous and unwilling to pain me or to insist on his own ideas , and I had to learn to gather from a gentle hint or a casual remark what his opinions were . Never shall I forget the first dress I bought under his guidance . I hesitated between a green and a red brocade , both of which , I thought , had his approval . I finally bought the red one , but the first time I wore it I sensed without words that my husband did not like it " Why did n't you say so when I was choosing it ? " I exclaimed . " I did give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did not respond I thought you had set your heart on the red . " I realized then that he would never impose his point of view on me and that I must learn to recognize the small signs which indicated his approval or dislike . Once I was attuned to his signals , however , he guided me with unfailing delicacy and tact . In the first place he taught me how to manage my servants . Alone I might have taken years to discover that French maids never respect a mistress unless she knows the amount of work which she may demand of them . That amount is so incredibly large that I was never able to bring myself to exact it . When I realized that my chambermaid not only kept the apartment in perfect order , waited on table , and answered the doorbell , but looked after my husband 's clothes and mine , washed my lingerie and his socks , and mended all the linen , I had not the heart to ask her to make me underwear and blouses , as any Frenchwoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afternoon off every week , as well as the usual alternate Sundays , to the annoyance of my French friends , who declared that , like all Americans , I was spoiling the servant market . I knew , however , that my indulgence was appreciated by my maids , for they saw that it was not the result of ignorance . With regard to people my husband 's insight often modified my hasty judgments . " So-and-so is clever , but he is too vain , " I remember exclaiming apropos of a man who is a well-known political figure to-day . " He is a mere lady-killerl " " The word ' mere ' is premature " was my husband 's comment . " That vanity will not long be satisfied with such small game as hearts . He will have a political career . " Enlightened by my husband 's quiet discernment , I shed many of my illusions about the French . My present impressions of them are the result of many years of experience , but I feel that I still have much to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility which , if it is not always the beginning of wisdom , is at least the end of fatuous certainty . As I see the French to-day , their most outstanding characteristic is intelligence . They are both quick-witted and penetrating , and this is true of all classes , even of the peasants . Jacques Bonhomme may be ignorant , limited , sometimes brutal , but he is rarely dull . I discovered that fact in the wards of a war hospital . The soldiers whom we nursed , most of them peasants , were untutored , sometimes illiterate , but their perceptions were keen . There was little about the American nurses which they did not discover , and their estimates of us ? strange creatures though we must have seemed to them ? were often disconcertingly accurate . In the next place the French , far from being romantic , as is often supposed , are the greatest realists in the world . They are not afraid of facts , and they accept human nature as it is . They do not disapprove of sensuality in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they dislike excesses . Above all , they are fundamentally reasonable . They know that life is difficult and goodness rare , therefore they are sometimes angered but seldom astonished by evil . They are skeptical , for they do not see life veiled by the rosy mists of illusive idealisms , but they are very tolerant and understanding . My husband never speaks severely of anyone 's private life , and moral indignation seems to him somewhat childish . Although he would not imitate them for worlds , the worst that he can be brought to say of vicious people is that they are unfortunate . It is this mixture of tolerance and skepticism which gives French gossip its peculiar character . There is no place where scandal flourishes more riotously than in Paris , but , strange to say , it is innocuous . It was once alarming to me to be told that So-andso had probably murdered his father or eloped with the colored cook ; but I soon learned that such stories are simply fables which people repeat because they are amusing , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are told , because no skeptical Parisian ever believes a word of them . I remember the first time I brought home some such tale and told it to my husband with horror . " My poor child , " he said , with amused pity , " do you mean to say that you believe what you hear ? " It is true also that Parisians would probably not care greatly if some part of the gossip which they repeat were true . They would feel that in any case it was none of their business . Some years ago a well-known French nobleman published a book of memoirs in which he spoke of his American ex-wife very cavalierly . I happened once to mention this fact with some indignation to an acquaintance , and he answered me calmly , " Oh yes , I said to So-and-so " ( mentioning the author by his first name ) " ' My dear fellow , that is a rotten thing to do . ' But he is rather apt to do shabby things . " This was said without the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty . It is , however , confined to Paris , and even there to a certain milieu . The French middle classes are morally very rigid . Whether it is a cause or a result of these traits I know not , but the French are fundamentally unemotional . Excitable they may be at times , but only on the surface . They readily lose their heads over details , but in moments of real crisis they are cool andcollected . Their feelings are usually very moderate , and so they can afford to express them freely . An Englishman who greets a long-lost son dares not bestow on him more than a handshake and a gruff " How-dedo ? " If he let his feelings go the result would be overwhelming , volcanic ; so he must suppress all emotional manifestations . The Frenchman , on the contrary , can allow himself to kiss his boy on both cheeks , and even shed a few tears , thus enjoying his perfectly reasonable emotions to the full . I have sometimes reluctantly suspected that the French were rather cold-hearted ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to add that their affections , though not ardent were reliable . As friends and relatives , what they lack in enthusiasm they make up for in faithfulness and sincerity . For all their realism the French are not materialistic . They love form and they deeply respect ideas . In fact , these two things are the objects of their truest passions . As a girl , I once dined at the home of a banker with the famous socialist leader , Jean Jaures . During the conversation both Jaures and his host grew so heated that I feared they would come to blows . Yet the discussion was not on political or social questions , but on the literary merits of one of Ibsen 's plays . I do not believe that American politicians and bankers often spend great ardor on such subjects ! It was a passion for ideas which made Robespierre so intransigeant , and to-day many an ardent Republican continues to adore the doctrines of Democracy , though he grumbles ceaselessly at its results . II It was certain practical aspects of life in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious arose from the French indifference to comfort . It is a great mistake to suppose that the French do not indulge more freely in bathtubs , steam heat , ice boxes , and telephones because they are ignorant of these things . Not at all ! They simply do not want them enough . Comfort costs money , and the Frenchman prefers his sous . His comfort seems to him to be transient , while money is not , and the cheapest thing with which to pay is his own skin . I have seen wealthy women stand patiently waiting under the pouring rain for an omnibus rather than risk the paint of their limousines in bad weather . A Frenchman will not sell his tapestries , which are a joy to the eye ( and incidentally a piece of tangible property ) in order to put steam heat or plumbing into his ch ? teau . Personally I prefer the plumbing , but I have learned to respect this stoical indifference to ease , for I realize that in-France wealth with all its possibilities of harmonious living can usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with us , by energy and daring . Therefore , I am grumblingly prepared to put up with the relative lack of comfort in France . It must be confessed , however , that , whatever one 's philosophy , practical matters in France are often trying to an American whose ideal is efficiency . It is no wonder that Frenchwomen spend much time in their homes , for every detail there must be attended to in person . If you are giving a dinner , the cook will insist on showing you her chicken at every stage of transformation from the moment when it enters the kitchen , disembowelled with hanging head , to that when it stands triumphant on its platter , swollen with chestnuts and bejewelled with a decoration of truffles . If the kitchen stove smokes , the workman who repairs it will want to talk to you personally in order to explain that this stove has a peculiar temperament which must behumored . It is for you to reconcile the cook 's temperament with that of the stove ! Paris plumbing and heating never function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They seem to like the mere attention , however inefficient it may be . As for the Paris telephone , it is nothing but an instrument of torture , and only French endurance can resist its demoralizing effects . My husband is not naturally a patient man but I deeply admire him at the telephone . He is so polite , and he has such a variety of tones at his disposal : cajoling , plaintive , pathetic , tragic , and irate ! His eloquence would move multitudes , but it has no effect on the telephone girl . It is quite customary in Paris to send an occasional box of chocolates to the unseen deity who controls one 's telephonic fate and sometime gives one a number . This has always reminded me of the old pagan custom of propitiating the gods by sacrifices . Everyone does it and , therefore , there can be no particular advantage for anybody ; but no one dares stop because they feel that there is no telling how much worse things might be if the sacrifices ? or chocolates ? were omitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a great respect for the life of things . It is a real pain to them to see an object neglected , abused , or thrown away before its usefulness is exhausted . I well remember my husband 's face when he saw a small hole which I once carelessly burned in a bedroom carpet . I had kept the had news from him as long as possible , but at last it had to be told . " It can be mended , " I suggested , on the verge of tears . " The little Armenian at the corner repairs rugs wonderfully welt . " " Yes , " he answered , sadly , " but the place will always show . " Had the scar been on the face of a beloved child he could scarcely have looked more grieved . The basis of this attitude is not parsimony but the realization , which we Americans have lost , that things are in truth the product of human thought and labor , and that to abuse them is to destroy a real value . Waste seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are in Paris a quantity of little people whose sole occupation is to mend , to repair , to renovate . In France no object is too humble to claim its mistress ' care and consideration , and you are no true French housewife until you know where to have your shoes reheeled , your porcelain delicately mended , your furniture reglued , your fabrics rewoven . An aspect of French life which is chilling to Americans is the inhospitality of the French . In saying this my conscience troubles me with the memory of a wealth of kindness which I have myself enjoyed , but it must be admitted that in general the French are not open-handed or hospitable even to one another . Such informal invitations as : " Come to lunch any time , " " Stay with us whenever you are in town " are unknown in France . I have many Parisian friends who would make real sacrifices for me , but not one on whom I could drop in unexpectedly for dinner . Here too thrift plays a part . If you are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more . Nor can you have recourse to the ice box , for what passes for one in Paris is merely a sort of outdoor cage , in which are kept some dabs of this , some specks of that , unalluring trifles which , graced with a heavenly sauce will , nevertheless , make an excellent dinner . One of the painful experiences of my early married life was the first time we came home from the theater , and hungrily tried to raid the kitchen pantry . Mother Hubbard 's dog was no more disappointed than we were ! There are no left-overs from a French cuisine . Yet one French custom which I should much like to see adopted in America is the inflexible rule that one must empty one 's plate at table . There is no hardship involved in this except for the absentminded , for in France food is never portioned out by the hostess ; every dish is passed round so that each may help himself according to his appetite . Nothing is ruder than to omit to clear one 's plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave something implies that the dish was unpalatable , and that is wounding to a hostess who prides herself on her table . I suffered from this rule in the early days of my Paris life , for I was not used to calculating the exact extent of my appetite . Moreover , I did not always recognize the dishes which were served , and often found myself unexpectedly committed to a serving of some pet aversion . I always did my duty , however , for I knew how much rudeness on my part would pain my husband . He is himself a Spartan in such matters . Once on a stormy trip to Algiers I saw him finish a plate of cassoulet ( white beans and onions ) , a dish which always disagreed with him , because the ship 's captain had indiscreetly helped him to it . Even the thought of inevitable seasickness could not overcome his heroic courtesy ! This was excess of good manners , but the rule itself is a wise one . As a semi-foreigner I am appalled to see the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown away . As a matter of fact , French plates are not merely emptied ; they are wiped clean . The obvious reason is that French sauces are too delicious to be dealt with by a mere fork , and it is correct to mop them up with one 's bread . Unwary Americans should remember , however , that there is an etiquette even in this matter . The morsel of bread which carries the last drops of some culinary poem to one 's lips must be held by one 's fork . To pick it up in one 's fingers is an unpardonable solecism ! One reason why the French do not indulge in casual hospitality is that they like things well and even ceremoniously done , and when they are invited out they expect to find delicate food , well served , in an appropriate setting . My husband , who loves conversation and has the appetite of a bird , grumbles about accepting an invitation from some rare Parisian hostess who is a bad housekeeper . Her carelessness offends not only his cultivated palate but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward strangers as compared with our own eager cordiality has other sources . In the first place , clever as they are , the French have a very limited curiosity . Moreover , an experience dating back to the epoch when French society was the model of all civilization has led them to believe that they are themselves the best company in the world and , therefore , they prefer each other 's society to that of strangers . On the whole , they are not far wrong , but it is a pity that even a distinguished foreigner will usually seem to them less desirable as a guest than some figure of Parisian society . This provincialism used to grieve me , but I now suspect that the American liking for strangers , springing , as it does , largely from curiosity , often grows cold with time . I am not sure but that foreigners who live long among us are eventually looked on with contempt for the very unlikenesses which at first attracted us . In France , on the contrary , those rare individuals who are once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that they are outsiders . A further difficulty in entertaining in Paris springs from the fact that in France people who disagree do notwillingly mingle . It is hard to he tolerant with regard to things in which we believe strongly and , indulgent as the French are to human weakness , they are often intolerant in the intellectual domain . Americans enjoy people for their personalities rather than for their opinions , while the French on the contrary are more interested in what people think and say than in what they arc . One proof of this is that , greatly as they care for form , the French accept clever people whatever their outward semblance . Among our friends there is a man whose table manners would alarm an ogre and whose clothes are , I suspect , the same which he wore when his wife died fifteen years ago . But he is a man of powerful intellect , wide knowledge , anti keen wit . Therefore , not only are we delighted to have him at our table , but most Parisians , however fashionable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knife to punctuate his conversation , and sometimes drops a button into his soup . III Once the French have adopted a point of view they do not , as we do , struggle to keep an open mind ; for they feel that to be ever ready to change one 's opinions on important subjects is proof either of a want of proper reflection , or of a lack of clear thinking . Because ideas are so vital to them , they are apt to consider people who differ fundamentally from them as unpleasant or dangerous . The parlor Bolshevik is unknown in France , for no one would be inconsistent enough to receive in his salon a person whose avowed ambition was to destroy both salon and host ! The result of this is that in France most people have labels , that is to say , they are more or less identified with some type of thought or some party , whether Catholic or radical , socialist or reactionary . It is important in giving a party to assemble the right tags and not to mix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like cocktails , owe their success rather to the blend than to the quality of the ingredients . To combine opponents might be a joke in America , perhaps even a cause of pleasurable excitement . In France it would be a grave social error , and the result would not be eager discussion , but chilling discomfort . To commit a " gaffe " is a serious matter in France , for it will never be forgotten . If you have uttered some amusing na ? vet ? , or trodden with involuntary wit on someone 's social toes , the story will be repeated with glee for years , but you will get no credit from the pleasure you have unwittingly given ! It is no light matter to be a hostess in so complex a world . Another thing which I had difficulty in learning was that novelties , as such , have little intrinsic charm for the French . Innovations do creep in , but they must prove themselves to be definitely superior before they are accepted ; for the French do not yearn for what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things . When I first set up housekeeping I was eager to introduce the American custom of having lighted candles on the dinner table . The idea horrified my husband . " The unshaded flame will hurt people 's eyes , " he said . This was a reasonable objection , but I did want my candles , so I bought taller candlesticks and longer tapers , in order that the little flames might tower well above the heads of my guests . " Now , " I exclaimed , " those flames can not possibly shine in anyone 's eyes . " " No , " murmured my husband despondently , " but you know the candles will melt down rapidly . . . . " Thereupon , I gave up candles and with them my hope of altering French customs . Yet in spiteof this conservatism most of the tasteful novelties of the day , in table decorations and other things as well , do originate in France . The greatest trial of my French existence was a dearth of feminine society . French women do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us . They do not clash about together to shops or movies to anything like the extent that we do , and that unjustly criticized institution , the women 's luncheon , is unknown in Paris . One obvious reason for this is that the men come home to lunch and this midday recess is one of the greatest superiorities of French life . It is extraordinary how much it alters feminine existence when , instead of a long day to be filled with sexless activities , there are only brief intervals between the appearances of the husband . Moreover , it changes not only the feminine but the masculine point of view , for it permits men to take a closer and more practical interest in the details of their homes . It is partly for this reason that French husbands often give their wives a companionship which American women can only find in one another . They like and expect to be consulted about household matters , such as menus and decorations , and they are often both able and willing to advise their wives in the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen at fashion shows are more often husbands than strangers imagine . Since my marriage I have seldom bought a dress or a hat without my husband 's advice , and when I have done so I have usually repented it , for he sees me more clearly than I see myself . French women too have a different point of view from ours . Their ambition ( and they are intensely ambitious ) is seldom for a personal career . Their pleasures , their circle , their place in life all depend on a man , and it is only through men that they hope to attain to power and consequence . One of the few French women I know who has made herself an independent career once admitted to me that she could not work unless she had the guidance and encouragement of some man , either husband , teacher or friend . French women 's technic of life reflects this dependence . They consider it their principal business to create an harmonious atmosphere , to be figures of delicate and suggestive charm , and to give their men-folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be unobtrusive partners in achievements of which they will share the fruits . If a Deputy becomes a Minister , it is probable that his wife 's tact and charm have helped him to reach the post , and in return she will be lodged in a palace and , like himself , will have patronage to distribute . The attitude and the results are the same , under other forms , in the small bourgeoisie and the laboring classes . To be desired and needed is more to a Frenchwoman than to be independent . To her the idea that woman 's place is the home has no terrors . That is her natural domain where she rules , creates , and finds scope for her pride and her sense of power . Is not this , after all , the ideal life for nine women out of ten ? Her children , too , take more of a Frenchwoman 's time than do those of American mothers as a rule . They are never confided to a boarding-school early , and often not at all . Their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lives . She gives perhaps less attention to their bodily development than we do ; but to be her children 's companion and confidante , to be with them in their play and in their work is a French mother 's conscious aim , and for that she will sacrifice everything else . Unlike the Englishwoman , shewill not readily follow her husband to distant places if it means leaving her children behind . Her children 's lessons are a great preoccupation to a French mother , for success in them is an important matter . Few French children do their homework alone ; father and mother pore over the lessons that are assigned , commenting on them and explaining them to the young pupils , and the whole family is interested in the school curriculum . In such existences , oriented toward the home , the husband , and the children , there is little room for the various activities which American women enjoy together . As for old maids , there are none in Parisian society ! I used privately to wonder whether they were drowned like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provinces or to good works . Some too find their vocation in being aunts . The maternal instinct is so strong in French women that nephews and nieces often seem able completely to fill an empty heart . Last , but not least , of the limitations of French life for me was its lack of intimacy . In the fascinating and colorful society of Paris little affection is exchanged . Love and intimacy are kept almost exclusively for the family circle . This is partly because , since everything in France is done par relations , that is to say , through personal connections , society is a game in which the stakes are the very real prizes of fame , honor , and success . It is not only Ministers and Deputies who have posts and favors to distribute ; members of the Academy or of the learned societies , owners or editors of newspapers and magazines , even critics of art and literature or political writers can make or break a career . Their good will is valuable and , therefore , the social contacts through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formality of French life springs also from the fact that the French are not as gregarious as we are . They are not afraid to be alone , nor do they need to huddle together , as we so often do , for mere company . When they seek one another it is in order to exchange ideas and to be amused , not because they need affection . Their lack of warmth is also the result of a mistrustfulness which is part of their skeptical nature . They express their own aloofness by a very apt phrase . They say : " We do not readily hand ourselves over , " and the word used , se livrer , implies a surrender . It was hard for me to learn that one need not trust or esteem people in order to enjoy them , for my impulse was to attach myself to those whom I liked . I still envy my husband , who could live contentedly among enemies provided they were superficially polite , and , above all , did not bore him . I know that I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV In return for these difficulties I found many compensations . First of all the tempo of life in France makes for true enjoyment . In America some inward unrest , some need of excitement seems always to be driving us on , and it was good to escape from that feverish rush . I recently visited one of our most delightful university towns and there talked with two French women . Both spoke of the terrible pace of American life . One of them told me that she belonged to a little club which meets for discussion once a week from eleven to twelve in the morning . " Imagine , " she said , with pained astonishment , " there is one lady who leaves exactly at twelve . No matter how interesting , how delightful is the discussion , always she gets up as the clock strikes ! Has she an appointment ? Perhaps so , but how can oneleave a conversation of the most absorbing for any appointment ? Is it not a foolish conception of life , " she added , with gentle scorn , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " This is the true French point of view . When I was first married twenty minutes was the longest time which I could happily spend in a chair on the boulevard . After that , having drunk my liqueur , looked at the sky , and watched the passers-by , I was seized by the fatal American need to " do something . " Now I feel with satisfaction that I could spend unlimited time anywhere in Europe or Africa absorbing one single cafe noir and watching life go by . I have found the inner peace which enables me to enjoy an endless series of moments each for itself . This serenity I learned in part over a tapestry frame . I used to wonder how women endured the monotony of their lives during the Middle Ages , confined as they were in their gloomy castles without books , without society , dependent on an occasional strolling minstrel for their only distraction . Now I know why they were contented ; they made tapestry . Endless hours can be passed happily in working on a piece of needlepoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mind is superficially occupied , for there is a pattern to follow and a choice of silks to be made , but the spirit drifts now into daydreams , now into deeper contemplation , while the web grows and flowers glow , as one 's fingers evoke them into colorful being . There is a sense of creation and of rest , and time disappears , so that one seems to be suspended in a smiling eternity . One great compensation which I found in France is the gentle art of conversation , which still flourishes there , although the French have been lamenting its decline for two centuries . In Paris it is not necessary to furnish your dinner guests with means of amusement for the evening . They possess these in themselves , and if they honor your board it is for the sake of talk . To ask them to play cards or to go to the theater would be superfluous , if not insulting . How comforting it is to know that one 's best pleasures depend only on one 's ears and tongue ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to instruct but to delight . Americans do not readily grasp this idea . Some of the puritanism which is rapidly fading from our customs lingers in our intellectual life , and talk for talk 's sake seems to us somewhat frivolous . Our practical minds wish to be enlightened , and to active at the truth , therefore we like to discuss , to talk things out , not perceiving that an epigram often conveys more truth than a lecture . The French feel that conversation should never degenerate into a lesson or an argument . It may he a battle of wits , but the weapons should be finely pointed rapiers , not clashing swords . " Glissez , mortel , n'appuyez pas ! " my husband often murmurs to me , and that is the secret of good talk . Pass lightly from point to point , striking sparks if you can , but never allow yourself to expound or to hammer your ideas home . The French , as our expressive slang phrase has it , " get you the first time . " In France the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receptive , not the active partner . She must water the conversational plant , but she does not produce its flower . It is pleasant to discover that at dinner parties one is not expected to amuse one 's neighbor , but only to allow oneself to be entertained . That neighbor , however occupied his day may have been , will not be a Tired Business Man , who would really prefer to be at home with slippers and pipe . On the contrary , he will be a willing playmate , eager toshow his powers in the game for which he is best fitted . But the role of listener is no sinecure in France . You can not be adequate to it merely by scattering random smiles and exclamations . Women are expected to be intelligent , and to evoke by enlightened appreciation the best qualities of their companions . A story , possibly true , which illustrates this went the rounds of Paris last year . Marshal Lyautey , it was said , was dining at the Legation of a foreign power . In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host , put beside him a woman noted in her own country for her remarkable beauty . It was apparently her only gift . During the dinner Africa was mentioned and the beauty na ? vely said to her distinguished neighbor , " Ah , yes . Africa ! Have you been there often ? " The builder of French Morocco was struck dumb , and it was obvious that even beauty did not condone such ignorance in his eyes , for he found nothing more to say to her . Closely allied to the delightful game of conversation ( the best of indoor sports ) is the new world of nuance which one enters as one grows into French life . In order to enjoy this varied domain which gradually unfolds before the inner eye one must learn a new language . I am not speaking of the French tongue but of the carefully graduated scale of meaning which is attached to all that is said . With any new acquaintance we must learn by experience how much weight to give to his words , and this is peculiarly true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they feel or think , and leave it to your intuition to supply the rest . To-day if a French friend says to me in speaking of a common acquaintance , " I do not see her often , " I know that I might reply to the unspoken thought , " I do not like her either . " An Anglo Saxon soon finds that his literal statements are given a significance which he did not in the least intend . I remember saying to my husband as we left one of the first French dinner parties I had been to in Paris , " That woman is a snobl " " Very well , " he replied instantly , " we will not go there again . " I had great difficulty in convincing him that I meant only what I had said and that , while my hostess was a snob , I had no wish to drop her . He himself would never have spoken so much had he not meant a great deal more . There is prudence in the French reserve , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderation which is born of innate taste . Exaggeration is for the French a misuse of language and a barrier to all delicacy of intercourse . They usually think before they speak and formulate their ideas from a background of reflection , whereas we are apt to talk as we think , hastily and tentatively , in view of further discussion . In conversation , as elsewhere , we care chiefly for the content , while the French are occupied with the form . French society , it must be confessed , has more rigid rules and customs than our own . Titles , for instance , are still significant , whether they are hereditary or spring from a function , and they must be used in presenting those who bear them . This is a great convenience to strangers , for it enables them to some extent to place people and to avoid , for instance , confusing an ambassador with an auctioneer even if they have the same name . More difficult is the question of precedence . I had believed in my happy-golucky American fashion that the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's guests where they would enjoy themselves most , but I soon found out my error . French people would rather spend a dull evening in a seat of honor to which their rank entitlesthem than to enjoy themselves in some lowlier spot . This once seemed to me absurd , but I have come to understand it . Where rank or importance count , to be denied the place which your consequence should command is humiliating , for it implies a slur . Many serious problems arise for a hostess out of this matter of precedence . Does a Minister in office outrank an Academician , or is it only the Prime Minister who does so ? In a more modest way does age outrank literary fame , and do both pass before or after an historic name ? The French are not alone in appreciating the importance of these things ; the English are so well aware of it that they give every Admiral , for instance , a flag-lieutenant , who is the best dressed man in the Navy , and whose chief duty is to seat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposes of four places of honor , two major and two minor ones , as it were , on the right and left of host and hostess . With these resources one can usually make an equitable division of one 's notables . Nevertheless , there are certain people of equal importance , bachelor Academicians , for example , whom one dares not invite together for fear of giving lasting offense to the man who sits at your left . Calls must be made in France on pain of losing your acquaintances , but I found this custom pleasant , for it was a way of seeing people informally . French teas , however , troubled inc greatly . They can not be taken casually , for they are as important as lunches or dinners . An invitation to one requires an answer so that the cakes and sandwiches may be correctly calculated , and if you accept you must go . Another French convention is that of writing notes . Innumerable are the occasions for these ; birth , death , marriage , a step up in one 's profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book , all require the acknowledgment of a note . There is great art in the writing of them , but also great labor . Yet , after all , this conventionality is not irksome once it is mastered . A man of letters , Andre Bellesort , once assured me that etiquette had been invented in the sixteenth century to prevent the French courtiers of that period from falling upon one another whenever they met . " You see that we still find it indispensable , " he added with a smile . The fact is that the French are sensitive and they have a lively vanity . Conventions are for them a means of safeguarding their feelings while preserving their freedom . Etiquette makes it possible to protect oneself against a bore without actual rudeness ( by the simple device of omitting to call , or to leave cards , for instance ) ? and the bore is more feared and hated in Paris than the executioner . V This brings me quite naturally to that exquisite thing , French politeness . Good manners are as important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern , for men may hide their vices , or leave them at home , but they take their manners everywhere . My husband says , " That man is rude " in much the same tone with which a Puritan might have said , " He is wicked " ; and the condemnation is just as final . There is a philosophy behind this point of view . The French realize that we necessarily spend much of our time in casual encounters , and they , therefore , argue that it is worthwhile to bring delicacy and consideration even to passing relationships . La bonne greice ? gradousness , is the lubricating oil of life . It makes the social wheels go round and eases the wear and tear of human friction . This is , afterall , a very civilized point of view . The French are themselves sensitive , and they are keenly aware of the feelings of others . Seldom do they fail to say the pleasant thing , to congratulate or sympathize as occasion demands . Little by little one comes to expect and to bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature to be gracious . Life thus acquires a great smoothness . It is rather like sitting on a down pillow . Nowadays when I go to England or America I often find myself wondering : " Why does So ? and-so want to be disagreeable ? " Suddenly I realize that poor So-and-so had no intention of being disagreeable ; he simply blurted out what was in his mind without considering its possible effect on me . I am , to say the least , mature , but no French girl of any age would ask me , as have many American ones , " What would you do if you were young ? " I am also undoubtedly what is euphemistically called " a large woman , " but in France I perceive it only in my mirror . I can not imagine a Frenchman ever saying to me kindly , as more than one American has done , " You know I like plump women , " as though his preference were sure to console met Tact is widespread in France . My saleswoman at the dressmaker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many pleasant , though expensive hours , seems to know my good points better than anyone in the world . My chamber maid makes me feel that her " Madame " is a very precious person . Even the chance waiter at a modest restaurant knows how to give me an agreeable sense of my importance without abandoning his own dignity . The attitude of these people is that we all have our own places in the world , and that it is their pleasure to serve me , as it is mine to be well served . I can never forget the delicacy and gentleness of the soldiers whom I nursed , Some of them were rough fellows enough , a few even belonged to the " Bataillon d'Afrique , " the disciplinary regiment . It is easy to imagine what their conversation must have been among themselves , but I never heard a coarse or brutal word while I was in the room , nor was I ever allowed to do a disagreeable or heavy task if there was a man in the ward well enough to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as exquisite . An American friend of mine once took a motor trip in France with a rather reckless chauffeur . Before starting she begged him to be careful not to run over any dogs , for that she felt she could not bear . When at the end of the tour she thanked him for sparing her feelings the chauffeur , who would cheerfully have run over a dog a day for the sake of speed , doffed his cap , and solemnly answered her , " Madame , it is I who thank you in the name of the dogs of Frances " I am often asked whether I prefer to live in France or in America , and the answer I give , while it is always very positive , is never twice the same , for my feelings on the subject vary according to time and place . The truth is that I have a divided heart , and when I have been a certain length of time in one of my countries , I begin to think with a sort ofremorseful homesickness of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , I really have been transmuted and assimilated , as well as accepted by the French . I do not think so , nor do I wish entirely so to be . Could I achieve my ideal , I would acquire what is best in the French character , while keeping the most valuable of my own native traits . This would mean on the one hand to grow more sensitive , to have a keener discernment of values , to accept reality without illusions , and to care more for the things of the mind and less for excitement and material pleasures ; on the other , to maintain a power of enthusiasm , to keep a warm , even a confiding heart in spite of clearer vision , to refuse to limit curiosity or affection in the face of the fact that life is short and love most uncertain . Such a combination has its difficulties and its perils . To be enthusiastic without illusion , sensitive without bitterness , intellectual without coldness requires no small degree of courage , for illusions , bitternesses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively seek to protect our toovulnerable souls . But who would part either from natural ardor or from acquired wisdom for the sake of mere ease and safety ? I am still American enough to feel that it is always worth while at least to try both to have your cake and eat it !
