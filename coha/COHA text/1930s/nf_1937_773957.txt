txt IV Let the Sky Rain Potatoes ? The Merry Wives of Windsor THERE are two questions which can easily be asked about a potato : What is it , and Why is it ? Both these questions are irritating to a true amateur . The answers to the first are self-evident : a potato is a food delicious , nourishing , and so on . The second question is perhaps too impertinent even to be answered , although 40 Let the Sky Rain Potatoes many a weary housewife has felt like shouting it to the high heavens if her family has chanced to be the kind that takes for granted the daily appearance of this ubiquitous vegetable . A dictionary will say that a potato is a farinaceous tuber used for food . An encyclopaedia will cover eight or nine large pages with a sad analysis of its origins , modes of cultivation , and diseases , some of which are enough in themselves to discourage any potato enthusiast who might read them carefully . Between these two extremes of definition is a story interesting even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . There are romance and colour , and the fine sound of brave names in its telling . In Peru , the Spanish found papas growing in the early 15oo 's , and the monk Hieronymus Cardin took them back with him to his own people . The Italians liked them , and then the Belgians . About that time , Sir Walter Raleigh found a potato in the American South , and carried it 41 Serve It Forth back to his estate near Cork . Some say it was a yam he had , thought strongly aphrodisiac by the Elizabethans . Some say it was a white potato . A German statue thanks Raleigh for bringing it to Europe . On the other hand , the Spanish claim recognition for its European introduction . No matter what its origin , eat it , eat it , urged the British Royal Society . But for many decades its cultivation made but little progress . By the time it had become important as a food , especially for poor people , its diseases also had matured , and in 1846 potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to America . Warts and scabs and rusts and rots did their work , too , and men worked hard to breed new varieties of potatoes before newer plagues seized them . Great Scott , the Boston Comrade , Magnum Bonum , Rhoderick Dhu and Up-to-Date , Ninetyfold : these and many hundreds more filled pots around the world , and still do . But no matter the name ; a spud 's a spud , and by any other name it would still be starchy , and 42 Let the Sky Rain Potatoes covered with dusty cork for skin , and , what 's worse , taken for granted on every blond-head 's table . If the men are darker , it is pastes in slender strings they 'll eat , or tubes , always farinaceous , as the dictionary says ; but more often on AngloSaxon fare the potato takes place before any foreign macaroni or spaghetti . It is hard sometimes to say why . A potato is good when it is cooked correctly . Baked slowly , with its skin rubbed first in a buttery hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it is delicious . Salt and pepper are almost always necessary to its hot moist-dusty flavour . Alone , or with a fat jug of rich cool milk or a chunk of fresh Gruyere , it fills the stomach and the soul with a satisfaction not too easy to attain . In general , however , a potato is a poor thing , poorly treated . More often than not it is cooked in so unthinking and ignorant a manner as to make one feel that it has never before been encountered in the kitchen , as when avocadoes 43 Serve It Forth were sent to the Cornish Mousehole by a lady who heard months later that their suave thick meat had been thrown away and the stones boiled and boiled to no avail . " Never have I tasted such a poor , flaccid , grey sad mixture of a mess , " says my mother when she tells of the potatoes served in Ireland . And who would contradict her who has ever seen the baked-or-boiled in a London Lyons or an A.B.C. ? The Irish prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . And in mid-western Europe , in a part where dumplings grow on every kitchen-range , there are great cannon balls of them , pernicious as any shrapnel to a foreign palate , but swallowed like feathery egg-whites by the natives . They arc served with goose at Christmas , and all around the year . They are the size of a toddling child 's round head . They are grey , and exceedingly heavy . They arc made painstakingly of grated raw potato , moulded , then boiled , then added to by moulding , then boiled again . Layer 44 Let the Sky Rain Potatoes after layer is pressed on , cooked , and cooled , and finally the whole sodden pock-marked mass is bounced in bubbling goose broth until time to heave it to the platter . Forks may bend against its iron-like curves , stomachs may curdle in a hundred gastric revolutions ; a potato dumpling is more adamantine . It survives , and is served to ever-renewing decades of hungry yodelling mouths . In itself , this always fresh desire for starch , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , nor its national disguise , the appetite for it is there , impervious to the mandates of dictators or any other blight . Perhaps its most insidious manifestation is that Anglo-Saxons take it for granted . A meal for them includes potatoes in some form ; it al ways has , therefore it always will . And no revolt , no smouldering rebellion of the meal-planner , can change this smug acceptance . Most important , however , is the potato 's function as a gastronomic complement . It is this that it should be considered , to rob it of its dangerous 45 Serve It Forth monotony , and clothe it with the changing mysterious garment of adaptability . Although few realize it , to be complementary is in itself a compliment . It is a subtle pleasure , like the small exaltation of a beautiful dark woman who finds herself unexpectedly in the company of an equally beautiful blonde . It is what a great chef meant once when he repulsed a consolation . He was a Frenchman , summoned to London when King Edward VII found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . This great cook one day prepared a dish of soles in such a manner that the guests at Edward 's table waited assuredly for a kingly compliment . He was summoned . Their mouths hung open in sated expectation . " The Chateau Yquem , " said Edward VII , " was excellent . " Later the master chef shrugged . a nonchalance denied by every muscle in his pleased face . " How could my dish have had a greater compliment ? " he demanded , calmly . " His Majesty knows , as I do , that when a dish is perfect , as 46 Let the Sky Rain Potatoes was my sole to-night , the wine is good . If the dish is lower than perfection , the wine , lacking its complement , tastes weak and poor . So ? you see ? " Although there are few ways of preparing potatoes to make them approach the perfection of a royal plate of fish , and none I know of to make them worth the compliment of a bottle of Chateau Yquem , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus , as I have said , that they should be treated . If , French fried , they make a grilled sirloin of beef taste richer ; if , mashed and whipped with fresh cream and salty butter , they bridge the deadly gap between a ragout and a salad ; if , baked and pinched open and bulging with mealy snowiness , they offset the fat spiced flavour of a pile of sausages ? then and then alone should they be served . Then they are dignified . Then they are worthy of a high place , not debased to the deadly rank of daily acceptance . Then they are a gastronomic pleasure , not merely " tubers used for food . " 471 V Borderland LMOST every person has something secret he likes to eat . He is downright furtive about it usually , or mentions it only in a kind or conscious self-amusement , as one who admits too quickly , " It is rather strange , yes ? and I 'll laugh with you . " Do you remember how Claudine used to crouch by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borderland enough to keep the toasting nubbin of chocolate from dripping off ? Sometimes she did it on a hairpin over a candle . But candles have a fat taste that would taint the burnt chocolate , so clean and blunt and hot . It would be like drinking a Martini from silver . Hard bitter chocolate is best , in a lump not bigger than a big raisin . It matters very little about the shape , for if you 're nimble enough you 'll keep it rolling hot on the pin , as shapely as an opium bead . When it is round and bubbling and giving out a dark blue smell , it is done . Then , without some blowing all about , you 'll burn your tongue . But it is delicious . However , it is not my secret delight . Mine seems to me less decadent than Claudine 's , somehow . Perhaps I am mistaken . I remember that Al looked at me very strangely when he first saw the little sections lying on the radiator . That February in Strasbourg was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a cramped dirty apartment across from the sad 49 Serve It Forth zoo half full of animals and birds frozen too stiff even to make smells , we grew quite morbid . Finally we counted all our money , decided we could not possibly afford to move , and next day went bag and baggage to the most expensive pension in the city . It was wonderful ? big room , windows , clean white billows of curtain , central heating . We basked like lizards . Finally Al went back to work , but I could not bear to walk into the bitter blowing streets from our warm room . It was then that I discovered how to eat little dried sections of tangerine . My pleasure in them is subtle and voluptuous and quite inexplicable . I can only write how they are prepared . In the morning , in the soft sultry chamber , sit in the window peeling tangerines , three or four . Peel them gently ; do not bruise them , as you watch soldiers pour past and past the corner and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pregnant crescent . If you find the Kiss , the secret section , save it for Al . 50 Borderland Listen to the chambermaid thumping up the pillows , and murmur encouragement to he : thick Alsatian tales of l'interieure . That is Paris the interior , Paris or anywhere west of Stras bourg or maybe the Vosges . While she mutter of seduction and French bicyclists who rid ( more than wheels , tear delicately from the sof pile of sections each velvet string . You knov those white pulpy strings that hold tangerine , into their skins ? Tear them off . Be careful . Take yesterday 's paper ( when we were ir Strasbourg L'Ami du Peuple was best , becaus ( when it got hot the ink stayed on it ) and spreac it on top of the radiator . The maid has gone , oi course ? it might be hard to ignore her bellig erent Alsatian glare of astonishment . After you have put the pieces of tangerine on the paper on the hot radiator , it is best to forget about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner in the brown dining-room : afterwards maybe you have a little nip of quetsch from the bottle in the armoire . Finally he goes Of course you are sorry , but ? 51 Serve It Forth On the radiator the sections of tangerines have grown even plumper , hot and full . You carry them to the window , pull it open , and leave them for a few minutes on the packed snow of the sill . They are ready . All afternoon you can sit , then , looking down on the corner . Afternoon papers are delivered to the kiosk . Children come home from school just as three lovely whores mince smartly into the pension 's chic tearoom . A basketful of Dutch tulips stations itself by the tram-stop , ready to tempt tired clerks at six o'clock . Finally the soldiers stump back from the Rhine . It is dark . The sections of tangerine are gone , and I can not tell you why they are so magical . Perhaps it is that little shell , thin as one layer of enamel on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under your teeth . Or the rush of cold pulp just after it . Or the perfume . I can not tell . There must be some one , though , who knows what I mean . Probably everyone does , because of his own secret eatings. 52 VI Garum I00 A.D.-400 A.D. Rome WHILE Greece exchanged black broth and its accompanying simplicity for that more complex kitchen science nurtured by her new esthetes , Rome shadowed her some years behind , mimicking with fantastic exaggeration each of her calm inevitable developments . For her Spartan pottage , Romans had a gruel 53 Serve It Forth of lentils . They too ate chestnuts and cheeses and fruits and green vegetables , with honey to sweeten and wine to gladden . Then when refinement , sure arbiter of a decadent civilization , crept into the Grecian cuisine , her tardy shadow Rome leaped feverishly in a grotesque and fascinating imitation . As had happened in Greece , town and villages vied for culinary honours . Certain cakes , cheeses of a special smell , and even fish from a named lake or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gradually shadow outleaped self , and in their furious delicacy of palate and heavy-handed subtlety of selection the wealthy Romans left Greeks far behind . Are pdtes de foie Bras better made from cygnets than from milk-white geese ? Of course ! Not at all ! Well , perhaps if the geese are nourished solely on green figs ? But on the other hand , a diet of almonds Senators cut important electors in the streets ; sons quarrelled with fathers , boys with their tutors . Even the philosophers considered such 54 Garum questions weightily , and uttered decisions which had but temporary effect . When Cleopatra melted her pearl and six million sesterces into the world 's most expensive recipe , she set a tantalizingly high mark . Until Rome fell , gourmets tried to outdo her . Undoubtedly the results were more palatable ? but never more costly . Rigid snobbism precluded all but the most extravagant citizens , and thus most plutocratic , from the inner circles of fine eating . Juvenal drew the portrait of all Roman bon vivants when he wrote of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch , he rolls his eyes O'er many an orb of matchless form and size , Selects the fairest to receive his plate , And at one meal devours a whole estate . Lucullus , perhaps the truest epicure as we now think of one , was undoubtedly the most refined . He set the pace . Other Romans , like Trimalchio 's vulgar prototype , might give banquets whose success depended upon the leaping 55 Serve It Forth of three naked virgins from a great crusted tart . It was Lucullus who gave his carefully chosen guests the exquisite compliment of letting them watch their next course ( lie ! Mullets bred in the mountain lake he had transplanted to his estates , or trout brought living from one certain stream in all Italy , expired slowly in beautiful glass jars placed before the diners . Each throe was judged . Lucky the guest whose dying fish leaped highest and longest ! The flavour would be unforgettable . It was Lucullus who sorted his friends into different rooms , rather like the various restaurants in a large German railroad station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two hundred dollars for each person . Decoration there was relatively simple . More expensive surroundings showed that here Lucullus spent more on his food . And finally , in the Apollo Room , where only his very intimate or important guests were invited , he spent one thousand dollars for each person . Here he entertained most frequently , with 56 Garum the most precious foods laid upon tables now solid ivory , now silver or carved tortoise shell . For ordinary guests goblets of inlaid gold did well enough , but in the Apollo Room glasses hollowed from great gems were used with nonchalance . Other men blinked at their own banquet bills , or complained bitterly , like Julius Casar when he found he had spent five millions sterling , one Roman summer , on suppers for his friends ? and on barley water mixed with wine , for his favourite charger to drink from a golden trough ! Sometimes there was a suicide , nor was it from remorse for unpaid debts . Apicius , when he found he had squandered over a million pounds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , died as exquisitely as one of the mullets he had watched . As Rome festered and decayed , the fever for fine eating mounted . What had been precious became vicious . Mark Antony 's largesse of a town of thirty-five thousand souls for his chef 's fine paste of flamingo brains changed to Helioga-57 Serve It Forth balus ' trick of fattening his prized conger eels on living slave-meat . As much money was spent on perfumes as on food . It was the usual thing now to have rare aromatic essences blown into the air between the twenty-four courses of daily banquets , as in Nero 's famous Domus Aurea , from whose revolving walls flowers and sweet distillations showered down upon the guests . Indeed , such strange behaviour was necessary . Satiety , that monster behind pleasure , breathed into the stuffed bellies of the Romans . Excitants to their palates were prerequisite ? those palates by now so ill-treated that some of the gourmets were forced to wear little tongue gloves to protect their delicate taste-glands from all but the most exotic flavours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately . They had eaten every fish in the earth 's waters , except Triton 's sacred dolphin and perhaps a mermaid . They had sucked the bones of every bird and birdling in ? But wait ! 58 Garum " Send hunters to Lydia , " Heliogabalus ordered , " and pay two hundred gold pieces to the one who brings us back a Phoenix ! " But none came . The fretful ruler tried colours . Perhaps they might whip up his dulled taste . For awhile Roman tables bloomed with shades as violent but not so harmless as those in a modern seedcatalogue . They soon faded . Les Tables Volantes , which Louis XV of France proudly called his own invention , rose first for Heliogabalus . Laden with dishes resolutely emptied , these tables sank , to the strains of young boys ' voices , into the marble floor . New perfumes from Araby spiced the air . Strange dances , increasingly erotic , occupied the dulled eyes of the diners . Then the beautiful boys raised their voices in mock amazement , and fell squealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Phoenix the king yearned for ? each time with new plumes . As the feasts grew longer and more extravagant , the guests lost gradually those stately good 59 Serve It Forth manners they had aped from the earlier Greek gourmands . Licence of the senses begot loose behaviour . If the goblets seemed too small , or the winesupply stingy or of poor vintage , banqueters howled until they were satisfied . If the dishes displeased them , they hurled food and vessel against a pillar or a serving-man . The host apologized . Emetics were served with the beginning courses of any longer dinner ? as they had been indeed in Greece , because of the difficulty of digestion in the reclining position assumed on the banqueting-couches . Now , however , the Romans found the capacity of their sated stomachs infinitely enlarged by the trick . By the time one dish appeared , its predecessor was well out of the way . Twice as much could be eaten ! This wholesale catharsis necessitated certain architectural changes . And suddenly these changes , luxurious privies to begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 6o Garu m They had a fine name , like a California realestate development . Little boys still hear it with fascination and disgust , in first-year Latin . Girls still invent other verbs , to avoid its nauseous root . Only one ever used it in public with the proper reverence : Colette , when she described an eclair si vomiteusement chocolateux . Romans , however , their minds less on future derivatives of the word than on their next course , used their vomitoria with appreciation . Their insides heaved too often . Quacks and honest physickers could not help . Rome grew dyspeptic , and heard clearly old Seneca 's wry comment , " Are you astonished at the innumerable diseases ? ? Count the number of our cooks ! " We are inclined to agree with him . One course of a Roman meal would lay us very low , probably , and strip our palates for many days of even the crudest perceptions of flavour . Look for a minute , hand over nose and a piece of ice on tongue , at the recipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insides of fish , 61 Serve It Forth both large fish and small . Salt them well . Expose them to the air until they are completely putrid . In a short time a liquid is produced . Drain this off . " And " this " is garum , most highly prized and used of all seasonings . In Cochin-China there is something like it , in these days , called nuocman ? and of course we have our English meat sauces . Romans , though , used garum not as a condiment in itself , but combined with a startling variety of spices . Dill , anise , hyssop , thyme ; pennyroyal and rue ; cummin , poppy seed , shallots and onions and garlic and leeks ? almost every known savour except our parsley , which they wore in garlands on their heads , made the simplest banquet dish a mess of inextricable flavours . Inextricable to us , that is . It is doubtful if even a professional taster , today , would be able to describe the sauce Apicius recommends for a boiled chicken : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : anise-seed , dried mint , and lazar root which is a kind of asafoetida ; cover them all with vinegar . Add dates and pour in garum and oil and a small quantity of mustard-seeds . Reduce all to a proper thickness with red wine warmed , and then pour this same over your chicken . " The chicken , " Apicius adds as an afterthought , " should of course be boiled previously in strong anise-seed water . " To cool your enraged palate after this strange dish you would most probably be served a goblet of red wine mixed with spices and sea water . Then , while pretty slave children imitated worn-out lechers for your eyes ' amusement , you would pretend to eat hungrily at a bowl of red mullet seasoned with pepper , rue , onion , dates , mustard , and the flesh of a sea-hedgehog pounded to a jelly . With this , a fine cup of vin rose , thickened to syrup with honey , myrrh , and spikenard . And after this , a piglet , soaked in ? A good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snails I HAVE eaten several strange things since I was twelve , and I shall be glad to taste broiled locusts and swallow a live fish . But unless I change very much , I shall never be able to eat a slug . My stomach jumps alarmingly at the thought of it . I have tried to be callous about slugs . I have tried to picture the beauty of their primeval 64 Fifty Million Snails movements before a fast camera , and I have forced myself to read in the Encyclopcedia Britannica the harmless ingredients of their oozy bodies . Nothing helps . I have a horror , deep in my marrow , of everything about them . Slugs are awful , slugs are things from the edges of insanity , and I am afraid of slugs and all their attributes . But I like snails . Most people like snails . Once in Dijon I was very dizzy for two days because I ate so many that inside me they changed into old rubber boiled in garlic . I still like them ; and in France people eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are beautiful , unless you are the gardener who planted the bush . They are beautiful on plates , too , each one in its little dent , shell full of hot green butter like a magic cup . In Burgundy they are most beautiful , piled in baskets in the stores , the shells one of the most luminous gentle browns in the world , like the hair of a Leonardo Virgin . The round holes 65 Serve It Forth are filled very full and smooth with the butter , cold now , firm , and a tender green . One shop in Dijon sold nothing else , and the window , banked firm against the glass with the finest samples , had from a distance the texture of a heavy glimmering silk . When the door opened , you could taste that peculiar smell of cold cooked snails , not quite like garlic , not quite like rubber tires . Once I saw a woman eat seven dozen . It was chez Crespin , so she had already eaten more than that many oysters . She turned a purplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived for two years or so with the Rigagniers in Dijon . The grandfather , Papazi , lived with them too ? or did we all live with Papazi ? He was a militant old fellow who mourned lustily every 14th of July that he had been too young to see battle in ' 71 , too old in ' 14 . Instead , he had become one of the most famous candy-makers in all the provinces . Retired from bonbon service , he kept his palate agile by cooking fine dishes for his grandchildren . 66 Fifty Million Snails And thanks to him , the three of them , in spite of a shared age of less than thirty-five , were seasoned gourmets all . It was very amusing to see Plume , the little boy like a monkey , taste a sauce with the slow tongue-rollings of an old Parisian epicure . The others were just as reverently fussy . Every meal chez Rigagnier smacked somewhat of professional gastronomy . Each spring we were worked subtly and completely into a frenzy for snails by Papazi 's sure suggestion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculating mildly on the possible time for the annual snail-hunt . The weeks went by and leaves burst out on all the trees , and Papazi brought little twigs to the table and rubbed them between his thick dexterous fingers . " Quite crisp , " he would remark , ruminatively . " Yes , I really do think , in fact I am almost sure , that the snails this year will be finer , sweeter , plumper , truly more delicious than ever before . " He looked calmly at his delighted listeners . 67 Serve It Forth The children were almost beside themselves . " When can we go , Papazi ? How about next Sunday ? How about tomorrow ? Will we get enough ? " " Calm yourselves , my dears ! This excitement will ruin the taste of your mother 's delicious quenelles ! " Plume and Doudouce subsided like pricked popovers , and Dede smacked his lips more loudly than ever over a fresh bite , to show his mature appreciation . Papazi ate silently for a minute . " No , not next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Sunday , but perhaps the Sunday after . That is , " he added , hastily , before the children could open their mouths to shout great glee , " i f the day is fine , and if the snails have fed well enough , and if there are not too many noxious weeds for them to ruin themselves on , this year ! And of course , after we have gathered them , something may happen to spoil them . It is a long and difficult business , the preparing of snails ! " 68 Fifty Million Snails The first time I heard Papazi say this I was fool enough to demand , " Why not buy them , then , all ready to eat ? " There was a shocked silence . The children stared at me . Papazi grew pink and haughty . Finally his daughter rebuked me , very gently : " Oh , but Madame ! Nobody can prepare snails like Papazi . These store snails are good , yes ? but to fix them as my father does is an art ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , but we were glad when the hunting-time came to end , we hoped , the daily speculations . That nightfall we returned from the woods , with most of our snails unescaped from the sacks we carried them in . It had been a pleasant day . The next morning we noticed a large packing-box in the courtyard . It was covered with a sheet of glass , and on the glass were glued the bottoms of what seemed a thousand snails , warming themselves upside down . At night it was still there , and the next day . 6g Serve It Forth " They must purify themselves , " Papazi explained . " They must get rid of any poisonous food in them . They must , you might say , starve to death ! " " How long will it be , then ? " " A few days ? a week , perhaps : these are very sturdy snails . " Indeed they were . For a day or two more they stayed , bottoms up , on the glass . Then they began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snails fainting in their little Black Hole . We lost sleep , feeling very sick for them , waiting for the hunger swoon to overcome another and another . Every morning we counted the survivors , and hoped they would loosen their hold before dark , and let us sleep . At last Papazi began his work , most of which I missed watching . There were parboilings to get the emaciated little creatures from their shells , and individual operations to remove their less delectable portions . There were endless scrubbings of each lovely shell , with little 70 Fifty Million Snails curved brushes made especially in Paris . Then the cadavers were tucked into their coffins again , and Papazi and Madame Rigagnier made an extra trip to market for the parsley , the garlic , and the sweet butter . The last scene I caught through the diningroom door : Plume and Doudouce bent gravely over a lighted table , pouring the hot sauce into each up-ended snail shell . Their hands trembled very slightly , and Plume 's tongue stuck out . And when we finally ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pungent on our little curved forks , it was clear that " store snails " were only for those unhappy people who did not live with Papazi ? or those fools too impatient to wait for his slow perfection . That was quite awhile ago . I had forgotten about snails , almost . Then , last month , I heard that a woman in our town was raising them . She had contracted to send them to good restaurants , at a very stiff figure . It seems they were blooded stock ! Last week-end she went away , and left all her X 7 ' Serve It Forth animals in the charge of our friend Eric . He had just read all about snail-culture in a magazine . " You simply feed them cornmeal , " he explained , easily . " It makes them plump ? gives the meat a delightful flavor , too ! " But the snails grew too plump , and then too fat , and then they blew up , all in a few hours ! Eric is devastated , and the restaurants threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy store snails , after all . There are few Papazis , and almost as few recipes , if you can find any escargots alive and edible , which seems doubtful . However , here is one set of directions , from Le Menagier de Paris : " Snails , which are called escargots , should be caught in the morning . Take the young small snails , those that have black shells , from the vines or elder trees ; then wash them in so much water that they throw up no more scum ; then wash them once in salt and vinegar , and set them to stew in water . Then you must pick these 72 Fifty Million Snails snails out of the shell at the point of a needle or a pin ; and then you must take off their tail , which is black , for that is their turd ; and then wash them and put them to stew and boil them in water ; and then take them out and put them in a dish to be eaten with bread . And also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onion or some other liquid , after they have been cooked as above said ; and they are eaten with spice and are for rich people . " This recipe differs quite plainly from Papazi 's method , but of course it is older . Le Menagier de Paris was first published about 1394 . A POSTSCRIPT ABOUT SNAILS This made Dillwyn remember more . In a letter he wrote : " In Hyere , in the middle of summer , I closed the latticed shutters of my room to keep out the dry , blistering sun , but it got through the chinks of the shutters and marked the dusty carpet with a row of 73 Serve It Forth white-hot blades . Naked on the bed , I sweated and dozed and imagined myself going to hell in the tropics . " Once I could not stand the feeling of being cooped up , and went for a walk in the middle of the day . The hotel force watched me go , shrugging shoulders and tapping foreheads . Fou ! ? he walks himself in the sun .

" The scorching earth hurt my feet through the thick soles of my shoes . " I marvelled that rnen and women would 74 Fifty Million Snails work out in the open under such conditions . There they were , the peasants harvesting grapes for wine , bending under the weight of filled baskets . They were brown as wood . Even the children looked old . " The incredible sun was in the middle of the sky . The workers in the vineyards stopped to rest and eat . They burned a stretch of grass at the edge of the vineyards along the roadside , and from the black ashes gathered in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Into cups , carried at their belts , they squeezed with their two hands the juice of half-rotted grapes . It tasted much like wine ; it was not wasting the good grapes . " Roasted snails ! Raw wine ! " I noticed that they crossed themselves before eating , gratefully . " ( 75 VIII Meals for Me WHEN shall we live , if not now ? " asked Seneca before a table laid for his pleasure and his friends ' . It is a quesion whose answer is almost too easily preluded . When indeed ? We are alive , and now . Nhen else live , and how more pleasantly than upping with sweet comrades ? Perhaps Landor , a little later , meant more 76 Meals for Me than he said ( but more than Seneca ? ) when he decided , " I shall dine late , but the dining-room will be well lighted , the guests few and selected . " Whatever his imputations , his tastes are mine . I too dine late by preference , and I too like my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few and even more selected . It is true that in the beginnings of all cultures meals were served early in the day , as indeed they are now among simple folk . A banquet at noon leaves long waking-hours for digestion , conversation , and the easing and refilling of the body . It is practical , and early Greeks and Romans , as well as modern peasants , have appreciated the double festival of a day spent far from the fields before tables tottering under the rare dishes of a marriage or a birthday . Not until ancient men leave their pastures and their vineyards for the vitiated air of cities ; not until they stretch days longer with the false light of burning wax or electricity , and then sleep wastefully in artificial darkness when the sun is high ; not until they have grown far away 77 Serve It Forth from simplicity do they leave their daytime feastings . Then , as in old Rome and our own towns , we dine later . For us it is a comparatively recent progression ; as few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couplets at the dissolute Londoners who put off banqueting until well past three o'clock . We soon grow used to the slow signs of corruption , so surrounded by them are we . In the beginning of the nineteenth century we dined at six , and today a good meal is wasted on most people unless the sun has long set . What is more tedious for us than an early supper ? It thrusts itself into the gathering speed of a day 's life like a stick into the spokes of a turning wheel . It forces a pause , a stop , which acts as a kind of disequilibrium to the fine balance of the remaining hours of consciousness . If the days are short , an early evening meal seems to cut them in two , leaving the second part hanging lifeless on the hardly realized beginning . And if the days are long , they are made 78 Meals for Me twice as monotonously hot by the tired interruption of cooked food . An early evening meal ? a long evening . A long evening ? what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , a passable movie , a game of bridge ? surely some way to kill a few hours . But an evening killed is murder of a kind , criminal like any disease , and like disease a thorough-going crime . If Time , so fleeting , must like humans die , let it be filled with good food and good talk , and then embalmed in the perfumes of conviviality . Let us kill it in slow parley , over the leisured savourings of fare both simple and elaborate , in the tempered colour of a room lighted softly , clearly , by living fire of wax or oil or wood , or by the most artful disguises of electricity . Let the death-chamber itself be airy , intimate , free of thick odours and the sensual distraction of high colour . It should be warmed by a fire in winter , cool with moving air in summer ; and in summer too the soft comfortable rugs should be taken away , leaving the shadows 79 Serve It Forth of chair legs spidering , reflecting , into the polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soft enough to slow digestion , as did the Roman couches , not hard as Cornish rocks , but well fitted to the average body . The best I ever sat in were wide , generous , solid , with high backs , made of ash , brought from England and polished in a log-cabin long before they ever set leg on a hardwood floor . The table should be ample , and above all solid , with no squeaks and shiverings . Plates , too , should be large , and the silver heavy rather than light , with smooth simple lines to it . Plain linen , ample as the table , plain colours in the flowers and the fruits , glasses no more ornamented than the bubbles they imitate ? all should be simple , and adequate as the food and drink served there . The guests , " few and selected , " are most important to Landor and to me , as they were to Archestratus long ago . lie wrote , in a fragment of his lost poem on " Gastronomy " : 8o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That round a table delicately spread , Or three , or four , may sit in choice repast , Or five at most . Who otherwise shall dine , Are like a troop marauding for their prey . I would add one more person to his dictum , though , and say that six can dine well at a table . More , even one or two , are dangerous , and beyond ten deadly . What is worse than the rigid right-left conversational etiquette of a formal banquet , unless it be the forced jollity of an annual feast of some modern " service " club , thick with the noise of too many people eating too much food cooked in too large quantities ? In either case there is more than a faint likeness to Archestratus ' " troop marauding for their prey . " Too few of us , perhaps , feel that the breaking of bread , the sharing of salt , the common dipping into one bowl , mean more than satisfaction of a need . We make such primal things as casual as tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both . 81 Serve It Forth Very simple men still know that if you injure the food another leaves , you can thus injure him . The bones from his plate , the rice from his bowl , can be moulded into a little figurine , and then decay will eat into his own flesh as into the mannequin 's . Or poison can be dropped into the bowl . But it is obvious that none who plans to harm a man through food will himself partake of that same food . Thus , there is honour and sanctity in eating together , when you are simple . So it should be now , although we have civilised ourselves away from the first rules of life . Sharing our meals should be a joyful and a trustful act , rather than the cursory fulfilment of our social obligations . I know one man , however , the opposite of what I mean , who has so simplified his concept of human hunger and its quelling that he considers the act of taking food as necessary and intimate as any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to be shared with several other beings . For him it is disgusting to eat even with his dear friends . 82 Meals for Me His viewpoint is exaggerated , and to my mind unhealthy . For me , there is no more agreeable relaxation than a quiet sharing of food with my few friends . My only approximation of his feeling is the irritation and revolt that rise in me at the thought of obligatory feeding with unknown or uncongenial people . To such a lewd exhibition I should prefer Plato 's solitary bowl of olives , but for neither of these would I forego a slow meal with three or four ? or six at most , sitting in " choice repast . " What six persons may consider choice is delicate to decide . Six tastes , six appetites , must be known , and fused by one memory and one skill into a mutually exciting whole . Old preferences must be converted into new . New flavours must be linked with old . From this fusion should result meals as stimulating to the tongue as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evocative of future delights . And to concoct such meals and serve them is 83 ) Serve It Forth one of the most satisfying of all civilised amenities , I think . Nothing is much sweeter than the sincere gratification ? and admiration ? of a friend . When Horace succoured a storm-bound traveller , he fed him a good chicken , a fat kid roasted , grapes , figs and nuts , and sweet Roman wine . When we went to sup with Nell Coover , the small old etcher , often hungry in her rooms filled with Whistler 's cushions and Heppelwhite 's beautiful chairs and cupboards , she gave us a strange lovely salad of sea mosses and jewelled ice-plants from the cliffs , and a bowl of green wild spinach . It was all she had , but it was served forth with no apology , nor did it need one . Our eyes and our stomachs were pleased , and Miss Coover too , I think , sure in the pleasure of well-treated guests . For my own meals I like simplicity above all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any interest I may thus stir in my fellow-diners is indirect flattery of myself . I like leisure . I like a mutual ease . For this reason I prefer 84 Meals for Me not to have among my guests two people or more , of any sex , who are in the first wild tremours of love . It is better to invite them after their new passion has settled , has solidified into a quieter reciprocity of emotions . ( It is also a waste of good food , to serve it to new lovers . ) I do not agree with the Greeks and Romans , that women should be reserved for the end of a meal and served with the final wines and music , nor do I think that Frenchman was right who stated that there are no blue eyes , no curls and dimpled shoulders , which can replace for a true gourmet the charms of a black truffle . It is , though , very dull to be at a table with dull people , no matter what their sex . Dining partners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've lived , should be chosen for their ability to eat ? and drink ! ? with the right mixture of abandon and restraint . They should enjoy food , and look upon its preparation and its degustation as one of the human arts . They should relish the accompanying drinks , whether they be ale from a bottle on a hillside or the ripe bouquet of a Chamber-85 Serve It Forth tin 1 919 in a great crystal globe on finest damask . And above all , friends should possess the rare gift of sitting . They should be able , no , eager , to sit for hours ? three , four , six ? over a meal of soup and wine and cheese , as well as one of twenty fabulous courses . Then , with good friends of such attributes , and good food on the board , and good wine in the pitcher , we may well ask , When shall we live if not now ? 86 IX Dark Ages and the Men of God I000 A.D.-1400 A.D. Europe THE decline of Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plume , " came to its sure end . Rome fell . Then the Dark Ages cast their mysterious silent gloom over all the arts of Europe . Gastronomy , with the others , dwindled , tottered , tapered into ignorance . Men ate in those countries , certainly : porridge for the lowly , roast X87 Serve It Forth meats for the rich . But as far as we know , they did not care . Food was only a necessity again , like sleep and sweating . There were no more investigating palates , no more keen nostrils trembling with sensuous fine delight at the perfume of a cold melon drenched with wine , or the heady aroma of a succulent piglet , well basted with its own juices and stuffed full of chestnuts and green almonds . La gourmandise was dead . No , not quite . A faint light still glowed , a little flame in the darkness , well hidden behind holiness and the convent walls . The good monks , never more wisely , remembered the spiritual importance of physical well-being . Helped by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest in Europe to a stringy skeleton , the plump brothers spent much time and thought on making delicious dishes appear frugal . The best ecclesiastical brains on the continent studied the egg , and discovered formulae for making it appear on Lenten boards as a rose , 88 ) Dark Ages and the Men of God a cabbage , or a roasted duck . And roasted ducks , and kids and pigs and even tender bulls , were made to look like nothing that ever breathed and walked about under the All-Seeing Eye . Juices dripped from every convent spit , and were metamorphosed into the best of all disguises , sauces infinitely elaborate . So abstinence begot kitchen trickery , and good eating survived with holy blessings through the Dark Ages . 89 x I Arise Resigned Roasted hares , though eaten , are thought to nourish melancholie ? Elizabethan cook-book . I ABRI , the homesick Turkish lawyer , invited us for tea . We drank too much of it , Sand ate , ravenously or discreetly , according to our nationalities , at a large cake like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us how . " Cook finest vermicelli thoroughly , " he in-90 I Arise Resigned structed , a cold polite smile on his face and his eyes very warm and melancholy . " Then when it is done spread it in a large shallow baking-dish and drip honey and sweet oil upon it until the dish brims . " Throw slivers of pistachio nuts upon it , as many as you like ? I like very many . And then bake it slowly . It will shrivel down to a brown crusty cake with a moist inside , like the one you did not eat much of . " " Sabri , it 's ? we ? " " I know . It 's too sweet for you , eh , Al ? " " Yes . It makes every tooth in my head quiver like a stricken doe . " Sabri almost smiled . " For myself , " he remarked , distantly , " it is barely sweet . And these icings and bonbons you eat ! They are tasteless as dust to a Turk . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we like anything with starch in it , too . There is a good reason . " He looked glumly and perhaps a little maliciously at me . " Yes , a very good reason ? for us , that is . We 91 Serve It Forth Easterners eat viscous , sticky foods to make ourselves more virile ! " Perhaps that 's what ails us , " he added , austerely . Then he grinned , and broke the last chunk of cake in his fat , too-sensitive hands . " Young men try to increase what they have ; old men look for what they 've passed by ? but is it only in Turkey ? " II No . Cooks , even before Anthippus ' , were turning their tricks to physical excitation . His , in ancient Athens , boasted of such skill : Insensible the palate of old age , More difficult than the soft lips of youth To move , I put much mustard in their dish ; With quickening sauces make their stupor keen , And lash the lazy blood that creeps within . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honing for lost pleasure , whose senile throat was first cheered by the hot pungency of a cordial . He took slow sips of the new liquor , distilled for him at some thoughtful courtier 's corn-92 I Arise Resigned mand , and from that day his temper was sweeter and his old body less obviously damned . Cordials comforted him . In his land , then , and on the globe everywhere for many centuries , sweet distillations and the sharp taste of spiced vinegars have warmed old men and young , in the armchair or the marriage bed . Bowls of meat , soaked for days in cordials and hot condiments ( Cold pudding settles one 's love , says an old English proverb ! ) are still served at wedding feasts in distant European villages . And then there are truffles , those mysterious growths which spring seedless and rootless from the oaky soil , which may or may not be as good as they are rare and dear , and which even BrillatSavarin names aphrodisiac . People tell me that only virgins have the true nose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not vouch for this , as I have never hunted truffles ? but I do know a man who once saw the last human hunter in all the Perigord country . 93 Serve It Forth Franz Mayen is the man . He has Napoleon 's rippled lips , the vaguely authentic mannerisms of an important agent provocateur , and a friend named Buo Dinh Ngo who is the son of an Annamite official . It was one of the many nights in Strasbourg when Mayen , Buo Dinh , Al , and I sat comfortably filled with fine food . We had eaten a pate de foie gras en brioche ( which at the time made me think of Careme 's dictum , " To become a perfect cook , one must first be a distinguished pastry-maker . " This plate is , however , more of a tour de force than a true delicacy , for the unctuous salve of a good Strasbourg pate is not well complemented by the short and sweet flavour of brioche . Dry toast with a pate moulded in wine aspic is certainly more fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on a pate de foie gras en brioche among other things , and now we sat complacently at our ease . Buo Dinh crouched behind a huge cigar and fingered a jade bead in his pocket . Al and I shared a glass of Alsatian quetschwasser , harsh 94 I Arise Resigned and clear . Franz Mayen , very sardonic and en tertaining , peered at us and talked ceaselessly , as always . " Yes , " he was saying , " I have seen the last virgin woman truffle-hunter in all France ! I am probably ? no , certainly ? unique , for I was but five or six when it happened , and a little boy among old men . It was a secret hunt " By moonlight , of course ? " one of us enquired , smoothly . " Ah no ! " Mayen was unruffled as a bowl of cream . " Naturally it was held in the white sunlight of the south ? a van Gogh sun , a French Midi sun . And we had gathered secretly because the Church was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virgin sniffing over the hills , with a pack of men hot at her heels ? it is disgusting to the Church , it is ? you understand me ? ? pagan ! " So this was to be the last hunt , with the only woman left alive who had the truffle nose . She was old , very old , and she was ? yes , unquestionably ? she was a virgin ! And , mon Dieu , mon 95 Serve It Forth Dieu , but what a nose ! It was long , most pointed , red at the tip . It quivered . " We started off at a hill far from the church , I lagging behind on my little legs , but very curious . We walked until I was panting . " The old maid went ahead . Finally she stopped . She lifted her formidable nose , red and quivering , into the hot air . We all watched her . " Then she was off , and it was hard to follow her , I can tell you . She ran like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up a steep hill . There she stopped , in a barren clearing around an old oak tree . " She pointed to the ground at her feet . The men dug with their blunt forks . Sure enough , truffles ! She started away , stopped suddenly , and pointed down . More truffles ! And all the time she was trembling and sniffing like a sick dog . " Finally she stood still , and her nose grew pale . She stopped shivering , and looked very old and weary . The hunt was over . 96 I Arise Resigned " When we got home , the best truffles were sent to Lyons , and the rest we chopped up and cooked with eggs into a kind of omelette . " Mayen pulled at his cigarette , and added disgustedly : " Of course it is too bad ! My one chance to eat enough truffles to see if they really are exciting ? and I was only six ! " " But is that all true , Franz , about the old woman ? Are you telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Franz was calling for more quetsch , and when we looked at he little Indo-Chinese he relit his cigar and hummed a phrase or two of the " Marseillaise . " III " You may serve me with two roast pigeons for dinner , " said the old Marechal de Mouchy when he returned home from his best friend 's funeral . " I have noticed that after eating a brace of pigeons I arise from the table feeling much more resigned . " Oddly enough , it was not until the eighteenth 97 II Serve It Forth century that Europeans became conscious of the subtle relations between the soul , on whose existence they spent so much thought , and the human stomach , on whose subsistence they spent even more time . Then , although the king , Louis XVI , paid small attention to any food so long as it filled him without too much discomfort , his courtiers followed the example of such staunch gentlemen as Mouchy , and enquired into many pseudomagical refinements of eating . Many of their remedies for lovesickness , melancholy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , arrived at with the usual scientific air of discovery , were nostrums older than the altars of Greece . Warm milk soothes jaded nerves , and brings slumber to the insomniac : no new thing this , although the sated Frenchmen seized with surprise on its ancient simplicity , and on many another like it . They experimented with strange brews , and although most psychic cures may have been due more to the powers of suggestion than to a mixture of wild herbs , fermentation also helped to 98 I Arise Resigned warm their tired bodies and thus cheer their souls . Since the earliest days of what is called civilization men have drunk wines made from the juice of grapes or apples or berries ; juice which has been " spoiled , " had its sugar changed into alcohol and carbon monoxide by a natural process . Men have been made foolish , or vicious , or even lifeless , by the fumes of wine , but more often they have been succoured . Gaiety and love have seemed easier to attain , and with wine have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . They are resigned ; life has been made acceptable . Death , too , appears less fearful if a man meets it warmed and relaxed by some spiritous cup . Indeed , so often have dying souls been helped to their fate by a last drink that it is the signal for mourning-cards to be printed when the doctor prescribes champagne for his patient . Poor uncle is as good as dead ? let him die happy , with all he can drink for once in his life ! And men to be killed for crimes they may 99 1 Serve It Forth have committed are often thus mercifully treated , as much , probably , to salve the punisher 's conscience as to ease the victim 's fears . For them , however , a harsher opiate is needed , brandy or rum . There is a recipe in one of Paul Reboux 's entertaining cook-books which explains this custom of pre-lethal drinking not too inappropriately . He is discussing the preparation of a rabbit for execution . " Many people , " he says , " whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise rabbits only to eat them . " This is in itself an act of human energy which I would not know how to accomplish . Intimate family life with a rabbit , strengthened by our daily relations , would make me no more capable of devouring my little animal than I would be of eating one of my friends . " However , if your sense of realism be strong enough , and if you want your rabbit to be even better than your neighbour 's , take care to nourish it ? " Monsieur Reboux tells with his own detached ioo I Arise Resigned care the schedule for feeding : warm milk while the beastie is still nursing from its mother , tender lettuce and meadow salads as it grows older , a few succulent carrots and grains of corn . And herbs , of course , to perfume its flesh before it is cooked rather than after . It will enjoy leek soup , he advises , and rich hot potato broth with bread . And even , on Sundays , a little bowl of cafe au lait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him a glass of good marc to drink . Rum , although traditional for such occasions , will render him less careless of his fate . After this , you will without scruple be able to give to his little neck the final and decisive blow . Your rabbit will already be in such a state of anaesthesia that nothing can matter to him . " Thus you are assured of having given him a beautiful life , and a beautiful death ! " o XI In Sinistra Parte , Johnannus Baptista 1100 A.D. ? I450 A.D. England I N ENGLAND , things had stayed fairly simple . Barbaric snarlings and pouncings had , of course , been curbed to that state of repressed ferocity which even now marks the hungry Britisher at table . The Romans had come and gone , leaving more roads than recipes . Druidic laws laid strict taboos on certain Io2 In Sinistra Parte , Johnannus Baptista foods : hares , poultry , fish . Oil and lard were much preferred to cow 's butter . Mortars were busy in every house and hovel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unleavened cakes of oat or wheaten flour , and the ubiquitous stew , were common fare in all the island 's homes . Things had stayed fairly simple . Then a vision of the Holy Sepulcher , raped by the foul infidel , flashed over western Europe . England followed , mighty and beautiful . Her bravest soldiers , her wiliest dreamers , the sturdiest folk from all her fields went southward and eastward in those stupendous migrations called the Crusades . Gain and the Holy Grail ! Many of the Englishmen died , in battles or storms or in the heathen 's tents . Some of them stayed on in the strange lands , took wives , and raised tall blue-eyed sons with dark skins . A few of them went back to England . They brought rich brocaded silks in many colours , and jewels , and strange heavy perfumes . These were for their women . Also for the Io3 Serve It Forth women , they said , were the spices in boxes and sacks ? and to please the women , nothing more , they showed how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eggs , or throw magical pinches of this and that into the daily soup , and so transform it that it steamed like incense . Then , while their wives watched with polite curiosity , the generous Crusaders ate heartily . Their eyes watered with nostalgic delight . They taught the spicy secrets to underlings . Apprentices were initiated slowly , and rivalries sprang up between the kitchen staffs of different English castles , which were matched only during the French eighteenth century . Finally a cook-book was written ; then several appeared in the libraries of great houses . We can read one of them ( with some stumbling , it is true ) in what are known now as The Harleian Mss. 279 . In these we see how much men could hold , seven hundred years ago . Purveyance lists , made for every visit of a ruler or nobleman , show us 104 In Sinistra Parte , Johnannus Baptista incredible pages of supplies . This is only a part of the poultry listed for one of Richard 's weekends in 1387 : " Fifty swans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grece ' and eight dozen other capons , sixty dozen hens , five herons , six kids and seven dozen rabbits ( strange place here for such lively fourlegged wingless little beasts ! ) , five dozen pullets for jelly and some eleven dozen to roast , a hundred dozen peacocks , twenty dozen cranes and curlews , and wilde fowle ynogh . ' " Besides the strange meats of crane and peacock and swan , seal was very popular , and whale and porpoise made any meal delicious . Marrow and almond milk were used in almost every recipe , whether with fish , meat , or dainty custard . Puddings of swans ' and capons ' necks , little birds and oxen salted whole , sweet soups of cinnamon and rose water with the roasts ? it all sounds strange now . In as many centuries , our American salads of marshmallow and pink jelly , 105 Serve It Forth and our chocolate sodas , will undoubtedly seem even queerer . Wines , especially a thin red Gascon mixed with honey and spices and called dare , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured over game and puddings and soups . But Englishmen , even then , drank ale with greater ease , and used it , moreover , in many of their dishes . They soured it in the sun for vinegar ; they soaked fish in it as a preservative , and put it in many sauces . Best of all , they quaffed cock-ale , a spiced brew in which one lusty rooster had ended his days and lain for many more . " To make Cock Ale , " instructs one ancient recipe reprinted in 1736 in Smith 's Cornpleat Housewife , " take ten gallons of ale and a large cock , the older the better . Parboil the cock , flea him , and stamp him in a stone mortar until his bones are broken . You must craw and gut him when you flea him . Put him into two quarts of sack , and 1 o6 In Sinistra Parte , Johnannus Baptista put to it 3 pounds of raisins of the sun stoned , some blades of mace , and a few cloves . " Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while before you find the ale has done working , put the ale and bag together into a vessel . In a week or 9 days ' time bottle it up , fill the bottles but just above the necks , and leave the same to ripen as other ale . " Recipes in The Harleian cook-book are vaguer than this bizarre proof of British strength . In only one or two of them are definite measurements given . " Take sugar enough , " says one direction . " Take clean fresh brawn , " says another , " and seethe it , but not enough . " No stepby-step procedure for young brides here ! It is rather the terse understatement of one expert to another . The directions for thickening sauces and soups leave even more to the reader 's foreknowledge . " Let it not be too thick nor too thin , but as potage should be . . make it somewhat running and somewhat standing . " 107 Serve It Forth The old cook 's English is very pleasant to read . He describes the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cometh on high , ally it and set it a-down ? and look that you stir it well ! " And for pie shells to fill with meat and birds , he says ? most aptly ! ? " Take and make fair little coffins ? " Meals were hearty then , as well as plentiful . The several main dishes of a course were bound together with a froth , a fluff , of what were called light plates . A typical one directs : " Mince pork and dates , add egg yolks and green cheese and ginger and cannel , mix all , and bake with a covering of hard-baked yolks . " This horsd'ceuvre would , no doubt , keep the diners occupied until some real food came their way , something to sink their teeth into ! Here , then , is a recipe for Beef y-Stewed : " Take fair beef of the ribs of the forequarters , and smite a fair piece , and wash the beef into a fair pot . Then take the water that the beef was soaking in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ io8 In Sinistra Parte , Johnannus Baptista same water and beef in a pot and let them boil together . Then take cannel , cloves , mace , grains of parise , quibibes , and onions minced , parsley and sage , and cast thereto and let them boil together . And then take a loaf of bread , and steep it with broth and vinegar , and then draw it through a strainer , and let it be still ; and when it is near enough , cast the liquor thereto , but not too much ; and then let boil and cast saffron therez'o , a quantity . Then take salt and vinegar , and cast thereto , and look that it be poignant enough , and serve forth . " As a decoration for this stew , primroses might be tossed upon it , less beautifully than yellow melon-flowers upon the roasted duck of China , but with the same desire . Flowers were often used thus by the Middle English , sometimes most fortunately . What could be more ludicrously lovely than a tiny crackled piglet all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swan in its feathers , with roses on its proud reptilian head ? 109 Serve It Forth The three main courses of a banquet were heralded by spectacular puddings and tarts called warners . These , more often than not , were eaten in spite of the silk , wire , wood , gilt , and feathers that decorated them . The biggest set-pieces marking the end of each course , however , were seldom eaten . Instead , after the guest of honour had duly inspected them , they were paraded slowly around the banquet-hall , sometimes carried on long stretchers by the strongest servants and sometimes wheeled cumbersomely on carts . Subtleties they were called , and in no uncertain style they indicated the character or activities of the honoured diner . A Templar home from Jerusalem saw sugar heretics bowed down before a Holy Sepulcher of paste and cake , with a Red Sea of jelly shimmering near it . A sporting nobleman recognized his own hunting-party , reduced to candy , galloping across a custard moor . When John Stafford was made Archbishop of no In Sinistra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth century , he nodded with benign pleasure at the three subtleties composed for him . First he saw Saint Andrew , sitting on a high altar of state , with beams of gold ; before him kneeling , John Stafford himself in his pontifical robes , with his crozier crouched behind him , coped . Then after dishes of crane and venison and many other meats and birds and finally fish and fruit and a great tart , the second subtlety appeared . It was the Trinity showing a Son of gold , with a crucifix in His hand . Saint Thomas sat on one side , Saint Austin on the other , and John Stafford knelt again , still in his bishop 's robes . Behind him was his crozier , coped with the arms of Rochester . Behind the crozier , on one side , knelt a black monk of Christ 's Church , and on the other the Abbot of Saint Austin 's . The third course came to its end , after fourteen separate dishes . The last great subtlety was trundled before the banqueters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A godhede in a son of gold glorified above , in the son the holy giste voluptable . Seint Thomas kneling a-for him , with ye poynt of a swerd in his hede , 8c a Mitre there-uppon , crowning s.T. in dextera parte , Maria tenens mitram ; in sinistra parte , Johannus Baptista ; et in iiij partibus , iiij Angeli incensantes . " And with this the banquet ended . 112 XII Pity the Blind in Palate FREDERICK the Great used to make his own coffee , with much to-do and fuss . For water he used champagne . Then , to make the flavour stronger , he stirred in powdered mustard . Now to me it seems improbable that Frederick truly liked this brew . I suspect him of bravado . Or perhaps he was taste-blind. 113 Serve It Forth Almost all people are born unconscious of the nuances of flavour . Many die so . Some of these unfortunates are physically deformed , and remain all their lives as truly taste-blind as their brother sufferers are blind to colour . Others never taste because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been taught to search for differentiations of flavour . They like hot coffee , a fried steak with plenty of salt and pepper and meat sauce upon it , a piece of apple pie and a chunk of cheese . They like the feeling of a full stomach . They resemble those myriad souls who say , " I do n't know anything about music , but I love a good rousing military band . " Let the listener to Sousa hear much music . Let him talk to other music-listeners . Let him read about music-makers . I-Ic will discover the strange note of the oboe , recognize the French horn 's convolutions . Schubert will sing sweetly in his head , and Beethoven sweep through his heart . Then one day he will 114 Pity the Blind in Palate cry . " Bach ! By God , I can hear him ! I can hear ! " That happens to the taste-blind in just some such way . He eats apple pie , good or bad , because he has always eaten it . Then one day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sodden half-cooked fruit , and eat instead some crisp crackers with his cheese , a crisp apple peeled and sliced ruminatively after the crackers and the yellow cheese . The man looks as if he knew something pleasant , a secret from the taste-blind . " I believe I 'll try that . It is ? yes , it is good . I wonder ? " And the man who was taste-blind begins to think about eating . Perhaps he talks a little , or reads . All he really need do is experiment . He discovers that cream is good in coffee in the morning , but that after dinner black coffee is better . He looks for the first time at soup , and pushes it away if it is too pale , too thick or thin . Potatoes become more to him than the in- Serve It Forth evitable companion of meat , and he finds un suspected tastes in the vegetables he has been gulping since his infancy . He is pleased . He is awakened . At last he can taste , discovering in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sensations : ( I ) direct , on the tongue ; ( 2 ) complete , when the food passes over the tongue and is swallowed ; and most enjoyable of all ( 3 ) reflection ? that is , judgment passed by the soul on the impressions which have been transmitted to it by the tongue . Yes , he can taste at last , and life itself has for him more flavour , more zest . Of all the present nations , France has the simplest school of cooking , in spite of the com plicated subtleties of her great chefs ? simplest in the sense of primitive and natural . Herbs , much sweet butter , cream , and long heating in pots of earthenware , give the Gallic cuisine its characteristic flavours , and the juices from boiled and roasted meats are the base of almost every one of its sauces . Pity the Blind in Palate It has been said that the foundation of all of French cookery is butter , as that of the Italian is olive oil , German lard , and Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be designated , unfortunately , as the basis of the English cuisine , and perhaps the flavour from innumerable tin cans , of American ! France , today , possesses what is probably the most intelligent collective palate . I do not mean that her crudest ragamuffin can name each nuance in Fruits aux Sept Liqueurs , or give the year of a vintage wine from its bouquet . Indeed , there are many Frenchmen as callous to the harmonies of taste as any American hotdog-gobbler or English connoisseur of teashop Cornish pasties . In general , though , France eats more consciously , more intelligently , than any other nation . It may be quails financiere , or it may be a stew concocted from the rabbit that Papa Jacques caught yesterday under the hedge . Whichever France eats , she does it with a pleasure , an openeyed delight quite foreign to most people . 117 Serve It Forth The quails are an artful lure to the most refined of palates , and the rabbit stew , steaming , aromatic , is made just as tempting with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacon , and a dash of cheap pure wine . In Paris the gourmets eat with quiet deliberation , rolling each mouthful slowly toward their gullets . In Jacques ' little cottage three or four friends inhale the stew 's rich fumes , and eat it down like the hungry workingmen they are . In Paris and in the village there is a gusto , a frank sensuous realization of food , that is pitifully unsuspected in , say , the college boarding-house or corner cafe of an American town . In America we eat , collectively , with a glum urge for food to fill us . We are ignorant of flavour . We are as a nation taste-blind . Cautiously we blink at a faint glimmer in the gloom . It seems , just now , that we have become conscious of a few subtleties . There is a faddish demand for roomy salad bowls , for pepper-mills , which may bring permanent light to our national palate . Already an occasional shamefaced 118 Pity the Blind in Palate protest is heard against calling a California wine " dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthetic gastronomy as prompted an advertisement saying , " This is a vintage year for maple syrup . These feeble but encouraging signs must survive as best they may , however , while ten million men rush every noontime for their ham-onwhite and cherry coke . Those ten million men may die taste-blind as well as stomach-ulcered , unless they are shocked into recognition of their own powers of enjoyment . It might be good if you could go to them , quietly , and say , " Please , sir , stop a minute and listen to me . Can you imagine eating bananas and Limburger cheese together ? You have never thought about it ? Then think . Taste them separately in your mind , the banana , the Limburger . Taste them together . Ah ! It is horrible ? Then how about mutton chops with shrimp sauce ? And try herring soup with strawberry jam , or chocolate with red wine . " Some of those ten million men would listen . 119 Serve It Forth Some of them would eat with their minds for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and light to the taste-blind . And that is a destiny not too despicable . 120 XIII A Pigges Pettie roes Elizabethan England EVEN in the lusty days of Elizabeth 's long reign , when England 's blood ran , perhaps , at its fastest and finest , there were melancholy observers of what seemed signs of weakening in the nation 's appetite . Who could tell where things would end , when already the most reputable of rich merchants were copying an effeminate Italian man-121 Serve It Forth nerism , and carrying their silver and gold forks about with them instead of eating with their fingers and knives as good Englishmen had been glad to do for centuries ? And the ladies , lying in bed until six o'clock in the morning ! When they arose , they breakfasted like babies , thinking they could start the day decently on a pot of ale and but one meager pound of bacon . The Queen , God be thanked , paid no attention to the new-style finicking , and made her first meal of the day light but sustaining : butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer and more wholesomely than white ) , a stew of mutton , a joint of beef , one of veal , some rabbits in a pie , chickens , and fruits , with beef and wine to wash all down in really hygienic fashion . It is true that Elizabeth could more easily command a full breakfast than most of her subjects , even in that prosperous age . They lived in simpler style , and made their dinners the day 's biggest meal . They dined early , at about eleven in the morning , and unless guests had been in-122 A Pigges Pettie Toes vited their meals were much like the diet-list of one well-to-do London bachelor who , on May 11 , 1589 , was served in his lodgings in War-wick Lane with the following plain fare : For supper that same day the gentleman ate more lightly , as was the general custom : But even a bachelor grows tired of the purely animal pleasure of eating , and wishes occasionally to change it by conversation with his friends 123 Serve It Forth into the even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June loth of the same year , the Elizabethan Londoner invited a few cronies to dine with him . His cook spared no pennies , and served forth a very agreeable dinner : Either this gentleman was a moderate drinker , or his cook did not follow the usual rule of X124 A Pigges Pettie Toes adding beverage prices to the daily lists . There are few such entries : an occasional pint of claret or Rhenish , and sometimes beer for dinner . In most establishments , however , enormous quantities of wines were drunk on ordinary days as well as festivals , and this in spite of the rising prices , which had jumped from the penny-agallon of two hundred years before , to an average of one shilling twopence for the same quantity in 1590 . Sack , alicant , claret , muscadine , Rhenish , and a port-like charneco , brown bastard , cider : all these were drunk as well as ales and beers , and most of them were mixed , according to the host 's taste , with sugar , hot spices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mead her favourite tipple , and wherever she went had jugs of it carried with her , in case what was provided by her subjects was not spiced to her taste . And indeed , it was a difficult task to add to each brew of honey and water the same amount of herbs and lemon peel and ground spices , although from 125 Serve It Forth there on the procedure was the same for the Queen and the kitchen maid : three months in the keg and six weeks in the bottles before the sweet heady stuff could be drunk . Perhaps such cloying wines made palates insensible to unsweetened fare ; perhaps the great quantities of meat that were eaten made Elizabethan stomachs demand more stimulus . Whatever the reason , Englishmen then , as now , sucked greedily on candies , and counted as a failure any feast whose table did not include large bowls of " sugared meats " and sweet Naples biscuits , and marchpane , with eringo the candied root of sea holly , and kissing comfits to end the meal and sweeten the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion , in Elizabeth 's days , to serve much more food for each course than could possibly be eaten ? a fashion always co-existent with periods of prosperity ? it is hard not to feel that the social observers were probably too pessimistic . Granted that appetities had dwindled from earlier Gargantuan size , that forks were turning the British 126 A Pigges Pettie Toes ers into a race of " foppish fursifers , " that men ate like women and women like lazy infants . We can not but be thankful that we are spared the critical eye of such carpers , as we sit down to our balanced lunches of orange juice and salad , free perhaps from the gout and dropsy that stood like evil friends behind every diningbench in old England . But are we so thankful that we are free also from fine furious Elizabethan life ? 127 XIV The Standing and the Waiting I T WAS at the top of the stairs that I first felt something wrong . Until then all had been as I last knew it : the archway , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stairs , too , were the same , bending round and back over themselves in several shallow flights ; and at the top was the familiar glass box with trout , a plate of mushrooms , 128 The Standing and the Waiting and some steaks laid carelessly across the coldpipes that made its bottom . We looked for a moment into the box , Chexbres with the hurried , timid appraisal of a man who is in a strange place and conscious of being watched for his reactions to it by another person to whom it is familiar , I with the proud worry of a woman who fears she has too much boasted . Would the dishes be as exciting , as satisfying ? Would the wine still be the best wine ? And I , would I be accepted , a loving admirer , or would I now be long forgotten ? Well , the glass box was the same . Chexbres flipped me a quick smile of reassurance . We went along the ugly tiled corridor , past the water-closets where I felt a sudden hilarious memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and found them full of men all chatting , easing themselves , belching appreciatively . I started to tell Chexbres of her face , puckered in an effort to look broad-minded . We X29 Serve It Forth turned the first abrupt corner of the hall , the corner where the kitchens started . One of the doors opened . A rat-like boy darted out , ducking his head and grinning shyly as he passed us . I refused to look at Chexbres , for I knew that he had smelled , as I had , as alas ! I had , that faint trail of bad air following after the scullion like the silver of a snail , bad air rising noxiously from the hidden dirty corners of the kitchens . I finished the story of my mother 's dauntless face , as we hurried on down the long dim corridor . " There are two dining-rooms for the pensionnaires , " I chattered foolishly , " and the pensionnaires are everybody ? like the mayor and the rich brothel-keepers and carpenters and Chinese students . " And here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual , but I felt very nervous . Oh , to have talked so much of the restaurant , to have boasted ! And then that little ominous whiff ! Or had Chexbres noticed it ? 130 The Standing and the Waiting I tapped nonchalantly on the half-open glass door of the small , incredibly disordered room . " Come in , then ! " The voice was cross and muffled . We pushed into the office . By the dim window two cooks in very tall hats sat with their bare arms leaning on a table covered with empty dishes . A cradled bottle lay in front of them . They smiled impersonally . Ribaudot stood clumsily with one leg still half under the table , his hands leaning on his tall desk . " Come in , come in , " he said , more pleasantly . He wiped his mouth , and peered politely at us . " How do you do ? good afternoon , Monsieur Ribaudot . I am sure you do n't remember me : Madame Fischer , who used so often to dine here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , of course ! Why , of course ! " He smiled warmly , but I could see that he did not remember . I shrugged inside , and while I introduced Chexbres as a fervent student of gastronomy , and we all chattered and assured each other 131 Serve It Forth of remembrance and good will , I looked for change . If the whiff , the faint bad trail , had caught Ribaudot , it was not yet evident . His office was filled with the conglomerate cooling odours of a good meal , and he himself with the first leisurely torpor of perfect digestion . Yes , of course he looked older , perhaps thinner , uncombed as ever , though , and still modestly sure of being a great restaurateur . " And Charles , little Charles ? " I asked , suddenly . Several looks crossed in the air . Chexbres looked at me , warmly , smiling at my nostalgic probings and at what I had told him of the waiter Charles . I looked first at Chexbres , thanking him for recognizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long dead , he had still been the ultimate , the impeccable peak of all waiters . Then I saw Ribaudot look swiftly at the two silent cooks and they at him , a look ? a look ? I felt very sad and puzzled . Ribaudot interrupted me. 132 The Standing Nd the Waiting " The little Charles ? " he asked , blandly . " Ah , you remember the little old Charles ? " His voice was noncommittal . " But certainly he is here . We will call him . " Through my half-hearted protestations he walked majestically the three paces to the door , and disappeared . The air was still full of crossed meaningful looks . I wondered very much , and watched Chexbres ' impassive interest in the framed diplomas on the walls . I tried to feel impassive , too . Chexbres turned . Charles stood in the doorway , breathing quickly , a rumpled napkin over one arm . Oh , I had forgotten how small ? but had n't he been fatter ? Yes , old , the little old Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face lighten quickly from peevish bewilderment to pleasure . " Howdedo , Charles . I do n't know if you remember ? " " 0 my God ! Oh , pardon , pardon , but it is the little American student , the little lady ! " 133 Serve It Forth Behind me , Chexbres laughed to hear me called little as I peered down on Charles , he up at me , timidly still , but recognizing me . " And you , Madame ? And how long is it ? And you , are you well ? Has it been two years ? Six ? Impossible ! But it is good , pardon me for saying so , but it is good to see you ! " He stopped suddenly , looking confusedly at the two silent cooks , and then at Ribaudot . He seemed to shrink even smaller . " Monsieur Ribaudot , " I said , " would it be possible to command a dinner for this evening , and ask for the services of Charles ? " " But certainly , certainly ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make squiggles on it . " Until eight tonight , then , Charles . And the old table in the corner ? was it Number Four ? " I turned to Ribaudot again . He seemed to know me at last , and to be trying to comfort me , to soften life for me . And all the time we discussed food so pleasantly I wondered at Charles ' quick , poignant , wet look of ? of gratitude ? ? as he hurried back to his work . 134 The Standing and the Waiting I felt sad , but said nothing to Chexbres . Instead , we talked of Burgundian architecture , not even mentioning the Burgundian meal we had so long planned . At eight o'clock the small dining-room was full , except for our waiting table . As we sat down I saw in one easy glance that the people were no different after six years . There was the old woman with a dog and a dancing-boy on her way to Cannes , and the table of American schoolteachers eating from a guide-book . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey , looking embarrassed before their larks on toast . At the table under the mirror sat a college professor ; the College Professor , twirling a glass of Corton , the pedagogic connoisseur , sipping alone in solemn appreciation , sure that his accent was as refined as his taste . There were two tables of French people , gay and hungry . I remembered that their faces would grow red , later on . A Chinese eating truffled pate in a trance of philosophical nausea , two Lesbians drinking 135 Serve It Forth Vichy , three silent pensionnaires , a priest ? the hard white lights burned down on all of us , the mirror reflected our monotonous gestures , the grey walls picked out our pale natures and the warmth of colour and odour and taste before us on the white tables . " This is a good room , " Chexbres murmured , lowering his eyelids and straightening a straight fork . " I like small rooms . Small rooms , for eating ? or mountain-sides . " " Good evening ! Ah , ' sieur-'dame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breathing fast . His minute moustache was newly stiff with wax , and his hair was plastered in a thin replica of the debonair curlicues he used to wear . He beamed anxiously at us . " Does ? is everything as you wished ? " " Everything is perfect , Charles ! " I wondered if my voice were too fervent . " Now we will start with a little glass of Dubonnet , please . " When he had gone , Chexbres said : " You are known , my dear ! You should be much flattered ? or I for being with you . " 136 The Standing and the Waiting He smiled , the sweet-tongued self-mocker , at me and at the table , and I looked with less haste at the tall crystal tulips to hold wine , at the napkins folded like pheasants , at the inky menu big as a newspaper , and our own little typewritten one on top of it , at the flowers ? Flowers chez Ribaudot , Ribaudot who hated any foreign odours near his plates ? Never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our table . On the little serving-board beside us , Charles fussed clumsily with a new bottle of Dubonnet . Finally it was open . He poured it with a misjudged flourish . Purple spread on the cloth . I looked quickly , without meaning to , at Chexbres , but he was watching the quiet colour in his glass . Perhaps he had not seen , had not realized , the fumblings of my perfect waiter ? He raised his aperitif . His eyes were wide and candid . " I drink to our pasts ? to yours and mine . And to ours . The wine is strong . Time is strong , too . " He bowed slightly . " I grow solemn ? or sententious . " X137 The Standing and the Waiting were desperate eyes , bloodshot , frantic , des-perate . I cringed away . " Oh , Chexbres , " I whispered , " do n't mind the spilling ! Do n't ! It 's that he 's nervous . His hand 's shaking because of that , I know . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said inside . You know Charles is drunk . Yes , Charles , the perfect waiter , spilling soup and drunk , and it hurts your pride . " Maybe his feet hurt him , " I went on very fast . " I know you hate soup in saucers . But you know I 've heard that waiters do stranger things than most criminals , simply because their feet hurt . " " Yes , I 'm sure , " Chexbres agreed , vaguely . This is really delicious , my dear . " You know , " he said , in a suddenly direct voice , " I ca n't understand why most people are put off at first by the coloured tiles on the roofs of Burgundy . It seems to me they 're a definite outcropping of the plebeian in architecture , like the frescoes of Swiss interiors during the same period . " 139 Serve It Forth I laughed at him . " I 'm not afraid of time . " " Do n't boast . " " I 'm not boasting . Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too complicated . But this tastes good . I 'm hungry . " " And this will be a good meal , worth waiting even longer than six years for . Do you know , " he asked naively , " that I 've never before had a menu written just for me ? It 's very exciting . " I felt my self-confidence sweep back , as he meant it to . " And flowers , " he went on . " I 've had flowers on my table , but never the only ones , in a room of such important people . " We looked vaguely , amicably , at the stiff little bouquet , mimosa and a purplish rosebud and a short twig of cypress . Charles steamed beside us , with a tall pitcher of soup . While he served it , it spilled from the trembling cups into the saucers . I felt a flash of intense irritation : wet saucers , God ! how they irritate me ! I looked straight into his eyes . They were not wet and grateful now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuffed . But almost at once I knew he was right . Six years ? six hundred years . . . architecture was better . We talked , and well , and all the dinner was most excellent , and the wine was like music on our tongues . Time was forgotten , and its signals , too . But I noticed , with a kind of fifth eye , that Charles ' hand grew steady , and his own eye clear , until by the end of the meal I dared preen myself upon his delicate sure touch . " Have you ever seen that better done ? " I asked Chexbres . " No . No , he is wonderful . He is an artist . " We watched as in a blissful dream the small fat hands moving like magic among bottles and small bowls and spoons and plates , stirring , pouring , turning the pan over the flame just so , just so , with the face bent keen and intent above . " It 's like a brain operation , " Chexbres said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon . Thank you for bringing me here . It 's worth ? " It was done . We tasted . We nodded silently , 140 The Standing and the Waiting and smiled at Charles , and he looked almost like the old Charles again , very self-sure . I felt happy . After coffee , I laughed to think of us sitting there almost the last , and at what I was going to do . " Chexbres , you think I 've shown off , but that was only the beginning ! Now I really do show off , and all for your benefit . " We smiled at each other , very effortless and calm . " Charles , " I called , warning Chexbres quickly , " You have never tasted the local marc , remember ! " Charles , what do you think has been the sad experience ? but first , are we keeping you too late ? " I waved my hand at the now empty room , dim in every corner but ours , and at a scullery boy scrubbing the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease in Time . " Oh , but what an idea ! " Charles exploded . " Excuse me for chiding you , Madame , but what an idea ! Madame , you must know that for you 141 Serve It Forth to have another good meal chez Ribaudot , and go away remembering it and me , I would gladly stay here until morning ? no , until tomorrow night , by God ! " Chexbres and I bowed courteously . Charles did , too . " And the sad experience , Madame ? " " Oh , thank you for recalling me . I had almost forgotten . Charles , last night we had a stroke of luck that was unfortunate ? I should say almost desolating . I , who wished to introduce our good friend Monsieur Chexbres to the famous marc of Burgundy , was served with a glass of some strange liquid ? thank God I had the good sense to taste it before letting Monsieur come near id ? some strange liquid , pale , cut , rank , which could never ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charles beamed , flourishing his napkin with glee . " Oh , but naturally I would not be so indiscreet as to mention the name of the miserable restaurant , " I protested , rhetorically . I glanced at Chexbres exultantly : the scene was beautiful . 142J The Standing and the Waiting " No need , no need , Madame ! A restaurant serving the good marc so insultingly , and to you , a connoisseur " ( here I bowed graciously ) " and to this poor gentleman a sure amateur having his first taste ( here Chexbres lowered his eyes modestly ) ? " ah , such poisonous conduct , my God ! could only be at " ( and here Charles leaned very close to us in the empty room and hissed ) " could only be at La Tour ! " He stood off , triumphant . I pressed a little line into the tablecloth with my thumb nail , smirking , murmuring , " Of course I say nothing , no names ! " in complete agreement . I could feel Chexbres ' appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must rectify that infected , that ? pardon me ? that stinking behaviour ! " I sighed faintly . It had worked ! " Yes , my idea , too . But no ordinary marc , Charles , no liqueur served on any one 's order . This must be ? " " Yes , very special , " he finished for me . " Trust me , Madame . It may take a few extra minutes . A little more filtre , perhaps , while I am gone ? " 143 Serve It Forth Chexbres and I sat wordless , looking mildly and somnolently at each other . We sipped at the bitter black coffee . A rickety old ventilator whirred in the ceiling , and the boy cleaning the hall bumped his bucket against the tiles . Lights went out , except over our table . Charles tiptoed back , wheezing , but his face full of life . He held a filthy old green bottle , not picturesquely crusted , but filthy . Silently he poured a little dark brown liquid into a large glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Permit me , sir , " Charles halted him , " permit me to suggest that Madame taste it . " I winked slightly at Chexbres , and took up the glass . I tried to look like a connoisseur , a little pompous probably . I sipped , and then I could only look beatifically delighted , for it was the cleanest , smoothest distillation that I had ever met . " Ah ! " Charles sighed . I had told him . He poured the glass almost half full , at least twice as full as 144 The Standing and the Waiting he should have , and with a jubilant look disappeared into the wet dark hall . " Chexbres , now I shall be solemn . But I have never been served such marc ! Not even Ribaudot would serve that to his best friends , to any one less than the mayor or maybe the Holy Ghost . Where did Charles get it ? " Chexbres let it run under his tongue , and sat nodding ecstatically at me . I could almost see it seeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonic tide , and then down his throat . " Dear sweet gentle Jesus ! " he remarked , softly . " Oh , I 'm glad we came , Chexbres . After all , I mean . " We both drank at the one glass , and talked peacefully under the one white light . Finally the marc was gone . Charles appeared , carrying the filthy bottle . " Oh , no more , no more ! Really , we could n't ? " He stopped very still , and looked at me . " Madame , you must drink one glass . Please ! " 145 Serve It Forth he said , in a quiet voice , almost muttering . " Please drink this glass from me . It is I , Charles , who offer it to you and to Monsieur Chexbres . " " But ? it is so late , and ? " The thought of swallowing one more mouthful closed my throat , almost . " I have said I would stay until tomorrow for you . I would stay until the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly , standing between us and the dark doorway . Beyond him I could see nothing , and there was not a sound anywhere , except the three of us breathing rather cautiously . " Thank you , " Chexbres said , warmly . " Madame was afraid only of detaining you too long , Charles . Otherwise we could sit for ever , too , drinking this miraculous liqueur . " He held out the glass . With a hand steady as oak , Charles poured it to the brim , a good halfpint of strong marc . " Thank you , Charles , " I said . " I want never to leave , here where I have so often been happy . 146 The Standing and the Waiting It may be six years again . Will you prepare the bill , please ? " We knew we must drink it all . It was like smouldering fire , wonderful still , but hard now to swallow . We sat without moving , conscious suddenly of exhaustion , and of being perhaps too full of food , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , with the little sheet of flimsy paper on a plate . I wondered about the tip : in a way I felt like not leaving one , because he seemed more than a waiter now . But when he brought back change , I left it all on the plate . " Thank you , Madame , " he said , and did not pick it up . He stood watching us sip resolutely at the marc . Finally I looked up at him . " Madame , thank you , thank you for coming again . " I wanted not to be personal , so I said , " But why not ? All people who love good food come to Ribaudot 's again . " " Yes , " he stuttered slightly , " but ? pardon me ' 47 Serve It Forth ? but I mean thank you for asking for me . You do n't know ? " " Oh , Charles , it is we who are fortunate , to have your services . " I felt very polished and diplomatic , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weariness and all the marc . " No , no ? I mean , you will never know what it meant , tonight , to have you ask for me , little old Charles . And now , good evening . " Chexbres asked , quickly , " But we will pass this way again , and soon we hope , and then of course ? ? " " Ah , who knows ? " Charles raised his eyebrows toward his thinning curlicue of hair , restrained a gesture to stroke his little whiff of moustache , smiled debonairly at us , and disappeared finally into the black corridor . " I thought he said he would wait until tomorrow night , " I murmured , flippantly . Then I felt rather ashamed , and apologized . " He 'll probably be waiting at the end of the hall , the top of the stairs , to help us with our coats . " 148 The Standing and the Waiting Chexbres said nothing , but slowly drank down the rest of the marc . The chairs squawked wildly as we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . In the corridor we saw a dim light , and as we went by Ribaudot 's office , his silhouette was sharp against the frosted glass , bent over his high des ' " I know where the coats are , " I whispered , and we tiptoed down the hall . " Is it Madame Fischer ? " His voice came muffled through the door . He opened it , blinking at us , with his hair mussed . " Oh , I 'm sorry ! I do hope we have n't kept you , " I said , in confusion . He looked very tenderly at us . " No . And have you dined well ? I am glad . I have your coats in here . " We stood awkwardly in the doorway while he crossed the little room to the table where the two cooks had sat in the afternoon . Our coats were piled on it , to one side , and a stiff ugly 149 Serve It Forth bouquet of mimosa and two purplish rosebuds and a twig of cypress stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were home in bed , very tired . " It was good of you to remember Ribaudot , " he said . " It was very natural . Who does not ? " " Ah , things nowadays ? the affairs ? " but he bowed , acceptance calm on his face . " And the poor old Charles . It was especially good for him . I see you and I shared the honour of flowers from him . " He looked impersonally at the ugly bouquet . " Yes , I fired Charles today , just before your first visit . He is on his way to the South by now . " Permit me to help you with your scarf . It was sad ? a fine waiter once , a brave little man always ? but what will you do ? Everything changes . Everything passes . " Good-night . Good-night , sir and Madame , and thank you . And good-bye . " " Au revoir , we hope , " I called as we walked away from him towards the dark . 150 The Standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and closed the glass door . In the long hall corruption hung faint and weakly foul on the still air . The stairs were deep , with the empty glass box like a dark ice cube , and we breathed freely once out in the courtyard . It was filled with moonlight . The trees in tubs were black , and through the archway the tower of the palace gleamed and glowed against the black sky . Chexbres took my hand gently , and pointed to the roofs , coloured tiles , Burgundian , drained of their colour now , but plainly patterned . I began to cry . 151 xv Catherine 's Lonesome Cooks 1533 A.D.-I810 A.D. France UNTIL well into the sixteenth century French cooking developed little . Lordly kitchens aped the British in the length , breadth , and depth of their enormous meals . Restaurants there were none , unless you could so name that redoubtable hostelry " La Tour d'Argent , " old then , older today . Now it serves crepes Suzette and canards pur-sang , but in 1533 152 Catherine 's Lonesome Cooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages as dormouse pasty and a mixed pie of snake , porpoise , swan , and plum-stuffed crane . It was that year that Fate and Pope Clement VII changed the table manners of Europe . The Holy Father , probably conscious le. , s of the gastronomic importance of his act than of its political results , married off his niece Catherine de ' Medici to France 's young Henry . And Catherine took her cooks to France with her . They were probably the first great chefs de cuisine in that land , and galling though the fact may be to those Frenchmen who mix patriotism with their love of fine food , they were Italians every one . Paris seemed harsh and boorish to the lonesome Florentines . They moped for the gay lightness of their own banquet-halls . There ladies and gentlemen were taught The Fifty Courtesies of the Table as soon as they were old enough to eat at all . Here in Paris many people still laughed jeeringly at " those Italian neatnesses 0153 Serve It Forth called forks , " and gulped down great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greasy fingers . Catherine 's cooks shuddered , and conferred together in low voices . It was not long before they acted . Their innovation burst like a bomb over all the noble tables of Paris . Sherbets appeared ! In every shape and colour , with flavours as clear and subtle as summer flowers , sherbets were set before the startled Frenchmen by the Queen 's wily chefs . Roughened tongues were made smooth , and hot throats cooled ; palates , long calloused by the indiscriminate spicings of the dark centuries , slowly grew keen and sensitive . The chefs chuckled . These Frenchmen might be able , in good time , to appreciate their Italian sauces and their tarts and soups . In good time ! By the beginning of the next century the French palate had indeed grown much more sophisticated , and some knowledge of culinary tricks was a necessary part of any worldling 's education . Louis XIII , it is true , became his 154 Catherine 's Lonesome Cooks own cook less for pleasure than because of his inherited fear of being poisoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , developed a passionate interest in cookery . It became smart to cook the main dish of a supper oneself . Kitchens , suddenly invaded by guests in elaborate costumes and dainty shoes , were the centre of attention . They bloomed with new pots , crest-emblazoned . A hundred impractical inventions of the amateur chefs for turning spits and whipping cream were discreetly ignored by harassed cooks , who worked as expertly as ever in this new shade . Kitchen gardens , as well , grew very amusingly under the ecstatic gushings of court ladies and the silent care of gardeners , and a bouquet of lettuces and shallots was as chic as lilies . The greatest men in all France became authors of strange poems on food and stranger recipes , which were greeted with peals of respectful laughter . Some of them , like Cardinal Richelieu 's invention of a sauce made with eggs and oil which he called maionnaise , are as fa-155 ' Serve It Forth rniliar a part of our diet today as almond milk and brawn were in ' Goo . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great-grandson , were less timid than the king who feared poison . They loved good food as they loved war and fine buildings and beautiful women , with a boundless and intelligent zest . Kitchens and kitchen gardens were just as fashionable under their energetic reigns , but it now became even more stylish to own a famous chef . Great men stooped to the most childish tricks to win a rival 's cook or steward , and recipes were guarded like coronation jewels . Diplomats and nobles were proud to give their revered family names to a new sauce or a bonbon , or share kudos with the chef who so honoured them . Soubise sauce , so subtly oniony , and Bechamel , that life-saver of la haute cuisine , are only two of the innumerable recipes that have come to us from the snobbish palates of the French eighteenth century . Great chefs were its oracles , and wrote seri-156 Catherine 's Lonesome Cooks ous treatises on the arts of carving and serving , or the complexities of gastronomic etiquette . The Prince de Conde 's chef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered for a dinner arrived too late to be served , gave some indication of his own seriousness as well as his art 's , in the essay L'Escuyer Tranchant . " A carver , " he dictates in one section , " should be scrupulous in his deportment ; his carriage should be grave and dignified , his appearance cheerful ; his eye serene , his head erect and well combed , abstaining as much as possible from sneezing , yawning , or twisting his mouth , speaking very little and directly , without being too near or too far from the table . " Oddly enough , Vatel 's disciples earned their princely pay as much from those glamorous women kept by the diplomats as from the great men themselves . The pleasures of the table had become so important , by the time Madame du Barry and la Pompadour reigned over France , that no intelligent courtesan could afford to be ' 57 Serve It Forth without a fine chef . Dining eclipsed its old companion love-making , and many a beautiful fclle was coveted more for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs . Waning passions , Louis the King 's and Louis the fat silk-merchant 's , were fanned by the invention of a thousand new recipes . It was thus , most probably , that started the extravagant fad for turkeys stuffed with truffles . French interest in anything from the American Colonies ran high , and such dishes as Indian corn pudding and wild roasted turkey made any table smart . Prices for them ran into several figures ? almost as expensive as truffles . It took a woman of unlimited income and capricious brain to combine the two whims of the moment , and serve a turkey stuffed with truffles to her admirers . Immediately a rage for the crazy dish swept Paris . First the demi-monde and then the court devoured it , with only slight qualms at its exorbitant cost . Then , in an epidemic frenzy , the middle 158 Catherine 's Lonesome Cooks classes , the little shopkeepers , the laundresses and coachmen were seized with a mad appetite for diode truflee . Truffles became so scarce that they were escorted through the city with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove their social stability by serving one stuffed turkey . Only the courtesans and the great lords could afford the dish . They soon tired of it . In a few months Paris had forgotten it , except in the bankruptcy courts . Under Louis XVI , gastronomy continued its somewhat debauched course . Louis himself was a plain man , more interested in locks and musical timepieces than in the intricacies of saucemaking . His simplicity , though , may have had its own subtle influence on the reigning vogue of the court , for under his poor giddy queen the pastoral life was lived most artificially . Marie Antoinette and all her ladies became , for several hours of every sunny day , milkmaids more exquisite than ever spaded dung in any truthful farmyard .
