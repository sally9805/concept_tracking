JAPAN-GREAT BRITAIN <P> Great Britain , said Prime Minister Seville Chamberlain last week , would never submit to threats and change its Far Eastern policy at Japan 's bidding . When the British and Japanese negotiators got down to real work at Tokyo last week however , Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita insisted in discussions with Sir Robert Craigie , the British Ambassador , that Britain admit she had sinned against Japan and promise in the future to recognize " the necessity " of Japan 's operations in China . He threatened to break off negotiations unless Sir Robert first signed a general formula to that effect . <P> While the negotiators tried to twist words into phrases that could cover such antithetical views , the Japanese Army made things hotter for the British in China by organizing " spontaneous " hostile demonstrations . Neither the Japanese Government , which is afraid of losing its remaining power to Army extremists , nor the British , who are playing for time , wanted to break off the Tokyo conversations . Finally Sir Robert and Foreign Minister Arita agreed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . recognize the actual situation in China , where hostilities on a large scale are in progress . . . . The Japanese forces in China have special requirements for the purpose of safeguarding their own security and maintaining public order . . . .

He declared emphatically that future discussions " will be confined to local issues at Tientsin " and Britain would not abandon her support of Chinese currency or right to grant credits to China . Again the Japanese thought otherwise . <P> Last March British and Chinese bankers , partly backed by the British Treasury , up a $50,000,000 exchange stabilization fund , pegged the Chinese dollar at 17 A surprisingly stable currency the dollar retained its value despite Japanese currency raids , Chinese military deat " apanese political pressure on Great Britain .
