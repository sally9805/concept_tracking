Although sulfanilamide and sulfapyridine work wonders in the treatment of pneumonia , they sometimes bring on a train of after-effects both irritating and dangerous , including vomiting , violent headaches , acute anemia . Last week Dr. Mark McDonough Bracken of Pittsburgh 's Mellon Institute reported another " miracle drug " for treatment of pneumonia , cheaper than and just as effective as sulfanilamide and sulfapyridine , but much safer . No kin to the older drugs , tongue-tripping hydroxy-ethylapocupreine is derived from quinine , is usually swallowed in gelatin capsules . Of 500 pneumonia patients treated at Pittsburgh 's Mercy Hospital , said Chief Physician William Watt Graham MacLachlan , less than 23% died . Usual Pittsburgh pneumonia-case death rate : 45% . Before advising other physicians to lay in a winter 's supply of hydroxyethylapocupreine , the cautious investigators , remembering the unqualified praise which greeted sulfanilamide , are waiting for further confirmation of the drug 's efficacy.
