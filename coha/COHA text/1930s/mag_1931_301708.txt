When 119,624,909,917 cigarets were produced last year against 119,038,841,560 in 1929 tobacco men hailed it as an indication of their industry 's ability to withstand Depression . Last week , however , this stout business suffered a reversal . It was announced that July production was 10,705,532,520 cigarets , a decrease of 9.7% from July 1930 . One reason for the sharpness of the decline was that during June the wholesale price was upped , retailers given a period of grace during which they stocked up . Also , July 1930 was the industry 's best month ever . Nevertheless the decrease was so large that 1931 's cigaret record , until now ahead of last year , shows a 1.06% drop from the first seven months of 1931 . <P> That price may have a big bearing on cigarets during Depression was illustrated last week by the case of Philip Morris &; Co. , Ltd . For a long time this company has had the sales rights and , through an affiliated holding company , controlled the production of several prominent cigarets ( Marlboro , English Ovals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barking Dog ) . For about two years it has turned out a Paul Jones cigaret selling at 10 for a standard package of 20 . By not advertising it , the company has saved nearly 5 a package on Paul Jones , kept quality up . Last week more &; more retailers were asking for Paul Jones , new machinery was being installed in the Richmond factory , production was increased to 14 hours a day . The present production of 15,000,000 a week goes mostly to New England , Ohio , Indiana , Iowa , Kentucky , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Michigan . A few United Cigar and Schulte stores handle Paul Jones in Manhattan and it is to this area that the increased production is expected to go , with other big cities to be added later . Although Paul Jones may be featured in window displays Philip Morris &; Co. still does-ot expect to advertise , hopes to prove the 10 price alone will reap its reward .                   @ @
