" As will be inferred from the foregoing correspondence John A. Roebling was a prudent and sagacious business man . If his profits were curtailed during the panic period he had at least managed to weather the storm that swept over the country and with the advent of better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manufacturer . Doubtless his engineering fees and investments served to keep him in sufficient funds , even though the wire rope industry was in a state of depression for the time being . During the winter seasons when outside construction work was at a standstill Mr. Roebling was commonly at home , busy preparing plans for the activities of the following season and making such changes and renovations in his plant as were necessary . // The letters to Swan begin again in the spring of 1858 and are mainly written as heretofore from Pittsburgh where he had resumed work on the bridge in company with his son Washington , who had been graduated the year before from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute . While he continues to refer to the " hard times " and counsels Swan to be careful in extendC 104 j PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS ing credits , he maintains a more hopeful spirit in respect to the financial if not the industrial situation . He writes about a new process discovered in England of converting good iron wire into steel wire and describes the probable process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , by which the strength is doubled , I have received some more information on the subject . This wire is made of good iron in the usual way , and converted into steel wire afterwards ? it is steel wire , hence its great strength . I have no longer doubt that this improvement will revolutionize the whole wire rope business , and if our business is to continue successfully , we will have to fall to work at once to experiment &; if possible to manufacture the same kind of wire . " The process is most probably as follows : " The wire is finished at an ordinary temper and then carbonized or cemented in close boxes in annealers . Perhaps it may be necessary to clean the wire in limewater . Our annealer if tight may do . Put a layer of good charcoal , pulverized in the bottom , then put in a layer of wire loosely , then a layer of charcoal &; so on to the top , the charcoal must completely surround the wire , so that all the wire comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do not know ? it does for cementing common steel . " In a subsequent letter he continues the subject : " Experience has taught here in Pittsburgh that a high conversion can not be effected by charcoal dust , but only by charcoal grains of the size of a small pea . Dust will do for low &; soft grades of blister , but for a deep hard crystallized conversion the coal must be in grains with sufficient air between , to support a partial combustion . C 105 J THE ROEBLINGS " I wish you to carry out my ideas for the purpose of arriving at facts . " No opinions , but facts ( well ascertained ) alone can be of service in such a matter . " The Lexington and Danville Railroad had been sold at auction and he announces to Swan that he had become one of the purchasers : " The Lexington &; Danville R.R. was sold on the 18th for $132,150-all told , a work that has cost S800,000 . I am one of the purchasers . We have a good bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My cash subscription or liability ( besides 5 bonds , which I hold ) amount to near $15,000 in 6 installments , running over a space of 24 months . " He directs Swan to open his private safe in Mrs. Roebling 's presence and send him certain securities which he will find there to be used to complete the payment of his purchase . LETTERS OF 18S9-186o In the spring of 1859 the Camden and Amboy Railroad , the lines of which skirted the land of Roebling 's factory at Trenton , contemplated a change which would involve an encroachment of about one hundred feet upon his property . He writes to Mr. D. G. Stevens , the engineer of the railroad company who had informed him of the project : " You are certainly not in earnest when you expect on my part a cordial cooperation with the R.R. Co. when such cooperation involves my own destruction . When locating my works I felt sure I should forever be out of the way of any future possible change in the location of the R.R. Should your plan be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , mill , residence &; all. ? The damage to me would be immense . " But I shall indulge in the hope that you will be able to ( - to6 J PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS modify your plan so as to avoid any encroachment upon my property &; with this expectation , I am , Yours sincerely . " He writes to Swan about the matter and encloses Stevens ' letter to him , instructing Swan to obtain a legal opinion as to his rights : " The execution of this plan would be a monstrous injury to my property &; must be avoided &; thwarted by all means . Please take the enclosed letter with my answer to Mr. Beasley Mercer Beasley , afterward chief justice &; ask his advice ? enquire if the R.K.

Ask Mr. Beasley whether commissioners would have a right to change the location of a township road to my serious injury . Say that Stevens ' plan would destroy my whole property . Otherwise keep this matter to yourself &; be cautious . " The letters continue through the spring and summer of 1860 and refer mainly to general matters of business , with some references to the Pittsburgh-Allegheny Bridge which was approaching completion . He reports a continuation of dull times in Pittsburgh : " Times are very dull here , and much worse , as you go W'r'est . A very general stagnation of business &; no money . No man West of this or South who orders rope , can be trusted unless previously known . " 4 , 107 J THE ROEBLINGS He is glad to learn from Swan that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " To fill all these orders , will keep you very busy all next summer . It is well you have got through with our improvements &; machinery for the present . Always good policy to be prepared for such heavy orders . " He writes on June 21 regarding the fine appearance of the bridge : " I have read your letter to Wash . Our bridge stands well &; is very firm , less shaking than on a wooden Br . We are now finishing &; putting up ornamental work &; tollhouses . I can not leave before end of the month . I do not wish to leave so long as things are in an unfinished condition . When entirely completed this Br. will make a splendid appearance , gilded domes on the towers &; well shaped spires on the tollhouses , with cornishes projecting 10 ' 6 " so as to cover the sidewalks , these are some of the features .

The bridge will be beautiful , when entirely completed . " A comparison of the industrial census of 1850 when John A. Roebling began manufacturing wire rope in Trenton with that of 1860 shows a substantial progress , alike in the capital invested in the business , the amount of product and the number of men employed . During the ten years intervening the capital had increased from $20,000 to $100,000 , the quantity of wire rope from 250 tons to 400 tons and the hands employed from 20 to 30 . The fact must also be taken into consideration that for several years previously the business of the country had been prostrated owing to the great financial panic of 1857 . Considering the circumstances it must be admitted that the industry had 108 J PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS done well in the first ten years of its existence , since it had weathered the greatest financial crisis in the history of the country and was prepared to take advantage of the prosperous times which presumably were to follow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil war with its cessation of public works , but also as an offset demands upon industry for vast supplies of all sorts in accordance with which John A. Roebling 's little business presumably enjoyed its due share of prosperity . However much Mr. Roebling may have deplored the necessity for the war between the States , he vehemently hated slavery and as a true patriot was prepared to make such sacrifices for his principles as were required to carry it to a successful completion . For one thing he did not hesitate to encourage his eldest son Washington to offer his services at the very first call for troops , the full particulars of which will be related in connection with Washington Roebling 's career as set forth in a subsequent chapter . For himself he proposed a popular subscription and headed it with a sum of ten thousand dollars to arm and equip State troops to defend the flag . It was found later that this voluntary contribution was unnecessary , but the proposal showed his generous spirit and his willingness to make financial sacrifices in the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him at Covington , Kentucky , taking up again his work on the Cincinnati-Covington bridge which had been interrupted by the war : " I have some trouble here with my laborers who struck this morning for a rise .

I think after the draft at N.Y . has been enforced at the point of the bayonet , there will be no more trouble . The Germans about here are mostly loyal , the Irish alone are disloyal .

" He learned that his son Washington had returned home on leave and is anxious to learn how he fares . He also speaks of Morgan 's raid into Indiana : " Mrs. R. wrote to me , that Washington had been home on a visit . I knew nothing of this , nobody had informed of it . I am anxious to hear from Washington , have you any news from him ? I have today got through with the reconstruction &; erection of my derricks &; would commence laying masonry , if martial law had not been declared on account of Morgan 's raid into Indiana , who is about 50 miles from here with 5,000 men . There are about 15,000 men after him to catch him . " It is evident from the following note that he had returned home to spend Christmas : " CHS SWAN Es . Trenton , Dec. 24 , 1863 .

" I , 110 PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS The spring of 1864 found him again at Covington , Kentucky . The high premium on gold was giving him at that time great concern and he writes Swan to advance rates on his products proportionately : " Let all parties understand that we can not under the circumstances have fixed rates even for one month . You will have to inform them , one and all , that no orders can be booked ahead more than one week at fixed rates . Our prices must rise in the same ratio as gold , iron &; wire will rise . All the orders you have now booked ahead , must be subject to increase of prices from week to week . " Our cardprices must be at once raised again to the gold point ? and you will have to keep issuing new cards every week , just as other parties do . " The following day he writes , giving Swan a general formula for replies to customers , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rule , No prices fixed beyond one week ahead . " To avoid trouble &; law suits and losses , I wish you also to observe the following rule in your correspondence . On receipt of an order reply as follows : " Yours has been received .

The invoice will be made out according to the prices ruling at the time . If these terms suit , please advise . I shall not book your order until I hear from you . " A few weeks later he writes again upon the same subject : " I want to make a few remarks in relation to money affairs . o N ou may be guided by it in our dealings . iii THE ROEBLINGS " 1 . It is now well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue any more currency . " 2 . He will resort to loans here &; in Europe .

The country is full of imported goods . Importations will stop . All heavy speculators will go to the wall , and I should not be surprised , that next winter , if our arms should be successful , gold will be clown to 15o and every thing else in proportion . " This is the view entertained by many sensible people . At any rate 1 have no fears , that gold will go further up , it will go down under the new financial policy of Mr. Fessenden . " He was much alarmed over unfavorable reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to Swan requesting him to take certain actions in his behalf . He recommends his favorite hydropathic cure : " Your remarks about Mrs. Roebling 's condition and her own letter to me are not satisfactory , and leave me to infer , that the worst is not over . Mrs. R. possesses very little recuperative powers of life , and I fear , that the little that is left will gradually wear away , and that her protracted weakness &; illness is only the approach to her final dissolution . This thought is gloomy and depressing . I am anxious to see her health restored her life spared yet for a while , but I am sorry to confess , that my wishes and advice will be powerless &; of no avail with her , because she never has paid the least attention to anything 112 J PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS I have said or done on this subject of health . Who is her physician ? Nobody has informed me . " Now I request you as a friend , to talk on my behalf with her physician and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her disease , in writing , also the history of her illness , and if he chooses , his treatment &; candid opinion , all in writing . I have among my friends here 3 distinguished physicians , with whom I shall consult , as soon as I am supplied with a correct description of her disease . . . . " Give my love to all &; read this to Mrs. Roebling . " It may be stated at this point that Mrs. Roebling died November 22 , 1864 . Her husband wrote a beautiful and pathetic tribute to her memory and inserted it in the Family Bible ; a reproduction of it appears in this chapter . In August he is again concerned with the high premium on gold and expects to see it go even higher : " Gold is fluctuating between 250 &; 260 and this state of things is likely to last another year . I do not expect that gold will be lower ? rather higher . No body can foretell the future . The North will not stand it another year without home rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its present perils is Butler , but Lincoln wants to be Pres. for another term . " In September he writes : " Gold is now dropping down fast and may be down to loo and even less during the following month . If G1 .

I r . Lincoln 's reelection is certain , this together with a few lucre great military successes will reduce the rebel forces to such 1113 J THE ROEBLINGS straits , that a general collapse of the Confederacy becomes a certain , a fixed fact before next spring . " On April s , 865 , he writes : " The Army news is glorious , the rebels are now in the last ditch , and the prospects are , that the whole South will be once more in Union traces before the next 4th of July .

I shall not be able to enjoy it much before this bridge is completed . After that I expect I shall take all the comfort I can get at home &; leave bridge building to younger folks . " I also request you to order , in conjunction with Ferdy &; Elvira an appropriate tomb stone for the late Mrs. Roebling , it appears time one should be erected . " c : ' ' : CHAPTER VI THE NIAGARA FALLS AND OTHER NOTABLE // IN DESCRIBING the Roebling bridges in this chapter and giving such technical details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the recognized authorities . He has not felt it necessary to cumber the narrative with notes , but has deemed it sufficient to append to the chapter a bibliography of the main sources of which he has made use . Suspension bridges are no new invention ; the principle has been known for centuries and , indeed , there are examples long previous to the Christian Era . A brief history of suspension bridges is given in History of Bridge Engineering by Henry Grattan Tyrrell , C.E. , of which the following represents a short summary : " The suspension bridge was used in remote ages in China , Japan , India , Tibet , and by the Dyaks of Borneo , the Aztecs of Mexico , and the natives of Peru and other parts of South America . In all early forrps the platforms were supported directly on the cables , which consisted of twisted vines or straps of hide drawn tightly to remove floor sag , the cable ends being fastened to trees or other permanent objects on shore . " Light bridges of this kind , requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Peru and in parts of China , India and Ireland . Definite information relating to the early history of bridges in China is lacking , but enough is known to prove that suspensions were used in that country in very remote times . The first one of which the date is given was built A.D. 65 by 115 THE ROEBLINGS order of Emperor Ming , in the province of Yunnan , and as described by Kirchen was 33o feet long , with a plank floor resting on chains . Iron chains were used for suspensions in Japan , five hundred years ago or more , at a period when iron was very valuable , and some of these are said to be still in use . Iron suspension bridges were used in Europe as early as 1615 and several are reported in Switzerland in 165o and in Italy in 1742 . " The first suspension bridge in England ( 1741 ) crossed a chasm 6o feet deep and the River Tees near the High Force , two miles from Middleton . Suspension bridges were used in America before any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern type , with horizontal suspended floor , appearing at the beginning of the nineteenth century . Those previous to IS o were chiefly the work of James Finley , a native of Fayette County , Pennsylvania , whose first bridge in 1801 over Jacob 's Creek on the turnpike between Uniontown and Greensburg had a span of 7o feet . As the Greensburg bridge was a success , many others were made like it , and the type became the most approved form in the first half of the nineteenth century . The Greensburg bridge had two iron chains , one on each side , with links of the proper length to suit the distance between the suspended floor joist . The chains had a sag of 10 feet , or one-seventh of the span , and passed over masonry towers , with the same angle of inclination on each side , being bolted to four large anchor stones on shore . The suspended wood floor was 12 1/2 feet wide without any stiffening trusses , the whole costing when finished about $600 . Eight similar ones are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prior to 1808 , when patents were granted to Mr. Finley on his designs . " 116 // THE FIRST WIRE SUSPENSION BRIDGE The first suspension bridge in which wire was the supporting material was built by White and Hazard over the Schuylkill River at Fairmount in 1816 . This firm owned and operated a wire mill . The cables used were made of six 3/8-inch wires . The bridge had a single span of 408 feet and a passage way of only 18 inches . Notably this was the first wire suspension bridge in any country , all those in Europe being of a later day . This bridge collapsed under a weight of snow and ice the same year it was built . The first wire suspension bridges on the continent of Europe were introduced about 182o , one of these being at Geneva over the Fosse , completed in 1823 . Charles Ellet , regarded as one of the leading bridge engineers in America , in 1842 built a wire suspension bridge over the Schuylkill River at Fairmount , Philadelphia , which remained in use until 1872 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by wire cables , five at each side , and had a clear width of 25 feet . ROEBLING , THE FIRST TO BUILD A RAILWAY SUSPENSION BRIDGE John A. Roebling as will thus he seen was not the first to build wire-cable suspension bridges , though he was an early pioneer in the art and was further to perfect the process and add elements of strength , rigidity and longevity as his special contribution . He was , however , the first to construct a wirecable suspension bridge capable of bearing the weight of a moving locomotive and train . Long-span bridges of a thousand feet and over were also first successfully constructed by hint . In 1846-1849 Charles Ellet built a wire suspension bridge over the Ohio River at Wheeling , West Virginia , with a cent , 117 J THE ROEBLINGS tral opening of Iwo feet , which was , when completed , the longest span in the world . This bridge was seriously damaged by a tornado in 1854 , when the floor was turned over and all but two cables were broken at the anchorage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span center . John A. Roebling was called in to make the repairs , which he did successfully by uniting the separate strands on each side into solid cables and placing them farther apart at the towers than at the center , thus rendering the bridge more rigid against the wind pressure . Mr. Tyrrell in his book History of Bridge Engineering previously referred to , thus describes the difference in the methods employed by Ellet and Roebling : " Mr. Filet used wires in separate strands side by side , with iron bars fastened across them from which the suspenders hung , while Mr. Roebling used wire cables in cylindrical form enclosed and wrapped with light wire to protect them from the weather . In his system the suspenders hung from clamps surrounding the cables , which were generally in planes sloping at an angle from the vertical , with systems of auxiliary stay cables radiating from the towers to successive panel points of the floor system . The stays added stiffness to the floor and relieved the main cables of much load , but the distribution of load on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afterwards abandoned . " // As early as 1844 , the project was mooted of building a suspension bridge over the gorge at Niagara . In 1846 , Charles Ellet , John A. Roebling , and other eminent engineers were asked to report upon the feasibility and cost of such a bridge , and all reported favorably . Charles Ellet was the successful 118 J // competitor and a contract was awarded to him in 1847 to build the proposed bridge . It was to cost $190,000 , to have a span of 800 feet and two 7/-foot roadways , two 4-foot sidewalks and a railway track in the center . As a preliminary operation Mr. Ellet built a foot bridge 7/ feet wide to carry material and supplies for use on the main structure . The main bridge was never finished , at least by Mr. Ellet , who had a controversy with the bridge authorities and withdrew from the work in 1849 . The bridge company then chose Mr. Roebling as the engineer , and the bridge , the first railway suspension in the world , was completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author of Lives and Works of Civil and Military Engineers , wrote to Mr. Roebling in 1846 , requesting his opinion as to the feasibility of constructing a railroad suspension bridge over the Niagara River below the Falls . Under date of January 7 , 1847 , Mr. Roebling wrote his reply which was afterwards published in Mr. Stuart 's book in the sketch of Mr. Roebling 's life appearing there , and is here given as showing the principles in accordance with which he contemplated the task : " I have bestowed some time upon this subject since the receipt of your letter , and have matured plans and working details . Although the question of applying the principle of suspension to railroad bridges has been disposed of in the negative by Mr. Robert Stephenson , when discussing the plan of the Britannia Bridge over the Menai , on the Chester and Holyhead Railway , I am bold enough to say that this celebrated engineer has not at all succeeded in the solution of this problem . That a suspension bridge can be built to answer for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only intended for common travel , but with some additional expense could be made stiff enough ( it is strong enough ) for railroad trains at 119 J THE ROEBLINGS a moderate rate of speed . Castings of ten tons weight , suspended to two pairs of large timber wheels , have lately been hauled over this bridge ; the six-horse coal trains which pass over it hourly weigh several tons . " It can not be questioned that wire cables , when well made , offer the safest and most economical means for the support of heavy weights . Any span within fifteen hundred feet , with the usual deflection , can be made perfectly safe for the support of railway trains as well as common travel . " The greater the weight to be supported , the stronger the cables must be , and as this is a matter of unerring calculation , there need be no difficulty on the score of strength . The only question which presents itself is ; Can a suspension bridge be made stiff enough , so as not to yield and bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it ; and can the great vibrations which result from the rapid motion of such trains and which prove so destructive to common bridges , be avoided and counteracted ? " I answer this question in the affirmative , and maintain that wire-cable bridges , properly constructed , will be found hereafter the most durable and cheapest railroad bridges for spans over one hundred feet . " There is not one good suspension bridge in Great Britain , nor will they ever succeed as long as they remain attached to their chains and present mode of superstructure . " The larger the span , the stiffer it can be made , on account of its great weight , which is necessary to insure stability . To obtain the greatest degree of stiffness , all the timber applied , should , as much as possible , be disposed in the direction of the floors ; truss frames , when made , are useful , but need not be applied to a great extent . To counteract the pliability of a cable , stays must be applied , by which a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspond with the knots of vibration , are rendered stationary , and so that the stays and cables act in concert in supporting the bridge . " The locality of the Niagara Bridge offers the very best opportunity for the application of a system of stays , which will insure all the stiffness requisite for the passage of railroad trains at a rapid rate . The plan I have devised for the structure will , I have no doubt , convince you at the first inspection that the rigidity of the structure will be ample . The strength of the cables I have based upon the following calculations : " Total weight of locomotive and train , two hundred and forty-five tons , the vertical impact of which , when moving at a speed of about twenty miles per hour , will not be less than four hundred tons ; to this we have to add the weight of a number of teams which may happen to be on the bridge at the same time a train is passing ; also for a foot of snow which may happen to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight , and allowing no less than five times the strength of wire which would barely support the tension resulting from these pressures , for the strength of the cables and stays , we will be found altogether on the safe side ; and by securing the cables against all chances of rusting , and preserving all the timber parts of the structure , we will be able to put up a bridge which will last for ages , and offer at all times a safe passage for railroad trains as well as common travel . " The author of the book referred to adds the following : " Mr. Roebling manifested his confidence in the success of the enterprise by an offer to construct the bridge on the fore-going principles , with two tracks for common travel , two footwalks , and one railroad track , within fifteen months , for the sum of $180,000 , subscribe $20,000 to the capital stock , and 121 THE ROEBLINGS give security for the complete success of the work in all its parts . " As previously observed , this bridge was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Ellet . But in 1851 work was begun by Mr. Roebling on a larger and more expensive bridge , which was substituted for it . This was the bridge which first brought Mr. Roebling his great fame , for he proved , against the almost unanimous opinion of engineers in America and Europe , the truth of his contention that a railway suspension was an entirely practical affair . The following account is taken from History of Bridge Engineering : // " The Niagara bridge had a span of 825 feet and two decks , the lower one carrying a highway 15 feet wide , partially enclosed at the side by timber stiffening trusses . The upper deck , 24 feet wide and 245 feet above high water , had a single track in the center and was floored over , separating it from the floor below . The floors were suspended at intervals of 5 feet from the upper and lower cables , the deflection of the lower ones being 10 feet more than the upper . There were four cables 10 1/4 inches in diameter , containing 520 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires of Mr. Ellet 's old foot bridge being incorporated with the others . The masonry towers were 6o feet high above the road , 15 feet square at the base and 8 feet square at the top , and the bridge was braced laterally against wind pressure by 58 wire guy ropes 1% inch diameter , fastened to rocks below , the guys detracting considerably from its appearance . " The bridge was commenced in September 1852 , and completed in 1854 , at a cost of $400,000 . After forty years of 122 // service the bridge was replaced in 1897 by the present steel arch , with a span of 55o feet . The Niagara Bridge has been the only railway suspension bridge in the world that has stood the test of time , the one in Vienna being used for only a short period . The bridge lasted forty-two years and was taken down , not because it was inefficient , but because the heavier railroad trains required a bridge of different construction . When the bridge was taken apart , the wire cables manufactured by Roebling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when originally put into their places . The strain of forty-two years had not hurt them . A " Memoir of The Niagara Falls and International Suspension Bridge , " written by John A. Roebling , C.E. , in 1855 , constitutes the final report of the engineer to the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge Company . In this report Mr. Roebling sets forth in technical detail the methods of construction used and the quality and strength of the materials . He considers the effects of heavy loads , of temperature , and of high winds as related to the safety and permanency of the work . He notes an interesting point to the effect that the trotting of horses or cattle or the marching of men put a greater strain upon the bridge than the passage of a railway train . " I will state here that in my opinion a heavy train running at a speed of twenty miles an hour , does less injury to the structure than is caused by twenty heavy cattle under a full trot . Public processions marching to the sound of music , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more injurious effect . No bridge constructed without regard to stability will long resist such tests . " In addition to the usual inspection by the bridge authorities the contract required that the completed work should be ex123 J THE ROEBLINGS amined and passed upon by the government engineer of the Province of Canada . Under date April 3o , 18S5 , Department of Public Works , Quebec , the assistant commissioner of that body , Hamilton H. Killaly , reported to the president and directors of the Niagara Suspension Bridge Companies that " having had repeated opportunities during the course of its construction of judging and observing the careful and scientific attention given to it in all its details . . . I do not require any further proof to satisfy me of its stability and sufficiency for the purpose for which it is designed . . . . The ingenious and talented calculations made of its strength , etc. , by Mr. Roebling to which I have had access , convince me fully , that with due care in the maintenance of it , it will be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and construction of which reflect the highest professional honor on that gentleman . " A method designed by Mr. Roebling to prevent corrosion of the wire cables similar to the process in use by the Roeblings at the present time is thus described : " Heretofore it had been the practice to lay each wire separately , until the number required for the cable was placed , and to hold them together by bands or coils of wire , placed at short distances apart . Mr. Roebling invented and used for this bridge a machine for winding the cables with small wire from end to end , in a manner that protects them from the action of the atmosphere and binds them , in a degree , into a solid mass . " AN UNFINISHED BRIDGE Simultaneously with the progress of the Niagara Bridge , another railway suspension bridge was commenced by Mr. Roebling over the Kentucky River on the projected line of the Lexington and Southern Kentucky Railroad . The gorge to be // crossed here was both wider and deeper than that at Niagara , requiring a span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone towers erected , and most of the cable wire and other material for the superstructure delivered at the site , when , the company becoming financially embarrassed , the work was suspended and has not since been resumed . In this bridge no carriageway was designed , and the plan of the structure was essentially different from that of the Niagara Bridge . THE CINCINNATI-COVINGTON BRIDGE In 1846 Mr. Roebling devised plans for a suspension bridge over the Ohio River between Cincinnati and Covington , but the completion of the bridge was delayed , first by the lack of funds and subsequently by the outbreak of the Civil War . The work was resumed but with different plans in 1863 and finally completed in 1867 . In his final report made to the bridge company in 1867 , Mr. Roebling noted : " At the lowest stage of water the Ohio River , between Cincinnati and Covington , has a width of about 1000 feet . By the charter of the Company the position of the towers was fixed at low-water mark , so that the middle span should present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . In the spring of the year 1832 the river rose sixty-two feet above low water . At this stage the width of waterway is over 2000 feet . With the exception of the towers , the whole waterway between the two cities is left unobstructed , a width of 1619 feet . The two small spans left open between the abutments and towers are each 281 feet , from face to center of towers . From an engineering point of view , this division of spans is not the most economical . The cheapest arrangement would have been one center span of Boo feet , and two half spans of 400 feet each . 125 THE ROEBLINGS But that plan had been forestalled by previous legislation . One of the early charters decreed one single span of 1400 feet in the clear . But this very great and expensive span was afterwards allowed to be reduced to 1000 feet , and with this amendment the foundations were commenced in 1856 . " Owing to the persistent opposition of property owners , steamboat and ferry interests , the clear elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the river span had been fixed at 122 feet . By a later enactment , this height was reduced to 100 feet . As the bridge stands now , its elevation is 103 feet in the clear above low-water mark , at a medium temperature of sixty degrees , rising one foot by extreme cold and sinking one foot below this mark in extreme heat . The greatest ascent is only five feet in one hundred , at the Cincinnati approach , and this diminishes as the suspended floor is reached . " He follows with a technical description of the bridge , stressing the strength and stabi I ity of the construction and points out that with a small addition to the cost the bridge could have been made capable of bearing the weight of railway trains : " The floor of the bridge is formed of a strong wrought-iron frame , overlaid with several thicknesses of plank , and suspended to the two wire cables by means of suspenders attached every five feet , arranged between roadway and footpaths ; the latter seven feet wide , and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is twenty feet wide , forming two tracks of four lines of iron trams , on which the wheels run , each tram being fourteen inches wide , to accommodate all kinds of gauges . The whole width of the floor between the outside railings is thirty-six feet . No stays or other obstructions are put up below the floor , such as may be seen under the Niagara bridge . No such means to prevent the floor from rising was used in this work ; its security and stability are provided for by other ap 126 // pliances . The rock underneath the Niagara bridge afforded a very cheap mode of anchoring ; it would have been a great oversight on my part not to avail myself of under-floor stays in such a favorable locality . But in the Ohio River no such appendages were admissible . " The general plan which I have always pursued in my works insures , by the heavy contraction of the cables in the center of the span , great lateral stability at this point . The larger and heavier the span , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vertical stability in the center is also insured in large spans by the weight of the structure . But not so between the center and the towers . In consequence of the equilibrating tendency of the two opposite halves , vertical oscillations occur easier , and the great length of suspenders , acting like pendulums , promotes lateral displacements . These tendencies have to be met , and are thoroughly overcome in the Ohio bridge by an effective system of stays . The very careless manner in which stays have been attempted heretofore is a violation of the principle involved . Their arrangement in this bridge not only insures their own freedom from oscillation , but renders them fully effective by the uninterrupted preservation of their lines . " Aside from simply stiffening the floor , the stays are rendering another and very important service ; they effectually insure equilibrium between the main and half spans . Without stays the balance between adjoining spans would sometimes be greatly disturbed by unequal loads . The large crowds of many thousands of people which frequently cover the floor from one end to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never produced the slightest injurious effect upon the statical condition of this work . " I le adds : " Great doubts are yet entertained by many engineers , par127 J THE ROEBLINGS ticularly in Europe , in regard to the fitness and safety of suspension bridges for railway purposes . By an additional expenditure of $50,000 and a railroad track laid down in the center of the floor , the Ohio bridge could have been made serviceable for the passage of locomotives and trains at the highest speed . Let any person who doubts this , observe the very slight tremor which is produced in this bridge by a long line of heavily loaded teams , frequently ten in a row , and he will readily understand that but a small addition of rigidity is wanted in order to pass railroad trains . " DIMENSIONS OF CINCINNATI-COVINGTON BRIDGE The principal dimensions of this bridge are : Main span , from center to center of towers , 1,057 feet . Side spans , from abutment to center of tower , 281 feet . Total length between abutments , 1,619 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 91 feet . Elevation of floor above low water at center , 103 feet .

The removal of the old structure and construction of the new permanent work , including the building of the three new piers and two anchorages , required three years , from 1857 to 186o . The total length of this bridge is 1,030 feet , divided into two spans of 344 feet each , and two side spans of 171 feet each . The floor has a width of 40 feet , including two sidewalks , to feet wide . The framework of the superstructure is composed essentially of iron girders , with a flooring of wood . Ornamental open towers of cast iron support the cables , which are four in number , two of 7 inches in diameter , attached to the floor between the sidewalks and carriageway , and two of 4 inches in diameter , attached to the ends of the floor beams ; in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays . A TRIBUTE TO ROEBLING 'S SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE Mr. Charles B. Stuart , in his book previously quoted from , pays the following tribute to Mr. Roebling 's scientific knowledge and the accuracy of his reasoning : " Mr. Roebling 's reasoning was always clear , simple , and explicit , and sustained by philosophical and scientific facts . 1 le took nothing for granted . His arguments were drawn from his store of scientific knowledge , with a mathematical accuracy and fitness that carried with them a conviction of truth . He was impatient at captious opposition to his projects , but always courted a discussion of his plans by those who brought sound theoretical or practical opposition to his views . In a report mule by him for a suspension bridge at Cincinnati as early as 129 J THE ROEBLINGS 1846 , and to which there was much opposition from those interested in river navigation , he says in effect : I have no fears of those who honestly believe the bridge to be injurious to the navigation ; the opposition of cavillers I most dread .

Roebling. 130 J CHAPTER VII // Tragic Death of John A. Roebling , 1869 ? Resume of Professional and Business Achievements As FAR back as the beginning of the last century the project to connect the city of New York with the opposite shore of Long Island by a bridge engaged a measure of public attention . A recent writer in the New York Times has been at pains to collect some references bearing upon the matter . He quotes General Jeremiah Johnson , writing in his notebook previous to 1800 , as stating his conviction that the idea of spanning the East River was a practical scheme . His words are : " It has been suggested that a bridge be constructed across the East River to New York . This idea has been treated as chimerical from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their serious consideration will find more weight in the practicability of the scheme than at first sight he imagined . A plan has already been laid down on paper , and a gentleman of acknowledged ability and good sense has observed that he would engage to erect it in two years ' time . " The Times writer also mentions in his article Thomas Pope , writing about 1811 , " as favorably inclined to the idea , " and General Joseph G. Swift in 1836 as making the bold suggestion that " a dike be built instead of a bridge . " He quotes Prime , the New York historian , as observing about the middle of the 1840 's that " the erection of a bridge between New York and Brooklyn had become the great topic of conversation , " but , contemplating the good ferry service at that time , he wondered 131 THE ROEBLINGS " who would think of crossing on a bridge if one stood in his way . " John A. Roebling 's thoughts were directed to the project certainly as early as 1853 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to spend several uncomfortable hours on a ferry boat in a winter day of that year when the river was choked with ice . ROEBLING THE FIRST TO SUGGEST THE FEASIBILITY // Under date June 19 , 1857 , Mr. Roebling addressed a letter to Abram S. Hewitt on the subject , to which letter Mr. Hewitt called attention in the course of the speech which he made on the occasion of the ceremonies held in connection with the opening of the bridge , May 24 , 1883 . The speaker observed that , so far as he was aware , " Mr. Roebling was the first engineer to suggest the feasibility of a bridge between the two cities , so constructed as to preserve unimpaired the freedom of navigation . . . . This letter , " he declared , " was the first step towards the construction of the work , which , however , came about in a manner different from his Roebling 's expectations and was finally completed on a plan more extensive than he had ventured to describe . " He added that : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ideas were limited to the demands of the time and controlled by the necessity for a profitable investment . He had no expectation that the two cities would embark in the enterprise . Indeed , in one of his letters so late as April 14 , 186o , he says : As to the corporations of New York and Brooklyn undertaking the job , no such hope may be entertained in our time . ' " Mr. Hewitt sent the letter of 1857 for publication to the Journal of Commerce where it subsequently appeared , and as he observed , " it attracted great 132 J // attention because it came from an engineer who had already demonstrated by successfully building suspension bridges that he spoke with the voice of experience and authority . " The initiative looking to the construction of a bridge originated not in New York City , nor from official sources , but in Brooklyn and from a private association of citizens of that city , of whom the leader was William C. Kingsley , who , as far back as 1865 , had conceived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the scheme was feasible , had succeeded in interesting others in it . A strong impetus was given to the enterprise by the arctic conditions prevailing in the East River during the memorable winter of 1866-1867 . There were days during that period when the river was so choked with ice that passengers by rail from Albany completed their journey to New York in less time than it took the unhappy voyagers by ferry boat from Brooklyn to reach their destination in Manhattan . Thus a popular and vehement demand for the immediate construction of a bridge spontaneously arose and the newspapers took up the matter and added their approval to the enterprise . // Application for a charter of a corporation of private citizens , empowered to raise the funds and erect the bridge , was made to the New York Legislature and on April 16 , 1867 , an act was passed incorporating The New York Bridge Company and giving authority to build a bridge over the East River between the cities of New York and Brooklyn . Parenthetically , it may be stated that , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public work of such magnitude could not be satisfactorily left in the hands of a private corporation and therefore an act was passed by the Legis133 THE ROEBLINGS lature seven years later , June 4 , 1874 , making the bridge a publicly owned enterprise , the whole cost to be defrayed by the two cities , Brooklyn paying two-thirds of the cost and New York one-third . The original money invested by private parties was returned to them and their title was extinguished . The same engineers were retained and also the chief working numbers of the directory , so the work remained a unit from first to last . The charter of 1867 fixed the Brooklyn terminus at the junction of Main and Fulton Streets , but allowed the New York terminus to be at or below Chatham Square , though not south of the junction of Chatham and Nassau Streets . The charter originally and provisionally fixed the capital at $5,000,000 , with power to increase the amount , and gave the cities of New York and Brooklyn authority to subscribe to the capital stock of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was then felt that this joining of public with private capital was a wise provision since it would be a double guarantee that the enterprise would be effectively carried on , since neither public nor private capital alone could be depended upon to carry the work forward upon safe and economical lines . One interest would serve as a check to the other and above all the men who had invested their own money would be zealous to see that political corruption had no opportunity to do its evil work . // On the organization of the company in May 1867 , one month after its incorporation had been effected , John A. Roebling was appointed chief engineer , May 23 , 1867 . At that time Mr. Roebling had about completed the Cincinnati-Covington Bridge which up to then was the longest suspension bridge in the United States . The fame of the engineer was now at its 134 J // zenith and he was universally regarded as the foremost exponent of wire-cable suspension bridges in America , if not in the world . The company therefore felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In September of the same year , an incredibly short space of time for the work involved , he presented the preliminary plans , surveys and estimates . His original estimate of the cost of the structure was $7,000,000 , exclusive of the land required for the approaches , and he placed the time necessary for building the bridge as five years . In his original plan and estimate Mr. Roebling contemplated approaches . constructed of light iron girders , or trestle work supported by pillars of brick or stone , but as later agreed upon it was concluded to build entirely of granite and brick , and to provide a series of masonry archways with a view to their being rented as warehouses . This , of course , increased the expense . Mr. Roebling claimed that the cost of these improvements should not be charged against the bridge and it was accordingly omitted by him . Additional expenses were subsequently incurred in building the stations at both terminals to provide for passengers on the elevated railway structures and for sundry preliminary costs connected with general superintendence , for interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other incidental disbursements . Moreover , the failure of the City of New York to provide promptly its proportion of the necessary funds added an enormous increase to the total cost which it is difficult to estimate . In the speech of Mr. Hewitt , previously quoted from , he touched upon the ultimate cost of the bridge and declared that the popular impression that through political thievery the cost had far exceeded the original estimates was wholly unfounded : " I know that to many I make a startling announcement when I state the incontrovertible fact that no money was ever 135 J THE ROEBLINGS stolen from the funds of the bridge ; that the whole has been honestly expended ; that the estimates for construction have not been materially exceeded ; and that the excess of costs over the estimates is due to the purchase of lands which were never included in the estimates ; to interest paid on the city 's subscriptions ; to the cost of additional height and breadth of the bridge ; and the increase of strength rendered necessary by a better comprehension of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by the original estimate of S7,000,000 have thus been raised to S9,000,000 , so that S2,000,000 represents the addition to the original estimates . " He concludes : " The statement I have made is due to the memory not only of John A. Roebling but also to Henry C. Murphy , that great man who devoted his last years to this enterprise ; and who , having like Moses led the people through the toilsome way , was permitted only to look , but not to enter upon the promised land . This testimony is due also to the living trustees and to the engineers who have controlled and directed this large expenditure in the public service . " In regard to the ring of corrupt officials which dominated the City of New York about this period , Mr. Hewitt declared that : " The government fell into the hands of a band of thieves , who engaged in a series of great and beneficial public works , not for the good they might do , but for the opportunity which they would afford to rob the public treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ring was driven into exile by the force of public indignation . . . . The collapse of the Ring brought the work on the bridge to a standstill . It was a timely event . The patriotic New Yorker might well have exclaimed , just before the great deliverance , in the words of the Consul of ancient Rome in Macaulay 's stirring poem : 136 // " And if they once may win the bridge , What hope to save the town ? " A BOARD OF CONSULTING ENGINEERS APPOINTED AT ROEBLING 'S SUGGESTION After Mr. Roebling 's preliminary report of 1867 had been accepted by the bridge trustees and he was ordered to proceed with the work , at his own instance and with the approval of the trustees , a board of consulting engineers , composed of some of the most eminent men in their profession , was appointed in March 1869 , to go over the plans and render judgment upon them . The board made its report in May of that year , stating that they had been informed by Mr. Roebling , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large interests connected therewith , in the Cities of New York and Brooklyn , he had suggested to the directors that it was right and proper , before going forward with the work , that his plans should be subjected to the careful scrutiny of a board of engineers , convened for the purpose , in order that , if his plans received their approval , the enterprise would stand before the public sustained by their professional judgment and would not rest solely on the judgment of one single engineer . " The board reported that " they had completely examined the plans and the investigations of the combinations and proportions proposed for the service required , and had deemed it an appropriate part of their duty to examine the structures of the same general character erected by Mr. Roebling , across the Monongahela and Allegheny at Pittsburgh in 1846 and 1854 ( 1859 ) and the Niagara , at Niagara Falls in 1854 , and across the Ohio at Cincinnati in 1867 . They had thus had under their eye and personal examination the successive steps , which , beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed G 137 THE ROEBLINGS by a span of 822 feet in 1854 and by a span of 1057 feet in 1867 , all standing this day , a practical demonstration of the soundness of the principles and proportions on which these structures have been erected and rendering unnecessary , at least for spans of loon feet , any other demonstration , and affording the best source of information as to the practicability of taking another step in a span of 1600 feet . " Their conclusion was " that it is beyond doubt entirely practicable to erect a steel wire suspension bridge of 1600 feet span , 135 feet elevation across the East River , in accordance with the plans of Mr. Roebling and that such structure will have all the strength and durability that should attend the permanent connection by a bridge of the Cities of New York and Brooklyn . " The report closes with some references to technical points and suggestions as to the precautions necessary to be taken to preserve the durability of the material used . A commission of three United States Army engineers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work and particularly as to whether or not the bridge would be an obstruction to navigation , and they made the single requirement that the height of the bridge at the center above high water should be increased by five feet , that is , from 130 feet to 135 feet . Probably seldom or never in a public work of such magnitude have the recognized experts so unanimously approved the plans exactly as they had issued from the mind of the one man selected to carry them to completion . Professional jealousy , if not the mere desire to display the possession of a critical faculty , commonly intervenes to prevent complete endorsement . 138 J // SUDDEN DEATH OF JOHN A. ROEBLING , 1869 Thus the plans for the bridge were perfected , accepted and approved in the spring of 1869 , the preliminary surveys had been made and the actual work was about to begin , when the sudden death of John A. Roebling in July of that year brought his connection with the enterprise to a tragic conclusion . Henceforth the history of the Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son and successor , Washington A. Roebling under whose name the subsequent history of the bridge will be continued . As the initiative in this great work resulted in the death of the father so likewise its continuance was responsible for the permanent disablement of the son . In fatal succession both fell victims to the intense zeal and devotion which alike animated them in the pursuance of a project which had enlisted the full energies of their manhood . The accident which resulted in the death of Mr. Roebling occurred on June 28 , 1869 . He was engaged at the time in taking observations for the projected bridge across the East River , at a point on the Brooklyn side where a double row of piles run along the river front . The front row was surmounted by a plank which lapped over when pressed against . Mr. Roebling was standing on the back row and was so much engrossed in his work that he did not notice a boat approaching . When the boat touched , the front piles were pushed back and Mr. Roebling 's foot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken to the house occupied by his son Washington A. Roebling who was then living at 137 Hicks Street , Brooklyn , so that he could 1w in close proximity to his work . The symptoms were not at ? first alarming , but tetanus afterwards set in with fatal effect and lie died on Thursday , July 22 , at about 6 o'clock a.m . Even on his death-bed his inventive mind was still at work . G 139 J THE ROEBLINGS by proposing to carry new highways across rivers upon bridges , the like of which had not been known before . " There arose about him a chorus of protest , voiced by engineers more eminent than he , who denounced his plan as visionary and impracticable . With courage undaunted , a persistence not to be repelled , he insisted that he had discovered a principle of mechanics worthy of acceptance , and silenced his critics by building those great bridges which stand as beautiful and imposing monuments to his memory . " Thirty-nine years after the death of John A. Roebling a bronze monument was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The funds were contributed by popular subscription , supplemented by contributions from his sons . The ceremonies connected with the unveiling of the monument were held June 30 , 19o8 , and were attended by over fifteen thousand people , among whom were the Governor of New Jersey , the two United States Senators and other distinguished guests . Throughout the city there was a general display of flags and the occasion was officially recognized by the closing of the City Hall and Court House at noon , and the attendance in a body of the city and county officials . The City of Muhlhausen , Germany , where Mr. Roebling was born , sent an artistic bronze wreath in honor of the memory of its famous son . Addresses were made by the Hon. Edward C. Stokes , former Governor of New Jersey , and Henry D. Estabrook of New York , general counsel of the Western Union Telegraph Company , whose daughter Blanche was the wife of Karl G.

The Roebling Press subsequently published a full account 142 J // of the proceedings with the text of the speeches made on the occasion , supplemented by extracts from newspaper comments made at the time . The monument was unveiled by Miss Emily Roebling , afterwards Mrs. Richard McCall Cadwalader , eldest daughter of Charles G. Roebling . The inscription on the face of the monument reads : TO JOHN A. ROEBLING , CIVIL ENGINEER DESIGNER AND BUILDER OF MANY SUSPENSION BRIDGES FOUNDER OF TRENTON 'S GREATEST INDUSTRY AN ENERGETIC WORKER , INVENTOR AND MAN OF AFFAIRS DEVOTED TO HIS ADOPTED COUNTRY IN WHOSE PROGRESS HE HAD UNSWERVING FAITH A PATRON OF ART AND SCIENCES AND BENEFACTOR OF MANKIND THIS MONUMENT IS ERECTED BY THE CITIZENS OF TRENTON // THE ROEBLING MONUMENT The monument has a total height of I 5 feet 7 inches . This is exclusive of the concrete base , which is built 4 feet 6 inches underground . The stonework supporting the statue is 9 feet high and the statue measures 6 feet 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had it been cast in a standing posture , it would have reached a height of exactly 8 feet . The statue is made of bronze , cast from a clay model designed by William Couper , the sculptor . The pedestal is built of red Swedish granite . On the right side of this granite pedestal is a bronze panel containing a reproduction in relief of the first railroad suspen 143 THE ROEBLINGS sion bridge built over the Niagara . On the left side is another panel containing a replica , also in relief , of the Brooklyn Bridge , designed by Mr. Roebling . Commenting on the statue and extolling its life-likeness , the orator of the day , Mr. Estabrook , in his opening remarks said : " I am expected by those having these ceremonies in charge to translate into words what the sculptor has so admirably expressed in bronze , namely the type and quality , the idiosyncrasy of your famous fellow townsman . But words are too plastic for such a task . As if his nature had been subdued to what it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iron . Iron was in his blood , and sometimes entered his very soul ; a man of iron with the virtues of iron and peccancies of iron to his account , and John A. Roebling as he was , as you knew him , head bared to the blows of fortune , or the storms of heaven , eyes fixed unwaveringly on whatever object he had in hand , poised , confident , unyielding , imperious and proud ? John A. Roebling is there ? seated forever on yonder pedestal . " John A. Roebling was a rich man when he died , a very rich man for those days . His total estate was valued at about $1,200,000 , by far the most of it accumulated in the last twenty years of his life . He left the business to his four sons and requested them to continue it under the firm name " John A. Roebling 's Sons , " and such it has remained to this day .

JOHN A. ROEBLING 'S WILL AND BENEFACTIONS His will , which is an interesting and characteristic document , was made i ; n 1867 . To his four sons , Washington A. , Ferdinand W. , Charles G. , and Edmund , the two latter being minors at the time , he left the factory buildings , fixtures and machinery together with the land they occupied to hold as equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $15o,000 . After the payment of legacies to certain charitable institutions and relatives , including the sum of $20,000 to his faithful superintendent Charles Swan ? the whole amounting to over $1 oo , 000 ? he bequeathed to each of his seven children by his first wife , and to his second wife Lucia W. Roebling , nee Cooper , whom he had married in 1867 , one-eighth of the residue of his personal estate , deducting however from each child 's , care the money respectively advanced to them in his lifetime , and from his sons ' shares the value of the industrial plant of which they came in possession . Mr. Roebling 's private ledger shows that he had kept an exact account of the expenditures made on behalf of his chil 145 J THE ROEBLINGS " Much progress was made during the twenty years of Swan 's administration . A rolling mill was built next to the canal , so as to roll our own rods from Swedish iron bars , which had been previously rolled by Cooper &; Hewitt . This was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New boilers were put in and anthracite coal used in the heating furnace . The wire mill was enlarged , a double annealing pot devised by John A. Roebling . It was not until 1862 that the rope walk was permanently abandoned . But before that time Mr. Roebling had designed vertical strand machines and vertical rope-laying machines which were erected in the building now known as the old rope shop . Some of these machines are still in use , about as good as new . A horizontal fast-running Smith ' strand machine which I had brought over from England was , however , frowned upon by John A. Roebling on the ground that it weakened and injured the wire . After he died this was one of the first things done . " Much experimenting was carried on in the direction of cleaning , annealing and preparing wire for drawing . One of the great discoveries consisted in avoiding brittleness of freshdrawn wire , which heretofore had to lie in storage for six months up aloft before it became fit for use . A London chemist had discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scale had been eaten off by dilute sulphuric acid . Then someone else discovered that by baking the wire at a temperature of 700 degrees in a sort of bake-oven all the hydrogen was driven out in twenty-four hours and the wire lost its brittleness . A further progress consisted in mixing muriatic acid with the vitriol , the latter only a third or fourth part , so that the amount of occluded hydrogen was very much reduced . Attempts to use alkalies for cleaning failed . Overman tried that in 1851. 148 J // " Mr. Swan 's duties constantly increased , being further complicated by having to attend to bookkeeping , signing checks , etc . He also built the new house , now occupied as an office ( after John A. Roebling 's plans ) ? occupied in 1856 . When the building , then called the rope shop , was filled with machinery , Mr. Roebling said it was no longer necessary to build more machinery and that the factory was big enough for all business . How much he was mistaken is shown by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its great career ? it depended for success on a flexible wire rope . Attempts were made to make them on the rope walk , but the wire was too fine and it failed . That required fast-running small machinery . Its immense expansion was not dreamed of at that time . We could not even draw the wire ? there was not a small wire block on the place . All that had to be learned . " Such was the situation when John A. Roebling died in 1869 . Charles was still at Troy , and Ferdinand and Swan were running the business , with my occasional help . Ferdinand had been in the office several years looking after the correspondence , orders and driving Swan , who was getting old and conservative . The work was getting too much for him . He was rather glad when the new force arrived . But Swan had grown up with John A. and not with these younger men . It was not long before a little friction developed and it grew and grew . It was not exactly jealousy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This state of affairs lasted some time . After three years of it Swan left suddenly ; he could not stand it any longer . His health was breaking ; a few years later he retired permanently . Had all this occurred today he would have been pensioned off earlier in recognition of his long and valuable services . " C 149 J THE ROEBLINGS As a matter of fact Swan , soon after John A. Roebling 's death , for reasons given above by the Colonel , severed his connection with the firm , but after an interval was persuaded to return , the brothers finding that his knowledge and experience at that time were essential to the successful progress of the industry . Favorable terms were offered him and he accordingly resumed his old place as superintendent . After his retirement he continued to live in Trenton in the enjoyment of his well earned leisure . He died in Trenton on January 28 , 1897 , in the seventy-fifth year of his age . He left one son , Charles Henry Swan , who married a daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the owner of Bloomsbury Court , the mansion built in 1719 by William Trent , for whom the city was named , and the oldest building standing in Trenton today . Quite recently his son , Edward Ansley Stokes , made a gift of this property to the city , which it is proposed to use as a branch library . A grandson of the original Charles Swan and a son of Charles Henry , Charles Edward Swan , is now a business man in Trenton . ATTITUDE OF EMPLOYEES TO COMPANY Perhaps it may here be noted that the Roeblings seem to possess the faculty of retaining the services of their capable employees for long periods . There would appear to have grown up an esprit de corps among the chief workers , clerical and mechanical , that binds them into a loyal group , devoted to the company 's interests . It is not perhaps that the scale of compensation is higher for the same class of work than in similar establishments , but rather that there is a sentimental feeling , bordering on an affection for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , even when an opportunity presents itself to better their financial state . Under the 1 150 . J // patriarchal rule of John A. Roebling the skilled workers were regarded almost as members of his family and even in later days under his sons much the same spirit prevailed . There were and still are men in the Roebling employ who have served for thirty , forty and even fifty years . While the Roeblings have always observed the open shop they have never made any distinction between union and nonunion men . All were alike free to belong to any association they might elect . All the company asked was faithful service and no interference with the prerogatives of the company as their employer , nor any coercion exercised upon their fellow workmen . Naturally as the number of those employed in the course of years tended to run into thousands and embraced all nationalities , there have been some strikes , but as it came to be known that the company having once made what it regarded as a just decision would not withdraw from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been prolonged ones . A full list of the authorities relating to the Brooklyn Bridge will be found at the end of a subsequent chapter where the story of the bridge is continued . // REMINISCENCES OF BOYHOOD DAYS IN SAXONBURG IF COLONEL ROEBLING could have been persuaded to write his autobiography it would have resulted in a production of rare merit , for not only was his memory for persons and events of unusual clearness and accuracy , but whatever he wrote bore the impress of his strongly marked personality . In his case the style was the man . He wrote as he talked . He had a gift for racy description and his comments were always pertinent and characterized by a certain caustic , not to say sardonic , humor , and a native shrewdness of observation that were most illuminating . Moreover , his perfect candor , his tendency to use direct language , always to call a spade a spade , and not an agricultural implement , and never to permit his sympathies or his antipathies to distort his judgment or to claim for his achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not properly belong to them , proves that he could have written of himself with the same detachment from personal issues as he was wont to do in the case of others . Though his integrity never led him to lean over backwards , or to indulge in any semblance of false modesty depreciatory of his own achievements , he yet had no hesitation in admitting his own errors of judgment and in fitly characterizing them . Never hesitating to say precisely what he thought , whether of his friends or others , even to the verge of indiscretion , the Colonel had no spark of malice in him . Dealing always in freedom of speech , he never resented a like freedom in others . All these traits are well illustrated in his extended review of the E 155 THE ROEBLINGS life and achievements of his brother Charles , which is printed in a subsequent chapter . If the Colonel could have contemplated himself as the subject of a biography he would doubtless have observed in the spirit of Oliver Cromwell : " If you are going to paint me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purposes of this biography there have been preserved some reminiscences of his boyhood days in a monograph which he wrote in 1924 and which was subsequently printed under the title of Early History of Saxonburg and published by the Butler County Historical Society . The paper was originally read at a meeting of the society held in Saxonburg October 6 , 1924 , to commemorate the achievements of John A. Roebling , the founder of the settlement . Portions of this memoir have already been freely quoted from in a previous chapter in dealing with the early history of the elder Roebling . Washington Augustus Roebling , born in Saxonburg , Butler County , Pennsylvania , was the eldest son of John August Roebling and Johanna Herting Roebling . " My father , " wrote the Colonel , " married in 1836 the eldest daughter of Ernst Herting , who had arrived from Muhlhausen with his family two years before . I was born the following year ( May 26 , 1837 ) and baptized by the postmaster , Mr. Shilly , there being no preacher as yet ? have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his grandfather , Ernst Herting , is given in the Colonel 's reminiscences : " Ernst Herting came over in 1833 , giving up a good tailoring business in Muhlhausen to improve his fortune in the new world . Had a hard struggle the first few years . Built himself a substantial blockhouse on the corner of Main Street and 156 J BOYHOOD DAYS IN SAXONBURG Pittsburgh Road ? standing yet . He was my grandfather , my father having married the eldest daughter , Johanna , in 1836 . There were two more sisters . He also raised hops which were in demand . As might be expected , much of my early life was spent under the shelter of my grandmother 's roof . When work was slack grandfather would go to Pittsburgh ; he even went to Louisville for a year . Raised canaries as a side issue . In emergencies he took a hand at rope-making . The grandmother 's maiden name was Catherine Miller , hailing from Verden on the Aller . I spent half my early days at that interesting house . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along to Trenton . After three years he returned to Saxonburg to live in our old house . " N SPARTAN TRAINING The boy grew up in this primitive community , composed of newly arrived German colonists , who suffered the usual privations and hardships which fall to the lot of pioneers in an isolated place , where their own labor had to supply them with the necessities sufficing for a bare existence . There were few conveniences and no comforts , as we conceive them today . It was Spartan training for the boy and left its deep impress upon his character . Except Ferdinand , who was also born in Saxonburg in 1842 , and was thus only seven years old when in 1849 the family removed to the more comfortable precincts of Trenton , the other sons , Charles and Edmund , were born in that city at a time when comparative prosperity had come to the family and hence they were spared the rough experiences which were the lot of Washington and to a lesser extent of Ferdinand , who presumably was too young to remember much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Washington G 157J THE ROEBLINGS was always keenly alive to them and had a clear recollection of his early life with its experiences , agreeable and otherwise . From the time of his birth until the removal to Trenton his father was often away for long periods on his engineering projects , though after 1841 , when the making of wire rope began , his presence at home was more frequent . The lad when sufficiently grown began to take his full part in the operations of strand-making and wire-twisting , all by hand . " About eight men , " he writes , " were needed for strand-making , but sixteen or eighteen were required for laying up the rope . These were recruited from the village and adjacent farm ? quite a task ? in which I took my full share . The men were always glad to see me because it meant good pay and free meals for days . Work was from sunrise to sunset ? three meals , with a snack of bread and butter in between , including whiskey . Meals were served in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all done on an open hearth . The American cooking stove was just making its appearance . We did not get one until 1847 . " JULIUS RIEDEL , WASHINGTON 'S FIRST INSTRUCTOR His education in the rudiments began at an early date . In 1843 , when he was six years old , he was placed under the tutelage of a newly arrived immigrant , one Julius Riedel , who , from the Colonel 's account , must have been a man of considerable parts . Riedel in 1842 married Leonora , daughter of Ernst Herting , and a younger sister of Colonel Roebling 's mother . They had a son , Edmund Riedel , and thus a cousin , who subsequently became superintendent of the main rope shop in the Roebling works at Trenton , dying in that city in 1923 . Edmund and the Colonel strongly resembled each other in personal appearance , and the natural inference is that the Colonel G 158 J BOYHOOD DAYS IN SAXONBURG favored the maternal rather than the paternal side of the house . A son of Edmund is now also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riedel 's variegated career , taken from the reminiscences , will not be out of place at this point : " One day in 1843 a new character appeared on our front steps ? a short , stout man , with a rifle and shotgun slung over his back , a carpetbag in one hand and leading a hunting dog , Rolla by name , by the other . A huge pair of spectacles adorned his face . He had walked up from Freeport , was exhausted and done up . My father took him in and practically took care of him the rest of hits long life . Julius Riedel was his name . Having no profession or trade , it was hard to place him , so he was made a sort of tutor for me , teaching the three R 's in German . Later on he established a small German school and married my mother 's sister , raising ultimately a family of six , who all drifted to Trenton in course of time . Riedel was the son of a Lithuanian baron with a large family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field Marshal Blucher . At the time when Napoleon escaped from Elba and entered on his fatal Waterloo campaign , Julius was 16 . The father asked the Marshal to let Julius ride along with him , to which assent was given ; so Julius came to be near Waterloo , within sound of guns if not in the thick of the fight , and also entered Paris with the Allies , where he remained a while before returning home and commencing life over again , which was hard , as he had a splendid German education but no profession . ( There lived another Napoleonic veteran near Saxonburg whom I met occasionally , but being a French Alsatian he was looked down upon . ) Riedel 's early experiences made a great impression on my youthful mind . " In 1844 there was a vacancy in the church ? no preacher . It occurred to my father that Riedel could fill it ; so he was G 159 J THE ROEBLINGS installed at once . He was gifted with a good delivery , a wonderful sympathetic voice that moved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? young couples yearned for his services ; even the death-bed anticipated his consoling funeral orations . His sermons were taken from Heinrich Zschokkes 's Hours of Devotion , in seven volumes , which were better than he could write . No one , however , knew the catastrophe that was impending . One day a delegation arrived from the Lutheran Synod in Pittsburgh and demanded his removal on the ground that he was no preacher , not the graduate of a theological seminary , had no license to preach ; that the marriages that he had performed were illegal and must be performed over again ; likewise the baptisms ; but the dead could remain in their graves . The congregation was in dismay , finally gave in and bade a silent farewell to poor Riedel . They never had another preacher like him . After some time a place was found for him as teacher in Columbus , Ohio . When he departed with his little family I was dumped into the same wagon and dropped at Pittsburgh to live with a German teacher named Henne . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small terms of employment with my father , Riedel moved his family into our old house when we all departed for Trenton in 1849 . Thirty years later he came to Trenton . He died in Saxonburg in 1891 , at the advanced age of ninety-one . He had filled a large horizon in my early youth . At all times he was a strict adherent to German etiquette . No one could enter his room without taking off his hat and making a profound bow . It is the same in Germany at the present day ? the old spirit of caste . " The reminiscences also include a lively description of another friend and neighbor of early Saxonburg days , one Ferdi 16o BOYHOOD DAYS IN SAXONBURG nand Baehr , for whom , perhaps , John A. Roebling 's second son was named : FERDINAND BAEHR " Our immediate neighbor was Ferdinand Baehr , from Muhlhausen , expert mechanic and wool-carder , and well-to-do , who had sacrificed his home to strive for unknown benefits abroad . He built a larger house than ours and painted it pink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of seasickness . The mother never got over the shock . As a makeshift to hide his grief , Baehr took a great interest in me as a boy . I was his daily visitor . He had brought over fine books , beautifully illustrated , many knicknacks interesting to a child . He established some carding-machines adjoining the house , driven by a white horse , bought wool in quantities . ( In those days there were no stocks or bonds to invest in . ) His wife 's brother , Eisenhardt , was his manager . Eisenhardt had been in the battle of Waterloo , a member of a Nassau regiment which held Hugomont against the attacks of the French . The French bullets rattled like hail against the big oaken doors which were never battered down . Day after day this story was related to me while sitting on the wool sacks . When I called for the twentieth rehearsal he lay dead on a sack . Baehr died about 1844 , leaving the house to a friend on condition that he would take care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that . His greatest lament was that he should die without having seen a steamengine . " Baehr always told my father it was nonsense to make wire rope on a long rope walk when it could be done with a machine in a small room , but he dodged the question of driving power . " In the following passage are vividly set forth some of the difficulties and hardships experienced by young Roebling in 161 J THE ROEBLINGS travelling between his Saxonburg home and Pittsburgh , the nearest large town , where for a period he attended a boarding school : SAXONBURG A REMOTE LOCALITY " Communication with the outside world was difficult . The road to Freeport , 11 miles , was all right in summer when the canal was open . The direct road to Pittsburgh was atrocious , especially in winter time ? 26 long miles . In the Deer Creek valley are steep hills . . . . Many a time have I made that trip . One winter my toes were frozen . . . . " My trips from Saxonburg to Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early an age , by way of Freeport and the canal , or in a wagon belonging to the cabinet-maker Bernigau , who kept a store and drove to town at intervals , exchanging country products for city wares , were a great pleasure in summer time . Starting before sunrise , the first stop was at a coffee house , six miles out , price 6 cents for all the cups one could drink . When half way out , near Deer Creek , we took dinner at Mrs. Staly 's , arriving late in the afternoon . The time was passed in making German verses and poetry . The Pittsburgh rendezvous for Saxonburg teamsters was always at Madam Dubail 's , on 8th Street , an Alsatian , who kept an excellent inn with ample yard room for teams and horses . This good woman often reinforced my starving pouch with delicious tidbits . " The return trip , especially in the winter time , was something dreadful ? uphill all the way , snow or mud axle-deep . A short cut by way of Lawrenceville was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then we had to turn back , adding six miles to the length of the trip . The road through Sharpsburg was a bed of mud , churned up by the 162 J , BOYHOOD DAYS IN SAXONBURG many iron wagons . The hill at Deer Creek was so steep that the load had to be transferred . Finally Saxonburg was reached late at night ? all half frozen and hungry . The waiting Christmas tree was the recompense for all this distress . " The cabinet-maker , Bernigau , to whom he refers in the above passage , was a special friend of the lad . " Bernigau , " he writes , " made all the coffins , also wonderful furniture and fancy articles forwhich the Pittsburgh demand was great . Many happy hours did I spend in his shop ! He had no small children . His very particular wife always made me take off my shoes before I could enter her house . Bernigau died early . The widow married his assistant not long after . " Being the Roebling boy , ' I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heirlooms the people had brought over ? curious old clocks , old Bibles and books , quaint pictures , novel utensils of copper , brass or china , long German pipes . My grandmother Herting had a wooden travelling-box with carved top inside of which a picture of the battle of Navarino was glued , showing the burning of the Turkish fleet ; that was a treat . A similar picture depicted Marshal Blucher driving the French over the Katzbach . " SOCIAL LIFE IN EARLY SAXONBURG A description of the social life of this primitive German community , as young Roebling recalled it nearly eighty years afterwards , furnishes a delectable picture of the habits and pleasures of those early days : " The vogue was still German . Lager beer had not arrived ; ale was not to the German taste ; wine was too dear ; hence Monongahela rye-whiskey became the staff of life . Entertainments at home , small parties and dances were frequently held . Bernigau played the violin ; Wickenhagen the violoncello ; 163 J THE ROEBLINGS Neher the cornet ; Roebling the flute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Aderhold 's hall by amateur actors , of whom Ernst Helmbold was the best . I remember with delight a play called Twenty Years After , another one , Only Six Courses . At an early day Aderhold , who kept the hotel and baked bread , instituted an annual festival for sharpshooters , lasting three days , attended by great crowds . I believe they are still continued , although Aderhold has been dead these fifty years . He died while pushing some dough into his oven . My uncle , Riedel , made a poem on the sad event , which is preserved . " The people were strict Lutherans , but not strict Sabbatarians , so that Sunday afternoon was devoted to reasonable enjoyment . Young men as they grew up generally went to Pittsburgh for a job , but never forgot their native heath . " I have been hack twice , for a day or two , once in 1858 and later in 1868 . Such subsequent visits only interfere with the glamour of earlier impressions . " The early emigrants were usually well educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law , and their wives knew how to cook and practise economy . " Saxonburg , " the Colonel observes , " was on the direct route of the annual flight of passenger pigeons from South Carolina to Canada . Thousands rested in our forests , many shot and none left now , the result of unrestricted slaughter . " Although only six years old at the time , the Colonel remembered the great comet of 1843 . " I saw the great comet with its head at the foot of Main Street and tail above the church . " Saxonburg , he notes , was subject to strokes of lightning . " Owing to its elevation ( 1,5oo feet ) , Saxonburg was subject to strokes of lightning . In 1844 our neighbor Baehr 's barn was struck on a Sunday afternoon . The roof of our house , close by , 164 J BOYHOOD DAYS IN SAXONBURG began to smoke , but was saved by wet blankets ; the barn was burnt to the ground . " " Strangers , " the Colonel writes , " who visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they found it a quiet little country village . The glamour of former clays had vanished . " As I am writing these reminiscences enough incidents crowd in from the caverns of memory to fill as many more pages , but I refrain . The only religion was Lutheran ? only one poor Irishman ? Mularky . " The people who arrived in style were the Helmboldshad driven in a coach-and-four all the way from the East . Their farm , just east of ours , was the largest and best . The coach was not used very long . " My youthful associations with the people were so intimate that I could relate more personal occurrences happening in this small community ? all thrown together by chance , as it were , and working day and night to better their condition . It is so in all new settlements . As a rule the Saxonburgers had large families ? a great help to our early settlers . It was an orderly town ? no murders or arrests . About a third of the people came from a district thirty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude with a list of some sixty of the colonists who were inhabitants of Saxonburg about the year 184o . In addition to drawing upon his own knowledge the writer has been at pains to collect such significant facts concerning them as were available . Of one Dr. Koch , from Marburg in Hessen , he preserves a lively , though unpleasant , recollection . The above named " was Saxonburg 's only homeopathic doctor . Pulled my best sound 165 J TIDE ROEBLINGS back tooth . I miss it yet . Homeopathy and my father 's hydropathy were the vogue in Saxonburg . " Of another character , Lamb , he writes : " He was a jovial , genial citizen who came to the homes at Christmas time to butcher the pigs , stuff the sausages and have a little party afterwards . He was also a First Aid ' man and vaccinated me . A staff to lean on in misfortune . " Of the Knoch family , blacksmiths , he records that " they were often employed by John A. Roebling . The son married my cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of John A. Roebling . She is still living ( 1924 ) , born in 1837 . Her four sons are living in various parts of the United States . The daughter wrote to me recently . This was one of the houses with an enchanting list of old things to please a boy . " Of the Tolly family he observed that " the last boy and girl rejoiced in the names of Theokar and Sheradina . " " My intimate knowledge of these people is due partly to the circumstance that once every ten days or two weeks we made the large rope strands , requiring a dozen more hands , for a day or two , which had to be recruited from the surrounding population . Being a good runner , this task was delegated to me . " The Saxonburgers were good cooks ? could preserve food over winter by drying , or under ground ? no canning . No fresh fish ; no cranberries or sweet potatoes . " X66 J ? CHAPTER IX THE MAN AND HIS TRAINING Trenton Academy ? Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed to Trenton in the autumn of 1849 , Washington was approaching his thirteenth year . His youthful experiences had taught him self-reliance and habits of industry , the ability to endure hardship and even to thrive under it . His upbringing had been a Spartan one , attended by a drastic home training which included vigorous hydropathic treatment for all physical ailments , real or imaginary , and the prompt administration of the cowhide for the least infraction of the Draconian Code laid down by his father for the government of his household . Young Washington therefore had learned the value of patience in adversity and resignation to the inevitable penalties exacted for infractions of the laws of nature and of man . But neither the buffets of circumstances nor those of parental infliction had availed to break his spirit or spoil his disposition , which always remained generous and kindly . If at times and under irritating conditions he was often brusque in manner and prone to indulge in sardonic remarks concerning persons he did not like , the essential gentleness of his nature was apparent to all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerance for human frailties and his consideration for his servants and employees were marked characteristics of his personality and were probably reactions from his own youthful experiences in the rough school of life at a time when 167 THE ROEBLINGS he himself had felt the need of an understanding sympathy , largely denied him . HARSH PARENTAL DISCIPLINE His mother , of whom he always spoke with the utmost affection , was evidently a woman devoted in every way to her children , and it was doubtless from her that he inherited the milder qualities which were so conspicuous , at least in the later years of his life , when notwithstanding his constant physical disabilities he was able , under a more cheerful environment , to cultivate a measure of that serenity which the conditions of his earlier and middle life had rendered difficult , if not impossible . Undoubtedly the severe castigations and almost unremitting scolding and faultfinding to which he and his brothers were subjected when they were growing up left their deep impress upon his mind and character . If the child was not spoiled it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel had the highest regard for his father 's genius and ability and , in the case of those who were interested , was always ready to recount his professional achievements . In his reminiscent moods he would , however , speak with small reserve and even with a certain apparent gusto of " the old unhappy far-off things " which belonged to the memories of his boyhood , and , more particularly , of the punishments which he was compelled to endure at the hands of an often irascible parent . He would recall these castigations , often unmerited , with a philosophic calm mingled with a strong sense of their comic aspect . In an address made upon the occasion of the unveiling of a monument in Trenton to the memory of John A. Roebling the orator of the day touched briefly upon this phase of the father 's character , obviously having been previously coached 168J THE MAN AND HIS TRAINING in this as in other particulars by the Colonel . himself . His words are : " Parental discipline is all right , coercion is all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amore , so to speak . But John A. Roebling sometimes punished in anger , which is not punishment , but truculence . Is there a mother 's son of us who has not often recalled with a grimace , half whimsical and wholly forgiving , the pendant whip , kept for terror rather than use and more respected by the harmless necessary cat ' than by his graceless boyhood ? Has he not in after years rallied his blessed mother on the set speech which always prefaced her occasional application of the whip , to the effect that it hurt her more than it did him , which statement , however doubted then , he knows now to have been the fact ? I fancy there are few such hallowed memories clustering about the twig of birch that decorated the home and eke the prancing legs of the Roebling youngsters . That birchen rod meant business . " During the years in Saxonburg the boy had naturally acquired a proficiency in the German tongue which up to the end of his life he spoke with the same fluency as English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his calculations in German rather than English . He also understood French and could converse in it , though less readily than in the other languages . The rudiments of Latin he would have acquired under his early teachers in Saxonburg and Pittsburgh and he doubtless pursued the study at the Trenton Academy which he attended after coming to Trenton . The Trenton Academy was one of the famous schools of the State . It had been started before the close of the war of the Revolution , and among its graduates were many young men who afterwards distinguished themselves locally and in a wider sphere . The Academy finally closed its doors in 1884 , ? X69 J THE ROEBLINGS after a full century of existence , and then only because it had largely been superseded by the State Model School and the growing excellence of the public school system of the city . During the 185o 's , the period when the school included Washing- ton Roebling as a pupil , the Academy enjoyed its most flourishing era and the reputation of the teachers was high , particularly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known throughout New Jersey as an educator and an able writer on educational subjects . The annual circular and catalogue of the Academy for the years 1851-1852 prints the name of Washington Roebling as a student in the " Classical Department , " the highest of three departments , the other two being designated as the " High c 170 J THE MAN AND HIS TRAINING English " and the " Common English . " The name of Ferdinand Roebling , Washington 's younger brother , appears for the same years in the " Common English . " There are twenty-four names in the Classical Department , including William L. Dayton , Jr. , subsequently a judge of the Court of Appeals of New Jersey and United States Minister to the Hague . Dayton 's father , also , William L. , was a member of the board of trustees at this period . He was a widely known man , having been an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the State , United States Senator from New Jersey and the unsuccessful candidate for the vice-presidency on the Republican ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Minister to France , where he died suddenly in 1864 . Another of Washington 's classmates was Ion Hanford Perdicaris , of Greek parentage , who , it will be recalled , was kidnapped by the Moroccan bandit Raisuli during the Roosevelt administration , an event which called forth the stirring Rooseveltian slogan , " Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead . " His father , G. A. Perdicaris , was also at that time a member of the board of trustees . Another classmate was William S. Stryker , for many years adjutant general of the State and favorably known for his historical writings , the chief of which is his admirable book , The Battles of Trenton and Princeton , published by Houghton , Mifflin &; Co. in 1898 . Another , afterwards eminent man , attending the Academy at this time , though not in Washington 's class , was Dr. Charles C. Abbott , the naturalist . The Academy catalogue of the same date advises that " Instruction in the Classical Department is given wholly by the principal in person , " and further observes , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission to its privileges unless their parents or guardians are resolutely deter 171 J THE ROEBLINGS mined to exact a faithful discharge of those duties which are assigned for the hours out of school . " It is improbable that Washington had any disposition to shirk his studies , but if he had , his father could doubtless be depended upon to keep him up to the mark . Another item under " General Remarks " gives this significant warning : " If there is necessity for corporal punishment it is promptly and judiciously administered . " The word " judiciously " must have caused a grim smile to appear on Washington 's face if he ever read the passage , for " corporal punishment , judiciously administered , " was something that , in his opinion , he had seldom experienced . // It was his father 's wish that his eldest son should follow in his footsteps as an engineer , doubtless perceiving in him the qualities which he was subsequently to display in so remarkable a fashion . Washington as a boy had already demonstrated his aptitude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved useful as an assistant to his father . Between the years 1851 and 1855 John A. Roebling was engaged in designing and building the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge , the first of his major achievements , and he was away from his home much of the time . During his absences his trusted superintendent , Charles Swan , looked after affairs at the mill and doubtless he was assisted by young Roebling during the time he could spare from his attendance at the Academy . Four years of study in that institution found him prepared at the age of seventeen to enter the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy , New York , then probably regarded as the foremost place in this country for the study of engineering , particularly in the mechanical field . There is no definite record covering 172 J THE MAN AND HIS TRAINING young Roebling 's career during his three years ' attendance , 1854-1857 , but his subsequent eminence in his profession would indicate that he was a capable and industrious student . Two or three of his letters written during his first year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Trenton , have survived . In one of these letters from Troy , dated March 13 , 1854 , he asks Mr. Swan to forward to him " a collection of logarithmic tables by Baron de La Vega , published in Vienna and written on the left hand in Latin and the other in French . " He tells Mr. Swan exactly where to look for the book and directs him to send it to his address at No. 97 Ferry Street . In another letter , under date of May 3 , 1854 , the writer says he is writing " just after having swum across the Hudson " and is therefore tired out . He continues : " There is no want to me of having plenty to do . It comes of itself , if you only want it , and sometimes there is a little too much of it . As my circle of acquaintances increases , paying even an occasional visit to them takes time . But I will take care of that . " He expresses concern over the " rolling " troubles Swan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a skilled hand to go to Trenton to work at the task , but could find none . He states that he had heard from " Ferdie " that the Trenton dam had broken away again and observes " had they taken my advice that would never have happened . " He has left on record his conviction that seventeen , at which age he entered , was at least a year too soon for what he calls " that terrible treadmill of forcing an avalanche of figures and facts into young brains not qualified to assimilate them as yet . " He states that the director while he was at " Troy " was the hardest taskmaster that ever lived , that " the boys were ground G 173 J THE ROEBLINGS down and crammed with knowledge and mathematics that their poor young brains could not make use of . " He added that " the few who graduated left the school as mental wrecks . " " I am still busy , " he says , " trying to forget the heterogeneous mass of unusable knowledge that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class his own starts with 65 and only graduates 12 it is proof of the terrible grind . " THE ROEBLING BENEFACTIONS TO THE INSTITUTE But if the memories of his collegiate career were not all agreeable he certainly in after years proved that he was no unfilial son of his alma mater , for his benefactions , together with those of his son , John A. Roebling , 2nd , and his brother , Charles G. Roebling , also graduates , aggregate over $200,000 , and there is a fine dormitory on the campus , built with the Roebling money , and a broadcasting station , WHAZ , also provided by the family . Moreover , Colonel Roebling left a bequest to the Institute in his will of $50,000 . At the time of Colonel Roebling 's death in 1926 he was said to have been the third in seniority among the graduates , A. H. Emory of Stamford being the oldest and Charles Mac Donald the second oldest . The latter spent some years after his retirement in Trenton and the Colonel and he enjoyed many opportunities of recalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel a little exaggerated in his memories the strenuous conditions of his student life , and his delight in forceful verbal utterance carried him beyond the boundaries of sober fact . In any event he never appeared to suffer very much in later life from the evils which he depicts , for obviously he never became one of the " mental wrecks " which he accused the Institute of producing in the educational grindmill as it worked in his day . G 174 J THE MAN AND HIS TRAINING // Following his graduation in the summer of 1857 , the young engineer returned to his home in Trenton and took up his work in the mill . For a part of this time his father and Swan seem to have been away and Washington apparently was in charge of the mill . He writes letters to Swan giving full particulars as to the condition of business affairs , and particularly as to the matter of credits which seem to have given him much concern . Collections were slow and there were failures of several large houses in Philadelphia and elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and there were widespread failures of banks and commercial houses . Accompanied by his father , Washington paid a business visit to Washington , D.C. , in the spring of 1858 and in connection with these matters writes Swan that he had visited the Capitol and had seen both houses of Congress in session and mentions that his father went to see the Secretary of the Navy in the hope of securing a contract for wire rigging for government ships , declaring that the prospect for obtaining it " was not very bright . " 175 J CHAPTER X BEGINNING A PROFESSIONAL CAREER IN THE spring of 1858 Washington joined his father who was then at Pittsburgh engaged in erecting a bridge over the Allegheny River . He remained there until the work was completed in the summer of 186o . During this period he writes many letters to Swan , explaining the progress made on the bridge and ordering certain supplies which were needed for the work on it . The letters also include many side observations upon the current events which interested him . The correspondence begins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the bridge was completed , after which he went to Kentucky for a period and then returned to his home in Trenton in the late autumn . Excerpts from these letters follow in chronological order : // On May 2 , 1858 , he announces his arrival in Pittsburgh and gives his impressions of the place which he had not visited since Saxonburg days : " I ca n't say that I have seen anything but smoke here as yet ; and it strikes me there is a great deal more than there used to be . They have put up so many new rolling mills , and factories and houses , that after all it is not to be wondered at if there is a little more smoke . Pittsburgh has increased wonderfully since I was here , but in nothing more than churches , of which there are any quantity and fine ones , too . I attended this morning at Mr. Preston 's church , where I used to go to Sunday School . r 176 J BEGINNING A PROFESSIONAL CAREER We sat in Mr. Holmes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn Street ; we have no female boarders fortunately and at the table , which is very well filled , each one digs in and helps himself . " On the bridge , the masonry of the Pittsburgh abutment is now above the chain , and unless the river should be very high they will be able to stop pumping in a short time . Nothing has been commenced as yet . My time is half spent in the office and half on the work and I always manage to find enough to do so far . Business is quite brisk in town , all the rolling mills are going and any quantity of steamboats coming and going . The town is full of raftmen now , who have brought down their rafts . Once in a while a raft strikes our pumping boat and knocks the connections all to smash , causing a delay in pumping several hours . " He has this to say about the reign of lawlessness in Pitts-burgh : " Pittsburgh is getting to be a great place for murders , stabbings , etc . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night for the benefit of the murdered Baer 's family was a brilliant affair , considering that the performers were all ' amateurs and Germans . I had no idea that so much native talent existed here . But the poorest stick among the performers was a long-legged violin player by the name of Riedel . Just ask Uncle Julius Riedel , who married his mother 's sister if he is any relative of his . " Evidently a cask of hams , unannounced , had been received at the Trenton home and Swan had written to inquire if they had been sent by Mr. Roebling . Here is the reply : " Father knows nothing whatsoever about the hams ; he has not sent any ; perhaps it is a present from somebody , or maybe 177 THE ROEBLINGS there is an infernal machine in the cask . If I were you I would keep it for a while , at any rate , and see what turns up , because if you send it back the railroad company will eat it up . " Here is a reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Father admits and , indeed , is almost certain that the whole iron business throughout the country will be very low for the next 4 or 5 yrs. , and then look out for the breakers here in Pittsburgh . You see it will be two years before Buck 's term expires , then we will certainly have a new tariff , and it will take two years more before its effects are felt throughout the country . " John A. Roebling 's intense dislike of the Democratic party crops out in the following passage : " Father is getting his dander up against the Democrats and says he will turn everyone out of the mill when he gets home . " The elder Roebling 's reaction to a proposal for the manufacture of steel wire for pianos is thus described : " A New York gentleman stopping at the Monongahela who was formerly in the piano-making business and used the improved piano steel wire of Webster and Harper , and also that of a firm in Vienna , says that the latter is far superior to the former . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Geib , has come to the conclusion all at once that the whole thing is a big humbug ; I think however he will change his mind again very soon . " The writer mentions that " The State Fair is about to be held in Pittsburgh when the town will be filled with strangers , " and adds this reflection upon the Trenton Fair : " It will be a very different affair from your small potato . " This in reference to his brother Ferdinand 's zeal in soliciting 178 J BEGINNING A PROFESSIONAL CAREER orders ( Ferdinand then being sixteen years old and attending a college in Washington ) : " I am glad to see that Ferdie ' is stirring around for orders , it is a mighty big beginning-$24 . " The musical delights of Pittsburgh are thus set forth : " We are enjoying the English opera here of late ; the troupe was excellent , especially the ladies who were very handsome indeed , and splendid actresses . I saw the Crown Diamonds , Barber of Seville , Bohemian Girl , and Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw . They also played your favorite Fra Diavolo , but I did not see it . " He speaks of a trip contemplated by his father with a view to a possible investment in coal oil lands : " Father intends going to Cincinnati in about two weeks to take a trip up the Kanahwa to some coal oil works . It is always very well to examine everything in person before investing . The country down there is awful . Every man is a rascal and every second man a thief , and it is about as difficult to get oil to the river as it was to get a Morris Canal rope from Saxonburg to Freeport . " Speaking of the progress on the piers , under date November 13 , 1858 , he writes : " By next Friday I think the last stone will be laid for this season , at least I hope so , because nothing can be told beforehand with any degree of certainty here . " In the same letter he records a visit to Pittsburgh of a Trenton friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher passed through the other day ; I prevailed upon him to stop off a day and take a look at Pittsburgh . He was thoroughly disgusted with it , I can assure you . You see it happened to be one of those dark , cloudy , smoky afternoons , when the sun does n't shine and the gas is lit at 4/ ; he ca n't 179 J THE ROEBLINGS imagine how anybody can live here and enjoy life . For my part I feel quite sorry that I will have to leave it . " Speaking of the hydropathic cure which the Pittsburghers of that day were wont to take at Philipsburg , he writes : " Quite a number of Pittsburghers have been down at Philipsburg this summer and got touched up a little in their health . But the trouble with some people who have undergone the water treatment is that they can do just as they please afterwards and eat what they like , and the result is that in a year or two they are as bad off as ever . " He mentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cure : " He has improved wonderfully and looks and feels like a new man . When he went there he was a dyspeptic , had a sore throat with an abscess in it , etc. , etc . All those evils left him under about a month 's treatment and starving . This latter part of the cure he disl iked more than anything else , because bathing always gave him a tremendous appetite . " He records the approach of the one hundredth anniversary of the capture of Fort Duquesne , on November 25 , 1858 : " Our celebration of the 25th promises to be a grand affair . It is in honor of the taking of Fort Duquesne one hundred years ago . Everett will deliver a speech on Washington in the freight depot of the Pennsylvania R.R. , which you know is built on the site of the old fort . Old Judge Wilkins is the presiding officer . Salvos of artillery will be fired all day long from the Point and a procession 10 miles long is to march through the town . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the 25th for Thanksgiving . " He finds many friends in Pittsburgh : " I am perfectly at home in this place and have ten times as many acquaintances as in Trenton. " r 18o j BEGINNING A PROFESSIONAL CAREER With this letter the correspondence for 1858 comes to an end , to be resumed again in the early spring of 1859. // Chess , it would appear , was a favorite game in Pittsburgh at this period : " Everybody has learned to play chess ( luring the last winter . Paulsen 's visit evidently stirred them up ; some of the Pittsburghers are said to have beaten him very badly when he was here , which is more than many cities can boast of . " In April he writes : " I am glad to hear that you got that steamer to rig . You will have a nice job there which will keep you busy and jumping around . In one week I bet you will see me jumping about here ; you had better come out and see how it is done . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite cheering accounts about the business at home ; previous to that we thought at one time that you would dry up altogether in the way of making wire rope . People had probably got the spring fever and were too lazy to order . " He reports progress on the bridge : " By the middle of this week the cast-iron towers will be up in place . Two columns and the bed-plate are up already ; we put up two columns a day ; they are awkward things to handle because they ca n't stand up alone ; it was more troublesome to hoist the shears on the pin ; they are 5o feet long and had to be hoisted up in a vertical position with only two guys instead of four . About the 4th of July the masonry will all be finished ? Thank the Lord . " He remarks that Pittsburgh is improving in an architectural way : 181 THE ROEBLINGS $ " Pittsburgh is getting along quite smart now ; I doubt if there is a lazy man in it , your humble servant perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron and glass business , especially nails . There is a perfect mania here for improvements . Every day somebody commences to tear down an old house and put up a new one with an iron front . The people will get over that in about two years and then will be the time for you to come and see the town . You would scarcely know it again , especially 5th Street . One interest however is at a standstill , namely steamboating . A month or two ago you recollect to boats were burnt up , occupying the whole wharf from Wood to Smith Streets  --  well , the wrecks are lying there yet and they seem to be in no hurry to get them away . You see from that how little demand for wharf room there is among boats . The lower wharf is now altogether taken up by large coal tugs which take coal boats to New Orleans and bring them back empty . The quantity of coal mined here is increasing every year and the large capitalists are gradually buying out the smaller ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few miles above here , has over five miles of river front , and every year he puts up a new slope and rents it out to somebody , charging him $1,000 for the coal he takes out . " He writes in July , referring to a visit made to Pittsburgh by his brother Ferdinand : " Ferdie ' no doubt has told you of all the wonderful events that have happened during his stay . He was very anxious to get back and go to shooting woodcock ; he did not even have enterprise enough to go to Saxonburg . If I had not been so busy I would have gone along with him . " This about the dislike of the treasurer of the bridge company to paying bills : C 182 BEGINNING A PROFESSIONAL . CAREER " Our treasurer makes a face ten yards long whenever Father hands in a little bill of $6,000 or $7,000 . " In September he has a little fun with Swan , chaffing him about a doctor 's bill which he was supposed to owe to a Pittsburgh physician : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here who will not forget you as long as they live . Among others there came the other day a man , asking if there was not a carpenter working for Mr. Roebling by the name of Charles Snow . I told him no , there is no one here by that name . " . Thereupon he handed me a little bill for professional services ? ? by Doctor W of St. Clair Street to the tune of $4 5 upon which $10 had been paid ; the bill was dated February 16 , 1.848 . I told him that a man by that name had worked for Father at the aqueduct and then went to Jersey and had not been heard of since . That put a stopper upon Doctor W ' s hopes and with a longdrawn sigh he returned to his office close by the bridge . Now I want you to confess right out what kind of professional services those were ? because the Doc 's reputation is none of the best . " On October 18 he writes : " Yesterday the last strand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It seems that the people in Allegheny were vexed over the bridge-tolls charged : " The Allegheny people are down on this bridge and three or four articles have appeared in the papers , pro and con . They ca n't get used to paying trip tolls since they have been accustomed all along to pay by the year . " He had met with an accident and thus describes it : " I was delayed in putting this letter into the office by having had a hole knocked into my head accidentally but I am happy THE ROEBLINGS to inform you that it is healed up again . I am all right , however . I experienced for the first time the delightful sensation of being knocked insensible . " On November lo he reports : " We have got along well on the bridge ; the big cables are wrapped , all but about so feet at each end when we ran out of wire and have had to take the smaller size ? you will have to make some more perhaps ? 2,000 feet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a day or two we hang on beams ; wrapping goes very well , no trouble after once getting started fairly .

You will see that although Pittsburgh claims to be the most orthodox Christian city in the United States there are still some very rotten persons in it . " About the sun spot : " Have you noticed the black spot in the sun lately ? We can see it here without smoked glass . Mr. B. attributes the cold spell of last month to that alone . " A postscript : " Tell that lazy chap Ferd to write . " LETTERS OF 186o There were five letters written in 186o : " This is my first letter to you in 186o and consequently I shall make it very short , because it is always a good rule to make a small beginning , but a big ending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the end of the year , you may always expect small letters .

Ile is going to Europe next summer for the benefit of his health unless he should be appointed to the treasureship of one of the Cincinnati banks . " Under date February 24 , 186o , he writes about a terrific storm that had taken place the day before : " Yesterday we had a furious storm ; it must have been as violent as the one you had lately . All hands had to quit , they could not stand up and I expected to sec our foot-bridge go to the dickens , every moment ; she jumped and pitched and reared like a wild horse , the new bridge shook a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make her stiff in that direction . Yesterday morning we had 65 degrees heat and in the night it snowed ; that explains the storm . " As to the time of the opening of the bridge he writes : " I am afraid that the contemplated opening of the bridge by April 1 , wo n't be exactly accomplished ; it will probably be the 15th . All the stays have to be cut off yet and put on before we can open and you know that those are not a few by the bill of rope you sent us . " The wrath of the Alleghenians has at last reached its full height and they have determined to build a free bridge right next to ours ; that is to say , a petition has been circulated for a charter , and since that do n't cost anything , it was fully signed and was nine feet long according to last accounts . The whole move is only intended to frighten our people to put the toll down to nothing .

Beyond the filling of cellars and damaging of floors there was not much damage done , except in the Monongahela , where 17 coal boats were sunk . The Monongahela bridge will have about $4,000 damages to pay for coal boats sunk against its piers . The company has to pay those damages every year and the effect will be to break it up sooner or later . During the last 3 weeks we have had incessant rains . The main bridge was to have been opened for foot-passengers today , but for the rain .

" 187 CHAPTER XI CIVIL WAR SERVICES Enlistment ? With Army of the Potomac FOLLOWING the completion of the Allegheny Bridge at Pittsburgh , the young engineer returned to Trenton in the autumn of 186o and took up his work in the mill . On February 21 , 1861 , Lincoln paid a visit to Trenton , while on the way to Washington for his inauguration , and made a short speech . As the Roeblings were then , and have always since remained , staunch Republicans , to the third and fourth generation , it is to be presumed that father and son were much impressed by the occasion and were in full sympathy with the President 's policies and prepared , should the necessity arise , to support him in his efforts to preserve the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ENCOURAGES THE SON TO ENLIST When the call came on that fateful April day , if Washington needed any encouragement to enlist in the war , which he presumably did not , his father would doubtless have furnished the incentive and provided the occasion , for John A. Roebling was not the man to spare himself , nor even his eldest son , who was his right hand , in a cause in which he felt great principles were involved . How the father encouraged his son may be inferred from the following story : At a time when the crisis was impending , and the probability of war was being everywhere discussed , one evening as the family sat at the supper table , the father turned to his son i88 J CIVIL WAR SERVICES Washington and said to him , with that harsh abruptness for which he was noted : " Do n't you think you have stretched your legs under my mahogany about long enough ' ? " Washington was eating a hot potato at the moment and was thus prevented from making an immediate reply . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from the table and departed without uttering a single word . As the story goes , he enlisted the next morning and literally never did return home , for as soon as the war was over he married and was henceforth the head of a household himself . This is the substance of the story as those who have heard the Colonel tell it , recall . Doubtless the incident may have been exaggerated in the repetition , but it is so far in agreement with the characteristics of the parties concerned that it seems entitely plausible . // Following the attack on Fort Sumter , President Lincoln 's call for volunteers , issued April 15 , 1861 , met with a ready response from the young men of Trenton . Company A , of the State Militia , had been organized November 30 , 1860 , and on April 16 , 1861 , in response to the President 's proclamation , reported for active duty .

A , N.G. , State of N.J. , April 16 , 1861 , discharged to enlist in New G 189 J THE ROEBLINGS York ; enrolled June 15 , 1861 , as pvt. , 6th New York Independent Battery ; Sergt. , Sept. 11 , 1861 ; 2nd lieut. , January 23 , 1862 ; discharged May 26 , 1864 , to accept commission as major and A.D.C. , U.S. Vols. ; resigned January 1 , 1865 ; commissioned lieut-col. , U.S. Vols. , by brevet , to date from December 6 , 1864 , for gallant conduct during the campaign before Richmond , Va. ; Col. , U.S. Vols. , by brevet , to date from March 13 , 1865 , for gallant and meritorious services during the war . " In his report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : " The young gentlemen composing this company performed all the duties of a military garrison , and at the same time rendered important service in the work of arming and equipping the troops for the field , for the period of three months service , from the 16th of April to the 16th of July , in which time seven regiments , four of militia , and three of volunteers , were fully armed and equipped . " But mere garrison duty in his home town was evidently not to the liking of young Roebling . He yearned for more active service and a few weeks later managed to obtain his discharge from Company A , when he enlisted again as a private in the 6th New York Artillery . He was not long in obtaining the promotion to which he was entitled by his abilities and training in the work of an engineer . In 1862 he was transferred to the staff of General Irvin McDowell and assigned to various engineering duties , notably the construction of a suspension bridge across the Rappahannock River . Later he served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign which ended in the Second Battle of Bull Run . He was present also at Antietam and South CIVIL WAR SERVICES Mountain , during which time he built a suspension bridge across the Shenandoah River at Harper 's Ferry . This bridge was captured by the Confederate forces , who entirely destroyed the flooring system . Colonel Roebling reconnoitered this bridge while it was still in the hands of the enemy . He prepared a complete new flooring at a distance , and when the Union Army reoccupied the position he was able to restore the bridge without loss of time . From August 1863 until March 1864 Colonel Roebling was attached to the 2nd Corps , serving on engineering duty and later on the staff with the 5th Corps during the Overland campaign . After the battle of Chancellorsville , it became his duty to ascend every morning in a captive balloon to reconnoiter the enemy and watch from the basket the movements of the Confederate Army . On one of these flights he was the first to discover that General Lee was moving toward Pennsylvania , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of these balloon ascensions in Winkler 's recent book , Morgan the Magnificent , where it is stated that Mr. J. P. Morgan , sitting in his office in New York , was informed by telegraph , among other happenings , of Colonel Roebling 's daily sessions in the air . ON LITTLE ROUND TOP AT GETTYSBURG Ten days before the Battle of Gettysburg it was discovered that there was at general headquarters no adequate detailed map of Pennsylvania . Colonel Roebling remembered that his father possessed such a map . He was immediately ordered to go to Trenton and bring back the map . During his absence the movements of both armies had been so rapid that upon his return he was unable to locate either of them . Taking the map , THE ROEBLINGS he mounted his horse and rode in search of the Union Army . He was in such danger of capture by the Confederate cavalry that he and his horse slept one night in a cave . It was not until daybreak of the morning of the first day 's battle that the Colonel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg he was on Little Round Top with General Warren , when the latter discovered the beginning of Hood 's furious attack , which threatened to outflank and defeat the whole Union Army . Colonel Roebling , with his own hands , helped to drag up the first cannon , which did so much to save the position . In fact , history regards this achievement of General Warren and his staff and men as the turning point of the war . In Jesse Bowman Young 's book , the Battle of Gettysburg , it is said in Chapter xxi , pp. 239-40 , " The Safeguarding of Little Round Top " : " Then General Warren and the staff officer Roebling with some stragglers near by helped to pull the guns by hand into position , no room being found for the horses just at that point . " Commenting upon the military ability of General Warren , a recent writer in Captains of the Civil War , Yale University Press 1921 , affirms that " Warren was not only a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he showed by seizing on his own initiative Little Round Top , ' without which the left flank could never have been held . " On the third day of the battle Colonel Roebling was consulting a map on a table at General Meade 's headquarters when a cannon ball carried away two legs of the table without injuring him . " Colonel Roebling served on the staff of General Warren , 1 192 J CIVIL WAR SERVICES who was in command of the 5th Corps , through the bloody campaign around Richmond , from the Battle of the Wilderness , through Spottsylvania , the Crater fight at Petersburg , and nine other battles to that of Hatcher 's Run . His last duty as a soldier was assisting in the destruction of the Weldon railroad in December 1864 . In 1877 General Warren , in writing to a friend , said : " Roebling was on my staff and I think performed more able and brave service than any one I knew . " SOME WAR ANECDOTES Colonel Roebling was close on hand at the time when General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warren 's division on the occasion when they saved Sickels ' corps from annihilation . In the controversy over the matter , which was carried on for many years , Colonel Roebling never hesitated to express his opinion that " Sickels had no business to be where he was . When General Sickels went to Meade 's headquarters he was ordered to go to his own men and it was in getting back that he lost his leg . " Another incident in which Colonel Roebling figured is told . It relates to an unsuccessful effort of a detachment of Northern soldiers to send a cannon ball into a barn under cover of which a number of Southern sharpshooters were sniping the Northerners . Colonel Roebling came along and saw the shots from the old cannon going wild . By raising his hand he learned the course of the wind , aimed the cannon accordingly , and ordered the gunners to try another shot , which they did , and the barn was instantly demolished . The sharpshooters , deprived of their shelter , were all killed and not a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Roebling was quartered late at 193 THE ROEBLINGS night in a stone jail . In the middle of the room stood a large chest that aroused his curiosity . He unfastened the lid , lifted it up , and put one of his hands inside to feel the contents . What was his horror to find that it came in contact with what appeared to be the cold forehead and nose of a corpse . Needless to say he quickly abandoned his investigation . When the morning came and he could see plainly , he found that the chest contained a stone statue , which he afterwards learned represented Mary Washington , the mother of George Washington . Preparations for the erection of the statue had been made just previous to the outbreak of the war , but the project had been indefinitely postponed , and meanwhile the statue had been stored in the jail for safekeeping . Another little incident is told of the Colonel 's war experience , in which Major Carl Lentz of Newark , one-time Republican leader there , figured . It was on the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cast their vote for the late President McKinley 's second term . Colonel Roebling was one of the electors , and Major Lentz was entertaining the party with war stories . Major Lentz declared that as he with others on picket duty were crossing the Rapidan just before the Battle of the Wilderness , under orders from brigade headquarters , one of the soldiers barely escaped drowning when his horse was carried away by the strong current , as the men forded the stream . The Major told in detail of the happening , and as he finished his story Colonel Roebling declared that the Major had told the incident exactly as it had occurred as he himself was there at the time . In his book , Meade 's Headquarters , made up of his wartime letters , Colonel Theodore Lyman , of General Meade 's staff , has some scattered references to Colonel Roebling. 194 7 CIVIL WAR SERVICES Under date November 30 , 1863 , page 56 , he records the following incident : " Captain Roebling from General Warren 's staff galloped up . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment rather a troubled air . He handed a scrap of paper . General Meade opened it and his face changed . My God ! ' he said , General Warren has half my army at his disposition . ' Roebling shrugged his shoulders . The note was to the effect that General Warren had made a careful examination of the enemy 's works , had altered his opinion of last evening and considered an assault hopeless . " On page 168 under date June 18 , 1864 , there is another reference : " Our lines were advancing and there was an inexplicable silence along the skirmish line . At 6:5o came an order for all the line to advance and attack the enemy , if found . A little after seven Major Roebling came in and reported he had discovered the enemy 's new line of works , that ran along a high ground beyond the railroad , that they were all there with batteries in position . Soon after General Warren mounted and we all rode to the front , over a wide oat-field past the works captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On page 240 under date October 6 , there is an amusing description of Colonel Roebling 's appearance and manner : " Roebling is a character , a major , aide-de-camp and engineer . He is a son of the German engineer Roebling , who built the celebrated suspension bridge over the Niagara River . He is a light-haired , blue-eyed man , with a countenance as if all the world were an empty show . He stoops a good deal , when riding has the stirrups so long that the tips of his toes can just touch them ; and , as he wears no boots , the bottoms of his pantaloons are always torn and ragged . He goes poking about 195 J THE ROEBLIl ! ' GS in the most dangerous places , looking for the position of the enemy , and always with an air of entire indifference . His conversation is curt and not garnished , with polite turnings . " What 's that redoubt doing there ? ' cries General Meade . Do n't know ; did n't put it there , ' replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was promoted to the rank of major , a little later he was breveted lieutenant-colonel . In January 1865 he resigned from the army , subsequently receiving the full brevet-rank of colonel . In later days he could often be persuaded to repeat stories of his military experiences for interested auditors and there were many such . When the Spanish War broke out and the Colonel was now well on in his sixties , he expressed the wish to serve his country once more . Ile actually made application to the authorities , but , of course , his services were declined on account of his age and physical disabilities . In referring to the matter the Colonel remarked that he was sorry , as he would have liked to fight for his country in every war in which it was engaged during his lifetime . in 1921 , in response to an inquiry made by someone who was seeking information as to people who had seen President Lincoln , Colonel Roebling wrote the following letter : " In answer to your curious quest as to people who saw Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four years and saw Lincoln on two occasions ? the first time in May 1861 , when he spoke a few words of welcome from the rear portico of the White House to the newly arriving soldiers , one of whom I was , and secondly about April 1 , 1864 , when he came down to Culpepper County to review the army previous to the Battle of the Wilderness . I was at that time major and aide-de 196 J CIVIL WAR SERVICES camp to General Warren , commanding the 5th Corps , and joined in the cavalcade . " The President was mounted on a hard-mouthed , fractious horse , and was evidently not a skilled horseman . " Soon after the march began his stove-pipe hat fell off ; next his pantaloons , which were not fastened on the bottom , slipped up to the knees , showing his white home-made drawers , secured below with some strings of white tape , which presently unravelled and slipped up also , revealing a long hairy leg . " While we were inclined to smile , we were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President compelled to endure such unmerited and humiliating torture . After repairs were made the review continued , but was shortened on his account . I never saw him again and was in Covington , Kentucky , when I heard of his assassination . " 197 J CHAPTER XII // DURING the Civil War period Colonel Roebling wrote a series of letters from the field to Charles Swan , the superintendent of the Roebling works at Trenton . These letters , fortunately preserved and never before published , cover a period from the autumn of 1861 to the winter of 1864 . They give his whereabouts , a general outline of his doings , and his reflections upon the course of events . Reference is made to the military bridges he built at Harper 's Ferry and elsewhere . The letters are fragmentary and discursive in their character and presuppose a general knowledge on the part of his correspondent of the major operations pertaining to campaigns in which the units to which he belonged were engaged . The writer says little about the battles and nothing of his own personal exploits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footnote to the history of the Campaign in Virginia and as embodying the experiences of an intelligent observer in his immediate environment . Possibly , in connection with the experi ences previously recorded by others , these letters may serve to throw some additional light upon the conditions which prevailed in the localities where the writer was stationed . Some of the letters lack a year-date , but it is not hard to determine from the context in which period they fall . There has been no attempt at comment or interpretation , since this would be unnecessary in the case of those who are familiar with the military history of those days , and in the case 198 J // of others would require a detailed elucidation for which space is not available . Camp Cameron , Co . K. , 9th Regt. , N.Y.S.M. Washington , D.C. ( No date , probably the summer of 1861 . ) Your turn has come at last for a letter , and as we have plenty of loafing time just now , I thought it well to sit down . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but since we have moved our tents to a more shady place , we can stand it better . Things progress very slowly here . Loafing in the camp seems to be the principal occupation of not only ourselves but everybody else . During the cool of the morning and evening we practise sabre exercise ; probably we will know something about it in six months from now . Sergeant Alexander , whom you met in the cars with me , gives the sabre drill . It seems that he is so much of a German as you or I , but he seems ashamed of it and never lets on that he understands a word . He is moreover from Breslau , and a countryman of yours . Some one stole his revolver and cigars ; thief is undiscovered so far and consequently he is rather wrathy . He caught a fool of a Secessionist in town the other day . The boys look on him as an old humbug . We would have had our horses before now and the whole lot was ready for us , when Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his battery , leaving us the bad ones , which our captain very properly refused to take , and therefore we will have to wait till they get another lot of good horses together . Sherman 's battery went through some manoeuvers near our camp this morning . The sight is very interesting ; the commands partly given by word , and partly 199 J THE ROEBLINGS by bugle . We got a wagon and 2 horses yesterday from the Maine boys ? that is something , at any rate . If they keep on this way the war will last 10 years . McComas ' regiment from New York came in town yesterday . During the night they had furlough , and , of course , got drunk , committing all sorts of mischief . Our guard caught a number of them and kept them prisoners for the night . There are about 200 men in camp , including ourselves ; they are mostly recruits for the different companies ? our regt . One of them , a German , was badly frightened last night . While on guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through the stock of the musket . He imagined of course that he had been shot by a Secessionist ; discharged his musket into the bushes and al armed the whole camp . When he got over his fright he smelled something like burnt leather , and that let the cat out of the bag . Several of our boys are musical , every night there is singing and guitar playing , going on till 91 when we have to be in bed . Morning call is at 472 , drill from s to 6 before it gets too warm , and evening drill 6 to 7 . We do not march to the arsenal every day , though three times a week the Grand Rounds come at 2 o'clock in the morning . They consist of staff officers , with an escort of the President 's Mounted Guard ; they visit every camp in the district that night on this side of the Potomac , and that is a circuit of about 3o miles . Their horses are very fine and go like thunder . When they approach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe the Jersey crowd is coming soon . If they come in a body they will make a fine impression , because every regiment makes it a point to march along Penna . Avenue from the Capitol to the White House . Most of them look tired , fagged out and dusty . I have seen no drilling as yet to beat our Corn-200 // pally A , in Trenton . At the same time I ca n't say I have seen very much . They say our regiment is pretty good but I have not seen them . Please tell " Ferdy " ' to go to Grammetts ' and order a pair of shoes for me , medium high around the ankles and with projecting soles , thus he gives a sketch of the soles soles double heavy . He has my measure from my last pair of shoes . Tell him that the last pair was a little tight around the instep and to make them a little wider ; put on lacing leather strings and send to me per express ( prepaid ) care of E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun practice today the stick was struck . Give my respect to all . Poolesville , Md . September 1 , 1861 . This is the first chance I have had for writing for over a week on account of our marching back and forward without much apparent purpose . On Saturday our captain received orders from Gen. McClellan to detach himself from Bank 's Army and report himself to Gen. Stone . We accordingly left Clarksville and approached the place where Stone 's Brigade is located . Please take notice therefore that I am no longer in Gen. Bank 's Army . In addition to being commissary I am now chief gunner and corporal of one of the new rifled cannon , which arrived last week . It is the place which I like best , because the gunner has all the sighting and pointing to do and can have the pleasure of popping over the rebels . The gun fires 13 lb. shell , weights 871 lbs . and is larger than the other pieces which we had . This little country town is about five minutes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty with our pieces . Rickett 's U.S. Battery is encamped here with us . You footnotes I His brother , Ferdinand . 201 J THE ROEBLINGS will remember that he was taken prisoner and lost his pieces at Bull Run ; besides having 30 men killed . The men say that the loss of their battery was entirely owing to a mistake on the part of their officers in abandoning their first position , which they could have held against any odds . Captain , U.S. Battery with whom we were encamped at Hyattstown , is ordered to report to Anderson in Ky . The river bank on the opposite side fairly swarms with Secessioners . They have thrown up heavy earth-works mounted with cannon , at every place where there is a chance to ford in low water . At present the water at the fords is at least six feet deep , rendering this impossible . Skirmishes take place daily . Three companies of the Mass . Regt. on picket were compelled to leave by rebel shells , our muskets not reaching across . Three companies of Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes they drove away every man from the guns and even made them leave their earth-works . Banks is approaching Washington and will most likely join McClellan . At the present high stage of water General Stone 's column will suffice to prevent the rebels from crossing in any considerable force . The country around here is flat and level like Jersey . The Potomac bottom , on the Maryland side , spreads out ten miles in width and the Virginia side is hilly at once . Their earth-work and camps are visible from here with a spyglass . This letter goes by private conveyance to Washington and I must close immediately . Camp Stone , Near Poolesville , November 13 , 1861 . I wrote to you the last night , just before the fight at Ball 's Bluff . That is nearly a month ago and it is about time to write you another letter . There is absolutely nothing of any interest 202 // going on at present ; the life we are leading just at present is very tedious . We have no chance to see anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rabbits and quail abound , but they are poor shooting without a dog . A member of Rickett 's regular battery who are in the woods with us was killed night before last in a drunken spree by the proprietor of the gin mill . The murderer fled that night . The next day about one hundred cavalry were sent in pursuit , scouring the country far and wide . He was caught , hid in sonic bushes at the foot of Sugar-Loaf Mountain . Stone would have had him shot on the spot , but he preferred to turn hint over to the civil authorities who will undoubtedly hang hint because he has been a dangerous character heretofore . One of our teamsters left us today . He is over 6o and can no longer endure a winter 's camping out . He was the best driver and had the best team in the whole division . He is worth say , $i5,000 , but has been a teamster all his life and determines to stick to it to the end . Previous to 183o already he drove a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . There is not a State in the West or South where he does not know every inch of the ground . He knows all the Shakers on the Kentucky now , having hauled for them and also stopped three months while agent of the great Southern Through Mail . In his younger days he went through the Indian War under General Jackson . We are all sorry to lose him , for although he promises to return in the spring , I expect the rheumatism will have too tight a mortgage on him . Only two things prevented him from becoming a prominent man in the West and these were the want of a little early education and secondly , , whiskey . Let me hear something about the big rope machine ; by this time you will have no doubt tried it . I received a letter from E 203 J THE ROEBLINGS Rhule a short time since . He reports the water as having risen above the cables ; they must have been hung very low . Rhule says in his innocent way that it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while from Father and myself . I suppose you have heard the malicious story which Dobie relates about Mr. Rhule and a certain widow in Pittsburgh . Give my respects to all . Camp Dickinson on the Potomac . Opposite the Shipping Point Battery . December 14 , 1861 . I wrote a few lines to " Ferdy " in Washington , being too busy to write more . We left there on Sunday afternoon , making only five miles that day , passing by three forts which protect the city from the south on the Maryland side . They are not quite finished and mount but few guns as yet . We encamped just opposite Alexandria ; it was too hazy however to see anything of the camps opposite and beyond the city . The next day we traveled about io miles further , camping two miles beyond the ancient and miserable little village of Piscataway . The rate of marching depends entirely on the speed with which the forage wagons can keep up . The roads are very bad , the ground being mainly wet and swampy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old barn is full of it , hanging up to dry , giving plenty of employment to our two cigar makers . Piscataway is fenced in ; the last house was built about so years ago and it is against the law to build a house outside the fence . The graveyard is filled with graves of a hundred years ago . The land is all worn out and much of it is abandoned . Our next day 's march was to a swamp of ten miles length , the trees being principally cedar , pine and green holly full of // red berries ; many of the holly trees were over a foot through and would be worth a hundred dollars in a city . That night we encamped within hearing distance of the guns of the rebel battery . The Harriet Lane was busy shelling diem and burning their store-houses . The fourth day at last brought us to our present camping grounds at Budd 's Ferry , about a mile from the river directly opposite the rebel battery at Shipping Point , the second one on the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they knew our camp they would most likely shell us , as it is their shells have massed a mile beyond . The river here is a mile and a half wide . I have examined their battery pretty well with my glass . It is quite a heavy work , built up of sand-bags and clay , and protected by the high river bluffs behind , making it necessary to take the heights behind first , before the battery itself could be held , after driving the enemy out . The battery mounts three heavy guns ; one gun throws a hundredpound shell . They fire every day at the passing vessels of which they have hit none , beside sending a few shells across to our camps . The Virginians seem to have built a railroad along the river some distance back of their battery by which they can throw a large force to any menaced point within a short time . You will therefore see by this system that the blockading of the river is very perfect . It is here that our gun boat flotilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery in a few hours , but as they are commanded by higher ground in the rear , the next day the rebels are back in full force . I saw the negroes today hard at work with pick and spade repairing damages across the river . We have three field batteries . There are about 13,000 men here , four firing squads , Sickels ' brigade , and the balance New Englanders . I never expected them to come near a Jersey regiment and now we are close together . 205 ... I THE ROEBLINGS The Trenton boys were quite surprised to see us pop in on a sudden . The Fifth , you know has quite a number . None of them has seen army service yet of any account and consequently they look on me as an experienced campaigner . Jim Rusling3 showed me his war steed . He can take down any horse in the division and stand cannonading without wincing . I saw all the boys but Johnson , who is quartermaster of the Seventh . I have no idea what the division here intends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither have they been ordered to go into winter quarters . The country around here is very poor ; no farm houses of any account , nothing but little negro cabins ; these negroes living on bacon and corn bread all year around . Near Piscataway we passed a negro factory for the southern market , containing seventeen little negroes two feet high in a shanty about the size of a pig-pen and guarded by an old woman . They all turned out to look at us and so I had a chance to take notes . The only white woman I have seen around here is Mrs. General Sickels , who rides around in full uniform , attended by a body guard of cavalry . While in Washington we exchanged our Hotchkiss shells by order of Berry for Shunkle percussionshell . I hope we can try the latter before long . They are covered with papier mache in place of lead , and when stripped of their covering , they look like a tad-pole . The percussion arrangement , however , is more certain . Our slumbers were disturbed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery ; the stillness added to their effect . Their shell burst half a mile to the right of us behind a blacksmith shop . There is no fort here of any // kind . A couple of rebel schooners are couped up in Quantico Creek opposite . The rebels are miserable shots . They fired thirty times at a schooner and succeeded in putting only one shot through the mainsail . Only two bay schooners have been lost thus far and they were located and taken by armed boats . If anything interesting happens here I will keep you posted . Direct your letters to me , Bunting 's Battery , Hooker 's Division , Budd 's Ferry , Maryland . We have no chance to see papers here so please send me some once in a while if there is interesting news . Give my love to all . Budd 's Ferry , January 26 , 1862 . Everything is jogging along here in the usual style ; times are even duller than up at Poolesville . The other night a party of us gave a musical soiree at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . The music consisted of singing , piano , guitar and violin , your humble servant performing on the latter . The affair was topped by a supper , very creditable for this part of Maryland . Most of the furniture is removed from the house on account of the range from the battery . We had scarcely finished supper when the batteries opened on a propellor , two shell fell in the yard alongside the house , fortunately without bursting . The rebels have mounted a very large mortar . Our boys say it takes a yoke of oxen to draw in the ball and afterwards they walk out of the touchholes . Most of the regiment have lately been supplied with Austrian rifles , which came over in one of the Hamburg steamers . They are an excellent weapon . The Tribunes which you send occasionally are very acceptable , as they are the only ones received in camp . I notice that all the papers are silent about our division . One of the gunboats here is covered with a sort of iron crating , intended prob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or else to keep out fragments of bursting shell . This is a splendid Sunday , clear and warm , reminding one of spring which will soon come . The bluebirds stay here all winter , as also the mocking-birds . Do you know what Mr. Gowers address is ? I should like to have it . I believe I have not thanked you yet for the cigars and do so now . They are the best I ever smoked . That jelly was also excellent ; it came safe and sound . The boys want me to take a hand in a game of whist so I must close , tell that gal Elvira4 I will answer in course of time , provided I ai n't too lazy . I want some more emerypaper . Budds Ferry , February 20 , 1862 . I received both your and " Ferdie 's " letter today and note what you say in regard to that majority . I was not aware that a Tenth New Jersey regiment had come out as yet . I have not heard anything of Captain Murphy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would accept his offer if it be made at all , because my present place suits me excellently well . Our new captain , Bramshall , has declined the other position offered to him , preferring to remain with this company , which is the best artillery company in this division , and that leaves things just as they were . We expect the appointment now every day , Bramshall 's refusal having about had time to reach Albany . The officers in our battery would be very sorry to lose me and are opposed to my leaving very much . I have forgotten almost all the little infantry drill I used to know ; the artillery is so much different . 208 // Do you know whether any of the men for the regiment are arrived yet ? I suppose they would have to remain in camp at Trenton for quite a while yet . General Berry will send down two Whitworth guns in a short time for the purpose of dismounting the guns of the rebels battery opposite , piece by piece . Bramshall will have charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided they come , of course . The other New York battery in this division will probably be dismissed on account of inefficiency . The balloon has been up for several days every afternoon making observations on the other side . Many of their troops have left of late , but they have about as many left as we have on this side . Hooker is making efforts to go to Kentucky with this division , but I doubt whether he will succeed . I fired a few shots across the other day which hit very well . They replied without doing any damage . Roll-call , and I must close . Give my love to all . Camp Dickinson , March 9 , 1862 . Budd 's Ferry . This Sunday has been the most eventful with us since we have been here . We were all sitting quietly in the sun making after dinner reflection , when the report was brought into camp that large quantities of smoke were visible on the other side . Immediately all available tree tops were manned by an eager crowd and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire seemed to be increasing every moment , until , in a short time , all their camps , to the number of six or more , appeared one mass of smoke extending far up the Quantico . Presently flames began to shoot forth from the steamer Page and also from 3 schooners which she had captured in the beginning of their 209 J THE ROEBLINGS career . The former burnt to the waters ' edge in a short time , her smoke stack disappearing very suddenly . By this time the flames had reached some of the magazines , resulting of course in some tremendous explosions . Some of their guns had been left in position , double shotted , and as the flames reached them they went off , the shots striking the bank on this side . Apparently no attempt has been made to remove the guns or any of their commissary or ordnance stores , the size and color of the flames indicating the burning of flour , forage and provisions , and , even now , nine o'clock , the sound of exploding shells falls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no sooner saw the first smoke before they came down opposite Cock-pit Point , reconnoitering . After throwing in a few shells and eliciting no reply , a detachment of marines was sent on shore who clambered up the steep bank , and finding the batteries deserted , immediately raised the flag of the Union . At Shipping Point , the strongest fort , the gun-boats proceeded much more cautiously , but no resistance was offered to the landing of a boat 's crew , whose first act no doubt was to tear down an immense black effigy which has been hanging from a pole for a long time . Last night two black deserters came over and reported that seven regiments had left that morning for Fredericksburg , and no doubt they were busy yesterday making preparations for a complete evacuation . By the arrival of the captain 's father tonight from Washington we hear of the taking of Leesburg and the occupation of Centerville . It must have been the fear of having their rear cut off ( Heintzelman ) which made them decamp so suddenly . Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side because we expect to go over now as a matter of course . Nobody could have dreamt of this twentyfour hours ago , but now that it is all over we have relapsed into our usual indifference . 210 // This morning the boys staked out a garden patch for the coming summer , but I fear that the only thing we could raise would be some of the pumpkins , the vines of which grow so rapidly that they overtook the boy that planted them before he got out of the field , and by the time he jumped over the fence he found a full grown pumpkin in his pocket . General Hooker feels a little disappointed that the credit of reducing those batteries was thus snatched away from him . However , it is well enough as it goes . I got a letter from old Fisher asking me to give him all the details about the Whitworth gun . These guns are two miles from our camp and I doubt now whether I will have time to do it . Give my love to all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just returned from a visit to the sacred soil of Secession . My visit was confined in extent to the Shipping Point Battery , the rain preventing a trip to Dumfries 5 miles up the Quantico . The battery is an immensely strong work , with banks at least 15 " thick and provided with plenty of bombproof shelters . It would have been impossible for anything but the Monitor to dislodge them by an attack from the water . Their defenses in the rear were rather weak , but in the front they were next to impregnable . Their camps are very filthy concerns , most of their huts being burrowed in the hillside to the rear of the battery , so as to have bomb-proof roofs . Plenty of provisions are lying about , comprising beef , both raw and roasted , rice , potatoes , flour and cornmeal , dried apples and peaches , crackers , soap , coffee mills but no coffee ; in fact all the necessities of life were present in abundance but no luxuries . Most of the guns were burst and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate magazine . Their cavalry pickets are plainly in sight only 3 miles off , but a small force has 211 THE ROEBLINGS been sent over thus far , most of whom return at night . A large number of letters have been found ; their uniform tenor is hard times , and harder times coming . All their old telegraphic dispatches were found at Dumfries . I saw one of Wigfall 's to Gen. Holmes , asking for immediate reinforcements , because he expected an immediate attack . At Dumfries only women remain , many of them very pretty . Dumfries is one of those ancient Virginia towns finished before the flood and on the decline ever since . I saw a contract dated 1760 , between one Alex . Cunningham of Glasgow , Scotland , and his factor here in Virginia , binding the latter to send a certain number of cargoes of tobacco to Scotland every year . The document is ratified with tremendous seals . Several masked batteries were discovered in unlooked-for places . On the whole we may congratulate ourselves that the rebels evacuated them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since yesterday morning an endless procession of steamers have passed up the river ; it seems as if every river and ocean steamer on the Atlantic coast had been pressed into service from Maine to Fort Monroe . I have seen over fifty go up myself , enough to transport 40,000 men in one day . It looks as if they were going to give our division the go-by and we feel rather bad about it . I am sure , at any rate , that the rebels will rue the day when they abandoned this line of defenses . You may look out for some heavy movements within the next few days . I have understood that the Monitor was to have been immediately sent here after arriving at Fort Monroe , if it had not been for the Merrimac . Budd 's Ferry April 30 , 1862 . I received your letter in due time . Day after tomorrow we C 212 // leave from here for certain . Our destination being , most likely , the York River , in place of Fort Monroe itself . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hooker , and left at 5 this morning for Fort Monroe . I expect we go in schooners towed by steamer . The gun and limbers will have to be taken apart , and lowered in the hold , while the horses will stand on deck . They are sea-going schooners with high bulwarks so that the horses ca n't jump overboard as they did in crossing the river at Ball 's Bluff . Troops are going down the river constantly . The big Constitution went down today . She can hold a brigade . I expect we will have a nice trip going down ; the first job will be to take Yorktown ; most likely the gun-boats hill have to do most of it . The place is very well fortified . Lieutenant Hall , of the regular battery here ( the Fort Sumter man ) , says that the old fortifications , built by Cornwallis , are in good preservation yet and are perfect in construction . This same Hall was employed by Floyd two years in strengthening and enlarging these same fortifications , especially on the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . On the other hand it is a good thing that we have a man in the division who is perfectly familiar with them . It will be a great help to us , having such a man in the division . I am glad to hear that my trunk arrived ? that piece of fiddle music in it is quite a trophy . It used to belong to J. B. Floyd , and has his autograph on it . I had the second , but some damn thief stole it . I scarcely know what directions to give you about my future address . I suppose Hooker 's division , Heintzelman 's Corps , near Fort Monroe or Yorktown will answer . I can probably send you better directions after we get to our destination . I wish the paymaster would come around ; we have n't been paid since shortly after New Year's. 213 j THE ROEBLINGS Washington , May 3i , 1862 . I have not got away from here yet but expect to very shortly . On Wednesday I took all the ropes here over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they can be shipped either by cars or vessel to any point without any intermediate hauling . I have also got all the tools , blocks and tackle , rope , full stock of iron and four hundred bridge bolts ; there . The bolts were made for me by Mr. Cheney at the government shops in Alexandria . He is an old friend of mine from Pittsburgh , formerly of the firm of Baldwin &; Cheney . I shall ascertain tomorrow whether I go out the Manassas Road . Fremont you know is in Strasburg and McDowell within 15 miles of him , so , " good bye Jackson . " The plans which I sent to Gen. Meigs ? the written instructions ? are being printed very nicely . The drawings are being engraved in Philadelphia . I have received several proof sheets already for correction . The engraving is done very well ? 50o copies are to be struck off . I wish they were done ; it would save me a heap of trouble in the way of explaining to folks . In moving the ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a carpenter at work putting in slats ; all slats having no backing under them are broken . The reels , on which the 400 feet lengths are , had better be wider and lower ; they fall over on very slight provocation . The bottoms of all the army wagons used in hauling them were broken through . I met Emerson from Trenton , and Col. Murphy just after . My respects to all . I have just heard some news from our boys through Maj. Webb ' who was there . He says the enemy killed 65 of our horses making it impossible to bring the battery forward , and // that after the regulars had run away from their guns our boys went in and worked them until the end of the fight . Washington , June 9th , 1862 . I am stopping here on my way to Fredericksburg , where they have some idea of rebuilding the road-bridge across the Rappahannock , which was swept away . There are some eight spans , I believe . I also came to see what had become of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forest Royal , and which had not arrived there when I left . I find that Gen. Meigs took it while I was away and sent it to I 1:u-per 's Ferry , without my knowing anything about it , and as I was responsible for it , I was of course a little anxious about it , but it is all right now . I wonder if you ever sent those ropes to Maj. Clary . Who did you send along with the ferry rope to Harper 's Ferry ' ? Address me at Falmouth , Va. , care Maj. D. G. Houston , Gen. McDowell 's staff . I have just heard that Jackson has been reinforced to 6o,000 men and will once more drive everybody over the Potomac ? he is a bully boy . Fredericksburg , June 1862 . I have been here now for a week without doing anything of any account , beyond making a plan for the proposed bridge here , in case they want it , which is questionable , because it will be the fourth bridge here . First there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the bridgebuilders ? creation ? are concentrated here . There is McCallum , chief of the R.Rds. , next Col. Haupt , then Col. Stone and the balance of the former firm of McCallum Bristol &; Co. , and next are the Engineers with two pontoon bridges of 600 ft. each , and a portable trestle bridge . As a matter of course 215 J THE ROEBLINGS these bridge colonels are constantly at loggerheads with each other , each one wanting to have his own way . The bridge , which I may possibly put up , is 1023 ft. long , spans varying from 70 to 8o ft. so that I can get along with 3 ropes on each side . There will be no trouble about putting it up . Two of the piers are gone and have to be replaced by trestles . Planking is so very scarce here that they will most likely have to be sent down from Alexandria . You will also notice that on account of the length of the bridge I have not quite enough , and may have to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusted with the " standstill policy . " On the Tuesday of my arrival the last of McCall 's Division had just left for Richmond , via York River . Shield 's Division is also permanently detached , which leaves McDowell only two divisions ; of these , the greater part of King 's Division is here and the greater part of the other , which is Ord 's old Division , is scattered from Front Royal to Catletts Station . Had Jackson waited one week , McDowell would have been with ' McClellan with 5o,000 men . Now everything is knocked into a cocked hat . It is hinted that King 's Division was ordered to Alexandria to embark from there to Richmond , but that he refused , threatening to resign with all his officers if they did not give him orders to march from here to Richmond over land . King is a trump . I suppose you know that I have received no letter from home yet . Address me care , Maj. D. C. Houston , Gen. McDowell 's staff . I am looking around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell " Ferdie " to send me a box of Bower 's two-cent Plantation cigars , direct by Adam 's Express to Fredericksburg , with my name merely . It is hot here . Give my respects to all . 216 J // Harper 's Ferry , October 27 , 1862 . Your kind letter of the loth has been received . 1 have moved down to Harper 's Ferry with Maj. Houston and am occupying a very decent 2% story brick house , where we intend to make ourselves comfortable if possible . The Maj. has charge of the four forts which are being built here and will probably remain here until after New Year 's . Most likely I shall be here as long too . Therefore address your letters direct to me at Harper 's Ferry ; the Post Office is almost next door . Your hopes that I will have good mechanics to build the bridge are vain , the only men that I can obtain are prisoners , and a very lazy set they are . You speak about some ropes sent here which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have never been used . I have one here which was ordered through Field &; Haron . Let me know the name of the Q.M . who ordered them , and if he is around here , I may be able to make him settle for it . But the best way would be to state the whole case to Meigs who will most likely have it settled at once . Mr. Rhule has not appeared and I guess wo n't come . There will be some fighting soon . Troops are moving down the east side of the Blue Ridge , and the heavy rain of yesterday and before will probably raise the Potomac sufficiently to relieve the large number of troops guarding it . I bet the next battle will be fought near Bull Run again . Give my love to all . Hurry up the strands . It takes 10 days to reach me . Harper 's Ferry , November 13 , 1862 . Your last letter was received , announcing the shipment of wire and box , which however have not arrived as yet , owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the B. &; O. R.R. It generally takes three weeks for anything to get here from Washington , and correspondingly , 6 weeks from Trenton . I returned this evening from a trip to Baltimore to look after my bridge-timber which has only partly arrived as yet . It was well I did so , since I discovered that old Belger 's clerks had made some horrible blunders in transferring my order to the Trenton men . For instance the lower floor plank which I had ordered 2 in. by 12 in. they changed to 12 in. by 12 in. and s cars were standing loaded with these big logs for planking the bridge ; the loss of course falls on the Government . Our dreams of quick happiness for the coming winter were suddenly dispelled by the receipt of an order from Gen. Halleek , appointing Maj. Houston chief eng . to Gen. Banks in the new expedition . Ile left yesterday very much to our regret . I shall most likely join him as soon as I get through here . Houston is a man of line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ranks among the first in the Engineer Corps . On my return from Baltimore I met " Golly Hall ? quite by chance at one of the stations . His regiment is engaged in the delightful duty of guarding a little R.R. bridge , a few miles from Frederick . They will probably stick there all winter . I am short of funds at present and wish you would send me S70 out of the office and a couple of blank M. &; M. checks ; I will send you a check for the amount filled up . There are over $400 pay due me but no chance of getting it for at least five weeks to come , if not longer . Mr. Rhule has had the usual complaint arising from this hard Limestone Water here . By aid of a compress , and keeping quiet , he got over it . Give my love to all . // Head Quarters 21st N. J. Vols. near New Baltimore , Va . November 14th , 1862 . We left Trenton on the twenty-fourth of September for Washington , D.C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the route we were handsomely received at Philadelphia , where we had a good dinner at the Soldiers Retreat . We went in Camp at East Capital Hill , Washington , where we stayed until the first of October . On the first of October we started for Frederick , Md. , and arrived there on the morning of the second , where we encamped just outside of the city . Our camp was called Camp I Iudson . We remained in Camp Hudson until the seventh , when we were ordered to report at Bakersville , a distance of twenty-two miles . We marched from Frederick at six o'clock in the afternoon , and arrived at Middletown at one o'clock a.m. , where we encamped for the night . Some of the boys gave out before they had marched five miles , not being used to marching and being new men . We stayed at Middletown until five o'clock p.m. , when we started on again and arrived at Boonsboro at 8 p.m. , and encamped for the night . Next morning we started again at 8 a.m. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey Brigade . On the 11th we were ordered to Hagerstown . Started at 7 a.m. , and arrived there at 3:30 p.m. , where we encamped . We stayed at Hagerstown about a week . We then started from Hagerstown and arrived at Clear Spring where we encamped . Our regiment did picket duty , one company at a time , about three miles from Clear Spring , for four or five days . We were then ordered nearer the river , where we did picket duty two or three days . Our pickets were on one side of the river and the rebels the other . We then went to Williamsport where we stayed two days . Our men being now quite used to marching , 219 J THE ROEBLINGS marched very well . We then started on again and stopped at Boonsboro again , where we were mustered in for pay . We stayed over night at Boonsboro and started on again in the morning . We passed through Crampton 's Pass , the scene of the late battle , arrived at Petersville in the afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November we started from Petersville and crossed the pontoon bridge at Berlin . Here we took our last look at Maryland , and crossed over into Virginia . We marched about six miles after crossing and then halted for the night . We started again the next day and arrived at White Plains , where we stayed two or three days . At this place we had quite a heavy fall of snow which lasted all day . We next started for this place . About three miles from where we are encamped our regiment was detailed for picket duty . We were apprehensive of the rebels falling on our rear , and it seems , we had a narrow escape , as . there was a rebel brigade within a half a mile from us . We could see their camp-fire plainly from where we were on picket . The night passed without anything occurring and the next day we came to this place . We are encamped about five miles from Warrenton , where there is Railroad communication with Alexandria . On the same sheet of paper there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had evidently been a recent guest at Mr. Swan 's home in Trenton : My time is so much occupied that it seemed almost as though I would never be able to write you , so this morning I set my nephew at work giving you a description of our marches , and will conclude by thanking you kindly for the interest you took in my family , and also , for the favor granted them in accommodating them while at Trenton . It appeared more like our own family while there than like strangers . I am fearful that you think us ungrateful for the kindness received
