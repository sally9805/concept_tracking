txt Business of E. I. du Pont de Nemours 5 . Co .. the country 's largest manufacturer of chemicals . showed a slight seasonal upturn In March , stockholders were told at the annual meeting in Wilmington yesterday . Improvement was shown principally in pigments , rayon cellophane and textile chemicals . However , the management is estimating that sales in the first six months of this year will be about 25% below volume in the corresponding 1937 period . President LA:um:not du Pont , who presided at the meeting , refused to make any estimate of first quarter earnings since the period has not yet been completed . Outlook for First Half Profits Assuming a decline of 25% in sales in the first half of this year . du Pont is unlikely to earn more than around 51 a share from chemical operations in the period and may earn materially less than this . In the first half of 1937 net from chemical operations was about $2.29 a common share . Dividends from General Motors brought the showing for that period to $3.41 a common share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to about 22 cents a share on du Pont 's common stock . The present decline in business of about 25% brings du Pont 's volume down approximately to 1936 levels . However , with costs sharply increased , due to an advance of about 20% in wages , earnings will probably be considerably less than a year ago or in the 1936 first quarter . The chemical trade generally is estimating that a drop of 25% in sales , which is more or less prevalent throughout the industry , will mean a drop of about 50% in profits in view of current operating conditions . In other words , the percentage of decline in net is about twice as great as the percentage of decline in gross . Results in Final 1937 Quarter This is substantiated to some extent by the fact that with a decline of 16% in sales in the final quarter of last year . du Pont showed profits of about 61 cents a share from chemical operations . against about 90 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1936. a decline of about 33% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales , current prices show the lowest profit margins in the history of the industry . Du Pont 's rayon division is third in point of dollar sales among the eleven divisions of the company . The decline in earning power of this division will be an important factor Rffectang first quarter results of the company as a whole .
