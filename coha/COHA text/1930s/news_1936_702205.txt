txt During the last four months I have traveled through many parts of the country and over many miles . It has been my privilege to meet thousands of my fellow-citizens and to address thousands more . Everywhere I have gone I have seen great numbers of men and women who have given both time and energy in making clear , as they understand them , the issues that face the country . To these men and women I want to pay my tribute for performing the duties of citizenship . There has been no campaign for many years in which they have been so sensible of their responsibilities . It is the basic principle of the American form of government that so long as our citizens understand the issues that are before them , their decision will be the right decision . It is the basic principle of our form of government that the issues may be left with safety to the tribunal of the people , a tribunal that has never failed in its duty when given a leadership that respected the combined wisdom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues before them in this election . I am confident that they will go to the polls tomorrow united in one aim ? to vote as Americans for the future of America . A Single and United Nation All regions of our country , all diverse interests within our borders , progress not by themselves , but as parts of a single and united nation . We go to the polls tomorrow not as farmers , not as workers in industry , not as workers on relief . We go as Americans . And when we stand before the ballot box we lay aside the prejudices of section or of group . We vote secure in the knowledge that we are responsible to no authority except the authority of our own conscience . And after we have cast our vote let us be resolved to take up the task that lies before us , not as farmers , not as workers in industry , not as workers on relief , but as Americans , determined to hold this nation united in the future as in the past  --  determined to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep it free . A Grave Responsibility Faced We face tomorrow a grave responsibility . This responsibility is not only to our own well-being in the years just ahead . It is a responsibility to the ideals of free and popular government upon which our nation was founded . It is a responsibility to a world which stands at a parting of the ways . The world needs a free America . We must hold the line of democracy . We dare not fail . Not far from the Kansas home where I am speaking tonight ran the great trails to the West  --  the Santa Fe trail , the Oregon trail , the Overland trail . Across these trails tracked the pioneers . These men and women had energy , determination and selfreliance . They had courage . And they had vision . Through their characters ran simplicity , steadfastness and abiding faith . They gave up comforts , home and quiet ways and dared to go forth through hardship and danger to build a world of the future . We need the courage of those men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the vision that enabled them to look beyond the present and see the world in which their children would prosper and be free . And above all we need their simplicity , their steadfastness and their abiding faith . A Great Task , a Great Destiny We still have before us a great task and a great destiny . We must prove to the world , by our calmness , understanding and unity , that democracy still lives . Let us go to the polls tomorrow resolved to maintain the eternal principles that have made us great  --  love of liberty , a passion for justice , and the habit of human tolerance . Let us resolve to preserve a form of government that is the envy of the world . Let us go resolved that the American way of life shall not . can not fall . And let us go resolved to keep the faith . Let us remember the Almighty God who presided over our beginnings , who carried us through storm and trial , and without whose guidance we can never attain the destiny that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm or in the whirlwind , * * but will be revealed by the still small voice that speaks to the conscience and the heart , prompting us to a wider and wiser humanity .
