Flash Gordon 's Trip to Mars ( Universal ) . A stratospherical chapter of the 15-piece adventures of the fearless Flash , this is a Grade A cinemedition of the famed King Features strip . Chesty Flash ( Larry Crabbe , onetime famed Olympic free-style swimmer ) works desperately to save humanity on Earth from destruction by a nitrogen-destroying lamp erected on Mars . <P> Since the silent-film days the cinema has kept fairly close to earth . To figure out how men in other worlds might look was , to the vaulting cineminds who conceived pictures like A Trip to Mars , By Rocket to the Moon , Jupiter 's Thunderbolt , a mild exercise in ingenuity . But how such out-planeters might talk , especially in conversation with men from Hollywood , has lately presented a weighty problem in linguistics . Flash Gordon is fortunate enough to find some English-speaking Martians , but with true comic-strip vigor , he usually manages to make actions speak louder than words . <P> Bluebeard 's Eighth Wife ( Paramount ) is capricious proof that impish , cheroot-chewing Ernst Lubitsch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of Director Lubitsch 's fun-making is gawky , good-natured Gary Cooper , a wealthy , clean-shaven Bluebeard loose on the Riviera after seven short-order U. S. marriages . Believing that " Lovemaking is the red tape of marriage , " he wants to marry in haste when he meets pertly marriageable Claudette Colbert . When she learns of the previous seven wives , she treats him to six months of honeyless honeymooning . When eventually remorseful Claudette is ready for surrender , Gary is fit for a strait jacket . <P> Airily written , amusingly scored , sprinkled with reliable supporting players , Bluebeard 's Eighth Wife has more deftness than heft , loses speed in the late rounds . Best fun : Actress Colbert warding off ardent Actor Cooper 's advances with a scallion breath , announcing : " I 'll fight you with every vegetable at my disposal . " <P> Mr. Moto 's Gamble .

The availability of Mr. Moto saved the $100,000 , added a feather to the cap of resourceful Producer Sol M. Wurtzel . Later found at his home , Hon. Chan pleaded illness , was granted a leave of absence . <P> So Mr. Moto , a soft-spoken Japanese with poached-egg eyes and a thorough knowledge of jujitsu , solved some nasty criminal problems . A boxing glove soaked in poison , and a gun with a time device set up under the prize ring and pointed at Mr. Moto 's seat all fitted into the pattern of a shady betting deal . Mr. Moto establishes a connection with Charlie by instructing Charlie 's collegiate son , Lee Chan ( Keye Luke ) , in a criminology class . <P> Current &; Choice <P> Merrily We Live ( Constance Bennett , Brian Aherne , Billie Burke , Alan Mowbray ; TIME , March 14 ) . <P> Mad About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 7 ) . <P> Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ( TIME , Dec. 27 ) .
