 | Literary Parasites Condensed from The Bookman ( June , ' 30 ) Clarice Lorenz Aiken Critic and magazine contributor ; wife of the poet Conrad Aiken FEW people realize the insuperable problems that meddlers , sycophants and parasites create for the average author . The rich and famous have always been set upon by parasites . " Poor but proud " people beg money outright from Edison , Ford and Rockefeller , while soidisant prodigies send manuscripts to successful authors for free criticism . There is not much to choose between these two evils : the first picks the philanthropist 's pockets , the second the author 's brains . Intrusions by letter are the commonest impositions ; verbal requests for various favors follow a close second , and there are a hundred other insidious forms . Once in a blue moon the author will receive an anonymous letter expressing delight at his latest book and asking for nothing in return . But such letters are rare as unexpected checks . Most letters are not even worth the time required to open and discard them . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lady writer comes to her real motive : Therefore , I would love to receive a personal reply from you , if you please . Of course , I realize that I am merely a stranger to you , but your answer would be doing me a very great honor indeed ! Unless you consider them too personal , please answer the following questions : Which do you consider the greater influence heredity or environment ? Why ? How can one face the death of a beloved one if reason forbids one to believe in immortality ? What are the titles of your favorite books , and who are your favorite authors ? Which of your own poems do you favor , and why ? What are your hobbies ? What is your philosophy of life ? What do you consider the world needs most in order to make it a better place in which to live ? What , would you say , is the greatest thing in life ? There are three chief reasons for these impositions on authors . The first is the patronizing attitude . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its toy , that he exists by its whim and tolerance . The second reason is the hero-worshipping attitude . The famous man always has been in the public eye and consciousness , and by some curious twist , the world elects him godfather . He should feel pleased at being made much of ! The third reason centers  | around the author 's unsystematic life . Consider the average writer  - -  -  he has no office , no office hours , no secretary . Why should his time not be at the disposal of you and me and our grandmothers ? If he is without means and poets are no longer supported by patrons of art he can not afford a buffer . All too easily taken in by the clamor of these " lost and distracted souls , " he surrenders his time and services . Consider the plight of the hapless author who sits down to breakfast and finds a mountain of letters . Why should he not grow perceptibly inhuman as he reads ? l le is swamped with requests for inscribed books from librarians in North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has libraries ha- colored people , sailors , consumptives , Old Ladies ' Homes , convicts , for the newly converted , etc . ) Requests come in to write a preface for a hopeless book of verse ; requests for his autograph , his photograph ; his favorite poem , story or novel ; requests to criticize a rejected manuscript ; urgent notes to lend his name to charities , movements , causes , which publicity-stunt devotees assure him will bring great prestige . He is asked wo n't he please copy out his favorite work in longhand for Susie Bean 's scrapbook ; wo n't he please write letters of introduction to other celebrities in the interests of a prospective editorial job ; he is asked to judge short story contests and award prizes a privilege generally ending in polite massacre . If he is an anthologist , so much the worse for him . His throat is cut by indignant champions of an omitted author . Why is Lydia Conchshell from Keokuk , Iowa , omitted ? Friends press him to do an obituary of a fellow poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sting . " Shy " literary acquaintances request him to review their first effort , which means favorably , of course ; after which the review will be used as a publisher 's blurb . England can testify to what havoc autograph collectors have reduced banks . Creditors who received checks signed by Shaw , Ga.lsworthy , Hardy and other notables , would neglect cashing them , hoping for a bullish autograph market . When a bearish market came along , hundreds of these checks would suddenly be dumped on the bank cashiers . To outwit these pests , such checks are now signed by the authors ' secretaries . Elsie Singmaster 's mail staggers her afresh each morning . " Dear Madam , " she read one morning , " My daughter has written a very good story which was published in her High School magazine . She does not intend to pursue a literary life , having good  | matrimonial prospects . Do you want to make an offer for the plot of her story for your own use ? Answer , stating price you will pay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Although Gamaliel Bradford insists he has not yet lost the zest that comes from having a charming woman ( as to the charm he is willing to give her the benefit of the doubt ) ask for his autograph or photograph , he is annoyed when the petitioner neglects to enclose postage . Booth Tarkington says that if he answered all the mail he receives , he would not have time to do anything else . " My troubles as an author , " testifies Thornton Burgess , " are nothing as compared with the flood of letters that come to me as a naturalist , because of my radio broadcasts . Apparently I am supposed to be a living encyclopedia . One correspondent says , I have a white albino , I would like your opinion of them . ' Another lady asks me to send her a cure for rheumatism . . .. " Arthur Stringer makes moan over an abomination that will find a large answering chorus : " A new and growing evil , " he says , " which seems to be encouraged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school children writing for autographs and life sketches , because they are studying ' a certain author . " Bertrand Russell writes : " In common with other authors , I suffer a good deal from persons who think that an author ought to do their work for them . Apart from autograph hunters , I get large numbers of letters from persons who wish me to copy out for them the appropriate entry in Who 's Who , or ask me my opinion on points which I have fully discussed in print . I get many letters from Hindus , beseeching me to adopt some form of mysticism ; from young Americans , asking me where I think the line should be drawn in petting ; and from Poles , urging me to admit that while all other nationalism may be bad , that of Poland is wholly noble . I get letters from engineers who can not understand Einstein , and from persons who think I can not understand Genesis , and from husbands whose wives have deserted them not ( they say ) that that would matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what in these circumstances should an enlightened male do ? I get letters trying to get me to advocate abortion , and I get letters from young mothers asking my opinion of bottle-feeding . Little wonder that an author comes to look upon these parasites as something worse than charity-seekers . They interfere with his work and embitter him into the bargain .
