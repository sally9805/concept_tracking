txt CHICAGO , July ** may prove to be a political storm of large dimensions for the local Democratic administration , with repercussions disturbing to Governor Horner and his State regime , is developing in Chicago over drastic action taken by the Board of Education . nominally in the interests of economy . but . by many , suspected of marking the initiation of a permanently restrictive program for the city 's public schools . By an order suddenly promulgated after closed-door sessions of a special committee , the board , by the two-thirds majority necessary to overrule the Superintendent of Schools , abolished Crane Junior College , wiped out the whole junior high school system , eliminated manual training , the teaching of printing , household arts and physical education in all elementary schools , curtailed instruction in music , discontinued the vocational bureau , ' and otherwise depleted and disorganized a system which it had taken years of patient labor and public education to build up . Said to Be Aimed at Deficit . All of this was done to save $5,000,000 in order to amortize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $11,000 , - 000 which had accumulated during the past four or five years . Of that deficit , which is probably less than the maximum estimate , $4,000,000 already had been amortized by shortening the school term . The schools closed two weeks earlier and will open two weeks later than usual th 's year . An instant and indignant outcry - vas raised by leading educators , t - achers , parent-teacher associations and citizens generally . A " Save Our Schools " campaign was launched . The Federation of Women High School Teachers within a few hours was circulating 500,000 dodgers headed " Save Our Schools , " and bearing in parallel columns excerpts from a speech of glowing promises made by Governor Horner on Oct. 12 , 1932. and a summary of the sharply conflicting radical cuts in the educational program ordered by the Chicago Board of Education on July 12 , 1933 . Over the one is the caption , " What the Democrats Promised , " and over the other " What the Democrats Did . " The dodger urges , " Call , write or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Former Mayor Cermak began the work of making the Board of Education Democratic before he was killed . Mayor Kelley recently completed the job by filling remaining vacancies . One of his appointees was made president of the board . Not one member of the board has even the shadow of a record as an educator . The solidity of the party majority in its drastic action is attribpted to party orders . Mayor Kelley disclaims responsibility , but Pat Nash , who is credited with being boss , both in Springfield and Chicago , remains silent , and so far no word has come from the Governor . Experts Oppose Board Policy . Lined up against the board 's policy , among others , are such men as President Robert Maynard Hutchins of the University of Chicago , who has been emphatically outspoken in his denunciations ; Professor Charles H. Judd , dean of the Department of Education at the University of Chicago ; Professor John E. Stout , holding similar office at Northwestern University ; President Lotus D. Coffman of the University of Minnesota and Dr. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two latter authorities were visitors in Chicago at the time the decree was promulgated . The closing of Crane Junior College shuts the doors on nearly 4,000 present students and blights the hopes of marry more who planned to enroll in September . The abolition of the junior high schools is declared by the educators to be a reactionary step of calamitous significance . It is pointed out that by spreading amortization of the deficit it could be completed not later than the Summer of 1933 if the shortened school term were continued for that period . The system would not be disturbed by that method . It is further urged that large economies are still possible in the care and operation of school plants , a direction in which the trustees have seemed strangely reluctant to explore . Mass meetings are being held , attended in large numbers by irate parents . Precinct organization is being effected throughout the city . The immediate purpose is an effort to obtain a rescinding of the order , but the assertion is made widely that the organization will be carried into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers behind the board defiant . Abolition of the Board of Education is vigorously advocated . That may make an issue for some aspiring Republican or independent . No politician has yet shown his hand in an attempt to capitalize the movement . but undoubtedly factional party opponents of the present regime are watching events with keen interest .
