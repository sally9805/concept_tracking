txt Release of the first instalment of the Eastman railroad and transportation coordination report is impending . It is likely to cover railroad consolidation , financial , rate making , labor and other basic railroad and transportation policy matters . Special studies covered will be incorporated in appendices to the recommendations . The report will be accompanied by comments of the ICC . It will go to the White House and to Congress . Federal Coordifiator of Transportation Joseph B. Eastman has been working on a plan for remedying the railroad situation . He has used as his base for consolidation studies the so-called Prince Plan . This plan would result in comparatively few systems serving the country . In the East . where consolidation has made the most progress so far , it would build up one system around the Pennsylvania and one around the New York Central Railroad . The Administration is represented as favoring portions of the Prince Plan as a means of solving the railroad problem , but it also believes that additional safeguards for the protection of labor should be allowed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in the number of employes required . However . Congress in its emergency ' legislation last year provided that the work of the coordinator in solving the railroad problem should not result in lowering the number of railroad workers below the May . 1933 , level , and with traffic volume rising , vast consolidations could be worked out which would bring about savings for the carriers without reducing the number of workers below the 1933 level . 4-Trunk Line Plan Put First I-. some railroad quarters the possibility of putting into effect any such grand scale plan as that of F. H. Prince of Boston is regarded as remote . Some say it could not happen without Government ownership . - In these quarters it is pointed out that first , step toward consolidating the carriers would be to make the four trunk line plan for the East an actuality . The Interstate Commerce Commission several years ago was ordered to draw up a plan for consolidation of the railroads of the country . In the East it finally approved the plan as agreed to by the Pennsylvania . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio-Nickel Plate systems A large part of eastern consolidation has beed effected . The greatest draw-back to its completion is that the Pennsylvania has a large stock interest in the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad and the Boston Maine in New England . The governors of the New England states have constantly opposed the entrance of the P. R. R. into their territory . The Interstate Commerce Commission has also opposed it . Probably the reason that the Pennsylvania bought into the New Haven and the B. &; M. was that the New York Central controlled the Boston ? Albany . It is argued in some quarters that if the New York Central would give up the B. &; A , the P. R. R. would be willing to get out of New England . Situations of Two Roads Differ On the other hand , it Is pointed out that the Boston &; Albany simply gives the New York Central access to Boston on through traffic . The road does Little of the local business that is done by the New Haven and the Boston &; Maine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , the Central would serve only one Atlantic . seaport unless it got the Virginian which would give it access to Norfolk . If the New England situation was cleared up , it is regarded as probable that the I. C. C. would remove the trusteeship order from the Western Maryland holdings of the B. &; 0. , and then some plan could be evolved for bringing Jo road into the B &; 0 . system . The B. &; 0 . has already made the Alton , the Buffalo , Rochester &; Pittsburgh and the Buffalo &; Susquehanna in its system The C. &; ** Plate system has placed its principal officials in control of the reads allocated to it in the four-party plan . The Central in recent years has increased its holdings of Delaware , Lackawanna stock . While its total holdings are now only about 10 , ; ; - of the stock outstanding , First National Bank interest are piominent holders of both Central and D. L .. &; W.                @ @ @ @ @
