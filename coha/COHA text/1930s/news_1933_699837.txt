txt Never before in the Grand Casino de I'Surope were the players so numerous or the stakes so high . In the old days it was simple . The game was Diplomacy and the players were a halfdozen only , all Europeans . You could always tell who were partners . With a little knowledge of the jargon you could follow the game well enough . But in these days there are over fifty players , drawn from the four quarters of the world , and the game is monstrously complicated . It is politics , economics and finance all rolled into one . It embraces ? disarmament , war-debts , tariffs , and peace-treaty revision  --  the Issues between gold and managed currencies , inflation asid.dellation , dictatorship and democracy . cornrnunism and capitalism . ? The Casino is a. babel of tonxges , a . P.04440911 of grievances and claims , a battleground of theories . The din of vo'ces deafens the ear , the conflict of opinion befuddles the mind . And everything shifts with amazing rapidity , bewildering the eye . The Casino itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game will become more complicated still . What has been the game at Geneva ? What will be the game in London ? The Geneva Game Relatively simple , this Geneva game , if reduced to essentials . In theory the aim is to get the world to disarm . In fact it is to get France to disarm on land . It there were no Germany , the thing could be done in a trice . True that Germany Is disarmed , at least on paper , but she can rearm . And nothing is more certain than that she will rearm unless France disarms . Imagine , said a French diplomat , a man with a revolver in face of a man without one . This latter had a revolver once and fired at the other , but missed and was disarmed . He is a notorious fighter . Nothing suits him better than to play soldier , even with a dummy gun . He refuses to stay disarmed . " Either the other man throws his gun away or I get mine back , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitates . She says she will lay down her gun if a policeman with a gun will stand by and keep order . She suggests that the League of Nations be the policeman . But if only because no two nations can agree whose orders or what orders this policeman shall obey . her suggestion falls flat . She has a second suggestion . It is that England or America or both together shall pledge themselves to stand by and keep order . If Germany attacks , they will defend her . But just what is " attack ? " It can be provoked . De . fense can look like menace of aggression . No man at Geneva or elsewhere has yet discovered a definition of aggression that will satisfy everybody , and no man at Geneva or elsewhere ever will . Hence the deadlock . France retains her gun . Germany threatens to make or buy one . Geneva splits words in the search for formulas . The London Game The London game , to open June 12 , hangs a lot on the issue of the Geneva game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite issue before June 12 , will open at a disadvantage . The argu. meat was that unless the world 's nations could be got to agree on disarming , they could not regain confidence in each other and themselves , and that without such confidence they could not develop business with each other . It seems all if the argument must be abandoned . Enough remains on the agenda , officially or unofficially  --  in the latter category war-debts ' and international indebtedness generally , especially Germany 's , in the former monetary and credit policy , exchange difficulties , price . levels , movements of capital , commercial inter. , changes , producers ' agreements , etc. , etc . The aim is clear : ? to stabilize moneys and remove the barriers on international movement of capi. tat and goods . The means are just the contrary . The conflict of view extends everywhere ? . to monetary , credit , tariff policies . Consider simply the differences between the attitudes of the three Powers upon whose cooperation every . thing depends , France , England and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not too lucid , accord . ing to reports received here , but at least Washington appears to have placed its faith in a policy of price-raising by inflation of credit and devaluation of currency . Londol is not prepared for inflation if only because it would mean the loss of the hundreds of millions of dollars of foreign capital which has taken refuge in the city . While Neville Chamberlain , Chancellor of the Exchequer , puts the raising of world prices to a , more satisfactory level as the first objective of the Economic Conference , he hastens to add that he has always held the view that " we can . not raise prices by monetary action alone . " " I am sure , " he says , " the revival of international trade is essential to an increase in prices . " Regarding currency , he holds " we want to protect the currencies of the world from fluctuations having no relation to ' their intrinsic values , " and cites a stable international monetary standard as the complete essential to thor . ough restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation and pledged to deflation . Washington would apparently like to return to stability of currency without too long delay , as would London . But the one will not act before the other , and the two can not agree .. in what should be the relation between dollar and sterling . Let them find their natural levels is the retort , but how can moneys find their natural levels when capital the world over is prevented from flowing to and fro naturally by a thousand barriers or as driven hither and thither simply by fear of loss and not chance of gain . Paris for Sound Money First Washington and London no doubt agree privately that without stabilization of currencies there can be no reduction of tariff barriers . It is Paris 's declared theme . Paris says to Washington and London that talk of economic disarmament is hopeless without preliminary return to sound money . She would , if she could , postpone the conference until then . London argues that until war-debts are settled she can not stabilize without risk of being driven off stability by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss debts , knowing well the opposition of American sentiment to their reduction , much less abolition , Both Paris and London maintain that , If war-debts are to be paid in any form , they must he paid in goods , and therefore America must lower her tariffs . Washington suggests timidly that it Eli. rope would grant facilities to American imports , some reduction of wax-debts might be con. sidered . But Europe with one voice replies that to pay any war-debt annuities she must export so much more to America and import from America , if not less , at least no more than now . America wants a bigger export-surplus plus payment of war-debts ; Europe is disposed to think that payment of war-debts means for America an import-surplus . Washington and London contend that stabilization of economic conditions must precede monetary stabilization . Paris contends that there can be no stabilization of economic conditions without preceding monetary stabilization . On what do these three Powers agree ? Seemingly nothing . Then what hope of getting them to agree lies in the convocation of 66 nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the conference will open .
