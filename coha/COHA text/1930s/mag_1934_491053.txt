GARET GAL2AZTV I T IS supposed that we debate a monetary policy . The President speaks of Tories , foes and mules . A former candidate for President speaks of crackpots , guinea pigs and baloney . Ecclesiastics hurl economic imprecations from the pulpit ; they speak of currency and Christ together in one accent of passion and become so excited that from opposite sides they denounce one another 's personal and mental merits , being themselves divided . on the money question , not by sect or denomination , but by whatever it is . The dismalities of the professional economist are made human by emotion and epithet and by the hitherto unheard of treachery of one casting up to another his record for wrong fortune-telling . Conventions go the way of political amenities into the dust . Scientists and philosophers descend to the pavement to exchange blows with all corners . The most notable example of this is not ours ; we borrow it from England . Frederick Soddy , famous in the world for his explorations into the structure of matter ' , turns his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . Shouting , " I am a scientist , so listen tome , " he produces a book called Wealth , Virtual Wealth and Debt , in which he discovers a conspiracy of finance to enslave the world , a conspiracy of editors to suppress the truth , and , by suggestion , a conspiracy of Jews " to reestablish by gold the dominance they were wont to derive from God . " The Eligibility Rules CH that passes for reaV1 soning is inferior to the invective . An eminent United States senator says , " The ones you hear howling about sound money are the ones who own securities " ( Borah , New York Times , Nov. 25 ) . As if that had anything to do with it ; or as if the status and purity of not owning securities qualified one to think and speak about money as one should , in which ease the absurdity follows that those who put their savings into Government bonds to support the Government 's credit for all purposes , including purposes of relief , and come thereby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to discuss the Government 's monetary policies . Those who hold for cheap money say , " Under your sacred gold standard we have had these four years of frightful economic depression . " The answer is , " The prosperity you are trying in vain to restore with cheap money was prosperity under the gold standard . " This is not reasoning , the answer no more than what is answered . You may have booms and depressions with any kind of money . The best of money will never save people from involving themselves in economic disaster by folly , whereas people who know how may manage very well with poor money . American Augurs HE only reality is what hap-1 pens from . day to day , and the meaning of that is in dispute . What will happen next nobody can prove until it happens . Hence speculation in commodities that are priced in money , speculation in money itself , and the running of money to and Fro in the world seeking its own safety . It is not recorded that the Romans ever referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet they might have done it . The augurs were those who foretold , by signs , what would happen , and one of the signs was the appearance of the entrails in the body of a sacrificed animal . The power of the augurs may be understood from the fact that no business of any importance could proceed until they had been consulted . The augurs in our modern ease are the chart makers . Chart gazing becomes a solemn performance . The Government now prints literally thousands of charts on which the official statisticians draw tortured lines to represent what happened a year ago , a month ago , a week ago , yesterday and today , in the economic viscera , and the idea is that one who can interpret the sign value of the lines will be able to foretell the future . ' No step in national monetary policy is taken without reference to these pictures of omen . Financial advisers spend a good deal of time gazing on them . One says , " Here is the price lino , " tracing that out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out . " Now , if we fix the price of gold at thirty-four point five , what will happen to the price line ? " Nobody knows for sure . Prices will either rise or fall ; that is certain , just . as the Roman augurs could be certain that the undertaking would either prosper or fail , and they had to guess which . Instead of killing a sheep and fiddling with its insides , we draw the entrails on quadruled paper , and that , of course , is a very superior way ; as to the future , we are no more sure of it than the Romans were . Seeing this , and that the experts , the practitioners and the professors of economic science can not themselves agree , there are those who say , some cynically and some by earnest confession , " Nobody knows what is final about money . " This now in fact , is a common saying , and it may well be true . But the conclusion that since everybody gets lost in the theory of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an.other 's , is , nevertheless , absurd . Neither does anybody know what is final about matter , nor can an engineer tell you why at last two and two make four . All the same , he has a working knowledge of materials which , together with a simple use of mathematics , enables him to construct a sound bridge . We do not say that since he knows nothing about matter really and that since neither he nor the greatest mathematician is able to say why two and two are four , therefore , a bridge is a piece of guesswork , a superstition or an engineering fetish . No . We let the engineer build the bridge , requiring only that it shall do what he says it will do . He sets a legend on it , saying it will hold up to a certain point of strain ; beyond that , he is not responsible . If it breaks under less than that certain load limit , we blame him and change engineers ; but if we exceed the load limit and the bridge falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a bridge we are rational ; about money we are not . of the sun 's stability . Whether the earth went round the sun or the sun went round the earth , it would all look and feel the same ; as touching people in any physical sense , it made no difference at all which was true . Over such a question , nevertheless , otherwise intelligent human beings burned a-nd mutilated one another . Merely as a fanatical dispute about astronomical facts it makes no sense whatever . But it was never that . They were talking of celestial mechanics and thinking all the time of something very different . They could not accept the astronomical facts and still believe what else they wished to believe , nor could they imagine believing what else they believed otherwise than as they believed it then , literally and simply . Therefore they were unwilling to face the facts . But certainly it was no state of astronomical facts that could move them so deeply , no question of the sun 's stability that divided them to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing less than fear of losing heaven . And so now we appear to be debating monetary mechanics in a language of high emotion , whereas , first , it is impossible in that imprecise language to state the technical facts about money , and whereas , secondly , very few people have either the patience or the qualities of mind to be really interested in the difficulties of the subject . How many of those who utter rhetorical judgments on the gold dollar know or really care how many grains of gold are in it ? How many can explain why the number is what it is or how changing it will affect human welfare  --  if it . will ? Where is there a common definition of the difference between currency and credit inflation ? The stability of money , a commodity dollar , devaluation  --  such as these are the ideas involved in a new monetary policy , and there is no emotional access to their meaning . Stability of money . Begin with that . Who knows precisely what it means or how it would work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have a constant . purchasing power , a. dollar that will buy at all times the same quantity of composite things . Do you look at the word " composite " ? You may ask what a composite quantity is and why a dollar of constant purchasing power will not buy at all times the same quantity of anything you may happen to want . Well , because that is impossible , and it is impossible because stability is a. thing that may be either true or untrue , or both true and untrue at the same time , and you could never be quite sure . Unstable Money or Unstable Commodities ? AS TEE things we buy go up and clown in price a dollar buys less or more of them  --  less as they go up and more as they go down  --  and from this we say the purchasing power of money fluctuates . Conclusion : Money is unstable . But we say also the sun rises and sets , because it looks that way , whereas we know that the sun stands still and the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation that the sun comes up and goes down ; it may appear in the same way to be true that the purchasing power of money fluctuates . That is not to say purchasing power of money does not . fluctuate , for actually it may and does ; but again it may seem true when untrue . You may be standing on your head without knowing it . We think always of buying things with dollars . There is habit in that point of view . But suppose you think of buying dollars with things . We are all of us continually doing that ; it is the other side of every transaction , the other point of view . How else do we get dollars ? We buy dollars with our labor , with wheat , with cotton , and so on . When the thing we sell is dear , it buys more dollars ; when the thing we sell is cheap , it buys fewer dollars , Where , then , is the instability ? Is it the purchasing power of money that fluctuates or the purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we mean the value of money priced in things or the value pf things priced in money ? You may think on it until you are dizzy , or until it occurs to you that stability itself is the delusion . There is no such thing . There are only degrees of instability . No absolute standard of value is possible , nor is there such a thing as an absolute definition of value . For purposes of exchange there needs to be something in which it will he convenient to price everything else  --  that is to say , money ; and for money it is an act . of natural intelligence to select some imperishable , honorable , incorruptible substance , widely diffused in the world , neither plentiful Emotional Monetary Mechanics B iIT are we not deceiving ourselves in the first premise ? Are we debating a monetary policy ? Is it not something else in disguise ? Only a few hundred years ago one who said the world was round and turned in space was a heretic , liable to be burned at the stake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obliged by the Inquisition at Rome to abjure the heresy nor scarce , that has for as many physical and psychic reasons as possible , a low degree of instability . That substance happens to be gold . That is all you can say . It happens to be gold . Next to gold it is silver . Gold and silver happen to he the two natural money metals . On their comparative merits for purposes of money , on the superiority of gold alone as a universal standard of value , on why a single standard is preferable to a double standard of both gold and silver , which is called bimetallism , there exIsts an immense body of precise and dreary literature . But when the money question is in the street. , it is a trial of patience even to recite the facts of experience . Reason does not act . Emotion does . It goes beyond prejudice , beyond greed and envy , and you come at last to something that is akin to religious conviction . Money is forgotten . Neither the goodness nor badness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces are in conflict. , by a rule of ancient antagonism . On one side the symbol is silver ; on the other side it is gold . Silver is held up to be the money of the people , the money of the poor , the money of the debtor , as against gold that is to be execrated as the money of the rich . Bryan 's Cross of Gold F ORTY years ago this same conflict was on foot . The same emotions that now are running were running then ; the same forces that now are acting were acting then . You will read in all the histories that the struggle at that time was between sound and unsound money , and sound money won . So it . did . And yet William Jennings Bryan was not thinking of money , was not speaking of it really , when , in 1896 , at the Chicago convention , he seized the Democratic nomination for President with a speech that had this terrific peroration : " We beg no longer . We entreat no more . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them : You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns . You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold . " Can it be supposed that what we were debating then was a monetary policy , with one side holding in its mind an image of crucifixion ? That was a social crisis . And it passed . Mr. Bryan himself lived happily thereafter and prospered in a gold-standard country . For uses of money neither gold nor silver is ideal . Neither one is quite stable ; it is enough to say that their degree of instability is lower than that of , perhaps , any other two substances that might be conveniently used for money . This relative constancy is owing principally to the fact . that the amount of labor necessary to produce them varies less over long periods of time than the amount of labor required to produce perishable things  --  food , commodities and manufactures . This is especially true of gold , wherein lies some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of both gold and silver is variable , and as the supply varies , their value in terms of other things must vary also . It is a fact , therefore , that the purchasing power of either gold or silver will fluctuate , causing prices to rise and fall . But the degree in which prices are affected by the instability of gold and silver  --  or of gold alone , let us say , to simplify the statement  --  the degree of this is as nothing if you compare it with the degree in which prices are affected by the greater instability of paper money , credit money and bank-check money . These invented forms of printed money may be limited by law in ratio to a gold reserve ; nevertheless , they expand and contract in a very volatile manner . When people are adventurous with money and business is good , they expand ; when the economic weather is bad , they contract . Since the quantity of these invented forms of printed money is twenty , thirty , maybe forty times greater than the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instability is much greater than that of either gold or silver , you may see that the purchasing power of money in general may rise or fall very steeply with no reference whatever to either gold or silver as a standard of value . So you have now two causes of instability . One is that the supply of gold or silver , or both together , is not absolutely constant ; but that is not . very serious . The second cause is that the great pyramid of paper and credit money inverted on a base of gold or silver , or both , is liable to contract or expand in a sudden manner ; and this is serious . But there is a third and major source of instability in things themselves , from changes unpredictable and uncontrollable in the relation of supply to demand . For example , let money of all kinds be absolutely stable for a season , but let the production of wheat in that season be doubled whore there has been no increase of demand . What will happen ? The price of wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchasing power of wheat has fallen or that the purchasing power of money has risen ? Either statement will make perfect sense . If the price of wheat has fallen from one dollar to fifty cents a bushel , then it takes two bushels of wheat to buy a dollar where one bushel was exchanged for a dollar before . Therefore , the purchasing power of wheat has fallen . On the other side , one dollar buys twice as much wheat as before . Therefore , the purchasing power of money has risen . Three Factors of Instability ALL the time continuously these three factors of instability are acting ; all the time continuously prices are changing . Prices are the effect . A way of allocating the effect among the three factors of instability is unknown . Practically it is impossible . The only certainty is that the least part of the price . effect is owing to the instability of gold or silver . The point here is that what happens to money will be only one cause of what may happen to prices ; moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the instability of money is responsible for the instability of prices . In nearly every way of the new economic thinking it is assumed that stability of prices would be a blessed thing . It might be . We can not be sure . There is no experience of it in human history . The one appearance of price stability in modern times was during the seven years immediately preceding this depression . For seven years the average price of commodities , or , as we say , the commodity index , ran in a horizontal line . Then came the most . violent collapse of prices that was ever known . Maybe the level was too high . Maybe it was only that everybody went broke in the stock-market boom wherein this wonderful first appearance of price stability had been fantastically capitalized . However , the idea of price stability as the great social desideratum survived and now becomes the leading theme . How shall this stability he achieved ? By making the purchasing power of money constant . And how shall the purchasing power of money he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , there is a statistical device called the commodity index number . What it represents is the average price of several hundred different commodities . There is your composile quantity of things . Now , let the index number start at 100 . If it falls to 95 , the gold content of the dollar is reduced to cheapen the dollar mild prices rise and the index number stands again at 100 . But suppose prices rise too much and the index number goes to 105 . In that . ea-se the gold content of the dollar is increased to make the dollar dear rust prices fall and the index mimber stands again at 100 . This dollar , which is thus cheapened as prices fall to make them rise again , or made dear as prices rise to make them fall again , is variously called the commodity dollar , he compensated dollar , the managed dollar , the automatie dollar , and by some the rubber dollar . The merit of it will he the constancy of its purchasing power  --  that is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , today , tomorrow , and  --  well , perhaps not forever . but for maybe a. generation . The Scapegoat Dollar The maximum of clarity occurs in the elementary statement . of what such a dollar would be and do . I It may he that the less you think of it the clearer it will stay . A stability of prices is to he achieved by means of a dollar that shall have a changeable value . Thus , the instability of things will be transferred to money , or , that is to say , the instability of things shall he absorbed by the instability of the dollar . The value of the dollar will he changed by adding to or subtracting from its gold content , a grain more today or a grain less tomorrnw , as the need may he statistically indicated for fewer and dearer dollars to stop a rise in prices , or for more and cheaper dollars to stop a fall in prices . The whole idea is that the purchasing power of ( his dollar shall be constant . ? But since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it be said that a dollar constant in purchasing power is cheap or dear , or that its value changes at all ? In relation to what , is it cheap or dear ? in relation to what , does its value change ? In relation to gold only . And why in relation to gold ' ? Because gold at last is the least instable thing of all . Thus , an appearance of price stability is to be produced by introducing between gold and things a dollar that shall he stable in relation to things and instable in relation to gold . Do you follow ? It may occur to you that people in that case would price things in both gold and dollars , so that . there would he two sets of prices  --  dollar prices stable in this new way and also gold prices , going up and down as before . To avoid this it would , perhaps , be necessary for the Government permanently to impound all gold and forbid the private use of it as money . That would seem to ensue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be done with it ? The answer is curious . Without gold the Government could not manipulate the value of the dollar . It . must . have something in which to price its own dollars . A stability of prices produced by means of a changeable dollar creates the necessity for something to stand still , else nobody could tell when the dollar was changing . Our financial system might become a flying universe and nobody would know it . The thing to stand still  --  relatively still  --  is gold as before . Defining Devaluation Here leave this stability in its own suspense . Does it excite you ? As a piece of monetary mechanism it . is wonderful , whether it works or not but . does it move you emotionally ? Certainly not . Devaluation , then . What is that ? It is another thing , and yet not another thing entirely , since it runs on the same chart and belongs to the same way of thinking . Suppose you are going to have stability of prices by means of a changeable dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level to begin with ? All these controlling ideas , remember , crystallized after a long and terrible depression , with prices in a slough . Nobody wished them to be stabilized there , because , if they were , a third of the country 's inflated capital structure would appear to be lost . At these very low prices , of course , the purchasing power of the dollar was high  --  which is to say , as we do say , the dollar was dear . Here again is that question of what moves , or where you stand to look . Was the cheapness of things owing to the dearness of the dollar or was the dearness of the dollar owing to the cheapness of things ? Had prices fallen or had the dollar risen ? This was never determined . It was not even debated . Simply , prices were too low and by the same measure the dollar was too high . Therefore , the way to lift prices was to depress the dollar . If there was any validity in the theory that prices at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or subtracting from the gold content . of the dollar a grain at a time , it followed in logic that prices could be lifted from a low level to a high level by a radical reduction in the gold content of the dollar to begin with . For one hundred years the legal gold content of the dollar had been 23.22 grains of fine gold . That was an arbitrary , absolute fact , like the cubic content of the bushel measure or the weight of a pound . This had nothing to do with the gold standard or gold solvency . For seventeen years , from 1801 to 1879 , the Government was a paper-money basis and unable to redeem its notes in gold , and yet the gold content of the dollar was not touched , and when the Government was solvent again and resumed gold Payments , there were still 23.22 grains of fine gold in a gold dollar . Several times during that one hundred years practically all the banks in the country shut up and temporarily no private obligation could be paid in gold ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar . Nor did anybody think of it in the 1890 's , when a cheap-money mania was upon us . The cheap-money people did demand the unlimited coinage of silver , but it was not proposed to abstract gold from the gold dollar . The idea of manipulating prices by manipulating the dollar , in the public interest , was not new . It belonged to a sect of evangelical economists who had no mission but this . They had proved it by charts and in their visions . Suddenly they were in a position to try it as an experiment in reality . That is to say , in the year 1933 they sold it . to the inflationists in Washington . Adventures of the Dollar But when the time came to begin the experiment in the world of reality , one factor was unknown . That was how much of the dollar 's gold content it would be necessary to abstract in order to produce a certain effect . Say , for example , that the effect desired was a rise in prices to the level of 1926 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold content of the dollar have to be reduced ? This nobody knew . So what Congress did was to pass a law giving the President the authority to reduce it as much as he might see fit , down to one-half . The Government had already impounded all the gold , had made it a crime for a private person to possess either gold or a gold certificate , the gold certificate being a kind of paper money specifically redeemable in gold coin . Also at the same time Congress repudiated the solemn promise written on the face of every United States Government bond  --  namely , the promise to redeem it when it should come due in the kind of money the owner of the bond had paid for it  --  that is to say , gold-standard money . These steps were all necessary in order that the Government should be able to control the experiment . If people were left to choose between statistical money and gold-standard money , even though the statistical money should he guaranteed to have eventually : 1 constant buying power , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred gold-standard money , so they would wreck the experiment . Gold had to be removed from them . Well , then we were off the gold standard and on nothing in place of it . The American dollar was a paper dollar and there was no other kind of dollar , and the power to say what this dollar was worth was in the hands of the President and the statistical augurs and those of his financial advisers who believed money was much too dear and should be cheapened in the public interest . The dollar began to fall , of course ; and prices rose . The two happenings were simultaneous and the rise in prices was at . first in a very rough way proportional to the fail of the dollar , and yet no exact relation can ever be proved . Much of the rise in prices undoubtedly was owing to the thought . that the general monetary policy of the Government would be for a long time inflationary , the devaluation of the dollar being but one of the steps . But how could anybody tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only dollar there was . You cannotprice a paper dollar in paper dollars any more than you can price gold in gold . A paper dollar is worth a paper dollar , just as an ounce of gold is worth an ounce of gold , and that is all there is of it . So what was the proof that the dollar was falling ? The proof was in the international money markets , where the dollar was priced in other people 's currency . It took more and more American piper dollars to buy a pound sterling in London , or fewer and fewer gold francs to buy an American paper dollar in Paris . When the international exchange value of the dollar had fallen about one-third , the whole world was in an uproar of speculation . At what point did the President mean to fix the gold content of the dollar to stop its fall ? The President said nothing about that ; he did say gold was a fetish and that the Government 's policy would be to cheapen the dollar until prices were raised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion . Nevertheless , the dollar stopped falling , as if it had found its natural point of resistance , and at the same time prices stopped rising ; and when the Government was silent about this temporary equilibrium , conservative opinion began to take heart and the inflationists began to say they were betrayed . But the Government had some bonds to sell ; it was in need of money . To be selling new bonds with one hand and to be depressing with the other hand at . the same time the value of the money in which the bonds would he redeemable was too experimental even for rubber-dollar theory . During the bond sale the dollar was permitted to revive , and its strength , everything considered , was amazing . But when the bonds were all well sold the Government returned to the business of depressing the dollar . It was not yet cheap enough ; it did not go down fast enough , in terms of other people 's money . Other people , especially the British , valued it too high . Swinging the Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own money with a club . The club was gold . This now is the beginning of the bewildering gold-purchase plan . The Government announced one Sunday night that it was going to buy gold . It did not want any more gold . It wanted only to cheapen the paper dollar . It sounds absurd as a statement , yet that was the official plan , publicly declared , intent and all . And to cheapen the dollar the Government purposely , by daily announcement , increased the number of paper dollars it would give for an ounce of gold , until actually it was giving more paper dollars for an ounce of gold than an ounce of gold was worth in paper dollars . Proof of this curious fact was that the Government gave more paper dollars for an ounce of gold at Washington than an individual , using the same paper dollars , would have had to pay for an ounce of gold in London . The dollar fell , of course ; the gold club so far worked . Yet prices did not rise as the charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go wrong with the charts . That fact of reality that we call people was not behaving in the charted manner . Where before there had been confusion and doubt , now there was foreboding . In Wall Street people were exchanging dollars for pounds sterling , for francs , even for South American currencies . They should n't , of course , according to the THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 3,1,0114 chart ; they should n't according to anything . Yet they would . And then again the Government was in need of money ; again it had more bonds to sell . And there ensued a second period of calm , cynically referred to as another " sound-money interlude , " during which time the number of paper dollars the Government would give for an ounce of gold was not increased . And during this time , also , the Government itself became involved in that question of what moves or where you stand to look . it began to talk of the stability of the dollar it had been devaluing with a club , and of the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It gave out to the newspaper correspondents the figures of a fever chart on which the pound sterling and the French franc appeared to have been rising like rockets . But in terms of what had they risen ? In terms of the American paper dollar . A chart showing the value of the American paper dollar in terms of the pound sterling and the French franc would have shown that while the pound and the franc stood still , the dollar had fallen headlong . Which was it . happened ? Either chart was true . That only shows what can be done with charts . The fact . is , as all the rest of the ' world knew , that the pound sterling and the French franc were all that time standing practically still . It was the dollar falling through space , and we ' were on the dollar , looking at other people 's money . When it is finished , as sometime it must . be . this isolate experiment will take its place as one of the very strange episodes in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world that gold money is a fetish , nevertheless using that fetish as a club to heat down the value of its own paper money ! The Government , its statistical augurs and its financial advisers were saying all the time that Great Britain bad done the same thing ; we were doing to our money only what Great Britain had done to hers on leaving the gold standard , and for the same ends . Well , facts themselves may evanish . While they survive , it may be well to set them down , before theory has time to eat them up . What Great Britain did was very different . What Britain Did Was Different This is what she did : First , she was obliged to leave the gold standard. ; her gold gave out . In that dilemma she stopped the increase of public expenditures and the increase of public debt. , forbade inflation to take place or prices to rise in England , and then let the pound sterling fall , not in England but in all the money markets of the outside world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did prices rise . It is true that they set up what they called an exchange equalization fund and used it to cheapen the pound sterling , but again , not in England , only in the money markets of the world outside , where they sold pounds for dollars and pounds for francs , and so on . The intent of thus cheapening the pound sterling outside of England was to give the world a cheaper pound with which to buy British goods ; the effect was simply that of cutting prices to the export trade in order to increase British exports , and it worked . It would not have worked if there had been inflation in England or if prices had been permitted to rise in England , for if prices had risen in England as the pound sterling was cheapened outside there could have been no benefit what : ever to the export ! trade . And what have we done that was like that ? In the first place , we were not obliged to leave the gold standard . We had plenty of gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking of inflation and even if , temporarily , we should have been obliged for that reason to suspend gold payments , still that would have created no necessity to leave the gold standard . And then , having left the gold standard , we embraced all these ideas of cheapening the dollar purposely in order to increase public expenditures , to increase the public debt and to raise prices internally by credit and currency inflation  --  in each case the exact opposite of what Great Britain did . So all of that is devaluation , for anything you can make of it . There is but one lucid statement . that can be made about it . It is this : There is no point to any devaluation of the dollar unless you mean to make more dollars ; and there is no point in making more dollars unless you intend inflation . Three Groups of Inflationists Inflation is the omnibus idea on which all the others ride . Every experiment proposed to be made with money looks to inflation , either directly or obliquely  --  even the commodity dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability  --  but not until prices have been raised to a high level by an intermediate process of inflation . That " not until " explains why the inflationists go along with the theory of a commodity dollar . What they want is the inflation first . Senator Thomas , of Oklahoma , author of the inflation law that was passed in the 1933 session of Congress , refers to three groups of inflationists  --  namely , the devaluationists , the silver people and the green backers . The green-backers are those who are for simply stamping the United States Treasury emblem on paper and calling it money . They get their name from the green-paper currency issued during the Civil War . Senator Thomas says these three groups will stand together to demand adequate inflation , as , of course , they will . Ile divided among them the inflation law that bears his name  --  the law , that is , authorizing the President ( 1 ) to reduce the gold content of the dollar as much as one-half , ( 2 ) to print and issue $3,000,000.000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries on account of their war debts silver bullion above its market value and issue against it silver certificates as legal-tender motley . The carry-all character of this law is significant . It bears witness to how little the emotional inflationist is interested in monetary policy as such . Any way to cheapen money will do . Rubber money will do , greenbacks will do , silver will do . Anything for inflation . And still it . is not inflation they are thinking of really ; they think of it so little that they do not attempt to define it exactly . They are thinking only of what inflation will do , any kind of inflation , as they believe , provided it is enough . And what will inflation do , any kind , only enough ? The first idea is that inflation will restore prices . Restore them to what ? Well , as the wish is , to about where they were in the year 192G . But in the first place , nobody can say how much inflation will be necessary to move prices hack to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nobody can prove that inflation will do it . If there was any such absolute relation between the quantity of money and the level of prices , as the inflationist so dearly believes , then prices would be higher now than they were in 1926 , or even at the top of the boom , since there is more money of all kinds now than there was then . The book of experience says that premeditated inflation , regarded as a cause , will have no effect upon prices until it begins to create distrust . of money , and that it will act powerfully upon prices only from the time at which it begins to destroy them  --  that is , when the panic begins and people go in flight . from money to things . Then presently , if it goes on , prices come to have no meaning what-ever . The second idea is that inflation will relieve the debtor at the expense of the creditor . It . is very difficult to classify debtors and creditors . Much the largest category is that of the debtor-creditor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , owing and being owed . Even the anti-inflationists concede that the debtor-creditor who is dominantly a debtor , ' owing more than is owed to him , will benefit by inflation . As a generalization this is wrong . Take as an example of the debtor-creditor the man who owes a mortgage on his house , and is therefore a debtor , but who has also a Government bond or a savings-bank account or a life-insurance policy , and is therefore also a creditor . If his mortgage is more than his Government bond or his savings-bank balance or his life-insurance policy , then he is dominantly a debtor , owing more than is owed to him . But will inflation help him to pay off his mortgage ? Not at all . The number of dollars he receives as a creditor will not increase ; the number he owes as a debtor will not decrease . Who Will Benefit by Inflation ? But there is another position , namely , that of debtor-producer . All in that position may expect really to be benefited by inflation , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more dollars for what they produce and sell , whereas the number of dollars required to pay their debts will not increase . And who are these fortunate debtor-producers ? It is curious to see . They arc , mainly , the great industrial corporations with their enormous bond indebtedness and farmers with their mortgage debt . If inflation should go far enough , the United States Steel Corporation could pay off its entire funded debt with a ton of pig iron and a farmer could pay off his mortgage with a pound of butter . Inflationists like Senator Thomas will not look at this strange pattern of fact . Neither will the indebted farmers . Hating Wall Street , nevertheless they will sit in with a Wall Street organization that happens also to be playing for inflation , to discuss how the Government may he forced to go faster to it , and the incongruity of this association is invisible to them , The Wall Street inflationist expects to be enriched by his ownership interest in corporations that occupy that debtor-producer position . The indebted farmer inflationist is himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt . All they have in common is the wish for cheap money with which to wipe out debt , THE SATURDAY The one may be trusted to take care of himself . If not , no matter . But the farmer debtor may be making troth with such trouble as neither he nor anyone else can now imagine . Suppose that through inflation , worked by the Government in his behalf , he does get rid of his debts . He will have done it by political action  --  that is , by being able at this time so it is obliged to repudiate the gold-standard clause in its own obligations and break faith with its own creditors . In that case something much more important than debt is destroyed . Contract itself is destroyed and there is no security , not even for the farmer . More Debt to Eliminate Debt Control of the Government is by majority . A majority of this country 's population is urban and industrial , not agricultural . Suppose , when it was all accomplished , the farmer , with his land free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government , appeared to flourish too much at the expense of the non-agricultural population . Suppose then the nonagricultural population got control of the Government and proposed again to redistribute the national wealth and income , but . in a reverse manner . What could the farmer say rightly against it ? Suppose more . The people of the cities want the land and propose to take it . If the farmer should say , ' You can not take it , because it is mine by deed , " the people of the cities might say : " When the public interest is involved it is no harder for us to get rid of deeds than it was for you to get rid of mortgages . Saying it was in the public interest , you divided among you the wealth of your creditors . Now , in the public interest , it is deemed necessary to divide among us your wealth in the land . " Debt is the common key to all the monetary confusion now distracting the mind of the world . All schemes and theories for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories for debasing it , and all of them derive from a debtor mentality . The world was credit mad . The World War was fought on credit . Victory was bought on credit . Reparations were paid with credit . Germany was restored by credit . Postwar international trade became one colossal pyramid of credit , sellers lending their customers the money to buy with , and all economic authorities , or nearly all , saying such was the true nature of trade . In order to sell , you had to lend , more and more . The same are now proving how impossible it is for the borrowers to pay for what . they borrowed . The . standard of living in all civilized countries was raised on credit . Nationalism was promoted with credit . Cities wore ornamented with credit . Ideals of social welfare were realized by means of public credit . In rigid lines , with no imagination for the new thing , only for higher-powered means , the agricultural and industrial capacity of the world was enormously expanded with credit , and the output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , by lending money to the consumer  --  else it could not be sold at all . The other side of credit is debt . Now the world is sick with a debt psychosis . It can not imagine paying its debts in anything like the money value of what has been borrowed and consumed . Hence all these ideas of reforming EVENING POST money by debasing it in order to be able to pay back less . This simple , universal motive is disguised by a great body of unnecessary theory and by emotional denanciation of the creditor whose wealth was borrowed and consumed , of the system under which he acquired the wealth before be loaned it , of his social right to it in any case ; and the precipitation of all this is denunciation of the gold standard . It was not the gold standard that created the debt . The trouble is not . owing to the kind and quality of money anywhere existing before ; it is owing to the kind and quality and amount of debt that was created on the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no insolvent country or city that . did not willingly borrow itself there . It is improbable that there is any farmer in hopeless trouble who did not borrow himself into it , mistakingdebt for capital . There is no insolvent hank in the world that did not lend itself into that condition . If debts are more than can be paid , that is an aspect of reality ; it must be faced . It is as much the creditor 's folly as the debtor 's . The law provides an honorable way to reduce debts , each debt on its own merits , according to the debtor 's capacity to pay . But when the Government unde:rtakes to relieve the debtor by debasing the money in which debts are payable , it recognizes a debtor class and a debtor status in the political sense ; it will be obliged , moreover , to impair the obligation of public and private contract to the point at which its own word engraved on its own bonds and its own money may no longer be trusted . Which is the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality . The Government is above morality . It may do with utter impunity what it forbids the individual to do and would prosecute him for doing . On grounds of expediency only is it arguable . But that is not the point really . The point is that not one of all the schemes proposing to reform money by debasing it . for the universal sake of the debtor contemplates reforming debt in the future . Under any one of them , all the follies of borrowing and lending that have occurred in the past . could occur again . Indeed , practically with no exception , they contemplate a much more popular dispensation of credit hereafter , which means a more popular creation of debt , as if the only purpose of delivering society from the anguish of intolerable debt might be that it should have the ecstasy of doing it again in a greater way . Paying for Economic Folly For example , reducing the gold content of the dollar may fail as a cause in itself to raise prices . That remains to be seen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no doubt it . would guarantee beforehand so much free new credit that if another boom started , it would make the last one look very old-fashioned . Never since the modern monetary mechanisms were invented have they been so irresponsibly misused as in the period since the World War  --  not here and there but everywhere in the world , by governments , by industry , by finance itself , by lenders and borrowers alike , by people collectively and individually , all with one delusion about credit . If there is at last anything mysterious in the nature of money , before theory , it is this  --  that when people have terribly abused its considered functions February 3 , 1054 they will be obliged to learn-that it has one mop , never formulated by the economist  --  namely , a pain function . For great follies with credit and debt a great price is exacted in terms of social pain . And there is no escape . Or is there ? The anti-inflationist , says no . The inflationist says yes . And that is what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The anti-inflationists , called also the Mammon-minded , the gold idolaters , Tories , reactionaries , enslavers , oppressors of the poor , and so on  --  these believe there is no way to avoid the price of economic folly . They say the only way back to economic health and prosperity is the way of hard work , fortitude , self-sacrifice and denial . The Inflationists ' Credo The inflationists , called also silverites , greenbackers , demagogues and revolutionaries  --  these believe not only that the price can be avoided but that the idea of it is the delusion , if not the invention , of a surviving feudal mentality , like the idea of a limited wage fund that made it seem impossible ever to raise the standard of living by raising wages , both imposed for the purpose of keeping the rich rich , the debtor in debt and the poor down . They believe it is possible to construct an economic world in which any such idea as that of money or credit pain will seem absurd , a world in which poverty shall be unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and denial will be as unnecessary as thrift . For is there not already of everything plenty , if only it were rightly divided ? Believing this , they are bound to believe the trouble was that a selfish minority  --  namely , those same idolaters of gold , Tories , reactionaries , enslavers , and so on  --  ordered the distribution of wages , income and wealth according to a law of their own , and did it by being able to control and manipulate money and credit . Wrong distribution was the source of all economic distress . Now let the people , or , that is to say , their Government , seize this power to manipulate money and credit and exercise it to redistribute income and wealth for the greatest good of the greatest number . And whereas hitherto there has been the false riddle of excessive plenty with not enough money in the hands of the people to buy it , then there will be both plenty of things and plenty of money . Thus , not only shall prosperity be restored ; it shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last the abundant life , with less work than ever before . more satisfactions , more leisure and complete security . Simply , a new world . There is the issue , ages older than any monetary system . It is the vision of a new world that makes the infla tionist so eloquent , though he thinks he is talking about money ; it is the fear of losing it that makes him so abusive and deaf to the heavy reasoning of the anti-inflationist . If what the conservative says about the principles of money , debt and credit is so , then it is only a dream that we can buy our way to a new world with cheap money or overtake it on wheels of a rubber dollar , and the power in the hands of the Government to manipulate money and credit may be hardly more than the power to create some very costly , perhaps some very painful , zigzag events on a statistical chart .
