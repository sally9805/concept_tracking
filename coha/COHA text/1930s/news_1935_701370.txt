txt Rogers , Struggling Along , Rallies to ' Soak Rich ' Cry To the Editor of The New York Times : BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. , Aug. 1 . ? Here is rather an amazing statement . It did n't get much publicity in the press , but it was in there . It was made by the President , who has access to the . records and must know : " Fifty-eight of the richest people in the U. S. paid no Federal tax on 37 per cent of their incomes . " This soaking the rich has got two sides to it . Roosevelt gets him a pack of humorously called " brain trusters " to help him devise ways and means of trying to get at this extra 37 per cent and the rich get them some lawyers that are just as smart as Roosevelt 's tribe , and their job is to cook up an antidote . So up to now most of the soaking has been done in the papers and notat the cash register . Yours , WILL ROGERS .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
