Last week Mexico forgot war for the nonce as the P. R. M. ( Party of the Mexican Revolution ) convened to choose a candidate for next July 's presidential election , and to build him a platform . Usually the selection of a P. R. M. candidate is all that is needed to assure his election . <P> This year conservative opposition is headed up by the Independent nominee , General Juan Andreu Almazn , running on a platform which promises to slow down the rate of change but to keep some of the more important recent reforms-i.e. , the agrarian program , nationalization of oil , etc . Normally an opposition nominee has about as much chance in a Mexican election as a dray horse in a sulky race , but Candidate Almazn has picked up much support and he is given an outside chance to win . The P. R. M. did not have to think even once last week before it nominated President Lzaro Crdenas ' favorite , a popular oldtime fighter who subdued the Catholic rebellion of 1928 and the Cedillo revolt last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camacho . Since January 1938 he has been training for the presidency on a regime of " silence on important issues . " <P> Since the nomination was such a pushover , U. S. interest centred on the proposed platform . The convention drafted a plan to nationalize the oil industry completely within the next six years . If the plan is endorsed , all petroleum holdings will be seized , and compensation paid only " in the event that it should be absolutely indispensable , " and only if it is proved that the original concession was not fraudulently obtained . Land expropriation will also be continued as vigorously as possible .
