txt TO PREVENT CREDIT FRAUDS . Textile Industry Moves for Its Own Protection . To the Editor of The New York Times : The underwriting by the Uptown Credit Group of the Textile Industry of a cooperative fraud fund , to be devoted to the investigation and prosecution of commercial fraud occurring in the textile industry during the coming year , is an encouraging indication that , in the face of generally adverse condition 's , the " white-collared crook " will not be permitted to - carry on his activities in the textile market unhampered . Few industries have . been hit as hard as the ' textile industry . Commodity prices have steadily fallen . There has been overproduction and lowered consumption . The cry of economy bas been heard on every side . Yet it has not been considered economy by this industry to let up in the fight against dishonesty in business . By means of this joint fund to which individual textile houses have contributed , persons issuing false financial statements to obtain credit will be prosecuted , fraudulent bankruptcies will be investigated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uptown Credit Group of the Textile Industry was , I believe , the first group to establish a joint fund for the prosecution of commercial frauds .
