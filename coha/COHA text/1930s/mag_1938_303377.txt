For the comparatively few people in the U. S. who are in a hurry to fly across the Atlantic , this will be a tantalizing summer . Last week the upper component of the British Short-Mayo Composite , the seaplane Mercury ( " The piggyback plane " ) , arrived in Foynes , Eire , after an uneventful round trip to Canada and the U. S. And last week off City Island , N. Y. , the Lufthansa Nordmeer , flicked like a bug from the deck of its catapult ship , the Friesenland , skittered across to the Azores just after its colleague , the Nordwind , had skittered from the Azores to Port Washington , Long Island . Howard Hughes and Douglas Corrigan having completed ( TIME , July 25 ) their spectacular flights with a maximum of uproar , the commercial airlines of three nations were quietly getting down to the business of flying the Atlantic . The New York World-Telegram , one day when no transatlantic plane was in the air , printed a facetious front-page headline : U. S. VIRTUALLY CUT OFF FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient to get North Atlantic planes into regular service . Every week since 1934 Deutsche Lufthansa has been flying mail in fast Heinkel He . 705 from Berlin to Bathurst on the bulging coast of Africa , thence in Dornier DO-18s across the narrow South Atlantic to where South America bulges out to meet them at Natal , Brazil . Lufthansa one day will carry passengers on this route ; until last year , when the Hindenburg burned up at Lakehurst , N. J. , passengers could make the crossing any fortnight by Zeppelin . <P> For three years Lufthansa pilots have flown the North Atlantic as cool as cream : they made eight flights in 1936 , 14 in 1937 , and this year they will make 28 , two a week , with the Nordmeer , Nordwind and Nordstern , all Hamburg Ha . 1395 with four Diesel engines , a catapult start , and a payload of only 880 Ib . Lufthansa would like to start flying mail any day now , but it has been allowed to use Pan American 's sea base at Port Washington only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for flight . <P> The French have also flown mail for years across the South Atlantic . For the last year the experimental S. S. Carimare has been dawdling in the middle of the ocean collecting weather information ; for the first time Air France Transatlantique ( combination of Air France and Compagnie Generale Transatlantique ) is on the point of sending planes across the North Atlantic . This month and next , the hulking , 40-ton , six-motored Latecoere Lt. de Vaisseau Paris will make half-a-dozen round trips . <P> The English have no notion of using piggyback planes in regular transatlantic service ; last week 's flight of the Mercury was a simple military experiment . Nonetheless , the Mercury will twice more shuttle across the Atlantic from Foynes to Montreal and Port Washington . More serious items on Imperial Airways ' transatlantic schedule : five flights by the De Havilland four-motor Albatross , four flights by the Cabot , a seaplane of the same genus as the Caledonia and the Cambria which made ten flights in 1937.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
