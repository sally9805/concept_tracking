FOR generations GreatBrit- ain , Ireland , Germany . Italy , the countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe have bred millions more people than their homelands could adequately support , To get out or to burst out with periodic savagery was the only alternative . Bloody , devastating wars failed to decimate them sufficiently . Emigration became a real necessity . It was never a greater necessity than it is right now . But where to go ? Everywhere in the Old World the barriers are already up . The countries of Europe , even did they offer any bright prospect of peace , offer nothing in the way of opportunity . Try to get ajob in England ! Try to get one in Germany or Italy I Or in France , unless you are willing to work , as so many Poles and Italians are doing , in the mines , the mills and the vineyards . Turn then to the new countries . Already Australia , Canada , New Zealand , even the ABC countries of Latin America  --  indeed , all the lands once thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to play the surly host . Uncle Sam , though not precisely smiling in the hospitable prewar way , still remains fairly cordial . In 1920 he admitted 158,598 immigrants from Europe alone . But what of his future plans ? Can he afford to keep his door open when all the others are closing ? Is the day near when he will draw in the welcome mat , as so many of the others have already done ? Can he do it ? Our Would.Ba Guests I HE RE are tunny who con- tend that the political power of the great foreign elements of the Anieriean population is so weighty that uninfluenced inunigration Jegislation is impossible of achievement for us , There are others who hold that this is bosh and that a few more months , a few more weeks , even , of hard times and bread lines  --  and a few more criminal outrages on the part of gangsters with foreign blood and foreign cognotnensare all that is needed for a great popular howl of such volume to arise as will blow the now creaking door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Europe has an inkling that things are not as they were . Germany especially , with her strong feeling for blood ties and the numerous ones she has connecting her with America , has reacted with particular sensitivity to the rumors from across the sea . All over the Fatherland the American consulates are being bombarded with requests from relatives to enable them to join their kin in the new country before it may be too late . Many workers , caught helplessly in the unemployment crisis , have joined in the rush , preferring to take a chance on being out of work in a new and vital land than in an old one staggering under its postwar burdens . Thus the German quota is filled many times over , and if all who have applied for the visa appear for the final examination it will take five years for the present list to be exhausted . It was to look at this situation from the European angle that I left my home in Paris and went a-calling at some of those centers from which , under the quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Hamburg , Bremen , Cologne , Glasgow , London . From Germany and Great Britain , including the Irish Free State , about 100,000 prospective citizens may step through the great open door annually . They may seek jobs , even though jobs be few or nonexistent . Unlisted , uncharted , once in , they are free to wander from the Atlantic to the Pacific , from the Gulf of Mexico to the St. Lawrence River , with a freedom which no other world power today accords to its foreign visitors or residents . No card of identity , with its revealing statistics , is exacted of them . No hotel or lodging-house slip with questions as to age , place of birth , time of arrival , nature of business and ultimate destination is presented by mine host or mine janitor , acting under the instructions of an exigent police department . A Perpetual Autobiographer NTO ONE asks when , where , or if last year 's taxes 1 ? 1 were paid . No one exacts a governmental labor permit when work iy sought . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a place in 1 he bread line is demanded . I thought of these things as I came out from my hotel one morning last September in Bremen . More than ten years ' residence abroad has taught me thoroughly the real meaning of American freedom : a freedom which I took very lightly , very unconsciously , while enjoying it on my native heath , but which I now treasure dearly after more than a decade of the deadly ennui of telling the police departments of the seven or eight countries of Europe I frequently // ( Continued from Page 28 ) their shipping affairs  --  must be thinking me a rare specimen . Several Frauleins , surprisingly smart , but with that sketchy chic which artificial silk so inexpensively and so temporarily confers , turned to look at me curiously . " They take me for an emigrant about to go down to Bremerhaven to embark for America , " I told myself with some satisfaction . Mentally and physically I had thought to compose myself as an emigrant , a hopeful inconspicuous unit not unlike any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded through the door . 1 was on my way to the American consulate , that big handsome house down there , rising rather grandiosely behind the trees dominating the city 's picturesque canal , for a hypothetical visa . I sat by the canal awhile , and presently a girl coming out of the consulate crossed over and joined me on my seat there . Looking at her , I saw at once that , sartorially , I had made a grave psychological mistake . My foul-weather clothes were a blatant error . I had dressed down to go for my visa ; she had dressed up for hers . Regardless of weather , she would have donned her Sunday best . To have been properly in the picture I should have worn patent-leather slippers , too tight ; art-silk stockings of a high sheen , easily spotted ; a cinnamon-brown suit and a strawberry-pink blouse , a purple hat . See what America does to her children ! I have no Sunday clothes ; I have clothes for different weathers and clothes for different times of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the French say . And yet , along about 1810 , a pair of my great-grandparents with several young children set sail from this very part of the world . When the father died on the two months ' voyage and was buried at sea , the young mother did not turn back , hut , friendless and alone , landed in the New World with her brood . The Goal of the Friiulein she wear a shawl on her head ? I think it en- tirely likely . And that grandfather who , at the age of nine , arrived from Amsterdam  --  was not all of his worldly goods done up in a handkerchief ? I ant told that it was , and that those other forbears from Dublin arrived in a fashion scarcely more stylish . It is patent that , like most Americans , I should know something about immigrants . And yet , such has been the speedy way of America with her children that I find it hard to realize that anyone ever belonging to me wore a shawl or carried a handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head achieves the highest comfort only in a chapeau from Paris , and I prefer cowhide for my traveling equipment . There are pessimists who declare that we are the products of the regal days , and that no immigrant who now arrives upon our shores will ever meet the golden opportunities which ran out to greet our ancestors . The next hundred years , they predict , will show profound changes in the American social life . Definite strata will have crystallized ; we shall have iron-bound classes , and men will be born into the leisure class and manage to stay there with scarcely any effort at all ; while others , born ditch diggers , will stay there , too , unless en-dowed with the superhuman ability to lift themselves up . 1 like to think that it is n't true and that our incredible mastery of machinery will rout History , always so eager to repeat herself , and that for the first time in the world 's annals it will be demonstrated for all to see that slaves need no longer exist  --  even industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a term literally applicable to all . Meanwhile , the girl who has joined me by the canal in Bremen is crying . " you have been rejected ? " I ask sympathetically in my bad German . " AM , nein ! " She smiled broadly . The tears are happy ones  --  the release after a long emotionaLstrain . She has been on the quota for several years ; long enough , she informs me proudly , to have studied a little amerikanisch . My bad German is hastily exchanged for her feeble American as she tells me that next week she will get on the boat at Bremerhaven which will take her to America , where she has a sister in Trenton . As a cook , her sister made " beeg " money . She , too , would make it . I tell her of a letter 1 have had recently from America . A friend of mine in Cleveland had called her twelve-dollar-a-week cook in to announce the sad news of a decrease in the family prosperity . She could no longer afford the fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her board . " Could you manage to pay me eight dollars a week , ma'am ? " the cook surprised my friend by asking . " I 'd be willing to take a reduction , now that times are hard . " " Times are hard over there , " I told my companion on the bench . " itch , " she came back at me , " not half so hard as over here . Here now I can not find any work at all . And my sister now , " this was added proudly , " does nodding at all . Nodding but her own housework . " The sister had married a mechanic in an electrical works ; he it is who makes the " beeg " money now . It is plain to see that the strongly intrenched position of the married housewife with nothing to do but to devote herself passionately to Kinder and Kiiche remains the ideal goal of the lower-class German . No matter how " beeg " the money this girl at my side will ultimately make in domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ; to her , means one where not only a job is offered but freedom from that job as well . A step up in the social ladder is what she wants over and above material betterment . And that is why in the ? American consulates in Europe today preferred positions on the quota lists are no longer given to servants . It is n't that the law or the officials administering it have any objection to a newcomer stepping up the social rungs as fast as her feet will carry her . 1 t is merely that the old system whereby these girls were shoved through ahead of the other applicants , on the theory that America needed servants more direly than she needed other workers , proved to be grossly unfair because , America 's notions of the liberty of the individual being what they are , there was no way of assuring that a prospective cook or housemaid would still be one ten days after she had landed . There was no compulsion on her to follow the work she had declared herself to be trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember , with mingled relief and astonishment , the bygone era of the twelve-dollar-a-month hired girl . She arrived usually from Poland , Bohemia , Hungary , Sweden or Saxony , prepared to attach herself with feudal loyalty to the great family of noble Americans who , sometimes , had sent the money to pay for her passage across . Preference in Making Up the Quotas T HE sights of the New World put on her face a look of dumb wonder comparable only with that worn by a particularly provincial cow confronting its first automobile over the pasture fence . This look lasted several months at least , and , during that time Lena or Hilda learned that the noble Americans had amazing ideas of equality . They treated her like a human being . Indeed , they even set themselves out to cure her of certain amusing habits , such as kissing the hands of her benefactors on the most unexpected occasions . Under the cure she grew bold : And just as soon as she had acquired a few notions of the local cuisine as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed around the corner to an honorable neighbor who , not having paid her passage over , could well afford to give her fifteen a month , instead of twelve . As I said before , servants are no longer given preferential treatment on the quota lists . At the moment of writing , the preference is going to the relatives of immigrants already established in America , and to farmers . This subject of preference is one which our immigration officers abroad , if you get them in the right mood , are willing to sit up nights to discuss with passion . It brings out more clearly than any other feature of their work the weak spots , the anomalies , of our present law  --  the best law , they all agree , which we have had thus far , but one which is a long way off from perfection . They all agree to that , too , and since they are intrusted with the practical working of the law , 1 think their opinion extremely valuable . The framing of the 1929 Immigration Law coincided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was an easy but somewhat erroneous matter to conclude from this that what was needed was more peasants from abroad to man the depleted farms . It might have been more accurate to deduce that the trend away from the farms was due to the fact that an adequate living could n't be made there . Either the organization was bad or there were too many farmers , or both . On the other hand , perhaps the organization was too good ; the machines were doing a lot of work which formerly fell to the cheap immigrant hands . At any rate , the granaries were bulging ; there had been ( Continued on Page 161 ) impossible the dumping on the American market by unscrupulous employers of a lot of cheap foreign labor which would beat down the native standard of living . And in so far as it continues to serve that purpose it remains a good provision . But , they contend , conditions are not the same today as they were when America was all continent and no population . It is doubtful if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as were , perhaps , once necessary . A population of some 120,000,000 may be counted upon to keep a country pretty well supplied with a growing army of workers of all kinds , especially a country which has inaugurated the most supermechanistie civilization the world has yet seen . Given the machines , is it likely that wo shall ever again need those hordes of men ? But. , add these critics , suppose that in periods of unusual industrial prosperity and expansion certain industries do find themselves handicapped by a temporary lack of man power , is there any advantage in our saying to the foreign worker : " You ca n't come in if you have your job in advance ; you have to come in unemployed , and find your job afterward " ? They ask : is not this the height of inefficiency ? Either we need workers or we do n't . And if we need them we need them for certain specified jobs . To which the supporters of the contract-labor prohibition retort : America is the land of the free . To give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his movements after he gets here is to strike a blow at the very foundation of the American idea of democracy and liberty . Once in , a man should be free to do as lie pleases , within the law . It interested me to query the many emigrants I spoke with in Germany and Britain about this phase of our law , and it amazed me to find that , without exception , they viewed it with entire disapproval , and in some cases with total incomprehension . A measure written into the law years ago , primarily for their benefit , they one and all had come to regard it as a trick designed to keep them out of the country . Over the Coffee Cups A talk I had on this subject with a highly skilled metallurgical worker from the Ruhr , whom I met in Cologne , was especially illustrative because of the superior intelligence of the 3:1111 ? 1% came out of the consulate together , three of us , for his wife was with him . As we walked along the magnificent Kaiser Friedrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of busy fluvial life with its barges and tugs and water-front industries , I tempted them in a manner I felt to be irresistible to the present-day German of modest means ; I invited them to a Kaffecklatsch , telling them candidly that I was an American journalist , eager , as usual , to talk of this and that . So heavily is coffee now taxed in Germany that it 's impossible to get a decent draught of it forless than a mark , and the German loves it with a passion scarcely less intense than that which he has for his Hackerbrau or his Menchener . To go and sit and talk awhile with the American lady was clearly no punishment with the aroma from three ktinnchems of the best Moka filling the air . This man had been only sixteen ai the conclusion of the war , but he was in the Ruhr receiving his training when the mark began to fall and the Westphalian district , with Stinnes directing , became an inferno of industry , until the French marched in . He was there when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaders . And since that time he had seen , too , the great vertical trusts become less and less prosperous as tariff barriers rose high around them and the world 's buying power seemed to shrink visibly with the days . The situation in Germany , with her 3,000,000 unemployed , did n't look good to him . He had several hundred dollars and he was emigrating with his young wife before hard times had eaten into his savings and made emigration impossible . Only the Jobless Need . fipply " Did you have a difficult time getting your visa ? " I asked him . " I have been very lucky , " he told me . " I have profited by the mistake of a friend of mine in Stuttgart . This friend was not so lucky . For a long time he had been wanting to go to America . When his turn on the quota came he was full of joy . " What are you ? ' they asked him in the consulate . " ' I am a construction worker , ' he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had one hundred dollars and told them so . " ' There is much unemployment in America , ' he was warned . ' Can you take care of yourself when you get over there ? ' " ' Oh , yes , ' my friend replied . ' Already I got a good job by my brother-in-law . ' " 1 You got a job ? ' " My friend did not know that to get his visa he must not have a job . When . this kind gentleman showed himself to be anxious about his future over there , my poor Otto was in a hurry to prove to him that he could take good care of himself . lie had the promise of a job where his brother-in-law worked ; he was too quick in saying so . He did not get his visa . All the gentlemen were very sorry , but what could they do ? It was that law . " " And you , of course , have no job ? " I asked . His shrewd blue eyes looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good workman , " he replied . " We go to Pittsburgh , where I have a friend . To him I have written , Do not write to me that you have some work for me , otherwise I can not come , because of that law . But write to me to come if you think there will be work when I get there . ' Now he has written for us to come . Maybe I find a good job after I get there . Nicht wahr ? " Perhaps he did , and then perhaps he did n't . I was afraid to wish him " Good luck " for fear that , by the same token , I might be wishing some equally worthy compatriot out of a job . As the train carried me to the Hook of Holland for my crossing over to England , I reflected on the tragic implication of that five-year waiting list of Germans who wanted to go to America . That week the German unemployment figures had taken another dizzy rise . The quota as it then stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 130,000 had asked for visas . Looking at the applicants sitting in our consulates in Germany , it is impossible not to see at once what good material they are for citizenship . They ( Continued oft Page 165 ) ( Continued from Page tea ) are clean , with the world 's best notions about hygiene . Our medical examiners report them to be exceptionally good physical specimens . They have the reputation for being painstaking , industrious workmen , with a will to work unexampled anywhere . A thousand tragic pities , I thought , that just now it will be hard for us to use those who do get in , with so many of our own fine workmen standing around waiting for jobs to materialize . Before setting foot on English soil I was made aware of how the gravity of the unemployment situation and the unprecedented industrial depression there has keyed the watchdogs at the ports of entry to a superalertness . " You are going to England for a visit. , I presume ? " the official who examined my passport on the boat asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You are not going ' to work there ? " I hesitated , and then explained , " I am ' a writer . I frequently come to England in the course of my . work . " " Is it something an Englishman could do us well ? " Very courteous , but very incisive , that . I declined to commit myself on such a delicate point . " But you are not seeking a job there ? " Assured that I was not , he affixed the necessary approval . I filled out my landing card and took train for Glasgow in that thin , cold drizzle which seems perpetually to be watering an island already far too wet . Indeed , the very wetness and discomfort of it have been offered as the most likely explanation for the impulse which in the past has caused so many Britons to emigrate to lands of more agreeable ' clime . In the gray gloom of the Midlands the train stopped at Doncaster ; the famous races were just over . The platforms thrdnged.with a rush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of whom had a distinct down-and-out look . And vet traveling is not cheap in England , and betting can be an expensive habit even for a rich man . ? - I thought as I watched them , poorly dressed and of poor physique for the most part , of that seathing indictment of a well-known British critic , St. John Ervine , who wrote only the other week : " In every corner of our country men and women may be seen attempting in one fashion or another to obtain money without working for it , either by gambling on dogs or horses or dirt-track racing , or solving puzzles or winning prizes in competitions , or by living on the dole . " The Stapatilieme Scats When I went up the steps of our Glasgow consulate and into the waiting room for the emigrants , I was impressed by its air of hushed calm . Just precisely no one was waiting for a visa at that moment . " The Scots , " one of the officials reminded me , " are a canny race . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emigrants left Scotland for the United States ; in the following year less than 10,000 went out . Hard-luck tales from across the water had caused reflection . Might it not be a wee bit cannier to bide home awhile ? After all , a lost job at home would give one the dole , at any rate ; whereas a lost job , abroad offered no such certainty-of maintained idleness . Thus , everywhere in Scotland  --  in Edinburgh , Dundee , Aberdeen , as well as in Glasgow  --  applications have fallen off . Glasgow is the home of the noisy left-wing element in the British electorate . The Clydeside navvy , miner , iron and steel worker , may be said to be the monkey wrench in all the machinery proposed for ridding the country of the unfortunate dole . It is possible to be thoroughly out of sympathy with him and yet to feel some pity for him . Hard work and low pay in a trying climate have been his heritage for generations . Not until lie became truculent did his wages start getting near a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal , munitions , guns were needed ; he was pampered and given not only exemption from military service but unprecedentedly high pay as well . Kitchens With Sleeping Nooks And now he either has no job at all , or he is told that the industry can no longer keep him at the rate he demands . He sees as a lost battle the long , slow fight for a standard wage . And because he 's suffering in Glasgow , and not in Moscow , it 's capitalism and not Coinmunism which , in his misery , lie discredits . . I spoke With a waitress that afternoon in a tea shop where I sought shelter from the rain over a cup of tea . Her sister in Edinburgh , she told me , was trying to get together enough money to go out to the States . " She has been to the u.nivairrsity , " she added proudly in her rich burr . A university girl who could find no work , except that of domestic service . " What will she do when she gets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . " " But that 's domestic service again , " I protested . " Right you are , ma'am , but it is n't the same as here . Look you , before I got this job here I was in service as a general . Forty pounds a year I cook was paid , with very poor outings and no room of my own to sleep in . I slept in a bunk built into the kitchen  --  a bunk with a little calico curtain across it . That was all the place I had to myself . That surprises you , ma'am , do n't it ? Well , most of the big old houses you see around here have bunks in the kitchens for the cooks . " My sister , with her learning , is too good for that . In New York she will get grrand wages , and fine outings , so that she can go to the libraries . A grreat one for reading and studying , she is . Mark you , before she 's over there long it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new country . " That evening , at ten o'clock , I crossed from my hotel to the post office through George Square . The fine drizzle of the day before still persisted , but it was colder up here in the north . As I approached the square I thought that something must be wrong , there were so many people there . When I came into it , however , I saw that nothing was wrong  --  except , of course , just about everything in the world . The people who sat there in the persistent rain , as though the night were a balmy summer one , obviously thought themselves lucky . They at least had the seats ; there were others standing , waiting for them to get up . At each bench there was a queue of huddled men , chin down in collar , hands in the pockets of flimsy jackets . I had seen men queue up in the rain for cheap seats at a popular movie or prize fight ; I had never before seen men queue up for a vacant seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet night . I was not sorry when the train carried me away . Down in London I found everyone talking about- unemployment and ways and means of getting rid of the dole talking rather dispiritedly , as people at the beginning of a long Arctic night must talk about the far-off coming of the sun . Lloyd George had just produced one of those aphorisms with which he has so often speared the truth . " It is a mistake to speak of our passing through a crisis , " he said ; " we are just going into one . " Pessimistically it was felt that lie had only just said it ; not oversaid it . What to do with and many , many people out of work and feeding on the national income ? The two most favored answers to the question are : " Stop them from multiplying themselves ; and assist them  --  pay them , if necessary  --  to get out of the crowded country . " Emigration schemes were devised several years ago . The workless , with public funds , were assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got there . The plan did not work out brilliantly . Conditions in the old country had often unfitted the emigrants for the vigorous life in the new . A man who for years had sat over a weaving machine in Lancashire , as his forbears had done , could not stand up to the rigors of a harvest season in Canada or Australia . He drifted to the cities , usually to join the unemployed already there . A servant girl from Wapping sometimes considered herself superior to her mistress in Melbourne . The latter was only a colonial . But she was human ; often the servant was fired . Canada 's Keep.Out Sign The colonies grew restive . This was n't what the man or the woman had been imported for . Immigrants from the mother country would have to do better than that if they wanted to be admitted . Many of them did , of course , but the bad impression remained . Last August , Canada threw a bomb by discontinuing her immigration from the Old World . In announcing the policy , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rendered necessary by reason of the unemployment in Canada . Its purpose is to prevent persons coming to this country who will not be able to find work on their arrival and to protect the people of Canada from the burden of such unemployment . " St. John Ervine , summing up the situation in the London weekly , Time and Tide , wrote : " Our trouble today mainly is that we have more people than we can maintain , and that no other nation wants our surplus because we have demoralized them by the dole . A race of runts is neither pleasing nor desirable . But undersized men can work , and work well , and the lack of inches would not keep our people out of other countries . What will increasingly keep them out is their lack of will to work . " The disheartening outcome of Whitehall 's attempt to settle surplus miners in Canada by subsidizing them is recalled . More than 8000 were chosen to go , of whom , after a few months , just under 6000 returned to home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quota from 34,007 for the fiscal year 1929 to 65,721 for the fiscal year 1930 was flattering to a country whose emigrants were being rebuffed
