James Smith Ferebee , 31-year-old La Salle Street broker , has a golf handicap of 11 at his club , Chicago 's de luxe Olympia Fields . Fat Fred Tuerk , his crony , averages " around 176 " for 18 holes . <P> One afternoon three weeks ago , James Smith Ferebee breezed into the club 's locker room , announced that he had just played 90 holes . " Could have gone 144 , " he added . This irked fat Fred Tuerk , who offered to bet him $2 that he could n't . <P> Other bystanders raised the ante to $500 . <P> Then Tuerk , getting into the spirit of the thing , decided to throw in his half of the Virginia farm he owned with Fellow-Member Ferebee . <P> Thus was started one of the most publicized bets of the past decade-a golf marathon for half of a $30,000 plantation and $2,500 in side bets . Only stipulations were that Golfer Ferebee must 1 ) make good his boast between dawn and dusk ; 2 ) get 95 or less for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , Golfer Ferebee teed up on Olympia 's tough No. 4 course ( which has plagued many a famed professional during championship tournaments ) , scampered down the dewy fairway , accompanied by three spectators , a scorer , a doctor and three caddies-two to spot the balls and one to tote his bag , which contained 14 clubs , two extra pairs of shoes , orange juice , beer and candy bars . <P> Moving along at a half-trot , Golfer Ferebee , who used to be a wrestler at the University of Virginia , played the first 36 holes in 172 strokes , 170 minutes . By noon he had collected a gallery of 500 and scores of 90 , 82 , 82 , 82 . Then Providence sent a rainstorm . Fortified by sandwiches &; coffee and refreshed by a shower during his 97-minute rest , Golfer Ferebee continued his jaunt , followed by a dozen reporters , photographers and , toward late afternoon , half of La Salle Street ( including Partner Tuerk ) . <P> In time 's nick , as the last ray of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final green , sank his putt for a 5 and a last-round 89 . He had taken 687 strokes ( 90 , 82 , 82 , 82 , 87 , 87 , 88 , 89 ) for the 144 holes , had covered each of Olympia 's four courses twice ( a tee-to-green distance of 29 miles ) in 13 hr. 32 min . " Well , anyway , my golf 's got volume , if not quality , " panted Ferebee , as he peeled off $100 to pay the ten caddies he had used . <P> Next day , as all La Salle Street speculated whether he would ever get Tuerk 's share of the 290-acre farm ( the title is in Mrs. Tuerk 's name ) , Golfer Ferebee was back at the Olympia Fields course , playing his regular Saturday afternoon foursome . <P> Although his stunt* had made him one of the celebrities of 1938 , it was no secret that Golfer Ferebee would have been just as pleased to have lost the farm . Heavily mortgaged , it has been a headache ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record is Ferebee 's marathon . In 1933 , in Los Angeles , one Bob Swanson played 306 holes in 19 hours .
