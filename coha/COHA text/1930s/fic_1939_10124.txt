The stranger 's voice was very formal . Then they heard Charles Kirby . " But I told you my son 's gone back to his regiment , and even if he had n't I would n't have him take part in any such tomfoolery as this . " " Is that the answer I 'm to give Mr. Leatherbury ? " Elizabeth and her mother glanced quickly at one another . " No . " Her father 's voice rose a little as it did when he was excited . " You tell your friend Mr. Leatherbury that my son is too busy fighting for his country to fight any duels , but if he is so set on having a duel , he can fight me . You tell him that .

I 'm slaving to keep my store from being pushed to the wall by profiteers , so I can support my family while my two sons are away fighting for their country . One of them is just sixteen and has never been away from home in his life , and is up there in the woods in a camp , for Christmas . My older son did come home for four days ,  --  the first time we 've seen him in five months ,  --  and he had to go back yesterday . His mother and sister and grandmother are here alone all the time , wondering if he ' s alive or dead . I come to a home like that for a quick dinner , and you come here and talk to me about duels , and tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand them , or the likes of you and your friend .

" Wait a minute , " Mrs. Kirby said . " What is this all about ? " " Why  --  I 'd rather not say . " The young man looked embarrassed . " I 'd rather you would say , young man .

" Elizabeth , blood burning her cheeks , took the old lady 's arm , and hurried her back into the dining room. pIO2Now Elizabeth understood the lost look in Mildred Wade 's smoky gray eyes that afternoon as she had stared at Brose . The war had done that . It was the war in her life and Chester 's , too . The war kept Chester writing , kept her dreaming of him . In peace he would go to his father 's law office . He would become a statesman , and in a house like the Wades ' he would have a wife like Mildred , and she would never see him again .

St. George Paxton , pressed against the outside wall of the waiting room , was cold with his hat off . The glare from the torches of the guard wavered over the Confederate flag draped across the box . The pallbearers moved slowly along the depot platform to the street . St. George shivered when the muffled drums rolled the death march . The militia tramped up Broad Street hill to the mournful beat .

He was not the same man St. George had met last summer in the War Office . His cheeks were still pink , but they sagged now , and the pouches under his eyes were gray . As he stood there , lost in his own thoughts , absent-mindedly pulling his greatcoat around his throat , the tight composure he held on himself fell away . He was a cruelly driven man . He moved toward the door , and St. George spoke to him quietly . At once the restraint drew his face together , like a mask fitted on . " Oh , good evening , St. George . I 've been trying to get somep106information about these accursed trains , so I can bring my wife and son back from the Valley . I think we ' re going to have some action up there from this man Jackson when the weather breaks , and my wife 's family are in a danger zone . But I ca n't get a thing out of the Virginia Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose you were down watching them bring in young Wise ? " St. George nodded . " A dreadful thing . Jennings Wise was a fine boy , a very promising one . And I do n't mean only as an officer . He was one of the best newspaper editors we had in the state . Did you know his father ? " " No , but he was in the office before he took his men to Roanoke Island , begging Benjamin for reenforcements . Benjamin talked and said nothing as usual , very suave and diplomatic about it all , and went back to his Madeira and Havanas while the Blues were wiped out . " " It was all a very bad business . " " Terrible . Terrible . " There was a pause . " Can I offer you a lift in my carriage ? " Virginius asked abruptly . " Thank you , Virginius . I had intended walking with the escort , but I ' m chilled to the bone . " St. George passed through the door which Virginius Kirby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the carriage , Virginius hesitated , then said : " Would you care to come to my home and have a nightcap with me ? I have one bottle left of excellent old Marquis de Pombal , and you 've never been in my home , you know . " St. George understood at a glance that the man wanted companionship . " I should be delighted , Virginius . " They sank back in the cushions and Virginius pulled about them a thick laprobe . " Yes , it was a terrible business , " Virginius went on as though there had been no interruption . " Roanoke Island opens the way to Norfolk , and it could have been held . I 've never regarded Ex-Governor Wise highly as a military man , but apparently thepI07Blues and the other troops did all that was humanly possible . I ca n't understand why Benjamin did nothing . " " What can he do ? It 's not the War Department ; it 's the Administration . Davis is running everything and according to him , and his ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re defending our rights . I used to complain about the way Memminger ran theTreasury Department . But it 's no use . He 's just a rubber stamp for the President , like Benjamin and all the others . The place where Benjamin would be really useful is the diplomatic service . He has that type of brain . He ' s shrewd , patient , and devious . " " He ' s too devious for our good . I do n't trust him . " " No , Virginius , I think he 's honest , and he would have been a far better man to send to England than Mason . If Davis were shrewd , he would 've sent Benjamin to Europe while the Yankees had Mason and Slidell in prison . That ' s when we had England 's sympathy . " " Do n't you think we have it now ? They ' re debating recognizing us . " " And they 'll keep on debating until they see which side wins . The United States has backed down and England has saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , and only that . " " But , good God , they 've got to have cotton . " " That ' s what everybody thinks , " St. George snorted . " Do n't you think England would rather have a few mills shut for a while than to make an enemy of the United States ? They ' re giving it a long view . " " If they gave it a long enough view , they ' d see that would risk their textile markets . " " They 're not seeing it that long , Virginius . Lord John Russell wants to make a good showing for Queen Victoria  --  while he 's alive . Textile markets will be something for other generations to worry about . No , we lost our chance with cotton when we did n't borrowtheir gold with cotton security . It 's too late now , with the blockade tightening the way it is.

The way they ' re winning in the West , all of Tennessee and Kentucky will soon be open to the scoundrels . " " Anyway , we ' 11 probably have a new War Secretary now .

" " That does n't get us back all the months we 've lost , proving to the world that we 're nonaggressors , while they plan another On to Richmond ' as soon as spring comes . " " No , and it does n't get us back Roanoke Island and the men we lost there . I met a young man in the Blues on Secession Night who , I understand , was wounded and captured there . Leatherbury his name was . You know him ? " " Leatherbury . . . . Oh , yes , I 've heard of him . Very curious . " St. George waited . The carriage drew to a stop at the curb . " Well , here we are . " Virginius offered St. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , a flagstone court in front enclosed by a tall , iron-railed fence . Marble blocks on either side of the stone steps projected almost to the gate . A low light burned in the hallway and St. George noticed that the brass on the white door needed attention . Inside , the house was not too warm , and Virginius hurried into the library , talking nervously . " I ' ve had to let my butler and housemaid go . The groom doubles in brass on special occasions , but I ca n't bother him after a night like this . The cook , poor soul , is worn out by taking care of the whole house while my wife ' s away . " The library was warmer . A low fire burned in the grate and Virginius immediately started rattling it and piling on fresh chunks out of a dull brass scuttle . " I do n't own one of the niggers . Grace  --  Mrs. Kirby  --  owns her personal maid , her family gave her when she was married . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . My father freed them all before I remember . " St. George unwrapped his scarf . He placed that and his hat on ap109chair and took his overcoat off . He went over and warmed his hands . " There we are . " Virginius straightened . His hair was grayer in the glow of the fire . " Ca n't keep so many fires these days with wood at eight dollars a cord ! But thank God for that port . I 've been keeping it for such an occasion . If you ' 11 excuse me  --  " St. George nodded . He glanced at the comfortable room , obviouslythe room of the man of the house and one he shared little . It was not too neat . Dust was gathering . There was a not unpleasantsmell of stale tobacco . There were more books than he had expected . His war friend was a strange man . If only he could manage some judicious probing .. . Virginius Kirby returned , divested of his greatcoat and bearing a lacquer tray containing the bottle and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginius was smiling brightly . His eyes were lit now . This was plainly a role he enjoyed . " I 've been carrying my cigars all over the house since I 've been alone , " he explained . He set the tray on his littered desk , expertlyremoved the cork . " That ' s a very handsome tray , " St. George said as the bottle was handed him . " Thank you . " " A present from my wife 's family . Their presents have been cluttering the house up for years . They 'll come in handy soon for cash . You know , I 've lost my law practice completely now , and our salaries  --  " St. George set the bottle down . " Our salaries were a joke at first , but they 're no joke now the way prices are rising . " He took a cigar from the proffered humidor . There were only three left . Virginius took one , giving the humidor a sad glance . Then he poured himself a glass . They touched them . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heavy liquor warmed him all through . Virginius beamed . " Wo n't you sit down ? " St. George relaxed , eyed his new friend . " About that Leatherbury fellow  --  you said it was curious ? " He sipped . " Oh , yes . Man wanted to challenge my nephew to a duel . He ' dpIIO have been killed . But my brother told him it was all foolishness in a time like this . " " Your brother was right . A duel indeed . Leatherbury must 've been powerfully provoked . " Virginius laughed , puffed at his cigar . " Hah . It seems he wanted to defend the honor of some lady who had met my nephew secretly at night , on the street . I reckon it was reckless of my nephew ,  --  as she was indeed a lady ,  --  but he ' s a hot-blooded young hellion . Time will take it out of him , worse luck .

" Virginius ' voice showed how far away his thoughtswere . " I had one I ' d like to live over  --  not once but forever . " " That kind , eh ? " St. George blew out a great cloud of smoke . Virginius nodded . " It was my first wife . " " Oh . The present Mrs. Kirby is your second wife ? I wondered why your son was only  --  twelve , is n't he ? " " Just . My second marriage was n't until I was forty . My first wife died when I was twenty-six . It took me that long to get over it . " " You must have loved her very much . " Virginius came out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his desk and drew out a small daguerreotype in a carved wooden frame . He silently passed it to the older man . A young woman looked directly out with intense eyes . She was beautiful in a high-tempered and passionate way . Obviously a woman you fell in love with when you were young , St. George reflected , but hardly the sort you married . " That ' s my wife , " Virginius said . " Some day I 'll tell you about her .

He was a little sad to be leaving his old room . Unhappiness he had known here , and despair , but it had been a comfortable sanctuary against the world . He remembered nights with the lamp turned low and the shades drawn when he had imagined himself like Edgar Poe , who had once lived in a room like this a few doors down the street , a lost and melancholy soul , alone in his sombre room where only the dark gods of his brooding understood him . Now , at the moment of breaking with his dream life , of leaving his secure backwater , he felt uneasy . It was like a premonition that he was moving out beyond his depth .

Philip remembered his days back in Mr. Kirby 's drugstore when they used to suspect Milton Duke of sharp trading . A sudden nostalgia for the placid safety of those days overwhelmed him . " I do n't know , Mr. Duke , " he said . " I feel like I 'm getting in over my head . " Milton Duke screwed up his face in a dry laugh .

Gone from their backs were the knapsacks with the neat roll of blanket and oilcloth on top . Now the oilcloth and blanket were rolled and slung over their left shoulders , tied beside their right hips . Canteens flapped under the roll , in the small of their backs . For the fine knapsacks , thin haversacks of canvas or burlap swung out from their left hips , suspended by a cord over their right shoulders . There were patches , patches everywhere . That ' s what Brose had used his mother 's needlecase for . It had been an April day like this before the night she had first seen him . On that year-ago afternoon she had sat on the balcony , her hair drying , and she wondered what to say to Dennis that evening . The garden was the same to-day as then . The rambler rosebuds covered the wall and new blossoms sweetened the lindens , and the light green grass was bordered with the fresh colors of jonquils and tulips and hyacinths .

" Are you looking for him ? " Mildred was startled by the sound as well as the words . Then , as she spun around , she was bewildered by her mother 's expression . Above the full , black Garibaldi blouse , with its neat row of buttons reaching to her white collar , Mrs. Wade 's face was curiously calm .

" Yet , you ' re standing here , looking for him ? " " I ca n't help that . " Her mother was silent . Then she moved beside Mildred and placed a hand timidly on her shoulder . " Do you know his company and regiment ? " " I even know his platoon and lieutenants . " She said , as if memorizing : " Company D , First Virginia Regiment , A. P. Hill 's brigade , Longstreet 's division . " " A. P. Hill 's brigade ! That 's not Ambrose Hill ? " She tried to sound bright and natural . Mildred nodded , watching the women and older men touch the soldiers and kiss them . Was his mother among them ? Where was the little blue sewing case now ? " I can scarcely believe that boy is a brigadier , " Mrs. Wade went on with strained cheerfulness . " I remember when he came to Richmondon a vacation from West Point . He was a classmate of George Pickett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " George Pickett has a brigade in that division too , " she said . " Good heavens , he was such a dandy , with his flowing hair and ' his curled moustaches , all perfumed . Do you remember a party you went to when he was on a furlough from the army ? " " Yes , I remember . His sister was with him , and she sang . " " I believe she did . You know George Pickett 's uncle , Mr. Johnston , the lawyer ? Well , he was once associated in law withpI20 Lincoln , and he told me the other day that Lincoln himself recommendedGeorge Pickett for his West Point appointment , even wrote him letters of advice . . . . " She stopped . All the eagerness went out of her . " Oh , to think of those boys now fighting for their very lives to defend their homes against men who were their friends and even roommates ! I just ca n't understand what has come over those Northerners . They talk all the time about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do shows they hate us . Their one object seems to be to wipe Richmond from the face of the earth . " An old lady ran along the ranks , staggering under a basket of food . " Try not to think of it so much , " Mildred said . " How can you help thinking of it ? " Her mother 's voice quivered with its old strain , verging toward hysteria . " When I see those women of your father 's own family , and those little girls , refugees right here in this house ! " " But Mother , it is n't just our family . The whole city is full of refugees . " " I do n't see how you can be so calm about it . Your own father is fighting up there in the Valley with Jackson . At this very minute , while we ' re standing here , he might be lying somewhere , wounded or  --  " " Yes , he might be , but thinking of it is n't going to help him any . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our only army that 's winning battles ? " " Yes , other people tell me that , but  --  but , there must be somethingwe could do ! " " There is nothing we can do , but wait . " " We can pray ! " " Do n't you think the men who were killed at Shiloh and all those other terrible defeats in the West had prayers for them ? Do n't you suppose somebody prayed for General Albert Sidney Johnston ? " " Do n't you say your prayers any more ? " Her mother was stricken . BUGLES BLOW NO MORE I2I " Yes , but I do n't believe in them . I do n't believe in anything any more . " " It ' s that Kirby man ! " Her mother 's hysteria was back . " I know it . " " Yes !

My heart aches because he ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to defend our own home , and I ' m not one of the girls giving him something . Now you know , will you let me alone ? " Her mother backed away . Her eyes grew wider and wider . Her lips trembled open , as if she would speak . But she was incapable of another effort . She turned quickly , and hurried into the house . In a loneliness such as she had never . known before , Mildred stared at the last of the gray men passing through the crowd . Somewherein that long line moving to the Peninsula had been Brose . She wondered if he had glanced up at her house . The last company of foot soldiers passed . Horseshoes clanged on the flagstones and gun carriages rumbled over the cobbles . She recognized the Howitzers , with no brass buttons shining now . They wore short jackets and rocked on the iron-seated caissons . One of them was his brother . His name was Paul . He was a sweet boy and he looked up to Brose . Mildred closed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A bugle called . She shivered . She turned blindly and moved into the house . She heard the low murmurings of the women 's voices from the living room . Mildred opened the door . None of them heard her . She stood and looked at them as they worked on bandages . The two little girls were bandaging a Confederatedoll . Aunt Abbie scraped lint slowly and carefully , steadying fingers that were shadowed by deep blue veins . She was no kin of Mildred 's , as blood went , but as their family counted it she was a kinswoman . She had married the son of Dinwiddie Wade 's greatuncle , he who had been the brother of the first Wade to come toI22 BUGLES BLOW NO MOREp122Richmond . Her husband was long since dead and Aunt Abbie must have been over eighty . Her two daughters also scraped lint and they were no defter than the old lady . But it was not their hands they had to steady . Cousin Emma Jane , who was sixty , had two sons and a son-in-law in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her fifties , had mothered all the young men in the family . They passed the lint to Isobel Wade and to Cousin Emma Jane 's daughter-in-law , Constance . Mildred 's mother formed it into " tents , " the conically shaped plugs for wounds , and Constance rolled it into boulettes , tight balls for absorption in cavities . A pile waited for Mildred , to smooth in long rolls and tie in the centre . She listened to five-year-old Sarah Jane , who was playing the nurse . " Did a Yankee shoot you , soldier ? " " Ten Yankees shot me , " Harriet said indignantly . She was eight and apparently playing the soldier . " Goodness gracious ! All ten ? " " Course not . " Harriet was scornful . " Ten shot at me , but only one shot me before I killed them all . " " Oh . What were they after you for , soldier ? " " They were after my little girls , that ' s what . " Harriet scowled ferociously at the thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were going to eat them . " " They were not ! " Bandaging stopped abruptly on the doll . " They were too .

" That ' s only because Mother and Grandmother were there . Else  --  " " I do n't believe it . Mother ! Do Yankees eat little girls ? " Constance Carter Wade was thirty years old . She was a handsomewoman , who had never been pretty , but her face was strongpI23with character . Now it was set in harsh lines . Her younger brother had been killed at the fall of New Bern . She held the gaze of her children and said in dead , measured tones : " They do n't eat them . They just burn their houses and put them out in the rainy night as you were , to become exiles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --  " " Constance . " Aunt Abbie shook her head . " You should n't put such ideas in their little heads . Let them forget that night  --  " " I do n't want them to forget that night , " she said with venom . " As long as they live I want them to remember it was Yankees who drove them out of their home and ruined it so it would n't be fit for dogs . " " But it ' s wrong to instill hatred like that . Besides , we 'll go back to our home as soon as the boys come back . " " No , Mother , " Cousin Emma Jane said , " we wo n't go back . " She was a quiet woman whose thoughts most often turned to her husband , Jack Wade . He had consumed brandy until his liver would stand no more , but no one in the world , she said , had ever laughed as he did . " I never want to go back to Kensington . They put their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they used his own decanter . . . then stole it . " " Oh , children , " the old lady began . " We ' re not children any more , Mother , " Cousin Flora said . " There was nothing quiet about her . As vigorous as the fox-hunting men of her family , but carrying nearly two hundred pounds on slender ankles , she talked to release her energy . " Nobody wants to go back to Kensington . It ' d be like sleeping in a bed after vermin had been in it , if there ' re any beds left . The way they were carting off things to send their homes I do n't know if there 's anything left  --  except their human filth , which they were free enough with .

You ' d all better come with me and the children to my family in North Carolina . " " Why , Constance ! " Aunt Abbie was shocked . " We ca n't live in North Carolina . " " And why not ? " " Because . . . because we 've always lived in Virginia , " " Apparently the Yankees do n't intend to let you , or any of us , live here any longer . Ever since McClellan landed his army at Yorktown , their one objective has been to get to Richmond , and we 've got nothing to stop them . " " And the way Mr. Davis sees fit to run things , " Cousin Flora said , " we would n't stop them if we could . The idea of appointing that Jew Benjamin Secretary of State !

I just saw a body of men passing through here on their way to stop McClellan , and  --  " " Isobel , if you 'd been mistreated by those Yankee scum as we have , you ' d want to get as far away from them as possible . I think you ' d better join us and come with Constance . You could rent out this big house and  --  " " I ' 11 never leave my home . " " That ' s what we said .

" " And do n't forget , " Flora said , " if they give up Norfolk , the Yankee gunboats can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Right here . " There was a firmness on her then that surprised them all . They looked at her as they might at a stranger , and Mildred felt a sudden rush of inexplicable pity for her mother , who , such a short time ago , had been a young girl.  | " That ' s the way to talk , Mildred , " Aunt Abbie began . " It might be the way for her to talk , " Flora snapped , " but not for you . You ' re coming with us to Constance 's family in North Carolina , and Isobel can stay here and entertain the Yankees if she wants to . " Aunt Abbie said nothing . Her hands returned to her lint . But they barely moved now . Her eyes were seeing other things . What was she remembering of her dead life on that plantation by the slow-flowing James ? Sixty years she had lived there , since the turn of the nineteenth century . Perhaps she remembered her chair on the wide lawn that sloped to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern afternoons , when Mildred was a young girl playing with Harriet , who was then a baby , and Constance and Ben would come back from a ride and have a champagne lemonade tinder the large poplar tree . Aunt Abbie was too old to understand that it was lost , that it would never be the same again for her . But did any of these women understand it ? Did even she really k now what was happening to their world and happening inside them ? How could any of them know , living in this pathetic halfworldof women ? A sterile house of women , of young and old women , of middle-aged and children , they pieced out their hours by pitiful makeshifts . Sewing socks and making bandages for unknownsoldiers , cooking and nursing for sick soldiers , giving parties and dances for furloughed soldiers , they devoted their lives to countless , nameless , dusty gray , patched soldiers they had never seen and some of whom would never he seen again by a living woman .

He would be back with his command before the end of May . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sergeant 's chevrons that looked so bright against the faded gray cloth . He might have lost his arm . That man named Leatherbury , who had wanted to fight a duel with Brose , had lost his arm , Uncle Virginius had told them . And Chester 's windtannedface was so sallow and drawn , and his eyes never laughed any more . For one breathless moment she longed to rid herself of the conviction that anything between Chester and her was unnatural . But she could not forget that world of Mildred Wade 's , in which he moved and in which he belonged . She knew that was no place for her , and her world was no place for him . The door to the hall opened silently and her father stood there . Her mother and Chester leaned forward in their chairs . Elizabeth felt her breath catch , her father looked so haggard , his eyes so dulled . He shook his head at them. pI27 " Nothing 's wrong , " he said in his tired voice . " I just closed the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . . . and the streets are filled with nothing but people fleeing the city . " " Do you think we should leave ? " Mrs. Kirby asked . He slouched into the room , shaking his head , and dropped into his rocker . " I do n't know what to think . " " I know the Yankees are going to take Richmond , and Virginia , and all the South . " Granny rocked complacently . " I 've always told you so . It ' s because we built railroads . They ' re going to take all the slaves and free negroes and ride them away on the railroads . " " Mamma , for the Lord 's sake , will you stop prattling ? Have n't we got enough to worry about with gunboats on the river trying to shell us in our homes ?

They took Nashville and New Orleans and now Norfolk ' s evacuated , and I certainly do n't think that little old river fort at ' Drewry 's Bluff will stop them here . And as for the army , Joe Johnston will just keep on retreating until he gets to the Mississippi . They brought Brose and Paul and all the soldiers from the north of the state down to the Peninsula in April , and all they 've done for the past month is move backward to Richmond . Would ' ve made more sense if they ' d stayed here in the first place and built a fort , instead of waiting until the gunboats were on us before they started one . " " They know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noboyishness in Chester 's voice any more . It was subdued and there was firmness in it now .

We have n't been ready yet to givepI28that big army of McClellan 's a battle . He 's got over a hundred thousand men . " " You gave him a battle at Williamsburg . " " That was just a rear-guard action , Mrs. Kirby . " His patience made Elizabeth ashamed . " They were pushing our retreat too fast and Longstreet turned on them . " Mr. Kirby stirred . " Brose wrote you that , Judy . He told you that McClellan 's army was three times as big . " " Then why do n't they bring Jackson 's army down from the Valley ? He fights three armies and licks them , too . " " Jackson is keeping them from overrunning the Valley , " Chester said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger than ours . The Union army is three times bigger than ours . We have to keep shifting men around . When we can get enough here , we ' 11 give them a battle . " " When they 've retreated to our back yards , I reckon . " " No ' m . Those sandbags you-all 've been working on are for the fortifications around the city , from five to seven miles out . And they ' re good , too . General Lee knows fortifications . " " I hope Evacuating ' Lee knows something . I certainly do n't think much of the military advice he ' s given the President . " " You must n't believe all you read in the newspapers , Mrs. Kirby . Lee has an almost hopeless task in building a defense for Richmond . We ' re vulnerable from nearly all sides and with no natural defenses . " " Well , if that 's the case , why did he wait until now , when the gunboats are on us , to build that fort at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . Richmond just started to make contributions to her own defense . And now they ' re working like beavers over there . They 've got the heavy guns and the crew from the Virginia  --  " " Yes !

" Oh , Jesus , " she was moaning . " Oh , Jesus , save us now . " Thunder rocked the house and the floor trembled under them . " They ' re the guns from Drewry 's Bluff answering , " Chester said . His voice was hardly above a whisper . Mr. Kirby was as white as death . His wife ' s face was darkly flushed and her mouth was drawn . Granny sat there as though she had been turned to stone . Then blasts came , again and again , roaring one on top of the other , and under them , at intervals , the heavier thunder rolled . The house was shaking steadily and the windows rattling .

" " You be careful then , " her father called despairingly after her as she ran out of the room . Alone upstairs , she was scared as when she had been a little girl in a thunderstorm .

Her gaze dropped to his hard-worn boots , neatly polished . She wanted to wrap her arms around his legs.  | " Those little flowers on your hat , " he said , " they look so helpless .

She fumbled for her handkerchief and wiped her eyes . He stepped back and his voice was gentler when he spoke , but the firm ring was still in it . " I ' 11 tell you again , Elizabeth , unless  --  " he paused and then his words jerked out  --  " unless there 's somebody else . " She shook her head , drying her eyes .

" The street was choked with buggies and carriages and wagons and carts and swarming mobs on foot . The bedlam of their shouts and screams rose above the distant thunder of the gunboats down the river . A gaunt-faced man in shabby clothes stood up in a buggy , and lashed at a rearing horse . People , staggering under bundles , scattered before him . An old woman , with her bonnet awry , pulled a little girl back toward the curb . An open carriage cut around the buggy . The old lady screamed . The negro coachman swerved the horses onto the sidewalk . The carriage crashed against a lamppost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . Chairs and table legs waved in the carriage .

The thunder rolled louder and throbbed through her . " You leavin ' ? You leavin ' ? " a pale young woman on the balconyof a yellow brick Georgian house was chanting to the street . An old man leaning on a gold-headed evening cane and clutching a handbag yelled back at her : " Only a fool would stay .

" We ' 11 never get through , " she said , trying to hold back . " Stay behind me . " He moved to the side of the building and she took hold of his worn leather belt . He touched men on the shoulder . " Pardon me , " he said quietly . They looked at the thin , determined face , the burning eyes , the battle-stained uniform with the pointed chevrons , and they looked at the yellow stripe of the cavalry . They moved .

Then the press inside the doorway suddenlysplit into tumbling fragments . They surged backward . Elizabeth glimpsed them like a torrent rushing toward her . Through a haze she saw a tide of pale , greasy , twisted , muttering faces looming over her . She was being engulfed by them . " We ' re saved ! We ' re saved ! Richmond ' s saved ! We 've driven the gunboats back ! " Maddened steps , like galloping hoofs , thundered down the hall and the moan rose with them and swept out into the street and broke . " We ' re saved !

It deprived him of his driving strength , and he had nothing else . Then he saw her . His face did not change . He walked stiffly to the bottom of the stairs . Music drifted from the drawing-room , and laughing voices . She could n't let him go in there , looking like that . " Dennis , " she said quietly , " why do you come to these parties if they make you so miserable ? " " I come to be with you . " " I must say it does n't seem to make you any happier . " " I ' d be more unhappy if I were n't , " he said stubbornly . " But you ca n't go on like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is ruined . What is left for a man like me ? " " Oh , everything ! " She made herself calmer , spoke more quietly . " Dennis . You should n't think of your injury like that . To other people you ' re a man who ' s made a great sacrifice for his country , for them . It ' s something for you to be proud of . "  | " How can I be proud of myself when there ' s an army five miles outside of Richmond , waiting to attack the city , and I ' m here helpless ? All those soldiers in there will ride back to camp at midnight and to-morrow they ' 11 fight to break this siege . What will I do ? I 'll skulk back to a hotel room and stay there by myself . I ' 11 be here like the women and children and old men . If the city falls , I ca n't do a thing to defend a soul  --  not even you . " " But you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first time she had ever been moved by him . " New Orleans has fallen , and Norfolk and other places , but those people have to go on living . If Richmond does fall , our lives will go on  --  somehow . " " Not mine . " His voice was harsh . " My life will never be the same again . " " None of ours will ever be the same , Dennis . The war has changed us all , in different ways . But you 're not helpless just because you ca n't help defend the city . There 's plenty  --  " " There ' s not you , Mildred , " he cut in . " That ' s where I ' m helpless . That ' s where it hurts most , this  --  this being half a man . " That she could not answer . If only she had , to give to Dennis , what she could n't give to Brose Kirby . From the drawingroom , voices floated on the sad strains of a waltz : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain ! Yet praying when this cruel war is over , Praying that we meet again ... " " Shall we go in ? " she said wearily . Without a word , he stood aside for her . When they entered the room she felt him stiffen . He had never been at home among dandies . Before he lost his arm he had looked with contempt on their city elegance and drawing-room accomplishments . But now their uniforms were faded with dust and rain and battle smoke , their collars were studded with hard-won bars of rank , and Dennis knew that these were the men who stood between Richmond and McClellan , and who at midnight , when he walked the rainy streets to his hotel room , would be riding back to the camp along the Chickahominy . Then she did feel pity for him . These dandies had the color , the elegance , that had never touched him ; and now , in the crisis , they had manhood too . There were men from the " Bloody First " ( Brose 's own battered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. P. Hill had a division . There was young Chester Cary , of Stuart 's cavalry brigade , wounded at Williamsburg . ( " Manassas was a child 's game compared to that , " he had said . ) There was a scarred lieutenant of the Richmond Howitzers , on whose ironseatedcaissons Brose 's young brother rode . There was a blackbeardedartilleryman from New Orleans ' famed Washington Battalion , and there was the blond-bearded Hood of Texas . There were a wind-bronzed captain of the Richmond Grays and a pinkcheekedboy of the Richmond Fayette Artillery whose eyes were already old . All , all dancing to-night as Dennis could never dance , laughing as he could never laugh , and knowing that to-morrow the bullets of McClellan 's Yanks would be reaching for them . Mrs. Ambler came toward them in another of her dresses that had run the blockade . The point lace was new . Mildred was quickly conscious of her own , last year 's , with a lace collar reworked from an old shawl . And the flounces were silk from an old dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ambler pretended to think the whole creation new . Then she turned to Dennis and said :  --  " You ' re the noblest-looking man here , Lieutenant Leatherbury . I ' m proud to have one of the gallant soldiers of Roanoke Island in my home . Wo n't you tell me about it sometime ? None of the other survivors will . " " You must remember , Mrs. Ambler , that in the Blues most of us had been friends all our lives . In that trap we saw boys we used to play with slaughtered . We never had a chance . Those of us who did escape  --  cheated death . " There was a short silence . Then Mrs. Ambler said vehemently :  --  " I hope our boys make them pay for it to-morrow ! "  | " Are they sure they fight to-morrow ? " Dennis asked quickly . " That ' s what they all say . Johnston is at last going to attack now that the Yankees are at our gates . " Willie Kennard came up then . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred remembered writing in her girl 's diary how handsome he had looked in a Norfolk reefing jacket and immense trousers that tapered at the ankle . He had worn the fashionable Dundreary whiskers then . Now he wore a close-cropped beard . She remembered him as a great dancing man ; now all you heard of him was that he was one of the most promising young officers of Richmond . " For auld lang syne , " he said , " will you give the first dance to me  --  if the lieutenant is n't dancing ? " Dennis bowed shortly . " I never dance . " " Lieutenant Leatherbury is going to talk to me , " Mrs. Ambler said . Willie 's arm touched her lightly and she glided out on the floor . It was as smooth as glass . Willie had not lost his touch . It would have been a release had not Dennis stood beside Mrs. Ambler , his face wooden , and watched her every move . Now that he considered himself helpless , he claimed her as he never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Hood , then with Burton Harrison , the President 's secretary , and then with Chester Cary , Dennis 's eyes never left her . He was like a grim guardian over her very thoughts . He seemed to suspect every word the men said to her . They talked only of the siege and their attack tomorrow . " ... We hit McClellan 's left wing to-morrow . . . . You see , he ' s split across the Chickahominy . . . . His left comes down across the Williamsburg Road . That wing 's about the size of our whole army . We 've got to get him while he 's divided . . . . He ca n't bring his right across because the rains have swollen the river and the swamp . . . . He crossed the Chickahominy with his right wing , up by Mechanicsville Pike , so he could meet McDowell coming down from Washington . But McDowell ' s held at Washington by Jackson 's victories in the Valley . . . . Your father ' s there with Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one having luck ... . We ' 11 try to help Joe Johnston have some to-morrow . . . . " Chester talked less of war than the others . Mildred was surprised at the boy 's change . He had matured since that afternoon , a year ago , when he was in her house with Brose . He had been an eager boy then , with excitement in his voice . Now he was as subdued as an older man , almost stern . And his eyes burned like a zealot 's . He had always been a serious boy . She tried to draw him out of himself . " I reckon you ' 11 be an officer soon , Chester , now that you 've got your sergeant 's chevrons . " " I hope . " No quick smile came . " I think I ' m going to be made a scout . I know this ground around here . " " That would be exciting ! " " I hope it will be beneficial to the army . " He was very grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Richmond . This city ca n't stand a siege . " He danced her toward the fringe of the guests . He seemed intent on his dancing , and this was strange , for even when he was a student he had been an indifferent dancer . They moved in front of the open French doors . Outside , the rain lashed and she felt the raw wind . " You poor boys have to ride back in that ? " She looked through the doors at the torrent slanting down . " Let ' s step outside and see how it looks ! " He spoke very quickly , in sudden excitement . Mildred knew he was not a man for flirtations . And she remembered the way he had looked at Elizabeth Kirby . Curious , she passed with him through the open doors . The rain drove in from one end of the porch . The farther end was dry , except for a slight mist blown by the wind . They moved toward that end . The music sounded faint inside , an overtone to the driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof and there was nothing but blackness . She was wondering what Chester wanted to see whenp141a dark shadow moved out from behind the column in front of her . Strength drained from her when she saw him . His hat was off and rain glistened in his loosened hair . He moved toward her , easily , and against the night sky she saw his shoulders blocked out . They looked bare with the wet shirt plastered to his skin . He held a slouch hat in one hand . Little streams trickled off it . When he stood in front of her his dark wet face was like a swooping hawk 's . She took one backward step . His hand closed over hers . Her body went limp in his arms . She felt his cool damp face on hers and her mouth reached for his . " Oh , Brose , " she murmured , " why did you come ? Why ? Why ? " " To-morrow . You know we attack . I had to see you . " " You should n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you we could n't  --  " " I know you told me , but I ca n't live in hell all the time . " " I do n't believe you . It could n't mean so much . It 's just that you want me . " " Sure I want you . But that is n't anywhere near all of it . Christ , . you 've wanted to see me ! You ought to know what it ' s like . " " I know too much of what it 's like . I want to forget it , I tell you . I do n't want to be reminded . " " How can you forget something that ' s in your vitals all the time ? Waiting out there in those mosquito-ridden thickets , with you here where the city might fall in ruins , what else is there any more ? " " But that ' s it ! It ' s because you 're out there in the army , with all your life cut away , that you think  --  " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Her voice was like a cry of pain . " Oh , why did you have to say that ? You know I saw you Secession Night with that girl . You know my father has told me about your life . I know how you ' ve lived , what you ' ve been . You ca n't change . " " You do n't know anything about me . Our past lives are all gone . It does n't make any difference that this war made us what we are now . We are it . That 's what brought us together . We have n't got any old lives to fit to one another . We 've got now , just what we are to-day . " " We 've got to-morrow , Brose . We 've got to go on living ! " He pulled her roughly to him . His arms held her cruelly . " You know I 'll never come to you again . " " I know . Brose , you ' re hurting me . " " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten Chester . Brose 's arms loosened and she turned . Chester was standing by the doorway . " Here comes Dennis . The party ' s about to break up . " Brose stepped back from her . His tumbled hair glistened . Hisdark wet face was blurred in the shadows . Only his eyes glowed . " Please go now , Brose . " " And leave you for him ? You ' 11 go to him now  --  in pity . You ' 11 go to him for safety , for your to-morrows . " " Brose , in God 's name , please go . " " I ' 11 go , and this time  --  good-bye . " " Mildred ! " Chester was right behind her . She watched Brose back into the shadows . He was swallowed up . Chester stepped beside her . She heard the splash as Brose struck the muddy ground of the garden . Below , on Main Street , she heard the muffled beat of a drum . More men moving up , men without to-morrows . " Mildred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshed tears . Dennis bulked in the doorway . " What 's the matter ? " He started toward them . " It was hot in there , " she said . She took Chester 's arm and they walked to meet Dennis . He peered at her closely . She could n't raise her eyes . The three of them moved into the doorway . There she stood rigid . Inside , the soldiers were leaving , and they were leaving girls who told them good-bye , girls who were waiting for them after to-morrow . The music came clear and sweet and haunting.  | Good night , ladies .. . The soldiers in the room lifted their strong voices . They moved singing toward the door . The girls moved beside them , holding them close . Why did she have to be alone , beside Dennis , when the one for whom she had a good-bye kiss had left in the darkness , without even a good-bye ... . Good night , sweet ladies .. . The soldiers were at the arched doorway leading into the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside , alone in the black rain , Brose was tramping back to the Chickahominy . The drums rolled for him . We 've got to leave you now .. . They passed through the arched doorway toward the front door . Their voices grew fainter . The girls ' voices were thrown after them , caught up in the lashing rain . The last soldier left the room . The ladies and old men stood in a tight bunch , waving , waving , and calling . Merrily we roll along , good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .. . Dimly the soldiers ' voices drifted back . Roll along , roll along .. . Dimly the distant drum , muffled in the rain , beat on Main Street hill , beat for him , walking alone , without a good-bye , without a to-morrow . Merrily we roll along , good-bye , good-bye , good-bye ... . When dusk closed down , the thunder receded and they heard a muffled rattle . " Them ' s muskets , " John said . Mildred looked at her mother . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conception of how long . Time had lost meaning . The cannonade had started in the middle of the afternoon . They had been finishing midday dinner . Mildred had not been drinking coffee . Her mother had a demi-tasse of thin brown coffee-flavored water . She could n't give up coffee ; she could n't afford to use much . Mrs. Wade had been raising the cup to her mouth when the first peal came . Her body grew rigid . With the cup poised , she looked as though she might have been sitting for a portrait . Then the thunder had come rolling . She had lowered the cup . Without a word she moved out on the balcony . Mildred followed . Since then they had sat there , silent . Edmonia and Delphy and John joined them . The sky hung low and dripping . The air was close . There was no change to indicate time . There was nothing but the ceaseless rolling of the harsh thunder . Sometimes it lulled , like a distant roar . Sometimes it swept higher , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been an hour . It might have been forever . Everything else was gone from life . Memory faded from the beginning of the cannonade and stretched back endlessly , a memory of dull thunder rolling through murky heat , of a gray sky dripping on the garden . Dusk came like a slow-falling curtain . The murk deepened until there was nothing but a dusky , hot blackness . Then lights gleamed below on Main Street . The thunder grew intermittent and distant . They barely heard it now , in sullen growls . The rattle grew fitful . It came in spiteful bursts . Suddenly there was a low rumble on Main Street . The five figures stirred . John stood up . They all looked at Mrs. Wade . She was leaning forward and in the darkness Mildred saw the pallor of her face . The rumble came nearer . Over it rose voices in a deepening murmur . Then came a high shout . Edmonia groaned . " They done took the city , Miz Isobel . " " Keep quiet , Mamma , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Delphy was huddled against one of the columns . " I don ' know . Lissen . Gettin ' louder . " It was clearer now . It was the rumble of many wagons over the cobblestones . They could hear the clank of the horses ' shoes . The droning murmur was a moan . It sounded like a thousand men groaning together . Shouts clamored steadily now.  | " They done took the city , " Edmonia wailed . " I knowed they  --  " " Shut up , Mamma , " John said . " Thet ' s a newsboy . He ' s yellin ' extry . " " All of them are not newsboys , " Mrs. Wade said . She arose quietly and walked to the edge of the balcony . Mildred moved beside her mother . Her calm was almost hysterical . Across the slice of Main Street which they could glimpse , a wagon moved slowly . The moans rose high . " It ' s the wounded , " Mrs. Wade said in a dead monotone . " We done lost then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " " They would n't be coming back to Richmond if they ' d lost .. . John ! " " Yes ' m . " " Get Maggie to take all the coffee we have left and make a big pail of it . Have we any ice ? " " Yes ' m , we got a little . But Maggie ai n't here . " Mrs. Wade made no movement . She stared straight ahead , over the darkened garden to where wagons moved along Main Street . Her profile had the white stillness of a corpse . " Where is Maggie ? " " She gone with Josiah . Say Yankees come foh to free ' em . They goin ' to the Yankees . " Mildred could hear Edmonia and Delphy draw in their breath and wait . " Did Sam and Felissy go too ? " John was silent . It was Delphy 's voice that came quavering . " You got ta fohgive them , Miz Isobel . They don ' know whut they doin ' . They b'lieve everything Josiah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed same like he put a spell on ' em . I swear foh Gawd , Miz Isobel , they don ' mean nothin ' wrong . " " Where are they ? " " I don ' know , ma'am , " John said . Mrs. Wade waited a moment . The groans below welled up louder . The line of wagons rumbled steadily across the slice of street . A shrill voice pierced the others . " Extry ! Extry ! Yankees driven back from Seven Pines . Ten thousand killed . " " Edmonia , you make the coffee , and , Delphy , you make a pail of ice water . " " Yes , ma'am . " " Yes ' m , Miz Isobel . " They scrambled up , went shuffling inside the house . In a second they heard Delphy 's voice out of the shadows . " John . You light sump'n in heah . Them nigguhs mout a come back heah . " " Excuse me , Miz Isobel , " John said . " I forgot to put on the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top to bottom . And when you come back , bring me Mr. Dinwiddie 's dueling pistols . Load them . " Mildred was getting afraid for her mother . " You do n't think they ' d try to harm us , do you , Mother ? " " They ' ve gotten liquor . That Josiah is a bad negro . " " But John ' 11 be here . " " No . John ' s going to take the coffee and water down to those wounded . You go with him and help those poor men . " " But we ca n't leave you here alone . " " You do as I say this time , Mildred . Your father ' s in a strange country , just like these men are . I ' d like to feel that some other woman would put his life before her own fears . " The heavy moan of many men grew and deepened , reaching up toward them on the porch . " They sound like they ' re beseeching us , " Isobel Wade said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people done to deserve this ? " " Extry ! Extry ! Yankees driven back from Seven Pines . Fifteen thousand killed . Half of First Vuhginia Regiment killed ! " " No ... " Her mother turned , looked full at Mildred with her dead eyes.  | " Is that Mr. Kirby 's regiment ? " Mildred nodded . She could n't get her breath . She felt as if her heart were not beating . Inside , all life had stopped . " Sit down , Mildred , " her mother said . " You look about to faint . " Mildred shook her head . " I  --  I 'll hurry up John . " She backed toward the doors . Her mother followed . " You 've seen him ? " " Yes . Yes , I saw him last night . He came to the dance where I was , stood outside in the rain , like a criminal . He came to see me because he knew he was going into the battle to-day . And I told him to go away . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Extry ! Extry ! Yankees driven back two miles . Twenty thousandkilled . First Vuhginia Regiment nearly wiped out . Captain Norton , Company D , killed ! " Mildred stumbled through the French doors . The dining room was black and sticky . She brushed against a chair and clung to the table for support . A dark shadow blocked out against the French windows . " Mildred . You ' re not to go down there looking for him . " " Company D is his ! " " Mildred . I 'll have you locked in the house before I 'll let you go down there looking for that man . " " You ca n't ! You hear ? You ca n't . I promised Father that as long as he lived I would n't see Brose Kirby . And I wo n't break that promise . I would n't break it last night . I let him go to that battle without a good-bye . But nothing in the world can stop me from finding out if he ' s alive or dead . " John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . His black face glistened with sweat . His eyes shifted from one to the other . He held the closed pistol case under his arm . There was a long silence . Then Mrs. Wade said :  --  " We wo n't need a light in here , John . Did you go over the house ? " " Yes ' m. "  | " Then leave the pistols in my sitting room upstairs . I 'll sit at the head of the stairs . I want you to go with Miss Mildred down to Main Street . She ' s going to help the wounded soldiers . You carry the coffee and water when Edmonia gets them ready . " The thin light of the taper vanished . In the hot blackness Mildredcould no longer see her mother . She had moved away from the window . Mildred felt for the door to the pantry , opened it from behind . " I ' m going now , Mother , " she said . Her mother made no answer . Mildred felt her way through the musty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women jumped , stared at her . " What 's mattuh with you , Miss Mildred ? " " You look same like a ghost standin ' theah . " " Have you got the coffee and water ready ? " " Just ' bout . " " All right . Give them to John . I ' 11 wait out on the portico . We ' ii go out through the back . " Outside the moan swelled and rolled in like a sullen surf . The groans of the men and the rumble of the wagons were indistinguishable . It was all one sound , the whole city wailing . She heard faintly , back on Broad Street , the tolling of the bell in the Virginia Central Depot . More soldiers arriving . More men to be thrown against the army lusting for the city . More men to come moaning through their city 's streets . And how long would it last ? How long before the foreign men would come marching in behind the wounded ? " I ' m ready , Miss Mildred . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down the steps to the garden , and to the gravel walk along the brick slave houses . There were no lights in them tonight . " Where are Edmonia and Delphy ? " " They sittin ' at the head of the stairs with Miz Isobel . I don ' know what to make of Miz Isobel . She look so funny , sittin ' theah with a pistol in each hand . Nevuh sayin ' a word . "  |p149They  passed out through the wooden gate between the quarters and the stable . People were hurrying down the hill . Their faces were awful to see . They had heard the news too . The First Virginia Regiment was composed largely of Richmond men . They were the men who had laughed and sung on these same streets that night last spring . Brose had been one of them , in a high-buttoned brown coat , his face dark in the glare of torches . She remembered him in his new uniform that afternoon , with the braided collar and the soft gray cloth of his jacket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining on the cape of his overcoat and a cadet cap shading his eyes . And she remembered him last night , with a wet gray shirt plastered to his shoulders and a slouch hat dripping water . He had marched alone to the roll of drums . There were no drums needed for these men now . The first ones she saw lay on the bottom of a springless wagon . She had not known that human beings could be so dirty . Then she saw that their faces were black . It was gunpowder , burnt in . Their clothes were filthy . Patches hung loose and long rents exposedthe flesh . Plastered to them was mud , wet and oozing . Trickling through the mud was blood . They groaned when they rolled . There was no straw in the wagon . A man at the edge pitched over and she saw the dark red fluid matted against his chest . Flies buzzed over it . The wagon started to sway . The whole street was swaying . The groans receded . Something cold struck her face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Miss Mildred ! " She was leaning against John 's arm and he was splashing water in her face . The ground steadied . The groans swelled loud again . She heard the voices about her , crying out . Where is he , where is he , where ... A heavier rumble rolled toward them . Mildred slowly straightened . " Don ' look now , Miss Mildred . " She pushed away from him . A coal cart rumbled past . The arms and legs tumbled together were stiff . Out of the back a headp150hung down . The mouth dropped open . Above the mouth there was a blackened red hole . Flies .. . " Give me some water , John . " She closed her eyes . " Heah you are , Miss Mildred . Maybe we bettuh go back . " She shook her head , sipped the cool water . Another wagon rumbled past . She looked over the cup . The bloody , muddy uniforms had been gray . She had seen others like them , when they were new and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She moved toward the wagon . Her legs were shaking . " Driver ! Driver . . . First Virginia ... " " No ' m . Fo'ty-first . " Water . . . water . . . water .. . She had the cup in her hand . She held it to John . He spilled the water in pouring . She moved to the back of the wagon . The man was old . His beard was matted . She passed him the cup . He splashed it over him gulping it down . Water . . . water .. . She took the cup from his shaking hands and passed it to a young man . His face was green . He shook his head and raised his arm . It was red soaked .

The soldier 's head fell on the older man 's shoulder . Blood drained on the velvet collar . Where is he , where is he , where .. .  |p151A  cart rumbled heavily . A stiff arm pointed out of the still bodies , pointed straight upward to the night sky . Water ... A mud-caked man limped on his musket . John steadied him . Mildred held the cup to his mouth .

They could hardly get in for the people rushing in , wild-eyed , stumbling out , unseeing . Surgeons ' sleeves were rolled up above dripping red arms . The blood glistened in the lamplight . Stewards and quartermasters swarmed in intercircling lines , like scurrying ants . Their red hands carried bandages and medicines . They were the bandages the women had made . The beds werep152filled . They were putting men on the floor . The groans were a low undertone to the voices . " More hospitals . . . stores . . . warehouses . . . water , water ... homes . . . more beds . . . where is he ...

In the street light a new major 's galon gleamed on the sleeve . Last night that arm had been around her waist . Willie Kennard would dance no more . People packed outside the wholesale drygoods store of Kent , Paine . Mildred shoved through them to the inside . Bolts of cloth were stretched on the floor . Soldiers were laid on them . Surgeonsstaggered with bloodshot eyes . Groans murmured under the voices . Quartermasters dripped mud and blood on the pallets they laid . " Where are the men of the First Virginia ? " Outside the groans were dying . It was the calling voices that wailed . The rumble of wagons was thin . A dead cart passed under a street lamp . Flies swarmed over it . A crowd was formingin front of Keen , Baldwin 's , the wholesalers . " Turnin ' everything into hospitals , " John said . Mildred pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high long sigh . At the doorway a young girl moved out supporting a drooping soldier . A dark older woman helped him from the other side . The soldier 's head was sagging . In the dim light the girl 's face suddenly took form . Mildred pushed toward her . " Miss Kirby , " she cried . The girl turned slowly . Her face was wet white . Her eyes stared , and she focused slowly , like a person waking out of a dream . Thep153soldier lifted his head . It was Paul , the sixteen-year-old brother . I Es face was drawn tight . His lips were gray . His eyes were an old man 's . But they steadied on her and the mouth parted in a ghastly smile.

Her mouth was a cruel line . " Come on  --  Mother . . . " Paul 's head drooped again . Mildred spun around . She moved through the crowd . She saw nothing , heard nothing . The woman hated her . " Mildred ! " She turned slowly . It was old Mr. Paxton . He was gray . His kit was off and the dye in his hair streaked down on his forehead and neck . The high , winged collar drooped over his coat . He touched John 's arm , rested himself . " Mildred . I ' m helping out with the Medical Department . Terriblesituation here . Not enough beds , nurses , nothing . Could you and your mother offer a few rooms ? " " Yes , sir . Only too gladly . We ' re good for ten . " " Thank you  --  " " Please , do n't thank me . I ' 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send them right up . It wo n't be for long . " He turned back down Main Street hill . Mildred moved on . The wails hung over all the city . The groans murmured on inside her . John swung the empty pails . He was nting . They turned up toward the house . People still moved wn the street with those wide eyes , those moving lips . Where he . . . where is he . . . A boy ran toward them , yelling . Ike s waving slips of yellow Confederate newspaper.  | " Extry ! Extry ! Five thousand Confederates killed and wounded ! " They turned in through the back gate . The quarters were still dark . John unlocked the kitchen door . The lights burned low . They walked through the silent house into the hall . " Mildred ! " It was her mother 's voice . " Yes , Mother . Did they come back ? " " Yes . I sent them away . All of them . " Mildred heard John draw in his breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant for good . " I told them if they wanted to be free  --  they were . Josiah said he was coming back . " " He bettuh not , " John said . " I told Mr. Paxton they could send ten wounded soldiers here , " Mildred said . " They ' re short of hospitals . " " Thank God we can help them . John , is there any of Mr. Dinwiddie'sbrandy left ? " " One bottle , Miz Isobel . " " Get that out and use up our tea . Edmonia and Delphy , you get busy . " Mildred heard them scuffling upstairs . John moved silently back into the pantry . Mildred looked at the sofa against the wall . She was aware all at once that her whole body ached . She stepped toward the sofa , then stopped . If she sat down , she would not rise again this night . There was a clatter of horses ' shoes on the flagstone and the rumble of a wagon coming into the drive . She thought of the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Brose , lying in the hard bottom of a springless wagon , moving toward a stranger 's house in a strange town . She walked stiffly down the hall and threw open the front door . The wagon had stopped . The low groans hummed in the hot night . At last the house was quiet . The wounded men had been more wakeful than on any night since they had come , two weeks before.  |p155They  could n t stop talking of Jeb Stuart 's ride around McClellan . " That little cavalry rode around the whole Yankee army . . . only one man lost . . . . See that plume on Stuart 's hat ? . . . Wa' n't he sump'n ? . . . They might have the navy , but we got the cavalry . . . . " Mildred had heard little of Jeb Stuart before . Turner Ashby was the name that had conjured . Ashby had been the famous cross-country rider of whom Dennis was forever speaking ; then he had become the cavalry leader who made legends with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always writing . Her father 's letters had changed since the Valley campaign . No more was he one of Richmond 's Company F , trudging on bootless marches in a strange country , sleeping wet and dreaming of his home , pulling caissons through muddy ruts , suffering the cold that whistled through the mountain passes . Now he was " one of Jackson 's men . " " So long as a man of us lives , " he had written , " he will not forget the Valley Pike this spring . The air is as sweet as wine . . . . We have played tag with the three armies of Banks , Fremont and Shields , and we have routed each in detail . . . , The green rollinghills are beautiful . We have plenty of forage . . . . We have driven the three armies from the Valley and McDowell huddles close to Washington , afraid of our attack . . . . Last night we ( lanced in Winchester . The people were so happy to see us .... " And through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Ashby on his milk-white horse , Ashby the last man to retreat on a rear-guard action , Ashby with lifted sabre and his charmed life . Too soon his charmed life had ended , ended in a rear-guard action , ended with " Charge , men , for God 's sake , charge . " There was only the legend left . " We will never see his like again . " And now it was Jeb Stuart . The city had been singing when his column rode swinging past that afternoon . Mildred had leaned out of the window with several of the wounded soldiers . They had pointed out the lean , blond Farley , the volunteer aide ; the beautiful , slender boy Pelham of the horse artillery ; the massive Prussian ,  | Heros von Borcke , with the great sword ; the giant Rooney Lee , son of the new general of the army . Then she had seen a big man laughing . Suddenly the cheering swelled . The soldiers beside her started yelling in their weak voices . A plume waved on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on his yellow sash . A doeskin gauntlet flashed as he saluted the crowd . Then she heard his golden voice and saw his eyes , blue and shining . " So that ' s Jeb Stuart . No wonder Chester loves him . " The wounded men would talk of nothing else . It was late before they were quieted and the house was silent . Mildred sat at the window of her room , overlooking the shadowedgarden . In the distance she saw the glow of the campfires of McClellan 's army . Not a breath of air stirred . The faint fragrance of the flowers and the linden blossoms mingled with the smell of sweat and antiseptics , of sick flesh and medicines . A wagon rumbled over the canal bridge and a muffled drum rolled the death march . Another night funeral . Then from Franklin Street rang out the harsh voice of one of Winder 's military policemen . " Halt ! Who goes there ? " Suddenly she remembered sitting at this window as a little girl , looking down over the darkened city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft call : " All ' s well . " Those words , in those lost days , had evoked all the peace and security of their lives in the city , seemed to suggest all the magic of the city 's life which she would know when she grew up . All ' s well . . . . The words echoed in her memory . Was there a person in Richmond with whom all was well ? She wondered what shadowed streets Brose walked to-night , how his dark passion was spent . He was in Richmond , she knew , with the remnants of his shattered regiment , helping recruit and reorganize . She had heard of all that , heard that new recruits were hard to come by for the luckless " Bloody First . " But they were soon to rejoin those men who slept to-night in the malarial thickets of the Chickahominy , who slept between the beleaguered city and the tightening ring ofp157McClellan 's army . Nothing could be well for a man returning to those long watches in the swamp , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a woman who loved a man of that suffering army . Nothing would ever be well again for those who slept in Richmond on this hot June night , and waited for  --  what ?  | " Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southernstates that by the accession of a Republican administration , their property and peace and personal security are to be endangered . There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension . . . and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed forces of the soil of any state . . . as among the gravest of crimes . . . . "  --  President Lincoln , quoted by PresidentDavis to the Confederate CongressFive miles northeast of Richmond the crossroads town of Mechanicsvillelay deserted by its inhabitants . Empty window sockets exposed the desolated rooms behind smouldering walls . Among the ruins , honeysuckle and woodbine climbed the porch trellis of the one house that stood untouched in the swirling smoke . On the main road outside the town , the plunder of a wrecked beer garden was scattered through a cleared grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned farmhouses looked over golden fields of unharvested wheat and pale green rows of tasseled corn . Over the red-clay road , farmers and their wives , their children and their old people , trudged toward Richmond . They straggled into Venable Street , past the Queen Anne house where Mrs. Fitchett watched from a dormer window , down the slope of Seventeenth Street to where the columned arches of the Old Market stretched shadows toward the slave block , up Franklin Street hill past the Ballard and Exchange hotels where rays of the falling sun flashed in field glasses upon the roofs , and into the rollinggreen hills of Capitol Square where groups huddled in thep162dusky shadows of trees . The refugees joined the townspeople , and waited . The only sound was the blasting thunder of the guns beyond Mechanicsville . From the roof of the Capitol , St. George Paxton watched the refugees while he waited for Virginius Kirby to finish with the telescope . Jefferson Davis , he knew , watched too , with his family and friends , from his gray mansion on Court End hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns that echoed in the twilight over the Chickahominy . What was the President thinking as he saw his people , homeless and exiled , and heard those cannons smashing out the lives of his countrymen ? Did he worry over the invaded young country , or did he ponder his own fate if the new capital fell ? " It ' s no use trying to see any more , St. George . It ' s too dark . " Virginius was gray , and in the gathering dusk the lines in his face looked black . St. George stared toward the river valley where hot smoke billowed and red splashed from the mouths of unseen guns . A shell burst high and golden sparks streaked down the deepening blue sky . " I believe the firing is growing heavier again . " " Maybe our men are trying another attack . I do n't think that Yankee line has moved back an inch . " The bellow of the heavy guns deepened and vibrated through him . The roof shook , glass rattled . The people on the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , on a dusk breeze , there floated faintly an echo of a high-pitched , longdrawnscream . " The Rebel Yell ! " The crowd cried out . " They ' re charging again . " Despite himself , St. George felt his heart beat faster as the thunder reverberated through him . The savage yell of charging men mingled with the thin crackle of muskets , and the old beau knew a premonitory fear . It was not for himself . The premonitionwas for the people on the roof , hushed with anxiety . He looked where they looked , where the night fell in smoky billows over a red arc of roaring guns . That arc did not move back.  | " Stonewall Jackson must not have come . " Virginius ' voice was lifeless . " Are you sure they were depending on him ? " St. George looked at him . " I ' ve heard enough in the War Office to know they expected him to sweep around the Yankee flank and rear while A. P. Hill attacked in front . But while I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and Longstreet and D. H. Hill were moving through Mechanicsville in support when I left . A. P. Hill had cleared the town and the Yankees had taken a strong position behind breastworks on the opposite bank of Beaver Dam Creek . " " And you think they ' re still fighting along that creek ? " " I ' m sure of it . . . . Listen ! It 's dying down . " The fury left the firing and the evening breeze brought no more rebel yells . St. George 's fear ebbed with the fighting , leaving only a strange sadness . He was not given much to emotions these clays , but he knew Beaver Dam Creek from possum-hunting days . The near bank was soggy and covered with dense thickets . The opposite bank , heavily wooded , reared sharply . He could not tell Virginius that it might well be a deathtrap , for his two nephews were there .

" The war clerk 's gloomy voice sounded in the darkness . " I reckon he did n't get here . " The dying thunder of the guns was like a summer storm rumbling down the river . " Do you suppose the United States Army in the Valley discovered he was slipping away to join Lee ? " " We have n't heard of any alarms there . McDowell is still waiting in front of Washington against Jackson 's attack . They do n't know where he is . " St. George shifted nearer him , peered at his stricken face . Virginiusstill watched the sulphurous clouds that billowed through the blackness over the Chickahominy . Isolated flashes lit the horizon on the far bank of Beaver Dam Creek . A shell burst high and livid lines streaked across the new bright stars . The crackle of muskets was faint and fitful . " Virginius , " he said quietly , " does this mean that Lee 's whole plan of breaking the siege has failed ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chickahominy . Magruder is still facing him , making a demonstration to keep McClellan from sending reenforcements over to the Mechanicsville side . But , you see , if Jackson had come up and gotten in the flank and rear , McClellan 's whole right wing would ' ve been caught betweenpincers and annihilated , and the Yankees would be cut off from their base . " " Yes , I see that , but what will happen if Jackson failed to get here ? " " What you saw , " he said hopelessly . " We made a frontal attack and drove them out of Mechanicsville , which does n't mean a row of beans . . . except that we 've lost men and probably warned them that Jackson has come down from the Valley . " St. George hesitated to speak his mind . The people on the roof were murmuring now . From snatches of their words it was plain they knew nothing of what had happened . They did n't even know if it were safe to go to bed . Where the rolling smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was almost silent . In that silence , they seemed to sense defeat . He spoke with slow deliberation . " Then , Virginius , if they ' re warned of Jackson 's coming , so that plan is nullified , and if they could sweep aside Magruder 's handfulon the south of the river and seize the city , would n't it be the point of wisdom to surrender the city  --  save further loss of blood , and the desolation of  --  " " God , Saint ! " Virginius whirled on him as though a new source of life had vitalized him . " If Richmond falls , the Confederacy falls . We manufacture virtually all the cannon here and half the munitions . " " I see . " Before the war clerk 's passionate zeal , he could n't go on.  |p165He  could n't say that the fate of Virginia , and their city , should be of more importance than the Confederacy . Virginius Kirby was caught up in the cause of the new country , like a religion . It was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangeredtheir city and their civilization for an ideal with which they had no business . He glanced over the sloping roofs of the old city , at the lights glowing in dormer windows . Accumulations of lifetimes were stored in those houses , and mementos of the dead . The wide streets , shaded by old trees , were sweet with associations for all of them , reaching backward into time and perpetuating their customs and loyalties . Yet he would be hooted down if he warned these people that they had exposed all that for a dying and half-foreign way of living ; that thousands of men who walked these streets on summer nights would never walk them again , nor would there be children of theirs to walk them . He heard around him women crying softly and men cursing under their breath in fear for their city , but he knew he would be their enemy if he spoke . He let his gaze roam over the lighted windows of old haunts he had known when he was young and walked the streets on hot nights like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My men can stand almost anything . They can stand that . "  --  General Stonewall Jackson to General Lee as his troops moved into action at Gaines 's Mill , the second battle of the Seven Days around Richmond , June 27 , 1862Nobody knew why they halted . Ahead , the musket fire was very heavy and the sullen growl of guns echoed through the woods . They could see nothing in the dense pine woods that walled each side of the road . The air was thick with red-clay dust . The order to fall out was passed along the line and the men dropped in the thin shade along the edge of the woods . They threw their stained , floppy hats beside them , slipped out of their blanket rolls and haversacks . Sweat gleamed like rain in their beards and shaggy hair , and their patched , faded uniforms were black with it . They unbuttoned shirts and dug for chiggers burrowing into their hairy flesh . Lieutenant Dinwiddie Wade walked ahead , up the road , to discoverwhy they had halted . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day . He passed the Stonewall Brigade to the head of the column . The woods ended and rough ground sloped in front of him . Along the edge of the trees men of another outfit were resting . Stonewall Jackson stood a few feet from the woods , sucking at a lemon , and peering under the brim of his faded cadet cap at another general . A close-cropped beard bordered the other general 's face , spare , intelligent , determined , and driving eyes were fixed on Old Jack as he talked . That must be D. H. Hill , Jackson 's brother-in-law . Both were sprayed with red-clay dust and Stonewall 's thick beard was tinted with it . Dinwiddie grew conscious of the men along the woods staring at him . He knew a swift pride in being " one of Jackson 's men . " A young officer stepped out from the troops and walked toward him . Rivulets streaked his saddle-brown face and his skin might have been wet leather . Dinwiddie recognized Baylor Warwick and started eagerly toward him . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a quickly smiling youth , with beautiful manners , in his parlor on West Franklin Street . He grasped his hand and shook it heartily . " I ' m so glad to see you , Baylor , " he cried . " You ' re the first person I ' ve met from Richmond . " " I ' m glad to see you , sir . " The smile of memory flashed briefly . " My men are very curious about you-all after your wonderful Valleycampaign . I reckon Stonewall Jackson is the most famous soldier in the country . "  | ' 7 " Yes , yes , " Dinwiddie dismissed that . " But how is Richmond standing the siege ? Did that battle yesterday help any ? " " It would ' ve broken it completely by crushing McClellan 's right if you-all had come up and cooperated with us at Mechanicsville , like we expected . But they ' ve just retreated a few miles and taken a strong position on that hill over yonder , behind another creek . What happened to Jackson yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those bleak , weary eyes . Suddenly he realized he was not talking with a deferential young man who visited his home as his daughter 's guest , but to a grim major . " We just could n't make it , " he said in a subdued voice . " You know that terrain we marched over ? " " I ' ve fought over it for the last month . " " Then you can appreciate how hard it must ' ve been on men accustomed to the Valley country . Even the Richmond men in CompanyF suffered . I ' ve never seen such heat and dust , and the flies and mosquitoes were a torment . Then , the roads were obstructed by felled timber and we were harassed by cavalry . None of us knew if the Yankees knew who we were . " " They know now all right , " Major Warwick answered brusquely . " That ' s A. P. Hill and Longstreet you hear hitting that hill way over yonder on the other side , east of Cold Harbor Tavern . Hill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all afternoon , he ' 11 be hurt worse to-day . We expected to combine with youalland catch them in flank and rear , like we wanted to yesterday . Now Jackson 's holding back D. H. Hill here and waiting for the Yanks to be driven across our front . But they ' re not driving worth a damn , and wo n't , with the position they 've got on top of that hill in front of us . " Lieutenant Wade looked across the sloping ground in his front to where it dipped into a ravine . On the opposite side of the ravine , a wooded hill slanted upward to a plateau , where the sun gleamed on unseen guns . " Is that hill on our front their flank ? "  | The major nodded morosely . " But it ' s too late to box them and if we do n't attack soon , it ' 11 be too late to drive them back across the river . " " Does that mean , " Dinwiddie asked hesitantly , " that McClellan can send over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hell , he wo n't have to . He ' 11 gobble up that little army of Magruder in front of him south of the Chickahominy and march into Richmond to-morrow like he was on parade . And they could keep us right here on this side , too . " The lieutenant shifted uneasily . He glanced at the wraiths of smoke drifting over the hill . " I ' 11 admit , " he said apologetically , " I never fully understood this campaign . " " Forget this campaign stuff ! You 're not in the Valley now , manoeuvring for position on country roads . You ' re trying to break a siege on your city . Do n't you grasp the simple fact that if we do n't carry this position to-day , you and I will be homeless tomorrow ? And when Richmond falls , the Confederacy falls , and we ' 11 be without a country . " Dinwiddie said nothing . He looked away from the angry face . A sweating horse galloped along the edge of the woods . The animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a hotfacedman plunged off him . " That ' s one of General Lee 's couriers ! " The sullen fatigue lifted from Major Warwick . " I ' 11 wager Lee is ordering Jackson in . " " Then I ' d better be getting back to my men . " Dinwiddie turned quickly away and hurried along the columns . No one had respect now for anything but military success . Yet Baylor was right . That was what should be respected when they were trying to save Richmond . A bugle sounded . The tired troops struggled to their feet . Voices echoed through the woods . Dust rose . The lieutenant broke into a trot . His lips were tight together . When he reached his brigade the companies had formed . Captain Morgan was leaving Colonel Cunningham , their old captain . The colonel was leading the whole brigade to-day . Captain Mor/gan fell in beside Dinwiddie on their way to Company F. His thin dark moustache drooped over his fine mouth . " We ' re going in , lieutenant . " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through these woods , the brigades separately , to come out in support of A. P. Hill . Things look bad . If we fail to carry this position , Richmond is doomed . We 're the only Richmond company in this brigade , you know , and we want to lead the way . " " I ' 11 do my best , captain . " " God be with you . " They shook hands . Dinwiddie felt better . He ran to his platoon as orders rang through the pine trees . They deployed into the woods and the firing seemed louder . The brush was heavy underfoot and so thick he could n't see beyond his Twenty-first Regiment . He heard the men crashing ahead . They walked slowly . Nobody spoke . The sun did n't shine through the leaves , but the woods felt like an oven . In front , he glimpsed the shaggy heads of skirmishers . They bobbed up and disappeared in the thickets . Seeing nothing but the dense pine woods , hearing nothing but the crashing men and the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirmishers ahead , he realized what Baylor Warwick meant about the difference of open campaigns and fighting to break a siege on your own city . Somewhere near , Cold Harbor Tavern nestled under its shady trees . He pictured the white frame , dormer-windowed house , with its white picket fence running under trees , and he pictured Isobel , cool and lovely beside him in the surrey as they drove to the tavern on a hot afternoon like this . No one would leave sweltering Richmond to-day for the tavern . Some of these men walking with him had also known its pleasant shade , as had their wives and mothers and daughters , who waited now in the besieged city . Watching the men , he saw them stiffen . They grew as rigid as pointers . All along the line the crashing ceased . The only sound was the firing . Straight ahead the woods lightened . Dinwiddie pulled out his watch . They had been in the woods more than an hour . He knew they had lost their way . His breath came hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Yankee lines ? The men moved ahead again , toward the light . He saw the edge of the woods . The sun was setting and the sky was red over Richmond . They broke out into a waving field of broomstraw . The other regimentscame popping out along the woods . They moved in open lines across the field . Straight ahead , a knoll rose against the horizon . Muskets crackled thinly beyond the knoll . Guns roared in broken thunder . Knots of men moved on their side of the knoll . As he drew closer , Dinwiddie saw the men were hairy and fierce , in motley gray , and he knew he was in his own lines . His breath oozed out in a hot sigh . He felt the men relax . They moved steadily toward the knoll . He saw horsemen ride up to a neatly dressed , still , gray soldier on a big gray horse . Nearer , Dinwiddie noticed the powerful build of the officer . A long-brimmed felt hat shaded his eyes and a closely trimmed , darkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might have been carved in stone . The troops near him lifted up a high cheer and it came singing along the lines . The still gray soldier lifted his hat . Lieutenant Wade knew then why , to the army in front of Richmond , General Robert E. Lee had become a symbol within four weeks of command . They quickened their stride and moved up the knoll . Orders rang out over the rising rattle of muskets and the men wavered to a halt at the crest . The lieutenant 's breath sucked in . Straight across from them a wooded hill clattered with muskets and smoke floated over the trees like a veil . The hill pitched sharply into a ravine and from the ravine an open field sloped to where he stood . Baylor Warwick had said the Yankees held a strong position . It was impregnable ! Below him , he saw a scattered gray wave ebbingback up the slope , away from the deepening crackle from the hill . An officer galloped out from the troops below them and Colonel Cunningham rode down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared up at Jackson 's Second Brigade . Their faces were black with gun smoke and set as in death . Colonel Cunningham saluted their officer and galloped up the hill . The other officer waved his sabre . His men looked dogtiredas their broken lines re-formed and faced again the smoking hill . They loaded their muskets slowly . Colonel Cunningham rode up in front of his old company and yelled :  --  " Men , we were lost in the woods and came out on the extreme right , but we 're much needed . The Yankee line has n't been carried anywhere , and it ' s got to be  --  now or never . This brigade below us is Anderson 's of Longstreet , and they ' re going back in with us in support . " He turned toward a sweating soldier who thundered up , his horse plunging . They spoke briefly . The fire deepened . The colonel cried : " The whole line is advancing . General Jackson says we must sweep the field with the bayonet ... . Forward ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackle of muskets rushed to meet them . The wooded hill across the ravine burst into a deafening rattle . Smoke billowed out of the trees and floated in wreaths over the trotting men of Anderson 's brigade . They were swooping toward the ravine . On his left , Dinwiddie saw dim blurred waves of gray flowing through the thickening smoke toward the ravine . The guns on the plateau opened up and the ground trembled and they were swept with a gale of iron . He glanced at his men . They were coming on , faces set , eyes hot , their torn jackets flapping in the wind . The smoke became a fog and he could hardly see beyond his company . A shell burst and he staggered . It was like a blow on the skull . Fragments whistled . A man bent in the middle , coughed , and sat down . Through rifts in the choking smoke , he saw Anderson 's brigade on the right swallowed up in the shadows of the ravine . He would be there next . His breath clogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the smoke all the figures were misty . The rest of the regiment was only a blur.  | Beyond them he saw nothing . A cannon ball screeched over his head , but he did n't duck any more . Then , right in front of him , the ground dropped away in the high bank of a creek . Men stumbled to a quick stop and looked at him . A shell crashed and the ground coughed up , showering him . He looked again for the captain . Now he could n't even see the rest of the company . Shot from the hill swept over them like a wind . The men were waiting for him . " Throw your guns across the creek , " he shouted , " and jump in . " His voice sounded to him like a despairing wail in the rattling thunder . The air sung with a metallic buzz . He moved to the edge of the bank . Wild ferns squashed under his shoes . He jumped . The brown water cooled his shins . He heard crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes watered from the smoke . The roar seemed to beat him down behind these slippery banks . Maybe he had better stay here . The rest of the line might have gone back . He might lead his platoon into Yankee hands . If only he could see Captain Morgan . Voices drifted hoarsely out of the bedlam . What were they saying ? Whose were they ? Where was everybody ? Men were pushing others up the steep bank without orders . Half of them were out . One toppled backward . He splashed near the lieutenant and the water turned red . The men on top started pulling out those in the creek . He had never been a good officer , he knew that now . He had never been advanced , like others . Cunningham was out of the company entirely , leading the brigade . Captain Morgan had enlisted after he had , as adjutant . He saw the last man being pulled out . He could n't stay in the creek alone . He lifted up his arms . He was hoisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing from behind trees . He squatted behind a log . Ahead , the ground tilted toward a rail fence . He glimpsed logs stacked between the rails , flashes of brass buttons , a blurred face , and the flickering sheen of muskets . Shots from behind that fence hailed through the woods . A beardless young man in ap173sweat-black shirt and ripped gray trousers sprawled in a raspberry bush . A battered brown hat shaded his staring eyes . His still fingers were clenched about his rifle . Dinwiddie wet his lips . He glanced around him desperately . He was n't afraid for himself . Cunningham had said they were only in support ; but General Jackson had ordered them to sweep the field with the bayonet . Dusk was settling in the smoking woods and he could barely see the men of his own platoon . Up on the hill , on both sides of him , the rattle rose higher . It might be the charge , or a counterattack . Then off in the woods , where Anderson 's brigade had plunged , came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wailed through the bedlam and screeched down the spine of the lieutenant . Oh God , help me to be a good officer now . . . . He jumped up from the log , waving his sabre , and shrieked at the top of his voice : " Remember Butler in New Orleans and do n't let McClellan in Richmond . Charge , boys , for God 's sake , charge ! " Dusky forms rose whooping out of the shadows and floated forward through the trees . The Rebel Yell was caught up closer on his right and he was sure , then , that the whole line was advancing . His own men bayed the fierce cry and it tore through his throat . He became one of the hairy horde lunging for the fence . Shadows took form behind the fence , moving backward up the hill . Yellow spurted from them and minnie balls whined through the murky dusk . A man beside him bent like a sapling in a wind . Dinwiddie stumbled through a locust bush . An unseen hand plucked his sleeve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the fence and over . The hill climbed sharply , heavily wooded . So many blurred figures rushed through the trees that it looked as if the woods were alive . The swelling crackle reverberated and the Valkyrie scream wailed high and thin . Dinwiddie forgot the rest of the regiment , his superiors . He was leading his baying handful up the hill , straight at a second breastwork . In one moment dusky figures loomed behind it and in the next his men were swarming over it . The hill grew steeper . Leadp174rained down from a breastwork higher up . The lieutenant saw the deep blue sky beyond the breastwork and he knew that was the crest of the hill . His breath became labored . He staggered through underbrush . Yellow spurted over a pile of logs . He saw loose earth and haversacks between them . A dark face under a blue cap was right in front of him . Blue eyes stared . Dinwiddie whipped out his revolver , fired . The blue man did not move . Dinwiddiestood still , gasping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , again and again . The savages swooped over the breastwork and a soleless shoe glanced against the blue cap . The face disappeared . For a moment , the lieutenant was alone in the swirling smoke . He scurried up the hill after his men . He climbed the fence and stumbled out on level ground . The confusion broke the hard centre of his fury . He stood there , panting and shaking , the gun trembling in his fist . Somewhere field guns blasted . Shadowy men swarmed around him , flowing out in widening circles , covering a plateau that stretched as far as he could see . There were no regular lines . In broken waves and milling clots they churned through the smoky , dusty dusk . He saw the dull glint of guns , points of red stabbing everywhere . The yelling was deafening . Groans rose from the earth . Water , for the love of Christ , water . . . . Peering through the hot fog , he saw a knot of blue men standing silently , their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dusk at his right , sweeping toward him . He backed toward the fence , his wet hand clenching convulsivelyon the gun . Then he recognized the motley gray . They were Anderson 's brigade . They must have carried the line at the extreme right . The relief drained his strength . He slumped against the fence , trying to steady himself . Off to the left , a suddencrackle broke . He saw a solid dark line moving toward a farmhouse , blocked out against the sky . A ragged line , gray as the dust , was on the far side of the blue . Dinwiddie started forward . The Confederates were cut off . A hand clutched him and he sprawled . Water ... .  |p175Panicky  , he struggled free , stumbled over bodies , slipped in blood . This might be a counterattack . He searched blurred faces for an officer . By the farmhouse the rattle deepened and he saw gray ghosts flowing through the dusk toward the solid dark line . The dark line grew still . The Yankees were enveloped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The field guns roared again . The musket firing was thinner and he located the sound of the battery as across the plateau . His danger was over now . He moved among the milling men . Gold gleamed on a torn gray sleeve . He saw captain 's bars on a rent collar . He grabbed at the officer . " I ca n't find my commanding officers , " he cried . " What shall I do ? " Gray eyes peered out of a grimy , tired face . " I know what I 'm go ' do , and that ' s rest right heah . One of Jackson 's men , ai n't you ? " " Yes , we got lost and came out here . I ca n't find my  --  " " You couldn't 've come out at a better place .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did , McClellan ' d been in Richmond to-morrow . We were about done for . If only Jackson  --  " " Yes , I know . " Dinwiddie moved away from him , back into the churning mass . He heard the padded thunder of cavalry . Everybody whirled around . Where the field guns still roared , immense figures loomed through the smoking dusk . Fireflies darted near the farmhouse and a short , fierce volley crackled over the pounding hoofs . Dinwiddie saw the Yankee cavalry break and the gigantic figures recede . Gray hordes floated after them and the field guns grew silent . The last Yankee battery had been taken . No more cannons thundered . Muskets rattled fitfully . The men were sitting on the ground , lighting pipes , biting off chews of tobacco , searching dead Yankees for cigars . For them the battle was over . For a moment Dinwiddie wished he were176 BUGLES BLOW NO MOREone of them , and could give up to his own weariness . He moved on , searching for his men . A scraggly scarecrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of his corporals . " Where 's your squad ? " Dinwiddie said . " I du n no , suh . " " Find them and hold them right here . I ' ll form the platoon around you . " He walked farther across the plateau . He had never seen so many dead . A mounted officer rode out of the fog . " Colonel Cunningham ! " Dinwiddie ran toward him . " I ca n't find Captain Morgan . What shall I do with my platoon ? " " I ca n't find anybody , but never mind . Just bivouac your platoonhere . " " But have we carried the whole position ? " " The whole line . Hood 's Texans broke it in the centre with the bayonet . They advanced without firing a shot and the first Yankee line got panicky and carried the other two in their rout . Law 's brigade and Pickett 's Virginians also broke through . " " How about our brigades ? " " They got lost in the woods and each one came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most needed . It ' s too dark and too much confusion for pursuit or re-forming now . We ' 11 organize in the morning . " Dinwiddie turned slowly to round up his scattered platoon . Most of the men were so exhausted they were lying on the ground where they had stopped at the end of their charge . He hated to make them move . They would have nothing to eat but the corn pones they had in their haversacks because the wagons would not be up the hill to-night . That meant he would sleep without a blanket . Then he remembered that only seven miles away he had a home . BUGLES BLOW NO MORE 177 " Prisoners state that McClellan , realizing the fact that he was cut off from his base of supplies , commenced evacuating his position on this side of the Chickahominy as early as Friday night . . . moving siege pieces and such commissary stores as he had the means of transporting .

"  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill on the opposite bank of Black Creek when the advance clattered across the bridge which Captain Blackford 's engineers had built during the night . The horses plunged into the underbrush where the Yankee ambuscade had been flushed by Pelham 's guns yesterday afternoon . The mountaineerscout lifted his gaunt face in the morning mist and sniffed . His tobacco-streaked beard , reaching to his chest , stuck out like a muzzle . " I don ' smell of nary Yank . You sure we come to the right place foh theah base , cap'n ? " " We 've come to the base they had when we circled their army . " Chester had been breveted lieutenant after Seven Pines , and Tibe had called him captain ever since . " You saw it then . " " I see it then but I don ' ricollect it much . I cai n't figguh why we ai n't seen moh Yanks if'n this is theah base . " Chester could n't understand it either , but he had learned what to keep to himself . They broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw the crest drawn in a line against the lightening sky . Tibe swung his carbine around in front of him . The other cavalrymen did too . " Thet ' d be a nice place foh Yanks to be layin ' foh to gobble us up . " Chester nodded . He glanced back for Stuart 's main body . Pelham'shorse guns rumbled over the bridge . They looked a long way off . But he was an officer now ; he was where he had worked and prayed to be . " They must 've abandoned their base or we could n't have approached so easily . " He was thinking out loud . " We saw their fires last night . " " Yeh , ' n ' I seen you loosen yoh gun ' n ' shake out yoh sabre . I ' d a heap ruther see theah base ' bandoned than heah tell of it . " Chester saw the men spreading out . There was no sound but the horses plodding on the turf . If the Yankees were lying here .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let ' s ride . I cai n't wait no moh . " Chester knew he was right . He waved his sabre and dug in the spurs . The big chestnut lunged under him , the fresh dawn wind whipped his face , and the padded thunder of the hoofs rolled up the hill . When they broke the crest , he saw the long plain in front of Rooney Lee 's White House stretched before him , and , as far as he could see , smashed piles of army stores smouldered . Without an order , the riders pulled up and stared . Behind the burning wreckage , the remains of Rooney Lee 's home lifted thin smoke against the bluing sky . " Damn ! " Tibe grunted . " As empty of Yanks as a roost is of chickens after Hood 's Texicans done passed . " " Keep your eyes sharp , anyway . " This could n't be the end of all their hard riding , of detaching themselves from the main army , of all the plans . . . a smoking pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced back . The main body had n't cleared the underbrush . It was up to him . He 'd rather die than move into an ambush . They were walking their horses , eyes strained ahead . They passed a deserted sutler 's wagon , its shafts in the grass . Then he saw the Yankees , a knot of them standing in dejected patience . They had no arms . Deserters ! McClellanhad changed his base . He did n't want to have to report that to General Stuart . " Leave those stragglers for General Stuart to question . Let ' s have a look at this refuse . " " Don ' sound so doleful , cap'n , " Tibe said . " It 'll be a lot in them sto'es whut we wo n't refuse . Heh-heh-heh . " They trotted past the Yankee stragglers . Near them a brokenP179army wagon drooped in , a clutter of boxes . Rifles , blankets , overcoats , and haversacks were scattered over the trampled ground , increasingas they approached the burning piles . The cavalrymen began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stared with popping eyes . Tibe gave a wheezy sigh that fluttered his scraggly moustache . " Great Gawd Almighty . You reckon they left all this foh us ' thout pizenin ' it , cap'n ? I ai n't never see the like . " " Take a good look , men , and see what you can save . " They rolled off their horses , whooping , and went at the stores like hounds at a rabbit hole . They rushed back out , their cheeks bulging and food oozing from their mouths . They broke boxes , knocked the heads off bottles , slashed open tins with sabres . A yellow-toothed farm boy proudly clutched a toothbrush . A kegchestedIrishman swallowed chocolate mints whole . Tibe came up to Chester , chortling . " Look heah , puttin ' little fish in these yere cans when they were camped right alongside the York River . Whut these little things taste like anyhow ? " He swallowed a sardine . " Pugh . I would n't tease my gullet with nasty little minnows like thet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ' re thousands of stands of rifles and a lot of corn that have n't been hurt . Get the men to gather those , and anything else we can use . " He whirled his horse . The main body was dismounting on the plain , where the stores began , and General Stuart and his staff were looking at them . Chester put his big gelding into a trot . As much as the army could use the salvaged arms and supplies , it was small reward for their bitter campaign and the heavy casualties . He pulled up near General Stuart . The general was talking with Farley , the aide . The early morningbreeze ruffled his moustaches and plume , the great beard shone , and the golden spurs and yellow sash gleamed in the sun . Behind him some of the troops worked over a salvaged ice machine and others squeezed lemons . Bottles of champagne lay like quail in the grass . The three giants of Jeb Stuart 's cavalry stood around them . It was easy to see what occupied the simple mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black beard , which covered everything but his nose , his eyes glistened in speculation . Baron Heros von Borcke , the Prussian staff officer who had run the blockade , looked beyond the men at the smoking stores . Standing erect with one arm cocked on the iron hilt of his great sword , one leg bent above the rolled top of his huge boots , his curved moustache swept out from his puzzled face , and his eyes were pained . Chester knew he was saddened by the waste . Rooney Lee stared beyond the stores at the ruins of his home . His eyes were kind like his father 's , and Chester turned away from him . He did n't want to know that soldier 's thoughts as he looked at the house where he had brought his wife . Then General Stuart called him . " They got away from us , old Cary . McClellan changed his base and must 've scurried for his gunboats on the James . I was afraid he might get his army out of the trap General Lee set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower Chickahominy with the First Virginia . I must be sure McClellan ' s not retreating down the Peninsula . " Chester saluted and swung up on his horse . He was glad to get away from this scene of waste . Scouting , he might do some good yet . They must trap McClellan 's army . He must n't escape and be able to return and besiege Richmond again . Too much had been lost just to break the siege . They had to crush him . General Fitz Lee 's regiment swung toward him . The troopers had finished with the ice machine and were pouring cold champagne lemonade into big goblets . Hagan hovered over them solicitously . Even von Borcke turned away from his contemplation of the wreckage . Only Rooney Lee had n't moved . The men served the officers . The general 's drink contained no champagne . A skinny city man , wearing Yankee breeches , came forward with a box of Havana cigars , puffing one himself . Chester walked his horse to the head of the First Virginia column and reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at those plundering the stores with joyful yelps . The line moved forward . As he rode toward the rising sun , in search of the re-P181treating Union army , he saw the officers lounging on the lawn with their champagne and cigars , and Sweeney was coming up with his banjo . If you want to have a good time , fine the cavalry .. . No moh driver 's lash for me , No moh , no moh ; No moh driver 's lash for me , Many thousand go ... . They were rolling dead bodies in an open trench as if they were shoveling trash . In the July heat the stench was sickening . LieutenantPhilip Parramore , Medical Purveyor , checked his horse as he breasted the wooded hill . He held his handkerchief over his nose . Behind him , one of his two-man detail spat . The gravediggersleaned on their shovels and looked at Philip . One of them brushed a mist of flies away from his head and squirted a stream of tobacco juice across the trench . It splattered on the horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . " I ' m looking for abandoned medical supplies , " he said . " Do you know if there are any around here ? " " Naw . This was the left flank of the Yankee line and they did n't have no supplies here . . . except shoes . " Philip 's eyes lowered to the trench . Bluish , bloated , grimy naked feet protruded from blue trousers . His stomach heaved . Convulsivelyhe jammed in the spurs and the small mare plunged . Philip rocked back , jerking the reins , then releasing them as he grabbed the horn . The horse skittered around the trench at the crest of the hill . " Heh-heh ! Come chargin ' up the hill like Jackson 's Second Brigade . " Philip tried to quiet the mare , but she fought the bit , moving out across an open plateau . The field was covered with people . His two-man detail trotted up behind him and his little horse quieted . Philip wiped his greasy face . All along the crest of the hill , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A broken fence ran along the top of the hill , with ripped haversacks and scorched blankets and clods of earth shoved against it . That must have been the last Yankee line in the Cold Harbor battle . He thought of the Confederates charging up that hill he had just ridden . The sweat turned cold . Around a wrecked caisson , dripping men in dirty gray were cutting harness off dead horses . A quartermaster captain , his jacket and striped trousers black with sweat , fanned away flies while he directed soldiers who were piling blankets and overcoats and haversacksin heaps . Two bearded old men drove a wagon loaded with Yankee Enfield rifles . Cursing soldiers under a gray-moustached officer hitched heaving work horses to gun carriages with " U S " on the boxes . Nothing resembled medical supplies . Then he saw masses of people creeping over the torn earth , bent in gruesome harvest . Some were soldiers but most were civilians  --  all ages , all classes , men and women . The stooped people picked among debris that was strewn across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rotten food mingled with that of the corpses . Philip brought his handkerchief over his nose again , pretending to wipe his face . " Look for medical supplies here , " he called to the two men , and turned his horse toward a farmhouse . Nobody looked up as he moved through the mob . A gray old woman with frenzied eyes held out her apron and crammed pickle jars in it , on top of meat tins and Edinburgh ale . A sallow-faced young man in a gray plaid suit staggered under a case of oranges . A red-faced soldier with sweat circling a scar on his cheek was drinking lemon syrup while he stood guard over packages of ground coffee . Soldiers worked out from him in a widening arc , pushing away the civilians from any coffee they found . A fat man , sitting on his coat beside a stinking heap of smashed sardine cans , drank a bottle of porter . Philip 's horse suddenly skittered . Four dead mules lay almost in a heap and a cloud of flies buzzed up from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head swam . He pushed the horse fast through fresh red-clay mounds in what had been a garden . There was a narrow strip of shade beside a shattered wall of the square , gray farmhouse . He fanned his face with his visored cap . Through the wrecked window beside him he saw walls honeycombedwith minnie balls and brown blotches of blood on once polished floors . He was afraid of being sick . His detail rode up then and looked at him curiously . " Nuthin ' round heah . " He nodded , pressing his lips tight together . He tasted the bile in his throat . He tensed his torso and walked the horse ahead . The sick wave receded . A desolated wheat field stretched from behind the house to a distant drop . Scavengers grouped around *trenchdiggingsoldiers . Nearer , he saw the scavengers were also soldiers . They worked silently , bent over , pulling shoes off dead Yankees . Philip tried not to look . He faced directly a red-bearded barrel of an officer chewing a cud . Red clay and lime coated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m looking for medical supplies , " Philip began . " You ' re about four days too late . " The officer bit off his words in a harsh voice . " You 'll have to follow the line of the goddamnedYankee retreat to Malvern Hill . " " Where they fought yesterday ? " " Yes , yesterday ! " He glanced up out of hard blue eyes .. " The fighting 's over and you 're safe . So is McClellan . He 's at the James and all you people who skulked in Richmond can honeydip over the fields where his damned army has been running for the List seven days . " Philip turned from the contempt and flicked in his spurs . Thelittle mare broke into a fast canter . Why must he always falterbefore any man with a sure grip on reality ? Could n't he remember that he too now lived in reality , with authority , and money , and aret power ? The fear seemed to lie too deep , down in thecmories of his pose-life , and pulled at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be found out , for even now he wanted to be what he was not . In the War Office and Medical Department , around the Spotswood Hotel and Swan Tavern , he was accepted by the departmental clerks and subofficials , the surgeons and assistants , the quartermasters and ordnance officers and details . It gave him the illusion of complete acceptance . But here on the field the fighting man 's contempt was revealed , and , above all , he wanted now to be accepted by the soldiers . He saw where the brush was mashed , winding down the slope , and the earth rutted with gun carriage and wagon wheels . Split haversacks and blankets lay in the brush . He was on the line of the retreat . How would it feel to be a soldier hot in pursuit of the United States Army ? Mounted , he would be in the cavalry advance , his old dream . He came out on a rutted road . With his two men following , he hurried his mare into a gallop over the hilly road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the sluggish , spreading river below him . His excitement choked off and his heart jammed in his throat . Blue soldiers moved over the road on the opposite bank . Paralysis left his hands and he started to haul in on the reins . Then he saw dust-gray men with shining muskets behind and beside the Yankees . Prisoners ! He released the reins as his contracted breath gasped out . He was shaking , and hot with shame . He pounded across the bridges that Stonewall Jackson had flung across the swampy waters . Mounds of rice and grain and piles of wrecked pontoons smouldered on the banks and on the islands . Parts of uniforms and more blankets lay trampled in the mud . He passed the silent soldiers , looking away from the shaggy-bearded Confederates . He was still sickened by his shame . Slowing to a walk up the winding road , he wondered what it was that he lacked . These men could n't be so careless of their lives , indifferent to hardship . He could endure hardship , even risk his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , but of life . He feared he would not measure up in the eyes of those who belonged . He turned into the Williamsburg Stage Road and passed McClellan 's abandoned breastworks around Seven Pines . TheyP185had been close then ! What would have happened if they had reached Richmond ? Suppose all the departments had been called out to fight at the inner lines ? That might happen yet . . . . He shuddered away from the thought . He glanced at the debris that littered the roadside , searching again for medical supplies . Rifles gleamed dully in the trampled grass , broken wagons sprawled . The wreckage thickened . In a clearing he saw wrecked ambulances , then broken stretchers and cots , split boxes , and everywhere were scattered strips and wads of graying bandages splotched with brown blood . This was evidently the hospital base where McClellan had abandoned two thousand wounded . " Look around here , men , " Philip said . " We 'll surely get all the supplies we can carry in this field hospital . " He leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket felt like a hot blanket swathing him . He realized that he was close to the battleground of Savage Station , where Magruder had hit the retreating Unions , expecting Stonewall Jackson to get them in flank . But Jackson had had to build those five bridges across the Chickahominy , which he had just ridden over , and did n't get up . In Richmond , when he heard of the battles , Philip thought of straight lines facing each other across open , flat fields . But these fields wandered for miles , up hills , down ravines , across creeks , through swamps , and in these dense woods thick with underbrush . It was far worse than he had imagined . You would never know where an enemy was waiting for you . His two men came galloping toward him . A relieved sigh cased his body . At last he could get away from this place , back to his room in the Spotswood , for a clean bath , fresh linen , a change of uniform , and a glass of amontillado before dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages . One held his nose . The other spat . " Damnedest thing you ever saw . Bastards ' ye thrown all the medical supplies together in a mess so ' s nobody ca n't get no moh use from them . "  | " No ! " His brain could n't accept it . " McClellan could n't have destroyed his medical supplies when he abandoned all these wounded . " " You mout n't call ' em dee-stroyed , but they come nigh deestroyin ' us . I swear , I never smelt nuthin ' that stunk like that . Ai n't ary pill even , what they ai n't ruint . " Philip slumped there for a moment . He glanced at their stupid faces . He knew nothing of such men . He was afraid to chance buying their silence with a tip , and turning back . " We 'll follow their line of retreat . " He crossed the field to a narrow road that jutted off the WilliamsburgRoad toward the river . The debris along it marked it plainly as the retreat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kerchief over his throat . Philip started to ask him how near the armies were , when he saw that the red was not a handkerchief . The still soldier had been sitting there a long time . He spurred the little mare into a canter again . He began to feel that he was caught up himself in all this horror and he could n't shake free of the fear that he might be yet . . . if the Yankee army returned toward Richmond . Breasting a hill , he looked down into another river valley . Pontoons were thrown across White Oak Swamp and drooping men trudged across the bridge . They were dust-gray , with odd coats and shirts , and battered felt hats shading their eyes against the sinking sun . As he neared them , a horse galloped down the opposite slope , clattered across the bridge , and skidded to a stop among the men , eddying pools of dust . Its rider flashed a sabre in the red light and yelled at the soldiers . They did not look up . Philip checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With gray-white and black-streaked faces , and haunted eyes that stared straight ahead , they shuffled sullenly past him . The horsemanpulled up beside Philip and nodded . He was a clean-shaven young man , with delicate , handsome features , and a certain arrogance on his thin face . Captain 's bars showed through the dust on his collar . He stared after the men.  | " Stragglers ? " The old habit to talk on equal terms surged up . The young captain nodded . " Ca n't much blame them . They were shattered yesterday at Malvern Hill . We should n't have attacked . The Yanks had a strong position and we hit them in detail . I think General Lee just hated to let McClellan escape after he ' d had him trapped three times , and each time something went wrong . ... You out from Richmond ? " " Yes , Medical Department . " Philip always hoped he would be taken for assistant surgeon . " I hoped to find some supplies . " " Not here . Have you heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did . " Philip became the insider . " I also heard that McClellan would n't have escaped if Jackson had been what we expected . " " You heard wrong ! " The young face sharpened in anger . " I ' m with General Jackson . Day before yesterday when Longstreet and A. P. Hill hit McClellan at Glendale , we were supposed to get him in rear and crush him . You 've been hearing that we did n't , I reckon . Well , we were held right here by Yankees on that hill over yonder on the other side of the swamp . The bridge had been destroyed and our men refused to rebuild it under the fire they were exposed to . General Jackson tried to shell them out and their guns were better . He tried to find a crossing for artillery and could n't . He tried everything , and there ' s been too damned much talk about Jackson 's failure in this campaign . McClellan escaped through a lot of blunders that ruined General Lee 's plans , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recapture his assurance . " Well , " he said matter-offactly , " the siege of Richmond is lifted and the whole army did it . " The young officer gave him a disgusted glance . " Balls ! " He spun around his lathered horse . Philip sat very still , watching the lean back of the captain moving through the veils of dust . He felt the eyes of his men on him . He made himself turn around , but he could n't face them . Beyond , where the road ran over the hill , the bent stragglers were etched against the sky . In the past year he had often felt apprehension at working with Milton Duke . From now on he would do everything , anything , to exempt himself from ever being one of those shattered men trooping back over a dusty road , or one of those still men lying in the weeds beside it.  | " I do but quote from one of those earlier speeches when I declarethat I have no purpose , directly or indirectly , to interfere with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no lawful right to do so ; I have no inclination to do so . "  --  President Lincoln , on taking his oath of office , as quoted by President Davis to the Confederate CongressThe wagon rumbled over the cobblestones of Twelfth Street . It pitched when it turned into the alley between the Wade tobacco warehouse and the back of the warehouse on Cary Street . Mildred stood with the matron and a new nurse in the doorway . She tried not to think of the groans . A wheel hub scraped the stone slab propped against the corner . Please don ' move me no moh ... . For Jesus ' sake , let me die here in peace ... . The new nurse whimpered . Mildred looked at her . She was not more than eighteen and she looked like a frightened child . Her face was . paper white and her eyes , staring widely , had the pale dead blue of the September sky . Mildred took hold of her arm . " You 'll get used to it . It ' s hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy , weather-blacked soldiers lifted an officer out of the wagon . His matted beard was gray with dust , but not as gray as the bandage around his head .

Bright red spotted the bandage and a stream trickled through the coated dust on his face . " I  --  I ' m afraid I ca n't stand it , " the new nurse whispered . Mildred helped her down the step . " You walk up to the canal and get a little breeze . It ' s awfully hot here . Come back when they ' re in bed . " " It is hot for September . " The girl moved unsteadily over the cobblestones , close to the narrow shade of the building . Mildred held open the door for the soldiers . " Are you hurt much , colonel ? " She wiped the blood off his forehead . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile . " Can stand  --  anything  --  to have the Yankees  --  out of Virginia . " " Look , lady ! " The driver tried to speak through his cud , but he had to spit and shift it . " Thet nurse fell down . " The girl was lying in a heap in the middle of the alley , just where the warehouse ended . Mildred ran over the cobblestones to her . A sickening odor made her falter near the girl . She looked at the canal boats on the Basin . They had no cargoes and nothing about them seemed different from the usual boats . Wind made the stench worse . Along the edge of the Basin , where the cobblestones behind the warehouse ended , was an open trench . Bluish and bloated flesh , brown with blood and black with flies , was heaped almost to the top . Mildred closed her eyes . The pile of amputated legs and arms swam through her brain . She staggered against the brick wall and leaned there . She reached for the camphor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had thought she would need that no more , and carried it now for new nurses . The odor burned a dry clearness in her brain . Her torso seemed to arch out in physical revolt . She felt strained like a bow , drawn too tight by this will she had imposed on every thought and feeling and action . Every moment of her life was a crushing of something natural by this cruel will . The Wades are a strong-willed people . ... She had heard that all her life . We must sacrifice everything of ourselves to the Confederacy .... Her mother had found sanctuary in that creed . But even a Wade , for her country , must reach a point beyond which the will would break . The young nurse stirred in the alley . Automatically Mildred opened her eyes and moved toward her . Perhaps that point in her will had not yet been reached , but , as she held her handkerchiefp191to the girl 's nostrils , she knew a tired and crushing loneliness . The nurse 's blue eyes fluttered open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper than the color of her youthful glow . " I ' m so ashamed . I came here to help and I ' m nothing but trouble . " " You must n't mind .

Her hospital duties gave her life , not death . " What is your name ? " Mildred said quietly . " Ann Bowers . " " Then , Miss Bowers , if you think you can stand it to-day , I ' 11 see that you find some duties to break you in gradually . " She put her hands under the girl 's slender arms and helped her to her feet . The nurse steadied herself and drew away . Her young face grew very serious and she looked at Mildred with passionate eyes . " I'l1 stand anything for the Confederacy . " They walked back down the alley . The wagon that carted the wounded had gone . " I do n't think we ' 11 have any more wounded coming down from Manassas , " Mildred said , " and that will make it easier on you . " She held open the door . The two long rows of cots were quiet except for a screened one where a surgeon worked . Outside the screen a bloody stub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "  | Mildred said quickly , pointing toward the end of the room , " is where you can work to-day . " She got between Miss Bowers and the row in which the surgeon worked , as they walked back to the office . The matron 's records were piled on her father 's desk and stacks of bandages reached up and half hid a framed woodcut of a sprawling , two-storied frame building with " 1782 " scrawled at the bottom . When she was a little girl , her father used to sit her on the desk and tell her about that building . It had been the first Wade tobacco warehouse in Richmond and he had seen it when he was a boy . He told her of his grandfather , who had it built . When his grandfather first came to Richmond it had just been incorporated as a city , though it had scarcely a thousand residents . It had been badly burned in the spring by the British under Benedict Arnold , and was rebuilding . John Peter Wade 's father , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , the city would grow with the rebuilding , and it would be a fine place for a young man to grow up with the new country . John Peter Wade had thought it a dreadful hole . The red-clay streets were dusty in summerand bogs when it rained , and hogs wallowed in the gutters . Where the present warehouse stood had been west of the city , across Shockoe Creek , and at Fourteenth and Main a footbridge by the Old Market connected the city . Wagons forded the creek . Capitol Square , then " the publick square , " was being built under the direction of Governor Tom Jefferson , who had moved the capitol to Richmond . The great life when John Peter Wade came to the city was discussing politics over a mug of ale in taverns , like the Bird-in-Hand , the Bell and the Eagle , and Gabriel Galt 's City Tavern , where the United States Hotel now stood . As Mildred used to listen , the life of the city that her great-grandfatherhad known seemed distant and unreal . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own life when she had visited her father at the warehouse . Then the sweet , rank smell of tobacco in the hogsheads , rolling on the floor where the cots now stood , mingled with the clean , masculine odor of herp193father . Outside , her vision was horizoned by the tall buildings of the Gallego Flour Mills below which the muleteers on the banks of the canal steered boats into the Basin . It had been a world of wonder , rich and complex and immense , planted solidly in time , and even as a child she had felt its power and importance . Now only the tangible objects surrounding her suggested that old life . Even to remember it was weakness . It was , she thought with bitterness , " unworthy of a Wade . " She turned to the long table against the opposite wall . There were stacks of two-inch strips of white cloth that had been her mother 's sheets and counterpanes , napkins and dimity petticoats . " Do you know how to fold these into compresses ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She worked in the Spotswood Sewing Circle . " " Then you do that.to-day . Do n't touch those green and white chintz pieces . They 're our old chair covers ; we use them for bandages . After to-day you can start at changing sheets , fetching water , and keeping the flies off the badly wounded . Then you ' 11 have a regular patient . " " Oh , thank you , Miss Wade . I 'm coming out there to help to-day , you ' 11 see . " " You ' re helping now . " She hurried out , toward the screen where the surgeon worked . The matron held the pail . She was a sharp-featured spinster in her forties . She gave Mildred a sour look and stood up . " You 're late , Miss Wade . The surgeon 's practically finished . The patient has already come out of the chloroform , and I 've got to record those men who arrived . " " You ' 11 find Miss Bowers in the office , " Mildred said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandages to-day . " " Another of your fine-lady fainters , " she sniffed , and marched off with the bloody pail . The surgeon glanced up and smiled wearily . He was very old . " If you ' 11 just wash the wound , Miss Wade , I ' 11 be back with the bandages in a few minutes . " He handed her a small tin pail filled with the red-oak-bark disinfectant which he prepared himself . He rose slowly and leaned against the window sill . " It ' s terribly hot to-day . . . . But we do n't have to worry about the Yankees bursting in on us . " He smiled again and moved slowly off . Mildred wet the cloth and washed away the blood that clotted around the stitches in the stub . One trickle leaked through and dropped on her sleeve . The soldier shifted in the bed . She glanced at his Irish face and saw his eyes searching out of deep pain . " Is it so bad , soldier ? " she asked gently . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bear for to see you spattered with blood from the likes of me . " Her first rush of emotion in many days filled her with an almost unbearable tenderness for the rough-faced man . " When you lose your blood for our country , I ' m proud to have it on my dress . " The Irishman shook his head and all at once his eyes were wet . " That might be all right for you to say to these heah soldiers from the South , but I ' m in a Richmond regiment and I know who you are . " The grip on her emotions had been broken and words spilled out before she was aware of thinking them . " In the First Virginia Regiment ? " " Yes ' m . The Bloody First . " " Do you know Brose Kirby ? " " Theah ' s a Sergeant Kirby in Company D  --  " " You askin ' ' bout Brose Kirby , Miss Wade ? " A weak voice from the next bed startled her . She whirled and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the soldier who was shaved each day by the poor old woman whom Mildred remembered having seen that afternoon at the Fair Grounds camp , asking for Company D. Now , looking at the woman 's son , Mildred suffered the same fear of that afternoon . The remembered emotions choked up so that she could n't speak . " I know you , ma'am , because I used to work in this heah warehouse . " The big-boned soldier grinned . " My name ' s Joe Fitchett.  |p195Brose  Kirby was my boss . Now he ' s my first sergeant  --  and the best top sergeant in the whole awmy . " " Thet ' s what this awmy needs is top sergeants , " the Irishman said . " Too danged many West P'inters . They might make officuhs , but only God cain make top sergeants . " " Then God must 've had our awmy in mind when He made Sergeant Kirby . Tell you what Brose did just befoh I was wounded at Second Manassas , ma'am . " He was speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear of Brose as much as he wanted to talk . She could only nod , as she bathed the wound . " We had a few conscripts in the company and they broke and one of ' em begun to run . Brose got in front of this heah conscript and said , Where the hell you think you runnin ' ? ' Feller said , I ai n't runnin ' , I 'm jest skeered . ' Then quit actin ' like a baby , ' Brose said . Wish I was a baby , ' the conscript yelled , and a gal baby at that . Then I would n't never have got conscripted . ' " " Heh-heh-heh , " the Irishman wheezed . Joe Fitchett scowled . " Brose looked at the conscript a minit and then he stuck a big pistol in the feller 's stomick . You git back theah and fight , ' he said , cold-like , or you wo n't never wish nuthin ' else . ' That feller looked at Sergeant Kirby and he got back , I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sergeant than he was of the Yankees . He was right , too . Brose jest as soon kill him as not . " Mildred had stared at him , mechanically bathing the amputated arm , while he talked . When he finished , she did n't speak . She feared that anything she said would betray her . It was the old fear that stirred up the memories of him , the black ' tin whom she had prayed the war would swallow up . He had glared at her out of his hot black eyes just as he had at the conscript . No pistol was needed with her . It was his reckless laugh and the feel of his hands that made her weak and helpless . Swallow him up ? She could see him , dark and hard , grinning at the idea . Nothing but death would swallow him up.  | She heard steps on the bare floor and saw the old lady in her homemade unbleached cotton dress and the artificial cherries bobbing on her bonnet . " Here ' s your mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . She was afraid even now that Joe Fitchett 's mother would remember her , and all would know the thing in her that she was trying to kill . The wound was washed clean and ready for the bandage . The soldier eyed her curiously . She tried to smile reassuringly as she rose . At the next bed she heard Miss Bowers . " Would you like to have your face washed ? " she asked timidly . " It ' s been washed fohteen times to-day , " a young voice said patiently , " but if you want to wash it again , I don ' mind . " Mildred hurried around the bed to the new nurse . Miss Bowers looked down at the hollow-cheeked young Carolinian with the mournful eyes . He was the victim of all the new nurses . Mildred whispered :  --  " You get him a newspaper and read it . That ' s what they like . " Miss Bowers nodded and tears rimmed her eyes . " Did the matron chase you out ? " The girl tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't mind her . I ' ll tell you what you do . To-night at home you boil some water over elderberries and the leaves and bring in the solution to-morrow . We use it as a disinfectantfor flies and that 'll make a good impression on her . " " Oh , you 're so sweet , " the girl cried . Mildred smiled and moved down the aisle to the stairs . She could n't bear the eager eyes of that girl , who could stand anything for her love . Mildred had to endure for her love too , not so that it might live but that it must die . That was the reason for her will , why she could n't be through with it yet . She could n't be through with it until it had crushed out his image , every echo of longing and desire , until she became like the matron , a cog that existed only for the Confederacy . It was the Confederacy that destroyed her old life . Now it would have to destroy the love that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it must yield her a new life.  |p197U|pstairs  the new patients had been placed in the beds near the door , where it was cooler . Already young women were gathered around them , helping the surgeons and the nurses . Groans and soothing voices ran together . You 'll be able to get around all right without . . . . It 's jest thet I want another crack at them Yanks . ... Oh , Lord Jesus . . . . It wo n't be bad in a little while , soldier . . . . I don ' mind foh myself . Hit 's my wife ' n ' chillun . ... God have mercy ... . At the far end of the room , Major Baylor Warwick was beckoning to her . She walked down the aisle . A fragile girl in a white muslin dress was sitting on the foot of a bed , reading from the Southern Illustrated News to a tawny-bearded giant puffing a pipe . Baylor , with his leg strapped in a harness suspended from the ceiling , was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been intense . Beside him stood the fifteen-year-old boy who had occupied the corner bed . He wore a neatly brushed and patched gray uniform with new buttons that a nurse had sewn on his jacket . His sallow face , with his large , grave eyes , was ageless , like a gnome 's . A cloying sweet smell hung heavily in the odor of antiseptics and sweat . She saw flowers banked on the other side of the major 's bed and she identified the odor of cologne . Baylor , grinning with his pale lips , pulled a champagne bottle from under the coverlet . " My Richmond admirers have given me a shower and I 've been trying to have Pete here accept a farewell party , but he insists that spiritus frumenti has not yet passed his lips and he intends to live out his few remaining years unpolluted . " Mildred smiled at the boy who stared so solemnly at her . " I did n't know you were leaving us so soon . The surgeon said September fifteenth . " " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be with the army on the invasion . " " You ' d think , " Baylor said , " a soldier like that would n't be afraid for his mother to smell his breath . " The boy turned to Baylor , not sure whether to resent him or not.  | " Does n't your mother mind your going off with the army ? " Mildred asked . " No ' m , she said she ' d rather see me dead than in the United States . " The grin left Baylor 's face . " Well , you can tell your mother if you maintain this spirit you ' 11 never be in the United States . We ' 11 win European recognition on this invasion , and that means inde-pendence . " " I do n't know about that , sir , but I know if we keep fighting them like we did at Manassas and Cedar Mountain , the Yanks will let us be . " " You ' re right , son . Mildred , in those fights our men ran out of ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead Yanks . Finally they stood ' em off with bayonets and clubbed muskets and stones . " " Yes , ma'am . I saw a soldier in our company kill a Yank by hitting him on the head with a rock . " Mildred looked into that old child 's face and thought of what all of them were enduring . The boy said good-bye to them then . " You know , " Baylor said , " I believe it was Pope 's treatment of civilians that made our men fight like savages . You 've never heard such tales as the people told us when we went through the country after Pope . " " We heard them down here . . . about his taking old men hostages and threatening to have them tried as spies if they wroteto their kin .... " " That ' s nothing . He really made war on the people . McClellan 's soldiers might 've done a little stealing and burning and insulted a few ladies , but McClellan after all fought our army . This Pope was a barbarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginians still thought the war was about secession , and they did n't particularly want to secede . Pope showed them it was the United States against us . They hate us , and if we do n't win , we ' 11 be without a country . " " And you think we will win now , Baylor ? " " If we keep invading and do n't have to stand another siege . We were close to falling then . "  | " But I hear the home guards are at the entrenchments now . " He shrugged . " That ' s against an unlikely emergency . McClellan'sarmy took after Lee when Lee left to hit Pope , and McClellan 's army is following him into Maryland now . Think of Lee 's audacity . Leaving a handful here on the chance that McClellan was so scared he would follow him . And here I am , trussed up like a Thanksgiving turkey , while Lee 's on his first invasion ! At least I ' ve got to celebrate with my champagne . That captain next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screen around him . Maybe he ' d like some . " She was glad to turn away so that Baylor would n't see her eyes . He did n't know yet that to-morrow they were going to amputate his leg . She moved the screen and started in . She stopped short . The shock came just as it had the first time , when she looked down at the still white face . The mouth had dropped open and glassy eyes stared at the ceiling . Untouched beside him was his dinner of corn pone and fat bacon . She backed out . " I ' 11 have to call the matron , Baylor . It ' s too late for champagne . " Baylor was silent a moment . " Better give him my flowers , " he said . The Indian summer heat of late September had lifted at last . Mildred , turning into her gate , felt some of her weariness lift with it . She paused in the dusk shadows of the yard and breathed in the fall . Autumn , not spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a refreshing tonic . Coming at the end of the winter social season and bringing Lent , it was associated with drives in the fresh green country , walks along the canal towpath , with dogwood and honeysuckle and blossoming gardens . But autumn awakened the soul after the sleep of summer . It meant dinner parties and balls , friends returning and visits , a horse galloping over a rolling field , hounds baying from the colored woods , and her father 's exuberant voice ringing clear over the countryside , " Hock to ' em , beauties ! " Autumn was expectant , an old dream reborn and new love. 200 BUGLES BLOW NO MOREp200In the hush of the lilac dusk she sensed it all , and she sensed too that this autumn must arouse only new strength and not desires . Strength was all she needed for the life this fall would bring : the treatment of her wounded father , who would be brought down from the Valley , where the army had retreated from Maryland ; the work with soldiers from that futile invasion who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the moral support of her mother , who now waited anxiously for her , fearful of the riffraff that roamed the dusk streets . With a sigh , she relinquished the mood evoked by autumn . She walked slowly to the house . The will to endure was all she could ask . As she opened the front door , her mother 's voice called from the parlor . She sounded excited , and Mildred hurried across the hall . " News from Father ? " " Good news ! " It was a heavy shout . Entering the doorway , she saw Dennis standing by the wing chair in front of the fireplace . His face was filled out and ruddy , his uniform freshly pressed , and captain 's gold braid on his left sleeve shone in the bright light . He looked handsome and strong standing there , and the scene was like the early days of the war . The huge room was opened for the first time since summer and everything was polished for the guests . " Dennis says it ' s good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear his letter before you dress for the dinner ? " " Oh , certainly . I sha n't have to dress , anyway . I changed at the hospital . " She offered her hand to Dennis . " And how are you ? " There was his old vigor in his answering smile . Only his eyes changed as he looked at her . " Like a two-year-old . I tell you commanding this boys ' company of local troops has made a new man of me . " " I ' m so glad you have them . " She turned to her mother . " Has Father had the operation yet ? " " No , but that 's what he writes about . See what you think . " She unfolded the cheap yellow paper and shifted it under the directBUGLES BLOW NO MORE 20Ip201glow of the chandelier . " A young man is writing this for me , " she read , " as I am too weak . They have been waiting for my strength to return before they probe for the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wound is painful , they will operate to-morrow . I expect to be home within the month and we can enjoy the beautiful autumn together while I recuperate . I am eager for that period of rest so that I may study to fit myself for a regimental officer . I believe I have an excellent opportunity for advancement as our division has suffered heavy casualties among officers . At Cedar Run we lost our Captain Morgan and Colonel Cunningham , our old captain , who handled our brigade so well at Cold Harbor . At Sharpsburg Company F had been reduced to three men and I acted as lieutenant-colonel for the 21st Regiment . Captain Page was acting colonel and when he was wounded the command would have devolved upon me , but I was shot right after him . The brigade finished that dreadful battle under the command of a lieutenant . I do n't know what our poor Richmond Company F will do with three privates , doubtless reorganize . They should for they have distinguished themselves and the three men behaved gallantly at Sharpsburg . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those fine men who left Richmond and only three left . How can the United States think we 'd ever want to be in the same country with them ? " " Go on , Mother , I want to hear about Father . " " All of Jackson 's men , " she read , " count Sharpsburg our greatest battle . We held the West Woods against three assaults and wore out three Union corps , and we could have taken the field if we had had one more division . As it was , every man on the field was engaged when a fresh Yankee force crossed Antietam Creek on our right flank . We would have been lost but for the timely arrival of A. P. Hill . He had marched his men from Harper 's Ferry in the terrible heat , but he threw them into action with such speed and fury that the Yanks were driven back . But that was the last division in our whole army . But you can see how we fought them , for our retreat was unpursued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft dirt Virginia roads , as they suffered badly walking barefootand in thin soles over the hard Maryland roads . I do n't have any feeling of failure about the invasion , though it was brief . We gave them a bad scare and captured arms at Harper 's Ferry and much-needed supplies , and we 've had them off Virginia soil for a while . Maryland itself was the real disappointment . Except for a few pro-Southern families , who treated us most cordially , the state is cool to our country . Unless we swing Kentucky I think the Confederacy will consist of its present states . They are enough , I believe , to win us our freedom . " " Maryland , their Maryland , ' the soldiers sang coming back , " Dennis said . Mrs. Wade glanced at him , without expression . She returned to the letter . " Fortunately my personal supplies are in fine shape , due to captures , and all I need is a pair of blankets for the winter , for which I am enclosing the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should buy them before they go up with winter approaching . You will be amused to know how I came by such wealth . I had intact that last ten dollars you sent me when we crossed the Potomac . Hearing there was bread soda near by and the regiment needing it badly for biscuits , I marched forth and bought a hundred-pound keg at six cents a pound . I toted the keg back and sold it at twenty-five cents a pound , thus earning the money I enclose . I reckon being in the Yankee country has created some trader instincts in me . I am so tired now I shall have to stop . When you receive this the operation will be over and I ' 11 be waiting to come home . Please borrow all the available books on tactics and strategy . I am just beginning to comprehend the meaning of warfare . Until now , I ' ve been a civilian fighting for my country . Now I ' m going to be a soldier . " " Is that all ? " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He seems cheerful and it sounds exactly like him . " " But he says he ' s growing weaker . " " That ' s natural , Mrs. Wade , from loss of blood and not eating . "  | " Then why did they expect him to grow stronger , and this pain . . . " All stomach wounds are painful . I imagine they hoped his natural vitality would bring some return of strength . I ' 11 wager he ' s straining at the bit now to be home . " She shook her head . " How soon will we know ? " " He ' 11 send word by some friend coming to Richmond . Do n't worry ; if he was in bad shape , he would n't have shown such interestin things . You notice he said we gave them a bad scare . We did right enough ; that ' s why Abe Lincoln made his proclamation freeing our slaves . With the cotton shortage in Europe , Lincoln is afraid we ' 11 get European recognition now that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Wade nodded dully and returned to the letter . Mildred was pleased to see Dennis more at peace . Since the army had been away and the Locals were on constant duty at the breastworks , his physical fitness had returned , and with it a new sense of importance . He seemed to have lost his bitter shame , his sense of impotence . She wanted to encourage him . " Do n't you think our position will be weakened , " she asked , " with our army falling back into Virginia ? " " Not the way things are going in Kentucky . You heard that Forrest captured Murfreesboro and Bragg won at Munfordville ? And Kirby Smith is threatening Cincinnati . No , Lincoln just had to make this appear a war over slavery to try and prevent us getting recognition . " " But if everybody in the world hates slavery so much , might n't his proclamation make it seem that the Union is fighting to free slaves , and actually prevent recognition ? " " Not if we keep winning . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my slaves from Washington , can he ? He has nothing to do with us . Queen Victoria might as well order the machines in the North to be abolished because those states once belonged to England . Anyway , the statesmen in Europe must know this proclamation is merely a political move . Why , Lincoln promised not to interfere with slavery , admitted he had no right . In Europe , they ' 11 know this is just dirty politics . Let us keep winning  --  you 'll see . " Mrs. Wade laid the letter aside . " I ' d like to get some bleached cotton while it ' s only a dollar a yard , and sew some new shirts for Dinny . " " Mother , I think we 'd better concentrate on food first , to build him up . With flour at sixteen dollars a barrel and bacon a dollar a pound , it 'll take all we can scrape to buy enough for us all to eat . " " That ' s right , and salt is out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unless the government steps in . Something else to be grateful to the blockade for . " " They seem to think the more they make us suffer , the more we ' 11 want to return to the Union . " Her delicate face set in its new , grim mask that was so unnatural for her . " As for me , the Butlers and Popes can do their worst in New Orleans and Virginia , but I ' 11 never return . Dinny said they hate us and they do . They ' ve made our lives hateful . But I do n't care . I 'll starve , 1 ' 11 stand anything , to see us free of them . " When Mrs. Wade talked like that , Mildred could n't answer her . Since her hatred of the war for what it did to her personally had grown into a hatred of the United States for what it had done to her family and Virginia , hardness had grown with it . Sometimes Mildred suspected her hard hate was a retreat , supplanting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set features , as though she feared that to let go for a moment would be to lose it . In the silence , the doorbell tinkled faintly back in the house . " Oh , I ' d forgotten the guests . " Mrs. Wade tried to compose herself . " I ' d feel more like entertaining if I knew about Dinny , but everybody says this is what we can do  --  make the soldiers at home forget the war . " She ruffled out her crinoline over the sofa and fixed a smile on her lips . John silently passed the door . They heard his low voice in the hall , then the door closed . Dennis arose , jerked down his jacket ,  |p205and  straightened his empty sleeve . Several moments passed . Mildred wondered who could be taking so long . Then John moved in the doorway . He just stood there , alone , holding an empty canvas sack in front of him . Straps from the sack hung down . Mildred read " U S " in faded letters on the canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair and her mother cried :  --  " What is it , John ? " John turned his eyes to her , without speaking . He moved slowly into the room . It seemed that he kept on walking across the rug , staring straight ahead . There was no expression on his black face , but because of his silence , Mildred stood up . She felt hollow inside . John stopped in front of Mrs. Wade . Her eyes opened wide and she tried to speak . He laid the canvas on her lap . It was a haversack . John gulped . " Sol-juh at the doh , said he was a friend of Mr. Dinwiddie 's ... . He brought this heah foh you-all from  --  from Mr. Dinwiddie ... " Mrs. Wade slowly lowered her gaze to the haversack . Her fingers fluttered over the flap . It fell forward . A dried apple dropped out and rolled on the floor . Mildred stared at the dried apple as though she had never seenone before . Fortunately my personal supplies are in fine shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out on the floor spilled grains of corn among coarse socks , a stub of pencil in the opened leaves of a dirty Bible , a chipped razor , and , shining with a dull steady glow , a gold hunting-case watch . The last time she saw that watch , her father had taken it out of his bright new uniform while they waited at the depot and her mother made a last examination of his knapsack . She saw again the knapsack , strapped firmly to his back , opened to reveal neat compartments containing white paper and a full toilet set , pen and ink , coils of linen collars and cuffs , white gloves , and a round mirror case from Paris . That imported knapsack seemed now to lay mistily over his scattered belongings . Then her mother blotted it out . She was lying , very still , across the canvas haversack , one arm outstretched toward the dried apple . Mildred heard someone screaming . Then she was being shaken . " Mildred . Mildred ! " That was Dennis . His hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to look after your mother . Do you hear me ? " Her eyes focused as though they had been blurred . John was lifting her mother . His face was wet , but hers was as dry as death . He placed her tenderly on the sofa . " I ' 11 get my camphor . " Her voice sounded faint and unnatural . The house seemed bare and empty as she went upstairs . There was a vagueness about her room . She took the camphor bottle out of the bureau and that seemed a silly thing to be doing . A shriek rose from downstairs . Her head cleared , like emerging from a nightmare . Edmonia was shrieking and Delphy began to wail . Mildred ran downstairs with the camphor . John and Dennis were bathing her mother 's wrists and forehead . Her face was paper white . Her eyes stared glassily at the ceiling . Mildred stooped over and held the camphor to her . She turned to the wall . John sighed . " She ' s coming out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother tried to pull away . Mildred held her . Rigid , her mother suffered the odor . She gasped for breath , straining upward , and then she fell back . Color touched her cheeks . She began to breathe deeply . " Mother . " She looked at them . Her eyes were clear but expressionless . While they stared at her , the doorbell tinkled faintly . John straightened . " I ' 11 go , " Dennis said , " and tell them the dinner is postponed . " As he turned , Mrs. Wade 's white hand fluttered out , tugged feebly at his empty sleeve . She shook her head . An expression lit her eyes , a scary , child-like determination . " Let them in . . . . Take them to the upstairs living-room . . . . I ' II join you  --  in a little while . . . . We must all do  --  what we can ....

"  --  Brigadier General Kemper to the First Virginia Regiment , of his brigade , as they moved into action at Marye 's Heights , in the Battle of Fredericksburg , December 13 , 1862Two soldiers in frayed , patched overcoats lifted the stretcher out of the ambulance . The gaunt horses drooped in the biting wind . Elizabeth stood in the vestibule with her mother and father and Granny , and watched the dirty soldiers move the stretcher through the gate . The head of the stretcher bumped the gatepost . Her mother moaned . Her eyes were wide and she was breathing hard . Her effort at control was painful to see . Granny stared with bright intentness . Mr. Kirby was silently crying . The soldiers nodded and moved sidewise up the wooden steps . Brose 's battered black slouch hat had slipped back on his head and the December wind ruffled his dark hair . His face seemed to be in a shadow . His full lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast a shadow like a dark socket over his closed eyes . One of the soldiers stumbled getting on the porch . " Please be careful , " Mr. Kirby whispered . " Yes , suh . " Elizabeth stood close to her father as they moved aside on the narrow porch . The soldiers walked with slow steps through the door . Marie held it open . She stared down at the still figure , dropjawedin awe , the whites of her eyes glaring . " Ah , Mistuh Brose , howcome you let ' em do thet to you ? "  | " Keep quiet , Marie , " Mrs. Kirby said . They followed the stretcher into the hall and closed the door . Elizabeth was trembling . She had said she would n't be scared . She had n't known how much she loved her brother . There was something awful about seeing him lie helpless . She followed them up the stairs . The carpet treads were worn and she hoped the soldiers would n't catch their toes . Her father said :  --  " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the trip , suh , done him in . He 's lost a lot of blood . I do n't see how he stood it . " " I tell you , you ca n't kill a Fitzhugh , " Granny said reedily . " Did they get the ball out of his chest ? " her father asked . " Yes , suh . It just missed his lung . " Marie had gone ahead and she held open the door to his room . She still stared at Brose in awe . The sheet was turned back on the bed and the soldiers laid him down quietly . " Do n't move him . If his wound opens again , he 's a goner . " Her mother ran to him then . She took the dusty black hat off his head and smoothed back his hair . She began to cry painfully . There was hardly any sound . Her breath caught and choked and a broken sigh gasped out . The soldiers looked at Elizabeth and then at her father . She knew she should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stepped quietly out of the room . Then her father went to unlace Brose 's shoes . Her mother waved him away . She moved along the bed on her knees and pulled at the strings . They were heavy , dirty shoes with thick , muddy soles . When the first one came off , Marie began to cry . All his toes were bare . Mrs. Kirby pulled off the other shoe . That sock was worse . She pulled the cover up and tucked it under his chin . Brose had not moved . Mr. Kirby said :  --  " Where 's that load of coal , Marie ? " " I could n't get it , Mistuh Charles . The money war n't ' null . " " But I gave you eight dollars for just a load . " " Hit ' s gone up , Mistuh Charles .

" His mother started sobbing and stroking his forehead . Charles Kirby went timidly to the bed . " How do you feel , son ? " Brose grinned . When she saw his gray lips move over his crooked teeth , Elizabeth started to cry too . " Everybody ' s crying but Granny , " he said . His voice was a drawn , thin croak . " It ' s nice here . . . in a bed .... I 'll be warmer than I ' ve been in a month . " " Do n't talk , son , " his father said . " Spend the eight dollars for coffee and  --  you have n't got any real coffee , I reckon ? " Mr. Kirby shook his head . His face was wet . " Let ' s have some real coffee for Christmas . Send Paul some . " " Paul ' s coming home for Christmas , son . " " Then let 's have a real Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Marie 's batter bread . " Marie 's weeping rose into a wail . " Do n't have butter no moh , Mistuh Brose , sence it ' s been two dollar a pound . No sugar neither . " " That ' s all right , " Charles Kirby said . " We 'll get the coffee somehow , but please do n't talk any more . " " Anyway , do n't get any coal for me . I wo n't ever need a fire ... after Fredericksburg . God , it was cold . " " Do n't think of that now , Brose , " his mother said . " You ' re home now . " Brose turned his head a little , to look at his mother . " You smell sweet . What you got on ? " " Nothing , son . I 've just washed , that ' s all . " " With soap ? " " Yes , son . " " Will you get me a piece of soap to wash with . . . to-morrow ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a full cake in the house . " Little sister , " he said , " do n't be scared . "  |p2I0  " I  --  I ' m not scared , Brose . " " You want somp'n hot foh to drink , Mistuh Brose ? " " No , Marie . I do n't want anything . I ' m a little sleepy . " " Close your eyes , son . " His eyes opened wider for a second and a defiant glare came into them . He looked at them in some silent bitter protest . He did n't look helpless any more . He looked like a captured hawk . Two days before Christmas his mother and father brought him downstairs . Elizabeth had piled pillows on the sofa and she waited with a blanket to spread over him . The parlor was cozy and looked like Christmas . The grate was burning low and , though it was the first time they had had a fire in here this year , the chill was off the room . Marie had gathered up the chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kerosene on an old kitchen chair that Mr. Kirby had broken into pieces . The hot blaze had warmed the room enough for the grate fire to hold the heat . Sprigs of cedar and pine that Elizabeth and her father had gathered in the woods near Seven Pines covered the mantel , and some old red paper they had found draped the candlesticks . Their homemade candles looked fine , and were burning , too . She had melted beeswaxand rosin together and run through it four threads of slacktwistedcotton . The grate and the candle gave the only light and it threw a soft yellow glow in the room , hiding the worn carpet and curtains . Outside snow fell . She heard him on the stairs and she tensed with eagerness to see him in his new jacket . It was their Christmas present . They had bought the material and had Mrs. Fitchett make it . Her mother had sewed on the Confederate buttons from his old jacket and the three slim angles and diamond of his first-sergeant 's chevrons . With the good pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat of his trousers and Marie had scrubbed them clean and pressed them . With stove blacking , she had brought a dull shine to his heavy shoes.  |p2IIThe  door opened and he stood there , between father and mother , looking at the room . He was freshly shaved and his long , loose hair was brushed back . In his new uniform , with the shining buttons and polished shoes , you would never know he was wounded . Then he gave a slow grin , which lighted his black eyes , and Elizabeth 's quick pride in him was stifled . While he lay in bed she had grown closer to her brother than ever in her life . Now , as he moved into the room , dark and rugged , he was the stranger he had always been to her . All her greetings froze on her lips and she watched him with a set smile , while sudden sadness rushed over her . They sat him down on the sofa and lifted his legs up . The heavy shoes gleamed dully in the firelight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brose ? " his father asked . " I thought our supply department was worthless . " " The United States is our supply department . I got these shoes off a dead Yankee . " Elizabeth 's hands clutched the blanket . She felt her father go rigid . Her mother grew a little pale . Then , in the sudden pause , she took the blanket from Elizabeth 's nerveless fingers and drew it over him . None of them looked at the shoes . " Do n't look like that , " he said . " I walked barefooted to Fredericksburg and so did thousands of other men with Longstreet . Half our men would be naked but for the Yankees , and we get muskets and cannon from them too . " Mr. Kirby cleared his throat . " I understand , son , " he said apologetically , " but you and Paul are always writing about how you get food and clothes and shelter . We ' d like to know something about your battles . Why do n't you tell us that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re cold and hungry all the time . When is Paul coming ? " " We ' re expecting him now , any minute . But , Brose , you do n't know how anxious we are to learn just what actually happens . Your mother and I try to picture you , so we can see what you ' re doing in a battle . "  |p2I2  " Well , you can imagine I ' m behind a fence or a ditch or something like that , and I wait there for Yanks to run toward me , or I get out and run toward them . Sometimes we just stay there and shoot . " Judy Kirby finished tucking in the blanket and stood up . Her mouth was tight , but her eyes were luminous with suppressed emotion . " But the battle as a whole , " her husband said hastily , " do n't you see something of that ? " " All we see are the few men in front of us , in woods or fields or , like at Fredericksburg , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hardly half that , but we had confidence in the position General Lee had given us . " " But I should think you ' d have seen the whole field at Fredericksburg . Were n't you on top of the hill that overlooks the town ? " " We were on top but back , at first , held in reserve . We heard the firing and every now and then a shell would burst near us , and several men in the regiment were wounded . Earlier , Stonewall Jackson had ridden by all dressed up in a new coat that Jeb Stuart had given him . It was the most beautiful thing you ever saw , all shiny facings and braid . We had yelled at him and he gave a foolish grin . So during most of the battle , we were just talking about Old jack being worried over his finery and not getting down to work . " " How about when you were ordered over the hill ? " " The smoke was so thick I could n't see anything but the slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunken road and dropped in that . Some men from another outfit were there , playing poker . Below the road , on the side of the hill , I heard wounded Yanks groaning and praying , and the soldiers told us the Yankee dead were piled up like cordwood . Then somebody yelled , Here they come , ' and I stuck my musket over the top of the wall and saw a lot of them coming up the hill . The hill was covered with bodies . I started shooting . Then something that felt like a rock hit me in the chest and that ' s all I remember . " The three of them stood there , staring at him , Elizabeth at hisp213feet , mother at his head , and father by his side . Mrs. Kirby said in a low voice :  --  " When did you come to , son ? " " At night , back of the lines . People were groaning all around me . I heard that we had driven them back with heavy losses and there was talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed , too . You remember him , Elizabeth ? He was leading the First South Carolina Regiment we saw parading that day , with Paul and Chester . " She nodded . That afternoon surged back over her , when all the uniforms were bright and new , and they all thought the war would be a few battles . " Then you never saw anything of the Fredericksburg people beingforced out of their homes , and the looting of the town ? " " Not a thing . I wondered where all the people did go , because the firing was right over the town and a lot of the houses were ruined . " " A lot of them came here , " Mr. Kirby said . " Poor Uncle Virginiushas his house full of them . That ' s the only way he ' s keeping his family alive , from the little money he 's getting as board from some of them . Others ca n't pay anything . They 're wiped out entirely . We fed several families ourselves . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 have a lot more when this Milroy gets through with the western part of Virginia . " " What 's that ? " Brose moved his right arm out of the blanket . " He assesses people for so many thousand dollars for damage done to the United States , and if they do n't pay he burns their homes . He 's worse than Beast ' Butler in New Orleans . I do n't see why we do n't retaliate . We could starve their soldiers here in Libby Prison , for damage done to our property , and give the food to our own poor . " " If General Lee had n't held us back on our invasion we could 've given them a taste of their own medicine then . They 'd call off their dogs soon enough if we did . Now we ' 11 have to go back to defending Richmond again . "  | " We 've got niggers working on fortifications now . " Mrs. Kirby 's face darkened and her mouth drew down . Elizabeth stiffened against her outburst , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped by the new conscripts , son ? " " Hardly any . " He stirred restlessly . His mother patted him . " We do n't need new men so much as we need to consolidate those we 've got and follow up our victories . There 's too much of this idea of defense . Look at that fool Bragg in Kentucky . Had the Yanks licked and then he spent a week at the inauguration of a Confederate governor and let Buell take Louisville . Now he 's fallen back to Tennessee and talks of the supplies he 's captured . Supplies are not going to do anything but prolong the war . If we want our freedom , we 've got to hurt them . Every soldier knows that , but Davis thinks they ' 11 quit if we keep driving them back , show them we can defend ourselves . " " There wo n't be anything here to defend except the profiteers , if things keep up like this , " his father said . " We do n't even pay Marie any wages now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do when our clothes wear out , the Lord only knows . " " How 're things at the store ? " Judy Kirby shook her head at her husband , but he did n't see . His tired face broke in a shy smile and for a moment his dull eyes lit . " Well , by discovering various drug substitutes , I 've managed to keep it above water and that ' s all . You ca n't get credit any more , you know , and drugs are out of sight at cash . Kent , Paine quoted me quinine at twenty-two dollars an ounce and sixteen dollars for oil peppermint . But by browsing in the woods I 've found all sorts of substitutes I can fix up . Dogwood makes excellent camomile , for instance , and hops and motherwort make laudanum . Wild senna will do for senna , cotton root for ergot , dandelion , butterfly weed , and pleurisy root for calomel , and I have to make corks out of corncobs and tupelo wood and  --  " " Oh , Brose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , " he said with a resigned firmness , " I do n't see how Ip215can keep on if stuff I have to buy goes any higher . Stores are being sold right and left . My old friends ' stores are all in the hands of strangers and  --  " " Well , even if we lose the store , we ' 11 keep going . I wo n't give in if we have to sell the house to strangers and live in the wood-shed . " The sliding doors creaked and Granny eased in . " We 'll have to burn the woodshed to keep warm , " she said , " if wood gets any higher . It ' s sixteen dollars a cord now , and I ' m frozen half the time in this house . This is going to be a hard winter . " " I ' 11 send you down some Yankees to burn , Granny , " Brose said . " How ' d you like that ? " " Humph . " She closed the door behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Must be the home cooking you 're getting . We ' 11 send it to you all the time and then you wo n't get shot trying to take it from the Yankees . " " Ca n't send it , Granny . That ' s the trouble now . There is food in the South , but the transportation does n't work . " The words recalled Chester 's last letter and again Elizabeth was filled with the thought of him , and for the first time she could speak . " Chester says that with all the horses they captured on their raid into Pennsylvania there are n't enough for the wagons , and not enough forage even for those horses they have . " " So you still hear from Chester ? " Brose moved his head and his eyes stared full at her . " How is he ? " " He ' s a scout , you know . " Brose nodded . " He ' s going to be a captain . " " Good for him . Is he as serious as ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old confusion returned , heating her cheeks . She tried to speak and her mother said sharply : " You ' d think the whole war was on his shoulders and  --  " The bell tinkled . " There 's Paul ! " Elizabeth whirled to the door in relief atp216escaping . The unheated hall cooled her cheeks . The thought of seeing her old playmate , the sweet one , swept clear the embarrassment . She jerked open the front door and felt elated at the rush of snow-chilled wind . A small figure , muffled in furs , stood there in the snowy dusk . " Miss Kirby ? " The voice was low and soft . " Yes . . . yes . . . " Elizabeth faltered and moved back into the hall . The muffled figure stepped up on the threshold into the reflected light from the open parlor door . Elizabeth saw a lovely white face , wearing a slightly arrogant smile . Red expectant lips were parted and there was a glow behind her smoky gray eyes . " Miss  --  Miss Wade ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . The sudden hush in the parlor answered her . " Yes , " came the cool tones , " I heard your brother was wounded . I wanted to bring him a little present . " " Yes . Yes , he is . Wo n't you come in ? He just came down-stairs . " Elizabeth backed into the parlor doorway ; then she remembered and stopped . She huddled against the doorjamb and watched the slender girl move easily into the room , still smiling with that touch of arrogance . Elizabeth turned after her . Her mother and father and Granny were standing , staring . Brose was propped up on one elbow . His black eyes were glaring hotly . " This  --  this is Miss Wade , " Elizabeth said.  | " NEWS FROM THE NORTH ( The New York Herald ) : Within afew weeks we may anticipate the occupation of the Rebel capital . . . . With the fall of Richmond , involving the defeatand demoralization of the main army of Jeff . Davis , the rebellion in the East will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whig , December 1862Mildred watched Mr. Kirby close the sliding doors on his family . He alone had been pleasant during her ordeal of trying to talk with them all . It was he who finally , sensing her embarrassment , had suggested that they leave . The kindness with which he had treated her was instinct in his sad , sweet face . He was a very tired man . Elizabeth was his child . She had wanted to be kind too , but she had hardly been able to speak . The poor thing was all unstrung , obviously made nervous by Mrs. Kirby 's hostility . Brose was his mother 's son : the same high cheekbones , the black eyes , the dark passion . Mrs. Kirby had seemed almost to hate her , and she had blocked all Mildred 's efforts at conversation . The grandmother was a curious one . She had stared steadily at Mildred the whole time , saying never a word . She had been the last to leave . Then , backing through the doors , she had muttered something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , one arm outside the blanket , and he looked up at her with inscrutable eyes . The blood that flushed his skin when she entered had receded , leaving his color a flat brown . His expression was equally flat . She felt her first touch of fear . While his family had been in the room , she had anxiously waited for them to leave , so she could go to him . She had imagined she would rush into his arms , as she had dreamed so often . Now she felt uncertain before this dark silent man covered with a blanket , and his feelings covered too , by something hard and unyielding . She must say something . " That old lady . . . your grandmother ? " He nodded . " What did she say as she went out ? " " I do n't know , but probably something about anyone who has anything to do with a Fitzhugh being crazy . She thinks that . " " Fitzhugh ? " " She married a Fitzhugh , " he said flatly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather . " " She 's right , " Mildred laughed shakily . " I mean , about being crazy . " " Why did you come here ? " His harshness made her feel like an intruder , as his family had . She steadied against her shakiness , forced herself to speak . " It ' s hard to tell you , like this . I  --  I had thought you would be glad to see me . " " Only a fool is glad to be hurt . " " I did n't come to hurt you , Brose . I came because , that night before Seven Pines , you said you would never come to me again . And . . . and I wanted to see you . " " You think because I 'm wounded  --  " " No , no ! " Her words rushed out . " You know better than that . " He just stared at her , still hard and unyielding , and then he shifted on the couch , and his face turned away from her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly brushed , grown long on the back of his neck , just as she had first seen him on that longagoSecession Night . The mood of that night swept through her , like a wave of his own Rebel line . She faltered toward the couch . " Oh , Brose , must you be so hard with me now ? It ' s been hard enough all along , God knows , without you doing this to me . " His eyes , lit with black heat , turned quickly to her . The candlelightthrew a glow on his face . She had never seen him so closep219and clear . The marks of his suffering showed in tiny lines around his mouth and eyes , and his nostrils were a little pinched . " You would n't come here . . . like this . . . " his voice was thick and halting . . . " just because you ' re sorry ? " " I ' m here , like this , because I love you . " She dropped on her knees beside him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more strength of her own and her body yielded against his chest , as he turned over toward her . His mouth bruised her own . She closed her eyes . " Oh , my darling , I 've waited so long for you to kiss me like that . " He fell back , drawing in breath , and he looked at her as though he had never seen her before . In the candlelight his face was dark now , as she remembered it . " You know what I call you to myself ? " she said . " My black ' un . " " I reckon that ' s right . . . about some things . " " About me ? " She smiled . " I do n't know what I am with you . I ' d like to know why you came here . " Her hands released him and she slid to sit , curled up , on the floor . She rested her chin on his arm . His face was very close . " You know about Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' m sorry for you and your mother . " " Not for him ? " He was silent a moment . " I should be , because he was a fine man to work for , but I ca n't forget that he kept you from seeing me . He thought I was n't good enough . " " Not as you mean it , Brose . He thought you were bad , and you are . " She felt the softness of her smile all through her . " He was afraid you would hurt me . " His gaze left her and he stared at the ceiling . " Maybe he was right , " he said slowly , almost to himself . " Maybe I would have . " " Would have ! " She rose to her knees . " What do you mean ? " " I do n't know . I reckon it ' s this wound . " Unexpectedly hep220grinned at her , showing his crooked teeth . " Maybe it 's softened me , I do n't know . " She almost laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't ever let anything soften you .

" " I 'll tell you what it has to do with your wound . For months , for years it seems , I 've lived in dread that I would see your name on a death list . When I heard that you were wounded , I was never so frightened in my life . I knew then , in my soul , what you meant about us having only to-day . I thought that if you had died there would be nothing left for me but a promise to a dead man . " " What promise ? " " I promised my father that as long as he lived I would never see you . " The words hung in the silence of the candlelit room and they became more than words . Mildred felt , close in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt it as he was in the year of his death , when he knew no more joy in his hours , no more pleasures in his body , but only the fate of his country and the mood and minutiae of soldiering . " The dead can go on living , " Brose said , and he must have felt it too . " I thought that too , Brose , until you were wounded . Now I know that we ourselves are too close to death to want to know the dead . It was different when people 's lives went on in security . Then they were bound to family ties and duties that stretched back into the past . Now we have no past . As you said , we have only to-day . " He did n't answer , and his dark look seemed like an appraisal . " Do n't think me heartless ! " All the long-silenced emotions foundvoice now . " If you only knew what I went through , long before you were wounded , trying to make up my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with letters in their pockets from girls who had believed we had forever . I could n't believe it was right for me to be held to that promise . I did n't believe my father had understood how much you meant to me . He thought he protected me , but he had n't . He had made my life miserable . Then , when you were wounded , I knew if you had died my life would have died too . All last fall I tried to live only for the Confederacy , as though you had never existed . I was like a machine . I was like a dead person . If you had been killed , I never would have had any life again . I fought against it , but my father 's words kept coming back : as long as he lived .

I tried to recapture my old life and I tried to build a new one , and I know there is n't anything for me but you . I 've learned what you said last year , that there is n't anything sure for any of us . We do n't even know what will become of Virginia , or Richmond . We only have what we 've got , here and now .

"  --  President Davis to the Third Session of the Senate and House of Representatives of the Confederacy , Richmond , January 12 , 1863In the shadow of the square red brick house where Chief Justice John Marshall had lived stood the stable of the old Blackwoodhome . It was gray brick and two-storied . The upper floor was for slaves , but they had gone with the Blackwoods and the rooms were empty and dark . In the front part of the ground floor two horses were stalled , and in the rear part stood a closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran a narrow alley , walled and roofed , with a barred door at each end . Behind the door that opened on the black street , Milton Duke watched a tall man approach from Clay Street . The man was muffled in a huge cape which flapped in front of his face . When he reached the stable he glanced quickly about the street and then turned to the heavy door . The cape flapped down from his face . Milton Duke saw the bold beauty of it , and the eyes bright and quick under arched brows . He swung back the door . The muffled figure glided in and was swallowed up in the pitch blacknessof the alley . No word was spoken . Milton bolted the door and slid along one wall to the opposite end of the alley and held open that door.  | The tall man moved gracefully through the opening and stood blocked out against the night sky as he surveyed the winter garden . Milton Duke barred the door and hurried , stooped , through the gray brush to the basement entrance under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolted the door and led the way to stairs that wound upward into a butler 's pantry , through an empty dining room , into a dimly lit library . Red velvet curtains were pulled over tall windows . Double doors into the drawing-room were closed . A single lamp burned on a corner table . Beside the lamp a cut-glass decanter of brandy stood on a tray with one glass beside it . Milton Duke studied the boldly beautiful face of his guest . The man was looking with admiration at the pine-paneled , high-vaulted room . Then suddenly the bright , clever eyes flashed on Milton Duke , who quickly gestured toward the decanter . " For you , " he said . He turned his back , walked to the fireplace , and put a chunk of slate coal on the low fire . The fellow made him uneasy . He was too damned sure . But he was a power now himself . He was no longer a poor wholesaler , living by hard bargains . This man must be made to feel the weight of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . The man had divested himself of the greatcoat . It lay sprawled across the love seat , with the stovepipe hat atop it , looking , in the shadows , much like a dead man . He wore a handsomely tailored black broadcloth suit , silk lined , and Milton Duke appraised the goods to be first class . A flowered neckpiece flowed out of a low , spread collar . He was pouring a glassful of brandy . As he stood there against the light , his shadow on the wall was gigantic . Duke tightened his lips against the man 's effect on him . He watched him down the brandy at a gulp and pour another . Then the tall man turned slowly , glancing over the room . " A beautiful home , " he said in a deep , rich voice . " Truly magnificent . " He sipped of his brandy . " . /Esthetically it is regrettablethat this grandeur , this artistry of human background , hasp227been perverted from its original purposes .

" There was ice in Adair 's smile . " Then I regret that you must be nervous during our brief interview . " Standing with his long legs braced , he lifted the glass as for a toast .

" " Did you never hear that all life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be hanged none the less high for playing our parts ignobly . " He sipped his brandy and his eyes smiled mockingly . For a moment Milton Duke had doubts of this man . He might be a spy to entrap him . He had met him only once , when they agreed on this meeting , but he had word that Adair was trustworthy . He wet his lips . " Wal , " he muttered , " anyway , you can quit makin ' them speeches and git down to business . It ai n't safe for you to be here . " " I can but reiterate , proceed . " The tone annoyed Duke and he started to tell him to get out . Then he noticed that those bright , clever eyes were wary , and he choked back the outburst . " The thing in a nutshell is , " he whispered , " that there ai n't no more sho profit in runnin ' the blockade . I got my son , Renze , down at Wilmington , buyin ' right on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction prices there that I 've even tried orderin ' the whole lot of a runner . Trouble with that is you have to buy the stuff ' n ' pay the feller whether he gits through or not . I figured that runs me as high as havin ' my boy buy at the public auctions at Wilmington . " " What has all this to do with me ? " The actor sounded bored , but his eyes were sharp . " Do n't you know I only run the undergroundfrom the United States ? " " I ' m comin ' to that , " Duke snapped . " Course I 'll have to keep buyin ' bulk from the blockade ' cause that ' s the onliest way to git it , but what I want to know from you is : Can you git me through the underground ' nough small stuff , like quinine and chloroform , to make it worth my while ? " " With my stature it is possible for me to run through ten pounds of quinine , secreted in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Milton Duke stiffened to keep from starting forward . He glanced down at the hand stroking his rough beard , to hide the gleam in his eyes . " And how much would that be worth to you , Adair ? " " Three thousand dollars  --  Confederate . " This time Milton Duke did not control himself . He leaped forward . His voice grated out . " You ai n't on no stage now . Talk sense . " " You will sell it at twenty-five dollars an ounce , my good merchant , adding to your fortune a thousand dollars . " " What 's a thousand dollars of shinplasters with gold at five to one ? " " Your net profit on my risking my neck . " Milton Duke swallowed . " I ' 11 give you two . " " I will settle for twenty-five hundred , as doubtless you will manage to extract more than twenty-five dollars from your purchasers . Wait . " He held up his hand as Duke started to speak . " You are not addressing a bargainer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little love . I desire only enough to procure my poor necessities . Twenty-five hundred will assure me of a profit which is the minimum necessary for my existence . You have my final word . "  | " Twenty-two hundred and fifty . " " Your words ring clear upon my ear , but for my heart they have no meaning . " Milton Duke studied the bold face , the eyes now reflective as the actor sniffed the brandy before downing the remnants of his third glass . " I ' 11 pay you that , Adair , if you 'll promise heah ' n ' now to git me some morphine and chloroform on other trips besides jest this one . " " That promise is gladly given  --  upon receipt of two thousand and five hundred dollars . " " In advance ? " Duke scowled . " How do I know you 'll come back ? " " You do n't . Nor do I , my doubting Tomaso . That rests with God and the United States Army . " " I wisht you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do I know you ' 11 come back if you can ? " " Shylock , you cease to amuse me ! " The actor 's raised voice thunderedin the room and reechoed through the wide halls . " Do you imagine that I ' d deprive myself of the pleasures of this city for your God-damned shinplasters ? " " Sh-h . " Duke glanced around nervously . " All right , " he whispered , " I ' 11 pay you in advance . But jest one thing . You said something about the United States Army . How do you git through ? " " By bringing them information from the South . " " A spy , huh ? " " An opprobrius name for one who conveys such innocuous bits of gossip as I. " " Then how do you git through our lines ? " " Your obtusity restores my good humor . I shall even indulge in more of your delightful hospitality  --  the brandy  --  while you fetch the money . . . . By bringing them information from the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constriction in his throat.  | " Both sides ag'in the middle , huh ? " " Even as you . " Adair smiled , bowed , and moved toward the decanter . " But mine ai n't so dangerous . " Duke was thinking fast . Adair paused and faced him , still smiling , but his voice was icy . " I would n't be so sure of that were I in your shoes . If one word were passed to some hard-fighting Reb who had seen a companion suffer for want of anaesthesia , I think your growing fortune might be enjoyed only by your progeny . " Milton Duke backed out of the door while Adair poured a drink . " Remember that you are a Christian and in such times you must be careful of your associates , and read every day in the Testamentyour mother gave you . We all pray for you ; for a speedy , just and honorable peace ' and for your return . May God shield you , and freedom of our beloved country be your reward . "  --  From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldierThe ladies in their furs , escorted by officers , looked very beautiful to Paul as he saw them talking on the columned portico of the Exchange Hotel . He paused by the stone slabs that winged the steps , and looked . What would it be like , to be going into the Exchange with such ladies ? He had not imagined the lights and the voices and the laughter could be so lovely . Before the war he used to ask Brose how the city looked at night . Brose had always told him to wait until he could see for himself . Here it was , his first vision of his own city in evening gayety . It could not have been so wonderful before the war , for then there would have been no uniforms with gold braid on the sleeves . And then it would not have meant so much as now , coming from the trenches.  |p231A  carriage drew up and a frock-coated colonel stepped out and held his hand for a young lady . Her face was small and she was smiling and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin white scarf fluttered over her golden hair . Paul saw the red stripe of artillery on the collar and cuff of the colonel as he turned and looked at him . All at once Paul felt embarrassed . He backed into the shadow and shuffled down Franklin Street hill . That artillery officer might have been their own Colonel Cabell . Suddenly Paul knew the feeling of not belonging . He glanced back up the street at the Richmond Varieties Theatre , with bright lights flaring on the poster . " Ballad and Burlesque , Sentiment and Farce , Dancing and Travesties . " He did n't belong there , either . He moved on down the cold street with a sense of loneliness like none he had ever known , not even when he first left home with the Howitzers . At the corner , where the red brick houses of Locust Alley sloped down toward Main Street , he stopped . Shaded lights reflected in the bare trees and the branches traced patterns against the night sky . Paul had to swallow hard to release the breath choking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . In his overcoat pockets , his hands grew clammy . He stared at the white wooden columns of the narrow porches and the brass gleaming on the white doors . Any house . . . Brose had told him that , and Brose would know . He wished Brose was with him now . He shifted and dug his hands deeper into his frayed pockets . It was cold , standing here . Out of the shadows on the other side of Franklin Street , a party of men swung toward him . One of them was muttering . Paul heard a curse . They moved into the street light . Two of Winder 's guards held a filthy soldier between them . It was the soldier cursing . He had a spade beard , frayed at the edges and splaying out . One of his eyes was blackened . Paul started and his pulse raced . That soldier was Cassius Brown . He used to be in the battery next to Paul 's and he had deserted . The guards saw Paul . They hesitated , alert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shadows . He moved quickly down the street , pulling the cape of his overcoat around his neck . " Skeedaddle , soljuh ! " That was Cass 's voice . " If you don ' want to land in Castle Thunder , git away from Winder 's men ! " " Shut up , " one of the men said . Paul walked faster . They turned into Locust Alley and came down the street after him . The soldier was cursing and beginning to yell . Paul heard scuffling on the sidewalk . " That ' s right , hit me , you dirty cowards ! Ai n't men enough to fit in the army . Stay heah in the city and pick on real soljuhs jest ' cause they ' re hongry and tryin ' to git a little food . " " Yeh , tryin ' to git it by beatin ' a woman . " " I did n't aim to hurt her , I swear foh Gawd , I did n't . I was jest a little drunk , that ' s all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have , instid of slinkin ' heah like rats  --  ow-w-w ! " " Shut up or we 'll give you worse . We 're layin ' for men like you . " " Yeh , go on and hit me , you dirty cowards . Go on ! I can yell as loud as you can hit . Ow-w-w ! Oh , goddam your lousy hides . Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! " A door opened and a stout woman in a silk dress looked out . Paul walked into the light . " What 's that ? " she said . Her voice was soft and a little scared . " A couple of Winder 's men taking a soldier to Castle Thunder . " She glanced down the street . Then she looked at Paul and smiled . Her teeth shone . " You better come in before they get you , " she said softly . The blood burned his cheeks . He tried to think of an excuse . " Come on , soldier , do n't be afraid . You ' re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . He swallowed again . Cass was quiet now . They were dragging him . Paul moved through the open iron gate and hurried up the steps . The lights were bright on a red carpet through the open door and white panelsp233glowed . The woman retreated before him into the doorway . She looked at him with a wise smile and he felt very young . " Why , you 're just a baby , " she said . " Did you get your back pay , baby ? " " Yes ' m , " he gulped . " Three months . " She closed the door , forcing him in . " You come right on in here . I 've got the sweetest little thing for you . You 'll be crazy about her . " " Yes ' m . " Paul followed down the warm hall , feeling the money in his pocket . He had given his mother fifteen dollars  --  enough for a load of coal  --  and he had only three five-dollar bills left of his thirty-three dollars . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said  --  and the five-dollar bills with the Richmond Capitol engraved on them had looked like riches . Now he was afraid it would n't be a drop in the bucket in a house like this . She stood aside and he moved into a brightly lighted room with red wallpaper and white paneling . Ottomans were placed around sofas . An oil painting hung over the white mantel . A fire was blazing . " You wait here , baby , " the woman smiled . She had some gold teeth in the back and they gleamed . " And take off that heavy coat . You 're at home now . " She hurried out . Paul felt uneasy in all this richness . A lot of people must still have money , he thought . Then the door opened and a young girl stood there . She had soft red hair , brushed back from her forehead , and green eyes looked gravely at him . Her mouth was small and it turned up a little as she moved into the room . " Are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low voice without much life . Paul nodded . He unbuttoned the patched overcoat and was ashamed of its ragged edges as she watched him . She stepped forward and took it and laid it across a chair . She motioned him to a sofa and her green eyes watched him curiously . As he sat down he wished he knew what to say.  | " You ' re in the artillery , I see . " She sat beside him . He smiled then . " The Richmond Howitzers , up at Fredericks-burg . " " It must be awful cold this winter , in those huts . " " It ' s a terrible winter  --  but our huts are n't so bad . " He looked straight ahead at the red wallpaper . It had pretty designs . " We cut pine logs into lengths and lay one atop the other , and it ' s sort of secure . We put oak shingles on the roof and chunk the cracks with daubs of red clay and water . It ' s not so bad . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls and his friends singing in the evening as they darned their clothes and worked at haversacks and bread trays and pipes , and he almostwished he was there now . " But do you have a fire there ? " " We have a fire . We have a nail keg on the roof for a chimney . " She laughed and he looked at her then . Her skin was so soft and her small mouth so moist that he had to turn away . Now surely he should say something . " You 've never been down to the city before ? " she asked . He felt his face burning and shook his head . " It must be nice to sleep in a bed again , " she said , very low . " It sure is , after that straw we sleep on  --  and clean clothes , you do n't know how wonderful that is . I think the smell of clean underwear is the sweetest thing on earth . " " I hear a lot of you men have n't got enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do n't get any from home are barefootedand bareheaded . But they 're all real cheerful . We visit and sing and make jokes at the amachoo barbers , and then when we get a food box from home we have a fine time . You see , usually we do n't have anything but salt meat and hardtack . " He looked at her again . Her green eyes were fixed steadily on him as though they wanted something from him . He wet his lips and shifted nervously on the seat . She shifted , too , like a cat , and moved nearer him . The silk dress slipped down on her shoulder . The flesh was soft and glowing , and there was nothing under thep235dress . His breath choked him . Now he knew he should say something . " There 're lots of sweet things here , soldier  --  beds and ladies ' underwear and good food and some nice wine that came through the blockade . Maybe you 'd like some wine , soldier . " Paul nodded vigorously , almost gagging with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up slowly , brushing against him . Her perfume made his nostrils quiver . She smiled down at him withoutopening her lips . Her green eyes scared him . " You take off your jacket , soldier , " she whispered . " I ' 11 be back with the wine . " He stared at her as she backed to the door with her strange smile . When the door closed he jumped up . He let out his constricted breath . He looked around the room , although he did n't know what he was looking for . From a distant room he heard voices singing a waltz . He should be enjoying this , like those people . Here was the real night world of the city , just as he had dreamed it a thousand times . Here he was in the most wonderful place he had ever seen , and that girl was as pretty as a picture . The singing grew louder  --  lusty , drunken voices . It called up the camp again and he wished he was there with his friends on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drunken voices soared in a deepening bellow and the words floated to him . He grew very still as he listened :  --  " Just before the battle , Mother , I am thinking most of you , While upon the field we ' re watching , With the enemy in view . Comrades brave are round me lying , Filled with thoughts of home and God , For well they know that on the morrow Some will sleep beneath the sod . " Farewell , Mother , you may never , Press me to your heart again ; But , oh , you ' 11 not forget me , Mother , If I ' m numbered with the slain .... "  | The tears burned in his eyes and he was all stopped up inside . All he wanted was to get out . He groped for his overcoat and flung on his flap-brimmed slouch hat . He pulled open the door and walked down the hall with his head bent . A woman 's voice screamed . The singing broke off . Doors flung open . A heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . Paul hurried . The hall filled with angry voices . He reached the foot of the stairs at the same time as the heavy man . The man 's shoulders were very broad and he hunched them forward in front of Paul , like a barrier . " Where the hell you think you 're going ? " Paul 's body grew rigid , as though he would never be able to , move , and his tongue was frozen in his mouth . He stared at the heavy man . The thick jaw was blue-colored with a beard line and his eyes were small , like a pig 's . " Let him have it , Mike ! " Paul glanced down the hall . The red-haired girl stood there holding a tray with a bottle and glasses on it . The older woman who had let him in stood beside her . Behind them were other women , all painted and all pretty . But now they looked as if they hated him . Men crowded on the stairs , half dressed and fully dressed , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " Well , " the heavy man snarled , " are you coming back in  --  or do I drag you back in ? " Paul 's eyes darted back . The man swayed toward him , one crooked arm swinging up . All at once the tension holding his body broke . He felt flushed and trembling . He stepped back and fumbled in the overcoat over his arm . " No , you do n't , damn you . " The man yelled and jumped . The big revolver jerked free of the pocket and the barrel hit the man 's stomach just as his hand grabbed Paul 's shoulder . " Take your hand off me , " Paul screamed , " or I 'll blast your guts out ! " The hand dropped . The man crouched lower , swaying , eyes measuring . In the hall there was a sudden silence.  | " What do you think you 're going to do with that ? " the man said . " You 'll find out if you try to stop me , you God-damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you , drag me back ! " The big man had never heard of Brose Kirby , but he was looking at his brother . And Paul knew , in that moment , he was not Brose 's brother for nothing . " That ' s all right , soldier , " the bouncer said . " Just  --  go . " Paul backed out into the cool , clean night . He was shaking so he could hardly get his overcoat on . He walked fast down the row of red brick houses toward Main Street and he was crying as though his heart would break . " The recently published correspondence between the Cabinets of France , Great Britain , and Russia indicates that the period is fast approaching when the dictates of reason , justice , and humanity will be respected , and our undoubted right to recognitionas an independent nation will be acknowledged . This recognition must , in the nature of things , be followed by a speedy peace . . . . "  --  Secretary of State Benjamin to lames M. Mason , Confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk , with his greatcoat on , checking over a newly arrived office invoice when Virginius Kirby came slowly and quietly through the door . The gray cape of Virginius ' overcoat was drawn tightly about his throat like an old woman 's shawl and his flabby cheeks were gray-white . His hair , almost white , ruffled in ragged edges over his red ears and needed badly the attentions of a professional barber . " It ' s bitter cold outside . " He walked to the small grate where a few pieces of slag sputtered and worked off a pair of cracked , thin kid gloves of streaked gray . " I dyed my old evening gloves , but they scarcely suffice for such weather . My hands ache , just from walking here from my brother 's . " " Is n't your brother selling candles that he makes at home ? " " His daughter , Elizabeth , makes them . " " I wonder if he could n't try his hand at some pencils . We gave up ink , except for important signatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen and very inferior . " Virginius shook his head gloomily . " He ' 11 have to try something . He wanted to see me about selling his store . It ' s failing . But he could get absolutely nothing for it now . Everyone is speculating , and they do n't want stores except for auctioneering . I swear Main Street looks like the Fair , with all those red flags out . " St. George tossed down the invoice . " We 'll have to put red flags on the government if we do n't get better prices  --  especially on drugs . I 'm beginning to suspect that some of those purveyors are buying from the highest bidder in order to have their own palms greased . By the way , what do you know of this Philip Parramore whom you recommended ? " " Nothing , except that he was my brother 's clerk . " " Well , he is living very high for a lieutenant , and he 's been seen with this profiteer , Milton Duke . " St. George saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm on my way now to the Richmond Quartermaster Department to make a check . Will you join me ? " " I might as well . " Virginius rubbed his hands together over the smoke , then blew on them . " I 've thawed out a little . " St. George wrapped his scarf around his neck and drew on his woollen mittens . " You ought to have your wife knit you gloves , like mine . " " My wife spends all her time on the boarders . " " Virginius , do you mind if I inquire what you ask for board ? Mrs. Paxton and I are considering renting our house and boarding . " " From some we get sixty dollars a month . "  | " Sixty dollars ! And you dye gloves ? You should be as rich as a speculator .

" He smiled then , unexpectedly , and a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack your philosophic detachment , Saint . I 'm just a blind believer . " St. George was stirred faintly with annoyance . " I am not so detached as people seem to believe . I think it understandable that one of my years should be beyond passionate emotion for anything . But I 've devoted the best of my talents and my energies  --  more than I ever did to my banking  --  to this government , such as it is . " " I was not implying a criticism of your patriotism . " There was a quiet dignity in his manner , and St. George was reminded of the man he had first met . Since then , Virginius had become so completely identified with the Confederacy that St. George frequently forgot he had not always been an impoverished war clerk . He had known other lives too , which had not died within him , and they were suggested now in his almost pathetic dignity . But St. George wanted none of his friend 's mysteries now . He jammed on his lustreless beaver and muttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crossed the room . He held open the door . They passed into the chill of the long hall . A thin man walked stiffly toward them . His mouth was drawn in a line that deepened the hollows in his pallid face . His eyes burned feverishly . St. George and Virginius touched their hats . " Good morning , Mr. President . " " Good morning , gentlemen . " His voice sounded tired and he drew a long breath before opening the door of the Treasury Secretary 's office . " There ' s your government , " St. George said bitterly . " Going to see his toady now to concoct some fine scheme for enriching the country with pretty new bills , while cotton rots in the gins . Davis does n't care a straw about the condition of the people as long as his theories sound logical . " " Is it too late for cotton now ? " Virginius asked dully . " It would n't be , of course , if we had European recognition . But England has taken a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dog 's shadow . " " They ' d retract if we invaded successfully ! " " Yes , Virginius , you ' re at last right about your obsession of invasion . With the failure of diplomacy and finance , Lee 's army is our only hope . But you know well that the President 's bureaucracy extends even to the army . " " God knows I do . " They came out of the Bank Street entrance into the biting wind that whipped down over the hills of Capitol Square , and walked toward Twelfth . Virginius went on bitterly , " Seddon is just like all the other secretaries . We spend all our time in the War Department transferring troops from point to point of the map , as though Davis were trying to see if he could n't have one soldier on every foot of Confederate soil . If we would give Lee enough men to gather the fruits of his victories , we 'd have won our independence by now . Lee is aging under all this .

If it were n't for private contributions , the army would have deserted long since out of hunger . " " To tell the truth , " Virginius said mournfully , " if the governmentdoes n't change its tactics , I fear for us . " " I 've been fearing ever since we began , when they refused to use their cotton for European gold . Now , while the blockade is strangling us , Congress debates on theories .

He fights Rosecrans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course says he holds the way to Chattanooga . God , if we 'd only stop holding places all over the country and invade ! It still would n't be too late for recognition . " They reached the Belvius Building and Virginius paused . " I reckon I wo n't go in with you after all , Saint . I think I ' 11 go into the St. James here and have a toddy . I ' m frozen . " St. George turned and saw the pain in his friend 's eyes . The new pouches under them were dark , as though he might be ill . The old beau realized , with a guilty start , that Virginius had been unusually gloomy since he came into his office . He had probably come for some word of cheer and St. George had been absorbed in his own bad humor . He put his mittened hand on the worn sleeve of the former attorney . " Virginius , I 'm sorry I did n't notice before that you seem troubled . I 'm a very old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stupidities that constantly offend my whole being . " " Do n't mention it , Saint . " Virginius waved his hand in its split evening glove . " I should n't inflict my worries on you . I 'm not so young myself any more and these privations of my family sometimessap my spirit . And certain things have been brought to my attention lately  --  of an upsetting nature . " St. George looked into those tired eyes and remembered the eveninglast winter in the library on Clay Street when he had seen the likeness of Virginius ' first wife . " Virginius , a year ago you divided with me your last choice wine  --  Marquis de Pombal . I have seventy-five dollars to-day . I sold my silver-lever watch . I must buy a pair of shoes for my wife and for myself , but I 'm sure there will be enough left for a brandy . " He glanced up at the long , three-storied St. James reaching back along Twelfth Street . It looked uninviting . " I would take it as an honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American and have  --  maybe two brandies. "  | The war clerk 's eyes moistened . " Saint , I ' 11 accept with pleasure and gratitude . And  --  and let me say that I might 've seemed unmindful at times of your kindnesses to me and your proffered friendship , but I appreciate  --  " " I ' 11 let you say nothing of the sort . " For a moment , forgetful of mittens and threadbare greatcoat , St. George was the ancient dandy again . He saw a glow of pleased respect in the eyes of his new friend . Suddenly he realized that the war had changed him as it had all others . He , with the other people of Richmond , had been reduced to the basic elements in his nature . Now , he and Virginius Kirby lived by the same makeshifts and same standards , suffered the same fears and hopes . In the Confederacy they had become alike . He smiled with some of his old detachment , for all that he had lost and for all he had become . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice :  --  " I , too , am appreciative of your friendship , Virginius .

No bureaucracy  --  " " ... But aggression . . . " " . . . Supplies on the field and not on paper ... " " ... All exempts in uniform , and invasion ... " " Damnation ! With us , Virginius , we 'll win in spite of the government . " " With us , St. George , we 'll win in spite of hell . " Their hands parted , and the two old men turned down Twelfth Street .

" Slowly , rigidly , her pale eyes staring , she advanced . " Well , I know that your love , asp245you call it , is nothing but gratification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . " " I ' d marry him to-morrow if he ' d ask me . " " And do you think he ever would ? " " I do n't care . " " Of course you do n't care . " She was so close that Mildred could see the new tiny lines that drew her mouth into its grimace . She raised her finger in Mildred 's face . " You do n't care for anything but this war . You think you can do anything you want because of the war . Let me tell you something , young lady  --  " Mildred knocked her mother 's hand away from her face . " I ' m going to tell you something . " " I do n't want to hear anything you 've got to say , " Mrs. Wade cut her off . " You ' re going to hear . " " I wo n't listen to you when you get like this . " She turned away . Mildred grabbed her shoulders and held her there . " You 're to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything but this war . What else is there ? I never had a life before as you did . My life began in the war . That ' s all I know , all I 've ever known , maybe all I ever will know . When you were my age did you wear a calico dress like this , with gourd seeds for buttons ? Did you go to a party where everyone will wear calico , because that is only two dollars a yard ! " Her mother jerked free and fell back from her . Mildred followed her . " You do n't like to hear that , do you ? You do n't like to think of that bonnet I 'm wearing . Do you remember when it was bought for me in Washington  --  a pearlgraysilk with lilies of the valley trimming the inside ? Look at it now ! Look at this mosquito netting over my cambric  --  " she jerked open the bosom of her postilion blouse  --  " does that look like anything but war ? " Her mother had retreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she dropped , limply . The mask broke on her face . She stared up in childlike helplessness . " But we ' re all wearingp246makeshifts , Mildred . You must n't take it personally . We have to accept these things and go on . " " Do you think you 've accepted them and gone on ? You 've been like a madwoman . " Her mother recoiled , hurt and frightened . Mildred checked the unleashed fury . It fought inside her for further release . " I  --  I 'm sorry , Mildred . I did n't know how I ' d been until I saw the look on your face . " Her head dropped forward . " Oh , dear , I wish I was the one who had died . You ' re all I have left and you turn on me like that . I  --  I wish I did know how to deal with you . " " You do n't have to deal with me at all , Mother . You 've said you never understood me . I reckon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to see my life can never be as yours was . The war is my life . " " Yes , yes . " She fumbled for her shawl and glanced at the two little fingers of flame in the low fire . She shook her head . " The war is our life now , but it will end . " " We might , too . You wo n't see that Brose Kirby is as important to me as Father was to you , and he might end before we 've ever had any life . Even Richmond might end if the Yankees get here . " " Oh , no , I ca n't see that this man is that important to you . I wo n't see it . " " Yes , Mother , that 's the truth . You wo n't see it . You 've hiddenfrom it , just as you hid from the war itself at first . " Her mother raised her head slowly , her eyes wide with wonderment . " Do I hide from things ? " Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death could not mature , Mildred 's hard core of resentment at last broke . But no warmth came . The hurt had been too deep . She studied her mother with a sympathy that was detached and wary . A knock sounded softly in the silence . " Mr. Kirby is downstairs , Miss Mildred . "  | " I ' 11 be right down , John . " She turned back to the oval mirror and fitted on her made-over bonnet . The dark blue it had been dyed looked well enough , but the bluebells decorating the crown would never look like anything but the lilies of the valley that had lined the brim when the bonnet was new . As she threw on her cloak , she faced her mother , hoping at least for a good-night that would be warm . Her mother 's gaze was fixed on her pleadingly . " Maybe I have hidden from this , Mildred . Maybe it seemed too much for me with  --  with your father 's death and everything . But I ca n't believe that you could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would n't fit in with your friends . If you would just think of what kind of life you ' d have with him in Richmond when everything was natural again . " It was no use . She made her voice friendly . " All right , Mother . " " Will you promise me that you 'll think of that when you 're with him to-night , among your own kind of friends ? " " Yes , Mother . Good night . " She hurried from the room . She paused in the cool hallway . She wanted to think only of him when she saw him . She moved slowly down the stairs , filling her mind with his image . As the staircase curved , she saw him , standing in the hall , just as he had been in her imagination , just as she had come to know him . Dark and rugged in his faded , patched overcoat , the dim light of the chandelier glowing on his loose brown hair , he did lack something indefinable , intangible , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked , some imponderable force unlike all the men she had ever known . It was that memory which had harried her during all those months when she tried to forget him . He glanced up . There was none of the quick attention , the stiffening into a gallant pose to which she was accustomed . He moved with lazy assurance toward the foot of the stairs , like a big cat . That assurance was of her . Feeling it possess her , Mildred suffered the quickening and the weakening that had become so familiar . He reached the stairs as she touched the floor . He held out no hand . He gave a slow grin . His black eyes moved over her , touched and found her good . " Your butler has a funny smell , " he said . She laughed shakily . " He ' s been scraping smokehouses for salt . You would n't know about such things , but , since we lost the salt mines , it ' s gone to a dollar a pound . If John gets enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelopes if you do . I 've used up all you gave me . " You 'll have to do as I do . Re-use those sent to you . I 'll write you on those you send me and then you send them back again . " " I never expected to be such a faithful correspondent . " " I told you you 'd do many things you never had before , and you are . " Like what ? " " Well , taking me this evening to my friends ' house , those you call snobs . " " No , fops are your friends . Snobs are fops who 're not your friends . " She smiled up at him and took his arm . " Let 's go and see the fops . " As her lawn fell behind and they walked under the bared trees , a chill touched her . She huddled down in her cloak collar against the February wind . The chill was on her nerves . Her mother 's words returned . For the first time he was to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . She cared not a fig for their reactions to him . Her apprehension , she realized , was for Brose . Suppose he lost something of himself , the strange dark hardness that drew and held her ? Down Franklin Street the wind soughed through the ivy vines on the red brick house where General Lee 's son Custis had his mess with other staff officers . She remembered as a child being taken to visit the Lee kinsmen at Shirley , near Kensington on the river . At Sixth Street the high brick wall shadowed the winterp249garden of the Archer house , and she remembered peeking into it when spring bloomed and she was on her way to the Pegrams ' . She passed Mrs. Stanard 's square brick house , with its semicircularstone steps , where as a little girl she had been introduced to William Makepeace Thackeray and where later she had met so many young dandies who now were important men in the new country . To the dark soldier beside her these Franklin Street homes , which held for her memories of another life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was only a remembered glimpse of a narrow , sinister street of locust trees and secret and silent houses . Here their two worlds met , on the cold , shadowed street , to the roll of a distant drum marching a night funeral . At Linden Row her nerves tightened and she wanted to slow her steps . It was the same feeling as when she used to meet him , and at the last moment her courage faltered . The narrow , whitecolumnedporches against the red brick fronts evoked all the order and custom of her world . Brose , holding open the iron gate to the Chiltons ' , suggested in every movement that reckless abandon of his . In the dimly reflected light from the hall , she glanced at him . Shaded by the wide , curling brim of his black hat , his face showed not the least change of mood . He did not show even interest . The bleak wind chilled her through as he banged the brass knocker . Mrs. Chilton opened the door to warmth and a soft glow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair gave her face a touch of austerity . For the first time Mildred was aware of her analytical gaze . It flickered to Brose , steadied , shrewd , intent , appraising . Her breath coming quick , Mildred said :  --  " Mrs. Chilton , I want to present Sergeant Kirby , of the First Virginia . He 's recuperating from a wound . . . at Fredericks-burg . " The older woman smiled slowly and her face , forming a welter of slim wrinkles , grew very bright . " Sergeant Kirby , I am delighted to receive one of the men of the Bloody First . Please comeui.  | Brose gave a short bow and waited for Mildred to pass through the doorway . Behind her came his most casual drawl . " Mrs. Chilton , I am delighted to be here . " Mrs. Chilton 's smile broadened . There was no suggestion of hauteur . She bobbed her head slightly as she looked him over . He stood straight under the light of the lamp which glowed on his long hair and dark face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Chilton said . " You 'll see a pile of equally tattered ones back in the hall . We have no butler any more , at least for the door . He doubles it i harness and triples in cookery and I would n't trust him out of my sight . Mildred , come with me . " She left him standing there , glancing around in faint curiosity , and Mrs. Chilton was saying : " Wherever did you find him , my girl ? I did n't know you had the sense  --  in all conscience , I did n't . He 's a man , take my word for it , and I 've seen a lot of creatures in trousers . And I know a thing or two about first sergeants . Randolph had his troubles with them when he was a captain . . . . He has the blackest eyes I ever saw . Where have you been hiding him ? " " Mother does n't like him . " While she removed her cloak , she tried to read Mrs. Chilton . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , poor Isobel , of course she would n't . He 'd terrify her . But I should n't talk about her after all she ' s been through . How is she ? " " Not too well , Mrs. Chilton . " She fluffed her hair before the mirror . " Of course not , the poor thing always was a child . And so pretty . It must be a strain on you , honey . It ' s a pity she could n't see how much better off you 'll be with a man like this to handle you than one of those young dandies who are pretty by profession . " Mildred turned from the mirror . " But , Mrs. Chilton , " she started to protest . " Now , now , my child , I 've been old much longer than you realizep251and I 've spent years watching you young things come out . And I watched you particularly , Mildred , because Randolph used to dance with you so much . When my husband liked to dance with a young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her restraint . " You may laugh , honey , but I know what you do to men , and do n't think for a minute that I ' d believe a man like that black-eyed devil downstairs would n't be mad about you . But , do n't worry , I wo n't breathe it . Oh , Lord , how I envy you ! There was no war when I was young . " Mildred laughed . " We ' d better go down and look after him . " " Honey , I can assure you that is one young man who does n't need anyone to look after him  --  anywhere ! " The last came with emphasis , and Mildred met squarely the wisdom in the older woman 's eyes . " Thank you . " She knew then that Mrs. Chilton was not being merely a hostess . Brose waited at the stairs , but no tension held her now . She watched Mrs. Chilton beam on him . " You ' re just in time for charades , Sergeant Kirby . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything here , Mrs. Chilton . " He grinned . In the crowded parlor heads turned and Mildred wanted to be looking at him , to touch him , to hold him close . That young man does n't need anyone to look after him  --  anywhere .... The gentlemen in the room , nodding and bowing , could not have that said of them . Most were men of courage too , many were fierce fighters . Some were reckless in their way and some had their color and abandon . Not one had a single tone like Brose 's reckless sureness . That was the force she had missed in all the dandies during that succession of unfinished episodes . That was the force by which Brose possessed her . Captain Cecil Cheswick , the young Englishman on Longstreet 's staff , vacated an ottoman near the front windows and smiled with big white teeth . Holding up a finger for silence , he tiptoed to a sofa where Sally Pinckney and Quartermaster Colonel Lancaster made room . Mildred felt the stares of everybody as she and Brose sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back room where two bedspreads , dyed Confederate gray , were being drawn jerkily apart over a clothesline , exposing a stage . On a canvas backdrop a rough frame building was sketched , with a sign bearing the words ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MAN ANDand there was a rude drawing of General Butler , the United States commandant of New Orleans . The guests turned to face the charade , when a lady and gentlemen in traveling clothes halted in front of the painted building and dropped handbags on the floor . Now she could look at Brose . She felt that her love lay naked in her face and she had to say something . " That backdrop is painted by Vizitelly , the famous artist . " She heard her own words , like a caress . Brose stared at it . " What 's it supposed to be ? " " You 're to guess . " She studied the outlines of his thin face . The room rocked with laughter . " Butler is for beast ! Ho-ho ... Beast ' Butler . . . . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast . . . . The word is inn ' ! " The curtains were drawn . She smiled at the puzzlement on him . Then he nodded his head toward a quiet , simply dressed officer leaning in the recess of the mantel . " Is n't that General A. P. Hill ? " She glanced at the full-bearded man with a large nose jutting over full but tight lips and deep-set eyes of intense seriousness . " Yes , " she whispered . " I reckon men think him handsome . " " Do n't you ? " " He 's so quiet and shy . I never understood how he could be such a hard fighter . " " He ' s the fiercest division commander in the army . " " I thought that your Pickett was , Brose . Do n't spoil my pride in your Virginia division . " " Ours is a good fighting division , I reckon as good as General Hill 's . But he ' s such a tiger when he ' s right . " She smiled in tenderness at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brose was looking at the guests . The wall of a roomp253was painted on canvas and several pieces of furniture were in front of it . Three girls with cloths on their heads busily swept and dusted . Brose touched her and nodded again . " Who ' s that puny-looking little fellow ? " She saw the small , pale man with his wide eyes . " Why , Brose , that 's Mr. Stephens . Do n't you recognize our Vice-President ? " " I thought that ' s who he was . No wonder we have such a peace policy with a poor , sick-looking fellow like him . " " He 's a brilliant man . " His brows lowered a little . " He talks too much . " " I 've got it ! " A voice yelled . " Egad , the word is dust . Dust ! " The bedspread curtains were drawn again together . " Now watch this one , Brose , and try to guess it . " " I do n't see any sense in this game . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see famous ones . That ' s the first time I got a good look at General Hill . " " Will you take back what you said about the fops ? " " That fellow over there is a fop . " She saw the lean , sprawled figure of Bradfute Peyton , his sardonic face archly creased as he whispered to Lizzie Branch . " He ' s a newspaper writer and a famous wit . " " Fop . " The curtains dragged back and revealed a courtroom scene . " Trial ! " Someone called almost at once . Voices started up . " Inn . . . dust . . . trial . That ' s the word , industrial . " Brose turned to her , his black brows drawn lower . " What is thisgame ? " " You watch , and you 'll see . " " How long does it go on ? " " Not much longer . " She smiled and unconsciously moved closer until the feel of his body was against her . His eyes swiftly lit and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , his desire possessing her . " Darling , " she whispered . " I wish we were out of this place . "  | " We will be soon . Watch this one . There go the curtains . " She herself could not watch . His mood was in her now and she was aware of her difference from all these girls in their calico dresses . She had played and gone to school with them , then to little girls ' parties , later to dinners and dances , and finally to war parties , tacky parties , sewing and cooking parties , and the Cary girls ' " Starvation Club " parties . Remembering their shared secrets and confidences , she saw unfold the pattern of their lives , and she knew that no longer was she a part of that pattern and no more would she share their lives . It was not that Brose did not belong to this world or that their love had been lived differently from the loves of her friends . It was the color of her love , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered life . She pictured the lives of her friends during the past two months , of what they had been formed . She compared them with what had formed hers during those winter afternoons when she had walked the old streets of the besieged city with the man who had awakened her desire . In those afternoons she and Brose had lived in a secret world of their own : of gray uniforms , wounded soldiers and paroled , furloughedsoldiers and raw recruits ; of lean troops in ragged gray and homespun butternut , muffled and hairy , with their muskets shining bright , shuffling in broken shoes and burlap through the snow ; of drums that rolled the whole day long for death marches to Hollywood , their country 's Valhalla ; of heavy guns rumbling over cobblestones , the shiny bronzed Napoleons leaving the Tredegar Iron Works on their way to Lee , the muddy , scarred Parrott field pieces , with " U S " on the caisson boxes , on their way to the arsenal for refittingand relettering ; of bugles that blared and bells that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers ; of silent blue men marching in file to Libby Prison , and sullen gray deserters to Castle Thunder ; of the clatter of cavalry rushing through the city ; of young girls in old bonnets and homemade dresses of ancient goods ; of old women in rags that could not be remade ; of young boys drilling under a one-armed man , of old men drillingp255under a one-legged youth  --  of all those colors their love had been composed , and all those moods had relived and re-formed in them , transmuted into the one passionate tone of their desire ... . The last charade ended . The guests stirring and beginning to talk broke into her mood . She wanted to withdraw from the conversation that widened and spread toward them . She wanted to hold her proud consciousness of difference . She wanted no intrusion on the strange secret beauty of her love . She thought of the kisses of her friends , in rooms like this , and she thought of her own in the shadows of garden walls , in the bare woods along the Canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a high hill in Hollywood near the old dueling ground with the city spread out before them , and the last at dusk behind the bell tower in Capitol Square . But the talk had drawn them in and the mood was lost . Bradfute Peyton 's elegant drawl was rising through laughter and Brose said , " There ' s that comic again . " " Wit , darling , " she whispered . " He ' s supposed to be funny . " " Yes , messieurs and mesdames , it was actually champagne they served , " Bradfute was saying , " at three hundred dollars . I shall become famous as the man who drank champagne in the winter of ' 6 " 3  --  " In the army , " Brose said , not too low , " they ' d say that such a perty rooster as him should get down and scratch . " " Grose ! " Captain Cheswick , the English youngster , whirled around and flashed his big teeth . " In the army you ' d be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , captain , I have n't been with the army since Fredericksburg . I ' m leaving day after to-morrow . " " Wounded , eh ? Too bad you ' re going back to Fredericksburg . It ' s fearfully cold there . " " I ' m going to Suffolk . I 'm in Longstreet 's corp . " " The deuce you say . So am I. What outfit ? " " First Virginia , Kemper 's brigade , Pickett 's division . "  | " The Bloody First , what ? " He laughed shortly . " Rugged lads . You ' re in a good division . The General is very fond of Pickett , you know . " The untrusted negro butler stood before him , offering hot chocolate in hand-painted cups . " Oh . . . thank you . " He took a large piece of chocolate cake . " Wo n't see this in camp , sergeant . Did you hear of Burnside 's mud march ? " " No . I heard that he 'd been removed and Hooker put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I imagine the mud march had a good deal to do with his removal . He decided the time was ripe to wipe the Rebels off the face of the earth and he took his greatest army in the universe ' out of their snug winter huts for an On to Richmond , ' you know . Well , the heavens simply opened on the poor Yanks and the greatest army in the universe ' was mired in mud . They trekked back to their camp , cursing the imbecile , and shortly after he was removed . I 'm sorry he 's gone . He was more amusing than Pope . However , I daresay this Hooker wo n't give us any trouble . Though , do you know , they ' ve been reenforced again since we slaughtered them at Fredericksburg and still have their hundred and fifty thousand . I 've never seen anything like it . They toward Sally Pinckney , and nodded . " You ' re right about the rooster . Hah ! " He smiled at Mildred and returned to Sally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . Mildred was balancing her cup of chocolate on her knee . " Have some chocolate , darling , and you take a good piece of cake , too . I happen to know it costs fifteen dollars , so enjoy yourself . " He fished for the largest piece on the plate , stared down the butler , and juggled his chocolate . A reedy officer in trim cavalry uniform stroked a long moustache which draped around his mouth and recounted the details of the President 's reception . " ... I know they were damask curtains in her train because I ' ve often seen them at her library window . Oh , by the way , speaking of libraries , have you heard the soldier 's name for Hugo'sp257new serial , Les Miserables ? They called it Lee 's Miserables ' ! " Brose scowled at the laughter . " Another fop . " " He ' s one of the President 's aides . " " Good he is . His life would be miserable all right in the army . " Warm with a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She checked it , just before she touched him , and glanced hastily around . Everyone was watching Mrs. Chilton . " No , " she was saying , " I do n't mind giving the secret of my chocolaterecipe if you will be sure to follow it when I visit you . I roast peanuts and slip off the skins , then pound them in a mortar . You blend the powdered peanuts with boiled milk and sugar and you have  --  what you ' re drinking . " " But how do you get the sugar , Mrs. Chilton ? " " Now while you ' re in good humor , " she laughed , " I want you to listen to a new poem on our war . Lizzie Branch has agreed to recite it . Sip your chocolate and enjoy your cake , but do be still . This is my treat of the evening . " " Poetry ? " Brose turned to Mildred , frowning . " Sh-h . Look at Lizzie . She ' s beautiful . . . and listen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was a sad melody for her sudden sense of loss . Until her mood had been broken , this evening had seemed to Mildred a beginning , a new and richer opening of their life . Now she saw it as a suggestion of all they had missed during their two months . Brose had been too weak to leave his home until the last two weeks , and then it had turned bitter cold . The nights were moonless and the dark streets were unsafe with ruffians swarming them , those shapes that loomed out of shadows with swift fingers wielding knife or garrote , or even club , such as had struck down old St. George Paxton , bearinghome the money from the sale of his watch . . . . " You listen , " Brose whispered , " this is good . " How had he known she was n't ? The communication between them deepened her sense of loss , but she listened to Lizzie , to share with him the poem :  --   | " Matted and damp are the curls of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pale are the lips of delicate mould  --  Somebody 's darling is dying now .. . Somebody wept when he marched away , Looking so handsome , brave and grand . Somebody 's kiss on his forehead lay ; Somebody clung to his parting hand . " Somebody 's watching and waiting for him , Yearning to hold him again to her heart ; And there he lies with his blue eyes dim , And the smiling , childlike lips apart . Tenderly bury the fair young dead , Pausing to drop on his grave a tear ; Carve on a wooden slab o'er his head  --  ' Somebody 's darling slumbers here ! ' " There was a long silence . Then the guests came out of their seats as if by signal . Voices started up and everyone moved toward Lizzie . " Grose , " Mildred whispered , " go back and get your overcoat and meet me in the hall . I must get out of here . " No one noticed as they made their way into the hall . The room upstairs was empty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak over her calico dress and for one moment she stared at her made-over bonnet in the mirror . How much of what stirred her was revealed in her face ? Her eyes , staring back , looked fevered . She whirled away and hurried down the stairs . Brose , in his caped overcoat , was talking with Mrs. Chilton . Mrs. Chilton swooped toward her , brimming with good humor . " It was lovely , Mrs. Chilton , " Mildred said quickly . " I 'm sorry we must leave early , but Sergeant Kirby is recuperating , you know . " " Of course I know , " she grinned slyly , " you must take good care of him . I ' m so glad you could come . . . " she turned to Brose . . . " and please come to see me whenever you are in Richmond . We ' re very proud of the men in our Bloody First and Pickett 's Virginia Division . "  | " The men are very proud of their ladies , Mrs. Chilton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boy . Now you two run along with none of your fancy speeches . I must see what I can do with the wolves in there . They ' ve eaten every particle of my cake . Good night . " The wind blew cold between the stone-slab wings of the steps outside . Bare lindens swayed against the night sky . In the silence the bell over the depot tolled . Gray men were shuffling through the cold city . Day after to-morrow he would be one of those nameless men shuffling along some dark street . The end of February had seemed so far away when first they started their afternoon walks last month . Now that it was here , the sense of loss , of waste , that she had suffered at the party grew in her . It was n't that they had missed parties , but the gayety that the party suggested had been denied them . Nights had been denied them ! They walked silently in the echo of their steps on the brick sidewalk . The houses were dark . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky from the chimneys of the Tredegar , where time never halted the moulding of guns for the Confederacy . When they reached the iron fence across her yard , she stopped and leaned against it . He stood before her , dark in the long shadow of the tree . Unconsciously , since they had left the Chiltons ' , she had waited for him to speak . Now she sensed that he was going to let the moment pass . It could n't . " Brose . . . " she forced out words . . . " I was thinking about you going . " " That ' 11 do no good . " His low intense voice encouraged her and she said softly : " No , darling , but I was thinking that something about it all is unfinished . " " When did that come to you ? " He was almost harsh . " To-night , at the party , something new seemed to be beginning for us , but everything has been just a beginning that somehow comes to nothing ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's words and she knew that , as her mother meant them , they had no meaning . They would never have any when she was close to him . The answer to his question and her mother 's was here , in her desire . That gave her the courage to voice her thoughts . " That ' s for you to say , Brose , " she said simply . " Hell , you know I want you . " His words , like a blow , crushed everything out of her , leaving only the stunned weakness of their effect . " Yes , " she whispered , " and I want you . " She heard his breath pull in and he swayed toward her . Then he stopped , poised , as though he stood at attention . " You do n't know what you 're saying . You do n't know what you 're talking about . " She could n't see his face in the shadow of his hat , but the roughnessof his voice was enough . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do . " Her hands groped over his arms , upward . " I do n't know anything about this ! " His hands reached upward and closed over hers , drawing them off his arm . She had never felt a grip so strong . " You just do n't understand things . " The pain in her fingers vibrated all through her in a muffled ecstasy . It frightened her , but she would n't be scared now . This was why her mother worried , begged her to think of to-morrow . The fever in her veins wanted no to-morrows , no questions ; it wanted only his released desire to cool the fever . She felt that desire of his beating at her . His dark passion , which nothing had ever curbed , throbbed now against the cruel bit of his own making . " Grose , I understand all I need to . . . that is , I 'll do anything you want me to . " He flung her hands out of his . " Then do n't say any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Damn it , yes ! Go on , quick , and leave me here . " He looked as though he might strike her and she backed away from his fury . The gate was at her back . " Not like this , Brose . I wo n't see you again , except a little while to-morrow . "  | " Better for you if you never see me again . " " Oh , Brose , my darling . . . " She moved toward him . His hand was hard against her shoulder and she saw him make a quick movement . She heard the gate latch rise and the gate creaked open . The hard hand on her shoulder pushed . She stumbled backward . The gate brushed against her cloak and slammed . She stood there , trembling . " Jesus ! " he said . " Jesus . Is this what love does to a man ? " She could n't answer . There were no words , no thoughts in her . Down by the Bird-in-Hand district a muffled shot cracked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard pounding the pavementfast . Then his voice came , thick and hoarse . " Mildred , I ' d feel like one of those thugs or Yankee agents if I did n't leave you now . " " You ' re changing , Brose . " " It 's times . Since I 've been a top sergeant I 've talked with officers and I know how this war is growing . They ' re making bigger plans than ever to capture Richmond . In this next campaign they ' 11 use all their man power and money to get the city . You do n't understand the dangers . Anything might happen . " " Let anything happen , but do n't you change . Do n't let love do that to you . Let love change me to make me like you . " He was silent and she heard her own labored breathing . " Mildred , you ' re just not like me and that ' s all there is to it . " " So what are you going to do ? " " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spun around . " Are n't you going to kiss me good-night ? " It was a cry . " No . " His voice floated out of the shadows . Already he was a dusky form , with shoulders swaying away from her . His heels clicked hard on the bricks . She watched him until there was no more to watch , except the empty street . In the whole city there was no sound . She turned slowly and looked at her house , its square lines blocked against the sky . A low light glowed through the glass fanfare above the door . Her mother had left that light for her . Long ago , it seemed , inp262another life , her father had left that light for her . It had been another life when her father lived . The gentle voices of his friends sang through the house that was now silent . Other young girls , as she had been then , laughed gayly and danced under the shining chandelier and arched their eyes over fans , and on the balcony she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie Kennard was killed at Seven Pines .

The war had caught them all up , but she alone had embraced the war , had given herself to its violence and uncertainties . She alone of all the people who had ever lived in that house , or who had eaten or drunk or danced or talked in its rooms , had offered herself to a man on the dark street . . . and had him turn his back , and leave her standing here in the bitterness of empty desire . The night wind cut through her cloak and she shivered . She walked toward the light in the silent house . Somehow she had to find a life that would quiet the tumult the black ' un had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare for action . . . . Pass the infantry to the front . . . . Let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees . . . . "  --  General Thomas J. ( Stonewall ) Jackson , as he lay dyingElizabeth had loved , since she could remember , to walk among the homes around Fourth and Fifth Street . There lived the great tobacco men : Harris and Ginter and Bransford , Walthall and Scott , Childrey and Taylor , and Enders and Scott . In the springtime her favorites were those on Main and Cary , where the rear gardens were built on elevations above the sloping streets and she could see the flowers . She liked best the big , square , red brick house on the corner of Fifth and Main , with magnolias in the front lawn and high-pitched , double balconies overlooking the rear garden . Next she liked the Barrett house on Fifth and Cary , square and gray with the narrow white porch and two columns in front , and in the back the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there Cary Street was a steep hill . Then , set deep in its lawn of tall oaks , was the Allan house where the poet Edgar Poe had lived , and down on Main the Caskie and the Boucher . It was the life they evoked that moved her . She lived in the core of Richmond , the genesis of its mood , when she breathed in the atmosphere of sweet-smelling flowers and the cooling shade of tall trees , of rambler roses climbing the old bricks of garden walls and ivy reaching toward the dormer windows of sloping roofs , of ladies and gentlemen on the upper balconies cooling in the river breeze . There lived the long memories that weaved and reweaved into the present : of the first fort by the Falls , the first cluster of farmhouses by the riverbank , the first tobacco warehouses and bright-painted taverns , the liquid voices of negroes singing at their work , and the cursing voices of barge drivers at the wharves ; of the first checkerboardlots on Church Hill 's red-clay streets , the frame story-and-ahalfQueen Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shockoe Creek , the soft foreign voices of South American sailors whose ships brought coffee for flour , and the Tidewater voices yelling at the Fairfield races ; of the cobblestoned streets climbing west beyond Shockoe Creek , the three-story brick houses forming the new Court End of town , the coon-skinned mountaineers with mule packs and the silk-ruffled dandies from the English ships , and the country voice of Patrick Henry ringing over the churchyard graves from St. John 's white-frame Episcopal Church ; of the hollow voice of drums marching the First Virginia Regiment off to meet the British redcoats and the singing voice of bugles marching the First Virginia off to meet the Yankee bluecoats , and of the golden voices of forgotten ladies who transmitted all the memories , from huddling in the old fort during Indian raids to cheering the president of their third country at the Spotswood Hotel . In Dixieland I 'll take my stand .. . To-day the ghostly voices were silent . No memories wove into this April morning . Where Main Street dipped downhill many of the houses were shuttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foreign faces with unfamiliar names . Within herself , Elizabeth felt their broken mood . Her own life , like theirs , seemed suspended between a lost past and an uncertain future . Chester had belonged to the old world . What was he now ? What was she ? When she reached the stores across the street from the Spotswood Hotel , where the business section began , she felt that the life suggested by those houses symbolized the life of Richmond . All other lives had somehow been built around that centre , which was an ideal and a base . Now there was nothing to look up to . Everything was changed . The old English-Virginia names , associated in her memory with Richmond as her home , were gone from most of thep265stores . Gone too were the familiar gentlemen , in their beavers and frock coats , who linked the past with the present through the long memories of her kinspeople . So you 're Charles Kirby 's little girl . . . . What 's your name ? . . . Well , Elizabeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Corinthian Hall . . . . None of these hurrying strangers had danced with her mother or laughed with her father in the yard of Masonic Hall . None of these slowly moving men , hairy and dirty and dusty gray , with slings and bandages and crutches and sticks , would care anything about the little girl of Judy and Charles Kirby . She was a stranger on this bustling street , splattered with red auction flags fluttering in the April breeze . She hated to enter the unfamiliar stores just as she shrank from entering a room full of strangers . At Ninth Street , Robinson and Adams were auctioneering off a secondhand dinner set , painted blue and gilt-edged , and behind the bellowing man in a wilted collar and brocaded waistcoat some kegs of butter stood on a secondhandBrussels carpet . They would have no tallow here . The auctioneer of Dunlop , Moncure , stood among tins of bicarbonate of soda and bottles of Hennessey brandy and yelled for attention to their blockade goods . They would have no tallow for her candles . Gaudily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their painted faces and shrewdness in their eyes . They did n't have to make candles . She watched them , awed , almost envious . They were more at home in this Richmond than she . The next windows displayed candles , homemade too , she saw . She was frightened to think of many other people selling candles . Anotherwindow was bright with bonnets , stuck on top of cavalry boots . She stopped and stared at them . Inside , the auctioneer held up pastel-colored organdies out of a big case . " Fresh from Europe ! Just up from Wilmington ! These beautifulorgandies that came through the blockade  --  " She hurried down the street . The windows swam before her eyes , piled with prayer books and playing cards , umbrellas and rifles , cartridges and groceries . On the sidewalk , near a doorway , a barrelp266of flour had a sign of $loo and a canteen on top . A harsh voice croaked from a store , punctuated by thumps . A fat man in a frock coat and striped trousers pounded four feather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best families in Richmond . . . little used ... " She moved around barrels of molasses with " $15 per gal " scrawled on the wood . " Smell of it , gentlemen , smell of the ineffable fragrance of this fine soap , made by the delicate hands of one of Richmond 's fairest ladies , perfumed as she would perfume herself for her gallant Southern knight . Step up and convince yourself by a sniff , right from a lady 's bood-wah . " Elizabeth stared at the lavender cakes , neatly moulded , and thought of the misshapen lumps Marie made by boiling lime and salt with the kitchen scrapings of grease and ashes . They would laugh if she asked for tallow . " Right from the Valley of Virginia , the first crop of real , native , home-grown apples . Only twenty-five dollars a bushel . Stock up now , ladies and gentlemen , before the speculators raise the prices . " Behind the auctioneer an odd assortment of boxes were stacked . They might have tallow . She tried to screw up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The auctioneer suddenly broke off and cocked his curly head to one side . Elizabeth heard shouting in the distance . The other voices along the street grew quiet and the swelling shout was the only sound . The customers plunged through the door . Before she could retreat , she was caught in the midst of sweating men . They looked anxiously up and down the street . The tocsin had n't rung to call out the local defense troops . The raging voices seem to roll up from Cary Street . Then she heard glass smashed . Someone screamed . She was hurried along with the crowd . Across the street government clerks ran out on the steps of the Customshouse . At the corner a man yelled down from his perch on the iron-grille rail of the American Hotel balcony , where he was polishing the big globes . No one answered him . Elizabeth wasp267pushed into Eleventh Street . Down the hill , where Cary Street crossed , the intersection was choked with women . They crept along in a solid mass . They were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street canyon . Elizabeth was carried down the street by the surge of men . The familiar tremblingof fear weakened her and breath came in short gasps . Then she was at Cary Street , jostled and bumped in the milling mob . She glimpsed the pack of women . Their clothes were tattered and torn , their hair hung disheveled above bestial faces . Her panic shook her as she stared at them , and their animal cries beat at her . Glass was strewn all over the flagstone crossing . Drays and carts swayed in the midst of the women and they shoved and fought over the piles in them . She glimpsed hams and flour barrels and molasses kegs and slabs of pork . The last of the women passed in front of her . Beyond them she saw an aproned man across the street trying to close a store door in their faces . They screamed and snarled and a small boy waved a hatchet at the shopkeeper . He fell back and the women swarmed over him into the store . The main mob ebbed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste left by a tide . The street was littered around them . The stores were wrecked . In a broken doorway a graybeardedshopkeeper moaned . Women started to come out of the store Elizabeth had seen them enter . They came singly , stood a moment , looking around with wild expressions . Some followed the mob . A bent , grayed old woman staggered toward Elizabeth . The men in front of her gave way and stared at the woman . She clutched loaves of bread and a handful of salt herring , and glared out of wide eyes , fever-bright and glassy . She panted like a dog . Dank gray hair tumbled from under her bonnet , half off her head . She came through the lane straight toward Elizabeth , and Elizabeth recognized her family 's former dressmaker . " Mrs. Fitchett , " she said weakly . " Mrs. Fitchett ! " The woman stopped and slowly her gaze focused . She shifted as though she might be ashamed . Then she lowered her eyes.  | " What are those women after , Mrs. Fitchett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But surely you ' re not breaking into stores ? " " We broke in the commissary store , " she muttered . A big-boned women , thin and sallow , her lips drawn back over her teeth , plunged through the men , facing them defiantly . A pair of boots were tied around her neck . Something shone in her hand . " But they ' re breaking open stores and that woman has stolen something . " " I cai n't he'p what they ' re doin ' . They 're so hongry I reckon they 've gone crazy . " She faced Elizabeth doggedly . " But what started them ? How could  --  " " I reckon ' t was that explosion at Brown 's Island . A lot was killed and hurt theah and they ' re desp'rit . Oh , Lord Jesus , look ! Heah comes the City Battalion . " Elizabeth turned . Bayonets gleamed in the morning sun . " Foh Gawd , " Mrs. Fitchett moaned , " whut ' d my boy Joe say if he knew the militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She raised the hand holding the fish to set her bonnet on straight . Her torn sleeve fell from her arm . The grayed skin was drawn tight over the bone . " You won ' tell Mistuh Brose , will you ? Joe ' d think hard of me if ' n he knew and he 's all I got . You wo n't tell , will you ? " Elizabeth shook her head . The exposed arm had made her sick . The old woman started to speak again . Then she closed tight her lips and defiance replaced the shame . She whirled and went scuttling up Eleventh Street . Elizabeth half turned . Men ran toward her . From behind and around her men and women of the mob scattered up the hill . Their shouts shook her . Riot , riot . . . close the stores . . . riot . . . going into Main . . . She just stood there , weak and terrified , while the crowd eddied about her . She turned back when the City Battalion marched past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim face moved . They were advancing on their first enemy . When the guide sergeant at the end of the column walked stiffly by , she saw that she stood alonep269in the debris . Then she started up Eleventh Street , almost stumbling in her weakness . Her legs would not steady . Main Street looked like Sunday . The stores were tightly barred , but glass was sprinkled on the sidewalk and some windows were broken . The mob had passed on . She hurried on toward Bank Street . She heard their shouting up the hill . Government clerks talked quietly in the Bank Street entrance of the Customshouse and there was one white-haired old gentleman who belonged in one of her favorite houses . A trim cavalry colonel halted his horse in front of him . The colonel was one of President Davis 's aides . " It ' s all over , Mr. Paxton , " he called cheerfully . " The President tried talking with them , but one of them threw a loaf of bread at him . Then Governor Letcher threatened to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sullen as animals . I did n't know we had such riffraff in the city . " " What you do n't know , apparently , " the old aristocrat said coldly , " is that hunger makes riffraff of us all . " The officer flushed . He spun his horse around and galloped up Bank Street . Elizabeth looked closely at the old gentleman as she passed him . Mr. Paxton . . . that must be Uncle Virginius ' friend . If Uncle Virginius could be a friend of such a fine gentleman of that world suggested by the houses , and Brose could be Mildred Wade 's sweetheart , why should she think that Chester 's life kept them apart ? She climbed the steps into Capitol Square . Negro nurses talked while the children they watched played near them . The nurses were glancing at a pale young woman who leaned back on a bench , as though she might be sick . Elizabeth glanced at her . Her poor dress was torn and her cheek was bruised . She was n't sick ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she held a man 's shoe . The shock of the bread riot , which had gripped her in a paralysis , broke into its horrible details and she saw again each hunger-crazed woman . They flashed before her vision like colored slides . Their bestial screams rang again through her brain . She forgot herp270morning errand , forgot their need of tallow , forgot Chester , everything , in a sudden frenzy to be home , where she could shut out the visions , where she felt safe , where things were familiar . Elizabeth lifted the straw she had plaited off the bowl and held it to the light . For some reason it looked less like a hat than those the other girls made . The lack of style did n't explain it ; there was little of that in anyone 's hat , or anything else . Somehow the crown appeared to be misshapen and the brim flopped . She took the strip of rose taffeta she had cut from the dress that had split . She started to weave it around the base of the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hat , through the window , she saw the gardens behind the Grace Street houses in full May bloom . There should n't be lilacs now . Her fingers grew still . " Elizabeth ! " Her mother 's sharp voice startled her . " For heaven 's sakes , ca n't you stop looking like you were at your own funeral ? " Her head bent over the raw potato she was slicing , her eyes glared under drawn black brows . " I was thinking about the farmer protesting when he sold Papa the straw , and saying he was against vittels being wasted for prettifyingwhen folks were starving . I do n't feel right to be putting ribbons on hats when I remember those poor starving women I saw . " " Then stop remembering them . It ' s been a month since you saw the bread riot and anybody ' d think you were one of them yourself . " " I ca n't stop remembering it . I keep seeing Mrs. Fitchett 's skinny arm when her sleeve fell back . " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own father . If he had n't worked himself to the bone , we ' d have been in the riot ourselves . It does seem to me the least you could do would be try and make him cheerful . " " Judy , let the child be , " Granny said . " It ' s Chester she ' s pining for . " " But Chester is coming to-morrow , is n't he , Elizabeth ? " Mrs.P271Kirby finished slicing the potato and laid the paper-thin disks on a bread tray with others that were drying . " Yes ' m , " she murmured . " Are you going to greet him with that Patience-on-a-monument look ? " " I do n't care how I 'm going to greet him . " She threw the hataway from her . " I wish  --  I wish I was n't going to see him at all ! " Granny stopped rocking . Marie looked in from the kitchen . " Anybody call me ? " " No , " Mrs. Kirby said grimly , " but you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And after you toast these , grind them finer than you did before . That last batch was the poorest excuse for coffee I ever drank . " " Hit 's all poh , if'n you ask me . " Marie picked up the tray . " Ai n't fitten foh a hawg ter drink . Thet ' s whut the matter with thet chile . You git yoh pappy foh ter bring some sassafras ' n ' I ' 11 make you some tea whut ' 11 bring you ' round . Springtime powerful bawd on young gals  --  " " All times are hard on Elizabeth , " Mrs. Kirby said . " Now what 's the matter with Chester ? " " Nothing , Mother , nothing . It 's not him . It 's just  --  every-thing . " " Hit ' s the springtime , " Marie said . " Sassafras tea  --  " " All right , Marie , " she said wearily , " I ' 11 get Papa to bring some . " " You do ' at , honey . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wuss ' n ' at Cawnfederate cawffee . " " Has Chester done something ? " her mother asked quietly . " Oh no , nobody ' s done anything . It ' s just me , just that everything in Richmond is so upset , and  --  oh !  --  I do n't know ... " " Bad times now , " Granny croaked , rocking placidly again ; " worse coming . " " It ' s your croaking that sets her off , " Mrs. Kirby said vehemently . " These are the best times we 've had since the war began . Everybodysays that Chancellorsville was the greatest victory we 've ever won .   " Soldier victories , " Granny sniffed . " They ' re not helping us . Look at these here cavalry raids all the time . . . this Stoneman , come a-stealing and a-burning right outside Richmond last week , scaring the poor folks out of their senses . " " That ' s what they ' re trying to do  --  scare the women so we ' 11 want to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This Hooker of theirs is about the tenth general that Lee has ruined . And Virginius told me that Lee did n't have Longstreet and two of his divisions . With them Hooker would ' ve been destroyed . " " Yes , Mother , but how is that helping Richmond ? " " Oh , for the Lord 's sake , Elizabeth , I 've heard Chester tell you that they ' d let us alone if we ran another army of theirs out of Virginia like we did Pope 's and McClellan 's . " Mrs. Kirby broke off suddenly and looked fixedly at her . Elizabeth stared down at the figures on her cotton dress . Then her mother said with a quiet steadiness : " Elizabeth , are you afraid that Chester does n't love you ? " " No ! " She looked up and tried to read her mother 's expression . " Then what are you afraid of ? " Her mother did n't seem to be thinking that Chester did not love her . " I do n't know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid of everything . " She fought back tears . " I know what it is , " Granny cackled , " and the springtime makes it worse . You 've gotten to the age when you need a man to lean on . Elizabeth turned to the old lady , but she was rocking and staring out the window , as she did the whole day long . " I believe Mamma is right , " her mother said slowly . " Yes , that ' s what has been in your craw all these past weeks . " The impatience and repressed anger had lifted from her and her eyes softened , as they used to so often , and now only for Brose . " Is that right , Elizabeth ? " She shook her head . She knew she would cry if she tried to speak.  | " What bright eyes she has , " Granny said . " Would you know if Chester was to walk in this minute ? " Something in her grandmother 's voice and expression suddenly quieted her . She stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought so , " Granny went on . " Well , he is about to walk in . I just see him ride up . " All at once Elizabeth was standing and her heart was pounding and she felt a strange , breathless buoyance , more exciting than anything she had ever known , and more scary . Her mother rose quickly and came toward her . " Elizabeth , my child , I reckon we have n't looked after you very well lately . I should have seen this , because Mamma is right . Chester loves you and you need to depend on him . Go to him and you wo n't be so nervous and so  --  so upset all the time . You ' re twenty years old now , and  --  " The bell tinkled back in the kitchen . She jumped . Her mother 's hand was on her shoulder . " Now , now , child , do n't take on so . You know , we all need to help one another and you can do what you can by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like that . " " Will he ? " The strange buoyance seemed to swell inside her so that she could hardly contain herself . " Yes , he will , but you must n't talk to him about bad times in the city . Do n't talk about the bread riot . Maybe he has n't heard of it  --  it was kept out of the papers . Talk to him about the great victory at Chancellorsville , talk of cheerful things , and show him that you believe we will win our freedom . You do and he will make you brave . " Her mother stepped away from her as Marie opened the door . She turned toward it , feeling light and glowing and ready to rush toward him . He moved into the doorway and paused , limp in his ( lusty gray clothes . His face , roughened by a stubble , was heavy with sorrow , while his eyes , usually so grave and strong , looked at them as though his heart were breaking . She checked her movement . The look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Chester . . . " When Mrs. Kirby 's voice faltered in the silence , Elizabeth was aware that they had all been standing there , as if turned to stone . He drew in a deep breath and spoke with an effort . " Good afternoon , Mrs. Kirby , and Mrs. Fitzhugh , and  --  " his stricken eyes moved to her  --  " and Elizabeth . " She tried to speak , but she was numbed . She could only stare at him . She saw that his eyes were wet . He lowered his head and then his muffled voice sounded , very low . " Stonewall Jackson is dead . " All day the crowds waited in the hot sun of Capitol Square . They were quiet and patient . There was little talking . The only movement was men wiping their sweaty faces and ladies gently fanning . When the slow roll of the " Death March " moaned from Grace Street , the crowds grew silent . Men removed their hats and ladies ceased fanning . Across the driveway , Uncle Virginius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . St. George Paxton stood beside him , glancing about . Uncle Virginius stared straight ahead , sightless . He had lost weight and his hair was turning white . Both of their black suits were worn and shiny . Hardly anyone wore fine clothes . The packs of poor women , on the hill below the driveway , wore patched dresses or those beyond patching . They were all clean though , their faces scrubbed , and they were weighted with their sorrow as poor people are . Farther up the driveway , Elizabeth saw Mildred Wade , her hair golden in the sun . Even in her sadness now there was aloofness , a suggestion of cool arrogance . What in that lovely girl responded to the dark recklessness of Brose ? The older woman beside her , dressed in mourning , had an air about her too . She must be Mrs. Wade . She had been pretty once , but now she was drawn . Elizabeth felt that never had Mrs. Wade possessed the passion she had sensed inp275Mildred Wade on that long-ago afternoon . Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to him now , as if for reassurance . He nodded toward the entrance . The crowd stirred and a whisper sighed through them like a hot wind . Ragged men in columns of fours marched through the Capitol gates . Their rifles were reversed on their shoulders . " They ' re two regiments from Brose 's division , " Chester whispered . " Pickett 's ? " He nodded . " All Virginians . Look at their faces . Great fighters . " She could n't see much but tangled beards , and eyes bright and shining like their rifles . They wore the yellow-gray homespun such as her mother made , and some wore Yankee trousers and some civilian broadcloth . Few wore jackets except the officers . The gold braid shone on theirs . Tears welled up in her as she heard the shuffle of their broken shoes , and she remembered the first parade she had watched with Chester , when the uniforms were new and thebands played . Then I wish I was in Dixie . . . Away , away .. . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down around his mouth and dark hair flowed in ringlets over his shoulders . His uniform glistened with gold braid and brass buttons and his eyes were the brightest of all . Behind him , heavy horses plodded , pulling rumbling gun carriages . She recognized the uniforms of the Richmond Fayette Artillery above the sullen glint of the guns . The men on the horses and those perched , cross-armed and stiff , on the caisson boxes stared straight ahead . A troop of cavalry came after them , the slow cloppety-clop of their walking horses echoing in the silence . Then the crowd sighed and swayed forward . The carriage moved slowly . The black plumes nodded , and danced long shadows across the Confederate flag on top the coffin . A soldier walked behind , leading a sorrel horse . The horse was saddled and boots hung between a field-glass case and a saddle holster . The **29;5937;TOOLONG air in the tent became hot and heavy again , thick with sour exhalations . Once , the dogs barked outside , and Vasilov thought he heard someone in the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been mistaken ; but a few moments later , moving a leg , he encountered an object that had n't been there before . Cautiously , he investigated and found a large jug of arrack . A miracle ! He sniffed the liquor . A miracle  --  but from whom , and why ? Then he shrugged and drank deeply . . . Ah , life was n't so bad after all ! The sour odor of Ghashun began to excite him again . He thought of the flaxen hair and fair skin of the German girl at Sarepta , the smooth lush limbs of the Magyar woman , " occupation , seamstress , " who lived just below the fort . Perhaps everything would come out all right , perhaps he was too impatient  --  perhaps when Subutai came back from Koulagina , things would be better . In the meantime , here he was , snug in a tent , with plenty of arrack and his captor 's wife .. . Roughly , he seized her shoulder . She snarled and spit at him , first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me no better than I do her ! " He chuckled and handed her the arrack jug . The bitter fumes of the liquor added to the sour heat of the tent . Vasilov constructed an image in his mind from the remembered fragments of the German girl and the Magyar woman , when he seized Ghashun again ; and he wondered , cynically what image she held in her mind when she responded to his attack this time . They clutched one another , lying on the cold mat , clamping their eyelids tightly over the bright secret images so remote and sweet , and flagellating with fierce blows , it seemed , the true and hated identity of each other 's body .. . Thus the night passed , and the blizzard still blew , and snow lay like a soft cloak over the sleeping horde . Utterly weary , people slept soundly in spite of their hastily made camps and the howling storm  --  aware , even in sleep it seemed , that on the morrow they need not rise again before dawn . And the snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay over their heads like a deep blanket of peace . Grandma , however , had a terrible dream not long before dawn . She woke in a cold sweat , trembling , her blood like a glacial stream bursting in spurts from ice , a paralytic chill in her bones . She could neither remember the dream , nor why it had seemed like an omen . In the vague light of dawn , she lay waiting as though for somethingP101more , some last cold clarity in which the meaning of the dream would reveal itself . Through the snow , like a thickness of white felt atop the cloth of her tent , the light came curiously soft and thin . Darkly nearby lay some dogs , huddled here out of the storm ; and across her feet , where he slept like a curled-up dog , lay Tenek . No sound of horns , no cannon fire nor calls , no sound of waking people came , from beyond . All slept , all lay quietly under the blanket of snow , over them still blowing the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muted wailing , or the sound of a distant sea ,  --  all motionless , like death . Staring upward , Grandma lay with the light filtering down through the snow . She slept no more ; but half-awake she dozed and dreamed . She thought of things that seemed forgotten long ago .. . There was another tent , like this , another snow . Clearly as though the voices were in this tent , here , right now , she heard someone call a name , " Linga . " With a start , she opened her eyes . Why , it was her own name they were calling ! But there was nobody  --  all was quiet in the tent , nobody called . . . Yes ,  --  it was long ago , another tent , near Bish-Uba the sparkling lake , only last evening rippled by what seemed a late summer breeze , waking , to find ice and snow , come overnight , an early winter blown over the summer pastures , and her own mother calling her name , at dawn ! Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a little pig-tail tied with a scrap of colored cloth ? . . . How far , how small , like somebody else ! The fresh dawn of summer days , helping her mother milk the rows , the long clear streaks of light coming like excitement through the still dark , the birds sometimes  --  were there such days ? And after , still in the cool dawn , to ride with other girls and boys , taking the herds out to graze , singing , racing , free and sweet under the warming sun , the intoxicating wind sometimes , the deep clean grass , overhead the great white clouds and floating birds ; the quiet peaceful dusk before the return , perhaps listening , weary and content , to a story told by one of the herdsmen-slaves , one in particular , a great Turk of a man whose whiskers they loved to pull , and who tussled them and tossed them high in the air until they ached with laughter -- -ah ! was such a thing , ever ? And even the winter , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lace of branches on which the snow fell and packed so that all was pleasant inside as in a white cave  --  even in winter what fun , the games in the snow ! making frosty houses of the soft flakes , inside which there was actually room for them to play they were in a temple or fort , or , more excitingly still , that they were marriedpeople in a yurt of their own ! and the time when Aunt Yana was about to bear a child and had n't been seen for three days on end  --  as though she were about to perform a feat three times as difficult as other women  --  how they had chattered with excitement while they modeled a doll-baby of snow and then sneaked up behind the shaman and Uncle Chiak , who were beating gongs and shaking sticks in the air to keep the demons away , leaving the snow-baby at the door of the yurt and running away , shrieking ! She recalled , too , the first day her mother let her stay and help in the yurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl and should learn the ways of a woman 's work . It had seemed like a bright and shining day , an adventure , sweeping the yurt with a willow broom , carrying water , feeding the dogs . In the simplest acts , there seemed magic she could learn , as though by knowing these things she could somehow conjure a yurt of her own into existence . What an exciting thing it had seemed , to collect the smooth glossy manure dried hard as stone in a basket and to carry the argols carefully in for the iron brazier  --  as though this were an act as thrilling and important , perhaps , as what Aunt Yana had done , that time in her mysterious yurt ! She could recall , too , the first day of her marriage , after the ritual , the capture and kidnap , the quick trip somewhere in the dark , the strange yurt filled with women and girls whom she knew but who looked different somehow , now giggling , chattering , tending and dressingher ; after this and all else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own brazier and willow broom , a shining copper bowl , in her own yurt with her own herds to tend and a man to care for , like a dream magically come true ! ... Could there have been , truly , ever such ecstasy merely to touch lightly the gleaming copper pot ? Grandma sighed , in the dull glow of a cold dawn , not bitterly but deeply . Like a witch 's light luring one on , it seemed looking back . But pain and labor , she knew from living , were the conditions of life ; it began that way , for mother and child alike , and likely the end was similar . The whole of a long life from which the thrill had somehowp103been lost , so that each day was like another , doing the same things  --  all this lay behind , as though she were now dead , or about to die . She thought dimly of the ceaseless labor of life  --  making salt in the saline marshes under a hot sun ; preparing food , cooking , eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mending with threads made from hamstrings that had lain buried for days and had been pounded in long fine shreds that twisted together ; embroideringkalats and the outer felts of the yurt ; boiling butter until it became dry and hard as iron in the sun , against the winter months  --  this and all else . But there were moments recalled , too  --  among the marsh grasses : t hot silence broken by the clear , cool call of a bird ; a vague content , at dusk with smoke curling up into a vast colorful sky where hung a pure white moon ; a child peaceful in sleep at her breast ; a tender touch of someone 's hand in sleep  --  she recalled the deep peace of nature in such moments , as though for these moments her life were part of such quiet peace , as though a time lay , just beyond , where all moments might be such as these .. . Grandma drew a deep shuddering sigh , filling her stiff lungs with the air churned warm and fetid from the breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , the light came more white and strong through the snow-covered tent . Suddenly she tried to move , to stir herself . But either her limbs were too stiff to move , or the way Tenek and the dogs had wedged her in  --  or could this be death ? . . . What had she been dreamingsnow-dolls ? copper kettles ? pain , like two ends of a line on which one 's life was strung ? . . . Terribly alarmed , now , Grandma made great efforts to thrust Tenek and the dogs aside , to rise , to run outside in the snow where there were still no sounds , to wake all people lest they be dead . But she seemed to be sinking deeper and more heavily under the snow , the cold white light , the smoky mist in which clarity was elusive as before . Subutai , Subutai ! she tried to cry out . But from a great distance now , she could hear a call muted and sweet somehow as dawn , a voice calling her name . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought vaguely , " What can this be ? what is it now ? "  |p104NOT  LONG AFTER DAWN , UBASHAand the troops returning from Koulagina came suddenly on the outlyinghoshuns of the horde . The wind was abating but the air was still glittering with snow , and many riders stumbled against carts before they could see where to go . The snow had blown and drifted deeply over the carts and tents so that all lay buried except where , occasionally on the sheltered side of a cart , a thick shelf of snow overhungdense shadows . Even the animals were covered with snow ; and the advent of the troops roused some of the nearby cattle and sheep , whose heads , breaking through the drifts , were raised with querulous lowing and bleating . But otherwise all was silent , lifeless , in the pale white light of dawn . Ubasha stroked his mustaches , mildly disturbed . Obviously no watch had been kept through the night . But what harm had come of it ? He knew that the people had been so exhausted they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the storm drift over their heads . He himself , and the troops with him , were so weary it seemed they would sleep in the saddle , should they cease moving . But it was already daybreak , and he turned to the trumpeters , assuming a stern air . " Sound horns , wake all ! " he shouted . " Sentries ! people ! where are all ? " The trumpeters blew their horns ; and through the horde , like a ripple spreading far and wide , other horns echoed the sonorous call . Slowly the people stirred , breaking the snow that lay piled over their tents and carts . Snow was still falling thickly , but men began clearing away the drifts , packing the fallen snow in high banks all about . Animals moved restlessly , adding their plaints to the growing clamor . Children cried , hungrily ; and from beneath the carts tiny shreds of smoke began to rise.  |p105When  the people began to examine their situation , the losses during the blizzardous night were found to have been enormous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen days , capped by the great storm , had taken a great toll of life among the people and animals . Wailing rose throughout the horde , seeing the extent of their loss . But many shrugged philosophically . They were used to hardship , migration , hunger , sudden loss , death . It was true that this midwinterflight and suffering were unprecedented . But here they were , most of them safe and sound . The worst was over . . . Were n't these the Emba lands they had heard about , where they could start all over again ? Every gain required a loss . Let the Tsarina try her tricks now  --  the Torguts were ready ! So ran the comment among the more hardy-minded . And so volatile were their spirits , so prone to optimism were the Torguts , that within a short time the entire people , spread over the great steppe between the Mugadir hills and the Emba , were digging themselves out of the blizzard with a bustle of confidence , once they had accepted their losses and difficulties as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zebek , and Bambar had gone to seek their uluses , Ubasha rode at the head of his own men through the deep snow . People shouted at the soldiers , and the riders laughed and shook lances and muskets high in the air . Dogs barked and leaped in the snow , and the horses reared excitedly now and then . Everyone cheered the returning troops and called for details of the siege . Some of the soldiers pointed to Subutai , who was leading Beran 's horse laden with the Kirghiz chieftain 's armor . Subutai laughed and shouted back over his shoulder when the people , seeing his trophies , cheered loudly ; he sat on his horse straightly , although he was tired , glad that he had chosen not to wear Beran 's heavy chain-mail . Batu , Norbo , and some of the other young men riding with Subutai , tried to shout back further details of the siege to the people ; but they only added to the chaotic din of questions , cheers , and laughter . And as the troops made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their spirits , like those of the people among whom they passed , rose high in spite of their weariness and the mounting evidence of great losses throughout the horde . Ubasha Khan , riding at the head of his warriors with Temuru andp106Choktu , became more gloomy and worried , the more he saw . It was not merely the losses which saddened him  --  nor the lack of vigilance , evidence of a weakened morale , which worried him . Yet he smiled uncertainly and said , " Well  --  here we are ! " Temuru and Choktu shrugged , plodding through the snow . But Rabdan , the nephew of Choktu , who was riding close behind , scowled and muttered . " Here ? and what good , may I ask ? " he said sarcastically . " So that we may be set upon at will by the Cossacks and savage tribes ? " Choktu and Temuru grumbled agreement . Even Ubasha nodded vaguely when he heard Rabdan speak . But then he said , " We shall see . Perhaps we shall find a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ubasha knew that Rabdan was right . This country , on which they had all counted so heavily , seemed not only a barren waste-land , with little timber or fuel and very few water-courses , but it seemed also poor land to defend . Somehow , perhaps unduly enthused by Zebek and Chereng , Ubasha had thought that the Emba , like the Volga , would provide a mighty barrier which , once crossed , might protect his people from attack . Now they were here ; and any man could see that the Emba was no defense at all  --  nothing but a broad shallow stream in a flat barren steppe . But Ubasha also knew that his people had suffered enormously ,  --  that they could move no further , no matter what . Here , and not somewhere beyond , they had willed to come ; and into the effort of reaching these Emba lands , they had poured their last resources of strength and hope . They could travel no more , at least for a time ; to move on would be calamitous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And his features , usually pleasant , became stern and tense . Here the Torguts should stay and regain their strength . Here they should somehow find adequate means of defense . And here , in spite of the barren wintry appearance of the land , perhaps they might even find that it was , truly , the good land they had hoped it to be , where they could live in freedom and peace . . . Determined to yield to no man on such points as these , no matter what wile and argument Zebek or Chereng might employ , Ubasha rode sternly ahead . When the riders reached their own ulus at last , Ubasha dismissed most of the younger men , with the exception of Subutai and a fewpI07whom he might require for courier duty in the event that the Sarga , or Military Council , had not yet been convoked . Emerging into a broad space already cleared of the new deep snow and trampled hard , the khan was pleased to see his own yurts had already been raised  --  to shelter his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sand-chab , and their Turkish slaves  --  and that the council yurt had also been established in the clearing . This he considered a good sign ; and he gave orders to raise the white temple yurts , too . He was also pleased to note that the Sarga was already in session , since smoke was pouring out through the iron vent in the roof of the council yurt . And so , taking Temuru and Choktu with him and requesting the younger men to help with the temple yurts until further command , he entered the council chamber . Within , the other members of the Sarga were seated on skins and Turkey-carpets around the great iron brazier , which was filled with glowing argols ; they were smoking and passing tea while they talked . When Ubasha and the two saissangs entered , everyone rose and welcomedthem effusively , congratulating them on their safe return and pressing them for details of the siege . At a signal from Zebek , two men left the yurt  --  Gedesu , who sidled past his father with scarcely a glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who bowed deferentially to the khan as he passed . Then Zebek himself followed the example of the other members , embracing and congratulating Ubasha on the successful outcome of the Koulagina siege . Ubasha , with a cup of hot tea in his hand and a pipe in his mouth , at length sat down beside the fire , feeling well content and rather sentimental . What a good fellow Zebek could be ! he thought . At times he mistrusted his cousin ; occasionally Ubasha was shrewd in his appraisal of people and their motives , yet ordinarily , prone to conciliation , he loved to believe in the native goodness of all men . Looking around , hearing a murmur of approval for the Koulagina incident still circulating among the council members , he felt a sudden and intenselove for them all . What good fellows they all were ! Each of thrtn had his faults and personal motives  --  what man had not ?  --  yet now , in the face of common danger and difficulty , how united they eotilel he , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these men , and from love of all the Torgut people , Ubasha now **27;5968;TOOLONG his cousin Zebek and the others for havingp108successfully led the horde safely to these lands near the Emba , and for having established winter camps with such efficiency and speed in spite of the snow . Then he leaned forward , blissfully sipping his hot tea . " All is well , " he said , " and here we shall make new life for our-selves . " Zebek and Chereng exchanged a quick glance . Prince Bambar tugged at his mustaches ; and his son , the Lama Loosang , bent piously over his yellow rosary , made of fig-wood from the sacred pepul tree . Zebek cleared his throat . " The Starshin Mitrasov and his Cossacks have taken the uluses of Mashi and Assarko , " he said , " and they have returned to the Volga . " " Ah ! " the khan exclaimed sharply . " There 's no denying , " said Bambar , " we have plenty of enemies hereabouts  --  that 's why I kept insisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's true  --  he did , " Zebek said pleasantly . " But that 's exactly why Chereng and I felt we should proceed more leisurely  --  so that the people would be fresh enough to continue traveling , if need be . " " Bambar was right , " Ubasha said , " there 's no need to go further . We shall find ways to protect ourselves here . " " But of course ! Impossible to travel further , in such snow ! " said Zebek and Chereng simultaneously . Ubasha relaxed again ; he was still disturbed , but he felt that once more he had unjustly suspected Zebek of some ulterior motive . " When the snow packs and freezes , of course , " Zebek said , " there may be others who think , like Mashi and Assarko , that it would be a good thing to return to the Volga  --  particularly should Cossacks appear and offer them safe passage . This we must guard against , or else the uluses might separate and each one go its own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alternately moved to praise and condemn his cousin . " The horde must be kept together at all costs . " " Well then , " said Chereng , " if I may say so , it would have been an excellent thing to have destroyed Koulagina and done away with the Cossacks for good and all ! " " Ach ! " said Temuru . " And have given the Tsarina an excuse to send the whole Russian army after us ? " " Perhaps she has enough excuse as it is , " said Zebek . " Two more Cossacks were killed yesterday morning . "  | " What ! after I distinctly ordered , " cried Ubasha , " that no more should be killed ? " Zebek shrugged . " Ask Bambar , " he said , " they were captives in his ulus . " Bambar said , uncomfortably : " Well , some of the men claimed these fellows raped their wives , so they dragged them over the snow till they died . " " And my own three Cossacks ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lama Loosang , without looking up from his beads , " as you ordered  --  and as God wills . " Temuru spat in the fire . " This is all pretty far from the point , " he said . " We were talking about Koulagina . " " Yes , and the point is , " said Chereng , " that here we 're really in a t rap . Just look at the situation carefully . There 's not only the garrison at Koulagina ,  --  word has probably gotten by now to Traubenberg . We 're apt to have them all come marching down on us , when the snow freezes . . . South of us are the Kara-Kalpaks and the Aral Sea . In addition  --  while it was , perhaps , an understandable thing for Tenoiru'sboy to spare Beran 's life  --  now we must consider that Nurali and the Kirghiz will learn where we are . Between them all , they can press us back against the Mugadir hills and slaughter our people like sheep ... We 're obviously in an indefensible position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was n't Chereng the very man who had said , glibly , " This will be a highly defensible place , with the Mugadir at our back and the Emba like a sword before us ! " . . . Where was Momotubash ? thought Temuru , looking around for someone to share his disgust . The pack of tricky , rascally beggars ! Yet the worst of it was that Temuru , like Ubasha and Choktu , knew that Chereng was right . The Djungarian prince ,  --  who had painted a false picture before , perhaps deliberately ,  --  had become , now they had reached these promised lands near the Emba , painfully correctin his analysis . . . What angered the newcomers to the Sarga most was the feeling that they had somehow been tricked . Uhasha , who betrayed his emotion by the way he flushed and stared into the fire , said quietly : " It would appear , then , that in our absence the council has made some decision . "  | " No decision at all , " said Zebek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Facts ? " said Ubasha Khan . " It 's also a fact that the people are exhausted  --  that it would be criminal to drive them another step . Perhaps the situation here is n't so bad as it seems . This is good land , and perhaps we shall find ways to defend it , " he said . " After all , the people need rest right now  --  not facts . " " They need good pastures , too , " said Zebek , dryly . " If this were really good land , perhaps I might agree with you , for there might be ways to protect ourselves , at least for a time . " " But it is ! " said Ubasha . " It 's good land  --  our people under HoOrluklived here one time . " " Less than one-third as many , then , " said Zebek . " And likely the pasture was better , too . We have dug through the snow , and the grass is sparse and not very good . Momotubash , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems small and not well watered . Other messages have come , from all parts of the horde . There is little fuel to be had . There are many more complaints . This is not good land for our people . " " Why did n't you say all this before ? " said Temuru . Ubasha laid a hand on his arm . " How could they know ? " he said softly . " It is no man 's fault . " " I do n't know about that , " said Bambar . " But I do know that here we are wide open to attack , as Zebek has said , on land not worth defending . Many animals have already been lost . There is little grass below the snow . The poorest half of our herds should be killed , and their meat salted and dried and frozen . . . Otherwise all will die  --  and we ourselves , into the bargain . " " But then , " said Ubasha , feeling himself being driven into a corner , " what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his eyes from his rosary and glanced at Chereng , who sprang to his feet and turned to a large chest where , among other things , the Torgut census rolls were kept . " Ah ! " said Chereng . " We have considered just such a thing , in the event it seemed best  --  " From the top of the chest he took a map , which he began to unroll . " Now if you 'll notice , " he said , " there are four directions we can travel . " " Remarkable ! " growled Temuru. pIIIChereng paid no attention . " First , " he said , " we can return westward , back to the Volga lands . " Everyone murmured dissent . " Very well , " said Chereng . " Northward  --  we 'd run right into Traubenberg 's arms . South is the Aral Sea ; but to the southeast is the land of the Kara-Kalpaks , between the sea and the Mugadir hills . This is small land , not very good , and bordered by deserts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well then , what 's the other direction ? " " East , " said Chereng , " into Asia . " " Aid But what of the Mugadir hills ? " " There 's an excellent pass  --  right here , between these two peaks . It 's our only chance . Once we gain the pass , none can attack us from the west  --  and all of Asia lies beyond . " " For instance , " said Zebek , " there 's excellent land in the Turgai country , beyond Lake Chalkhar  --  not very much peopled , I 'm told . Once there , the land offers a fine natural defense , lying as it does betweenthe lake swamps , the Rivers Irgiz and Turgai , and the Moun Kum desert . This is the land , perhaps , we should have headed for from the very first . " A buzz of excited comment followed these remarks . Someone stirred the fire and tossed more argols into the brazier . Tea was passed , and smoke rose from many pipes . Uhasha sat listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual , his clever cousin seemed to be right , and even the old warrior Temuru was giving his grudging agreement . But it seemed to Ubasha that there was something much deeper than happen-chance about all their misfortunes  --  the loss of the two small uluses and the threat of further dispersal of the horde ; the murder of all but a few of the Cossack hostages ; the strange discrepancy between what they had been led to expect of the Emba lands and what they had actually found  --  all these things seemed so effectively to block any action other than to move cast ward again , that they could scarcely be accidental . Yet to feel personallypiqued , to let any petty considerations stand in the way of his people 's welfare , was utterly impossible for Ubasha . He knew , now , that the Torgut horde had not yet reached those lands where peace and freedom might be found . And so he said : " Then it is agreed , and so it shall be . Yet here we shall stay , until the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curing the animals ' meat has been done . " " But of course ! " " In such weather , what else ? " " Until Chagan-Sara , " said Ubasha , firmly seizing this small point . " Until the New Year feast , we shall stay . " So it was decided ; and there was great talk among the council members now . Yet , in spite of the pleasant illusion of unity among themselves  --  once more gained at the cost of conceding to Zebek  --  Ubasha stared rather sadly into the argol coals . He tried not to think that here , nonetheless , they might have been able to hold their enemies at bay , that here they might have come to terms with the Tsarina as originally planned , or that here they might find , somehow , sufficient pasture for all . But he could n't help thinking , more than ever , that Zebek was an untrustworthy man . So finally he said : " Cousin , your flank seems most exposed to such sudden raids as have already lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , were many good fighters . " " Yes , it 's true , " said Zebek , " our tasks have been extremely heavy , without nursing every little ulus along . Besides , we must take great care now lest others , hearing that we plan to travel still further east , have a mind to return . " He frowned ; and Ubasha , also schooled in the art of dissimulation , looked back at him with limpid eyes . " But now that we are agreed to go on , " Ubasha said pointedly , " such rumors will no longer disturb the people , who want time to rest in safety and prepare for Chagan-Sara . " " That 's true , too . What do you suggest , cousin ? " " That we send you , let us say , a thousand men . These , together with your own , should be ample guarantee against Cossacks , KaraKalpaks , wolves , or such rumors as might get around to make the people uneasy , coming at an improper time . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering his eyes to the argols blazing in the bluish air of the yurt . " And it 's also true that we 've been even less fortunate than most in regard to animals . So it might be a good thing to send your men with proper provisioning . And perhaps , " he said , suddenly wrinkling his forehead as though trying to recall something , " you might send along that young fellow who did so nicely at Koulagina , what's-his-name "  | " Subutai . " " Ah yes , Subutai  --  Temuru 's boy , is n't he ? " murmured Zebek , blowing on his tea . " That 's the kind we need  --  quite a bold fellow , so the Princess Cedar-chab tells me ... " And so , after couriers had been despatched to all parts of the horde with orders that the poorer half of all herds must be slaughtered and tired , Ubasha pushed aside the tapestried door of the council yurt and I. Joked for Subutai . He smiled when he noticed that the boy had tethered his Bar-Kul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuks planted in the snow at the entrance of Ubasha 's household yurt . Subutai , who had been helping with the temple yurts , came running when the khan called . Ubasha walked aside with him a little , laying a hind on the boy 's shoulder , and said : " You go to the Prince Zebek . Take a thousand men , and guard his people for a time . See that all goes well , and that no foolish ones try to return through the snow whence we came . " Then he lowered his voice and added , " Learn all you can of the conditions among Zebek 's people  --  of what extent and nature his herds and wealth . Talk with his Jew . Learn all you can ... " While he was talking , they walked toward Subutai 's horse ; and now Cedar-chab came from the yurt . She smiled uncertainly at Suhutai , and took her brother 's arm . She bent her face a little , mysteriously , and fingered the silver chain-mail laden on Beran 's horse . Subutai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . Ubasha smiled , and said a few pleasant words about Subutai 's exploit at Koulagina , which made him blush all the more . Just then , Zebek emerged from the council yurt and come over to where they stood . For a moment he gazed absently at Subutai 's trophiesof war . Familiarly , he drew Cedar-chab 's free arm through his own and looked at Subutai . " Look , lad , " he said . " You 'll find my Jew with your brother ( ; edcsu somewhere close by . He 'll go with you to your father 's aimak rind help you provision for the men you bring . Then he 'll find you the way to my ulus  --  he 's a clever man , my Jew . " Without a word , then , without looking around , flushed and confused , Subutai sprang up on his white horse and rode away . Zebek made some remark to Cedar-chab and laughed . She looked clown at the white , trampled ground . Only Ubasha , wondering about all manner of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEcouncil yurt , Gedesu had been discoursing with Zebek 's Jew , one Lev Zolotsky . Lev 's dark face was built like a dodecahedron , the governing symbolof which was a great hooked nose , a regular berkut beak , which made his small full lips seem of little consequence but which , on the other hand , seemed to be given special emphasis by the dark shiny eyes set back under his sloping forehead . These eyes interrupted the outward slope only to project the more strongly that great final peninsula of his face , so that his nose seemed really a gun barrel , a musket sight , along which his eyes were unblinkingly focused . These features never failed to fascinate the Torguts , so much so that Zebek himself would often sit for hours at a time , drinking arrack and smackinghis lips , regarding his Jew Lev unhurriedly , the way a man might who has captured for himself a great bird of some extinct or unknown species . Zebek valued Lev highly , however , for a certain turn of mind that made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple laws of life . The Jew had fallen into the prince 's hands only last autumn . On a visit to Novgorod , Zebek had indulged in a game of French cards with some Russians . He lost heavily , including a golden seal reputed to have belonged to Genghis Khan . A Russian nobleman lost heavily as he . Finally the winners left the game , but the two losers continued to play . The Russian wagered Lev Zolotsky , whom he had captured from the Krim Turks in the recent war near Astrakhan , against one thousand of Zebek 's sheep . The Torgut prince won . Afterward , Lev Zolotsky said :  | " Great lord , rich master  --  never gamble a thousand sheep against one Jew ! " " Why not ? " " Why , lord and master , great prince ! It is only the Jew 's mind you win , not his body  --  for that body is like the sheep , that belong to the pasture . The sheep remain with you so long as you treat them well , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jew 's laxly , his thought like golden apples , which you may pluck and use . Against this your forfeit should have been , not the bodies of sheep , but their fruit  --  their wool , great lord ! And in this way , too , you would have been in no danger of losing your sheep themselves . " Like a miracle of water in the desert , the Jew had already succeeded in making part of Zebek 's squandered wealth reappear , like water bubbling up as though it had only been idling underground . Yet this was accomplished by Lev with such disarming simplicity  --  as though It were no trick at all , but just a mere setting-in-motion of some natural law  --  that men such as Gedesu , who had achieved wealth in their own measure with much puffing and blundering of schemes , like a magician 's neophytes who let the audience see exactly how the thing is done , were completely entranced by Lev Zolotsky , and longed to learn from him the one magic word which might gain them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Gedesu , taking advantage of such a moment is this , was conversing in hoarse whispers with Lev . " But it 's a bad thing , Lev my dear brother , " he was saying , " this order to segregate and kill half of our herds , which surely we ca n't tat ourselves , is n't it so ? " t L waited , his narrow brow wrinkled , his cheeks puffed out queruously , looking at Lev 's beak intently . " Great lord , rich friend , " said Lev finally , adopting an effective variation of his usual epistolic manner with Zebek .. . Lev spoke Torgut with a strange blending of Turkish , Arabic , Hebraic , Russian accents and mis-pronunciations which gave his speech the effect of a golden nugget concealed in a great variety of ores . He also was unable to place the words of a sentence in their proper order  - -  object , subject , verb  --  so that to his Torgut listeners , his speech sounded strangely as theirs might to some alien grammarian or to Lev himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to whom it unknown Is enjoyed . " Such verbal eccentricities often made his listeners laughp116delightedly at first , just as the lisping of the Chinese and the way they elided their r 's , saying Togai for Torgut , Tukui for Turki , always sent them into peals of laughter . However , such was the golden essence of what Lev said , that soon his listeners learned to pay slight attention to such idiosyncrasies , placing all their attention on his thought . " Great lord , rich friend , " Lev repeated with emphasis , " such is not so . . . When the meat is dead , why burden your back with what is useless as gold in the other world ? . Keep what you can eat  --  distribute the rest . " " But , " Gedesu quavered , " but I have gone to great effort to assemblesuch cattle and sheep as I have . " " Assemble , in their place , " said Lev , " something else . Wealth is a fluid thing . In many parts of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in cattle and sheep , not even in gold  --  which you ca n't eat ; which is heavy to carry ; which may be stolen  --  but rather in certainpaper with marks thereon . " " Really , can this be true ? " said Gedesu , wetting his lips . " So that he might carry the wealth of a khan , for instance , like a piece of paper in the breast of his kalat ? " " Even so , " said Lev . " But then , " Gedesu said thoughtfully , " what if there came robbers and thieves  --  men who stop at nothing , men stronger than oneself  --  could it be , thus they might take all the fruits of a man 's wisdom and wealth in this way ? " " My great rich friend , this is true , " Lev said . " But therefore such men place themselves and this piece of paper , so to speak , in the protectionand safe-keeping of some powerful lord , some banker , some man of great skill in watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , " said Gedesu , " truly it is hard to keep a man with a musket from taking your sheep , your cattle and goods . " Lev nodded . " These things are easily separated from a man , like kumiss from the curds of milk , " he said . " And how much more easily , too , when the animals can no longer move of their own accord ! Dead meat ! Why , in time , too , it will rot in the sun ! . . . These are things to know ; for cattle and sheep  --  like your eye , your finger , my merciful rich friend !  --  are only the means whereby a man comes to great wealth and power . " " Yes , these are fine things to know , " said Gedesu hurriedly , for hep117saw , approaching them on his white horse , leading Beran 's horse laden with the gleaming chain-mail , his brother Subutai . He added in a hoarse whisper , " We will speak later  --  more of such wisdom ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We travel to the ulus of Zebek-Dordzhi , taking one thousand men . Each man shall bring a sheep for his own provisioning . " Lev threw out his arms in a wide gesture . " But illustrious lord  --  one thousand sheep ! Surely it is difficult for each man to despoil himself of a sheep , merely to help my lord Zebek protect his people and herds from beasts and Cossack riders ! Rather lct our rich friend Gedesu lend us a thousand of his own slaughtered sheep  --  which will put my master deep in his debt . " Subutai laughed grimly . " ' That 's not a bad idea , " he said . Nudging his mare , Gedesu turned back and said : " I was about , really , somehow the idea came to me , too , that 's what wanted to say , " he faltered , looking at Lev with the fawning air a man who wishes to show that his lesson in financial strategy has ken effect . When he rode forward , Lev leaned toward Subutai and id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cure the des and in payment will return them , fine sheep-skins , to cancel the bt with Gedesu . " " Excellent , you 're a wizard ! " cried Subutai , laughing . " Eh ! what 's this ? " Gedesu said uneasily , turning again . " Why , only the thought , great lender , " said Lev , " that when such tiers are done properly , as now , all gain . The men gain free proions  --  halfa sheep per man is sufficient , since the meat is a gift to m ; my master , as is only right , will gain half of the thousand cars ; while you gain most of all  --  equal of your sheep , plus the golden n of my master 's good will . " Satisfied with this explanation , Gedesu let the others ride abreast ; I out of the corner of his good eye , he glanced covetously at the in-mail his brother had won from Beran . " ' That 's a pretty thing you have , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkle of approbation . " How many animals should it bring , would you say ? " " Such questions , " said Subutai to Lev , " betray the bleating of sheepn they see their masters approaching with knives . " " Oh , very well ! " said Gedesu , riding forward again.  |p118They  rode on through the hoshuns . What wind and snow still blew was at their backs . Lev said to Subutai : " Brave captain , golden companion  --  you speak truly . Life is a sheep which the wise man shears without fail in season . . . This brother of yours , Gedesu , gains with an eye or finger what he might more easily have won with a musket or lance . " " These are good thoughts , " said Subutai . " Like you , " Lev said thoughtfully , " I too am a warrior of sorts . I fight with a mind sharp as a lance . Once I was a student , residing in a city far away , Damascus . There I studied the Talmud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Bichik . Then my father , who was a trader , sent me among the Krim Turks , who captured me and made me a slave . . . Think you I like the conditions of servitude ? Not at all , noble captain ! But I am a man of great curiosity . How I love new things , new people , new places ! Twice , three times really , I have changed everything , even my name . Once it was Lev son of Samuel . Then it was Lev Sam-Ali , and among the Russ , Zolotsky . Perhaps among your people I shall take a true Torgut name , Levambar , perhaps . . . What matter such things , to me ? The true thing , illustrious friend , is what I am able to do  --  to see my way among new people , new problems , clear as a lance point , like your dagger and gun , to bring about new and more lasting arrangements of men and things in which , perhaps , I may be permitted to live peacefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lev Zolotsky further on these and several points . But at this moment , they were approachingGrandma 's cart and tent . Subutai 's joy of home-coming was numbed by the fact that people were gathered about , wailing ; from within the tent , too , came the hollow sound of ghostly moaning .. . What could it mean ? Subutai sprang down from his horse ; but it was Gedesu , for once in his life moving more swiftly than Subutai , who tore the flap of Grandma 's tent aside . Within , it was dark . And from inside came such a peculiar odor , as of decay , that all moved backward involuntarily . But Gedesu reached in and seized Tenek by the legs , hauling him out . The dogs came out , too , their tails hanging , their bellies close to the ground , their faces reflecting a fear , it seemed , of the moans issuing from their own throats  --  as though such sounds were made , not by their ownpI19will , but by some strange wind howling down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crouched nearby in the snow . When Subutai crawled into the tent , from the very first he could see , Grandma was lying there white as snow , white as a cold stone cut to her own image . . . His hand trembled as he reached out to stroke the kind old face , the weary smile now restfully pressed on her lips as though by some last thought that none but she , holding it forever secret , could know . Yet for the moment Subutai felt no grief , unable to transform the peaceful fact of death into a sentiment of personal grievance . But , suddenly shaking with great blubbering quivers of his fat body , Gedesu burst out sobbing as though in personal agony . While to Subutai it had seemed that he and Grandma were somehow contemplating a quiet thought , this wretched bawling of Gedesu now struck bun with the recollection that death was not the calm conclusion of a long life weary and well done , but rather , a sentiment of heart-rending agony among the living . And so , uttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brother ; and the two clung toEther , weeping at Grandma 's side . " She was so good , " blubbered Gedesu , " so rich  --  such work  --  such crds  --  so old  --  " He sniffled and sobbed . But Subutai , unable to detect the scheming ready going on somewhere in Gedesu 's head , embraced his brother gently . His own grief seemed almost negligible , compared to the vastness of Gedesu 's anguish . The man seemed stricken as by his own ath ; and Subutai , feeling gentle and kind with his brother for the first time he could remember , drew Gedesu quietly from the tent , saying : " Come now , Gedesu ; there is no more we can do . Come , Ghashun II know  --  we must find Ghashun , Gedesu . Ghashun will know what do for Grandma . . . Come , Gedesu . " People , in a kindly way , pointed where Gedesu 's hoshun might be found . The two brothers rode side by side . Somewhere behind them , Lev Zotsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p them from stiffening in the cold . Gedesu finally ceased crying , only the furrowed grime on his face marked where fountainousrs had flowed ; but from time to time a great shudder passed like anved billow of snow from his body . But soon even such tokens ofP120grief came to an end ; and he rode rigid and silent as Subutai , except that a melancholy dignity was added to his already pompous bulk . And Subutai felt only a cold white emptiness , like snow , and a cold stone in his throat .. . Already they were passing among Gedesu 's animals ; and here was Merghen , clearing away the snow , looking at them in startled surprise , opening and closing his mouth several times , and finally stammering : " What ! You , Gedesu ? but we thought you were in your . . . Well , but . . . 0 Buddha , Khan Tengri ! could such a thing be ! " Subutai , thinking that Merghen had already learned of Grandma 's death and was trying to offer consolation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens is done . . . Where 's Gha-shun ? " Merghen gulped again , looking from Subutai to Gedesu in fright . " Why , but , " he stammered , " look , Gedesu  --  she  --  she 's gone yonder , to Yelden 's wife  --  yes , that 's it ! Yelden 's wife is ill . . . Go fetch her  --  I 'll get things to order , here ! " But as Gedesu made no reply , Merghen went on more importu-nately : " And look , Gedesu  --  they have a whole sheep broiling over there , yonder at Yelden 's . I should n't wonder but what they 'd be glad , really , for you to come eat  --  only , leave me a little ! " he added , as though to make his story ring more true . But now some wide-eyed children had come around from the other side of one of Gedesu 's carts . " He 's not there ! " they exclaimed . " It 's not Gedesu  --  he 's here ! " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then suddenly they scampered away . " Something 's wrong here ! " Gedesu cried sharply . " Come , tell me  --  is it Ghashun ? Can it be , she 's dead , too ? What is it ? . . . Out of my way ! clear way , there ! " And he rode forward , through the animals and carts , brushing heedlessly against the banked snow so that some of the cake-like piles at the top came tumbling down to smash whitely underfoot . A crowd of gaping idlers stood before his tent . From within the tent came shrieks of laughter , drunken belches , snatches of song , absolutelyunintelligible sounds , a pandemonium of brawling drunkenness . Gedesu 's face swelled with rage so that the skin was stretched nearly to bursting , no longer red but white as a sheep-gut stretched tight on ' 1'IIE TORGUTS 121P121a drum . With a mighty heave , he ripped the tent cloth free from its moorings , making a sharp tearing sound  --  an act of vandalism toward his own property so foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned for a moment to watch the wind rattle the torn cloth and blow it away . But there was a much more fascinating , dramatic sight to be seen . On the matting , where the tent had formerlycovered them , lay Ghashun and Vasilov ! " What will Gedesu do ? " people whispered , shivering with anticipation . " Vashi , you 're too young ! Run home  --  tell Aunt Sarkhu to tome -- quick now ! " Ghashun , startled to find the open sky where the roof of the tenttad been , blinked and turned her bleary eyes toward the people . " I lelp , murder ! " she suddenly screamed , drunkenly . " Rape ! " Many more people came running  --  Aunt Sarkhu and others , omen , men , children . All looked at Ghashun , who struggled to her t and began to kick at the drunken Russian , shouting persistentlyt the crowd , " Rape ! rape ! " while Vasilov lay there with his head rown back , laughing like a madman . . . All looked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his back and who seemed , beveit or not , about to squander still more of his wealth by shooting s slave ! Gedesu , feeling all eyes upon him , fumbled with the unfamiliar upon , trying to ram home the powder and shot with the rod . The plc became quiet now , respectfully watching him . But he seemed fat to manage both musket and rod , and somebody tittered . Subu- , with an expressionless face , took the musket from Gedesu and skillfully made it ready to shoot . Now everyone laughed a little , and ( lest ' muttered angrily . When he took the gun , the crowd became kt again ; all held their breath , standing on tiptoe to look over one ther 's shoulders . Guiding his horse , Gedesu jockeyed around for pod position . Several times he raised the musket to shoot , only to Me that his angle of fire was bad . After he had performed these net'vers several times , the crowd began to titter again . Someone shouted , " Just ram it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is commotion , Vasilov lay on the mat , laughing and shouting , as ) ttgh completely unconcerned ; and this fearlessness of the Cossack , ' pled with the scorn most people felt for Gedesu and Ghashun , be-n to sway the crowd with a good-natured sympathy for Vasilov. y jeered at Gedesu , and he lost his head , frantic to act in becoming manner ; he shot without looking , with his good eye tightly closed and his face turned away from the bucking gun . Everyone craned forward to see what had occurred . The acrid smoke blew away on the wind . Vasilov was still alive and laughing , lurching to his feet , pointing , laughing and shouting : " Oho ! he shot one of his own sheep ! " Sure enough ! there was a dead sheep , dogs yelping all about  --  Gedesu had shot one of his own sheep ! Everyone laughed heartily . Gedesu opened his good eye and his face flushed with shame . Muttering , he threw down his musket and dismounted , drawing a dagger from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll show you ! " he shouted , puffing and sick at heart . " Somebody bind him up  --  bind him up like a sheep , according to law ! " Nobody moved . " Merghen ! . . . Ghashun ! " Gedesu cried desperately . But Merghen had gone to rescue the dead sheep from the hungry dogs , and Ghashun had slunk off somewhere . At this point , Subutai intervened . He leaped down from his horse and approached Gedesu . " Look here , " he said , " you may kill him or not , as you see fit . But I 'd like to buy the man . How much is he worth ? " It was amazing , the way Gedesu cooled down . He still fingered his knife , reluctantly , like a man set on some spendthrift act worth more to his self-esteem than paltry wealth . But his good eye narrowed , and slowly then he put the dagger back in his belt , saying : " Well ! but that 's another way of looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crowd began to leave , feeling that the incident had come to an undramatic but pleasant end , and only a few remained to watch the bargaining . " I still have a hundred sheep of my own , " said Subutai . " Not enough ! " cried Gedesu warmly . " What about the sheep and cattle you get from Grandma ? " " They 're not mine , nor yours either . They 're father 's . " " But sooner or later ! " said Gedesu . " And he 's old , too , like Grandma . Besides , he ca n't take care of them now . No more can you . . . And Grandma would like to know her animals are being well cared for , I 'm sure , " he whined . " One hundred sheep ! " Subutai said firmly.  |p123Gedesu  , aware that he could get no more from his brother , cast a crafty glance at Beran 's armor , which a few loiterers were fingering with admiration . " Well now , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor of yours " " Sheep 's broiling ! " shouted Merghen , suddenly appearing around a banked pile of snow . " What sheep ? " Gedesu said blankly . " Why , the one you shot ! " cried Merghen , laughing and ducking 110m sight . The odor of broiling sheep , now that Merghen had mentioned it , could be smelt appetizingly in the cold air . " Then it 's a bargain ? " said Gedesu hopefully , feeling that the chainmailwould establish him , somehow , as a man of prowess again . " Come  --  we 'll have broiled sheep on the bargain ! " As a matter of fact , Subutai was glad to make the bargain . The hain-mail , which seemed too heavy and restricting for ordinary wear , e considered principally a trophy  --  and a difficult one to carry around , et that . Too , he enjoyed imagining how Gedesu would struggle and tfT , trying to get the armor down over his folds of fat ; and he smiled nically to think how the arrogant Beran would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now in the hands of a great fat hero ho closed his eyes and turned his head aside , even when shooting a cep ! Gedesu , with a great joint of meat in his hand , began to feel better . ncl at last Ghashun reappeared , seeming dry and bitter as usual , as though nothing had happened . " Faster , you fool Merghen  --  we 're freezing here ! " she shouted at erghen who , with some others , had begun to erect Gedesu 's yurt. d then she turned on Gedesu , screaming , " Stop stuffing your fat ks , you coward , like it was another man 's sheep you were guzzling !  --  . A fine bargainer you are ! What 's the good of that tin stuff ? ink you , can it be milked or sheared or eaten ?

Gedesu stopped gnawing and his face grew red .   " Why , you  --  I could kill you too ! " he sputtered . " Look , do n't think I ca n't see things  --  even with one eye ! You and your rape ! you 're a fine one to talk . . . Why  --  why " Ghashun swung around sharply . " Listen ! " she shouted . " You talk like that and I 'll go take my sheep and cattle and go back to my father  --  see if I do n't ! " Gedesu looked at her in panic . " No , do n't say that ! " he cried . " Stay , I did n't know what I said  --  do n't go ! " Subutai , disgusted with all that was going on , wiped his greasy fingers on his boots and left the fire without saying a word . He gave Beran 's horse to Vasilov , who had sobered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cossack and rounding up the men who were to travel to Zebek 's ulus . Lev Zolotsky remained with Gedesu . He shivered , although he was wearing one of Zebek 's cast-off furs . It was a curious thing , the wind seemed to have let up and the air , what little snow was falling , seemed warmer ; yet he was beginning to feel a chill , nonetheless  --  perhaps because he was bored .. . The brazier , glowing and hissing when snow fell in the coals , rather than warming the air seemed only to make the whole clearing bleak and cold by contrast . Walls of snow were banked around , the carts stood forlornly covered with snow ; even the frame-work of Gedesu 's yurt , already raised nearby , seemed only to emphasize what cold wind still blew , whistling , as it did , through the thin willow-work of the walls . Lev thought of the hot sun in Damascus , lying like a golden blanket of dust on the quiet streets , the sharp black shade so cool under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his eyes and thought , " Ah ! what am I doing here , with nothing to gain ? " But it was a passing nostalgia , and he opened his eyes , clear again to the cold reality of this Torgut camp on the Aral plain , stimulated again by the thought of these people who , with the proper coaxing and guile , might be made to yield something after all . " But never , " he thought , " praise be to God  --  never have I been like yonder fat slob  --  nor his wife , like a greedy bag . . . Ah yes , my rich hypocritical schlemiel  --  it 's either you or myself , and that 's a fact ! " And , hunching his fur up to the tip of his great steaming nose , with his eyes sharp and unblinking again , he said to Gedesu at last :  | " Merciful forgiver of sins , rich friend ! let us go now , as we said , and see to the killing of sheep . " The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Gedesu 's flocks always picking the sheep which seemed to promise the soundest and sweetest meat . " That one yonder , " he would say , " how lush and fat-looking the meat  --  too lazy to calf ! Yes , and poor wool , too  --  you 'll get little use from that one , take my word ! " Gedesu , and Ghashun too , fell under the spell of Lev 's facile manner and words . Ghashun , who would have turned a face hard as stone to one of their neighbors asking the loan of even one single sheep , armed so delighted to grant such a favor , as Lev painted it , to a great lord like Zebek , that she went among the sheep zestfully wielding a knife , herself , creating a havoc of blood and death among the flocks the and Gedesu had acquired by many laborious schemes . And Gedesu , too , felt a pleasure , a sense of power and self-esteem , so that he slaughtered with a bold stroke , as though he were redeeming himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act thus in the morning . Only Merghen , watching the great bald faces of the sheep whiten with the emptying stroke of death , cast from time to time a dubious glance at Gedesu ; but then he winked at Lev and shrugged , and went on with his work . Finally Subutai returned , leading his troop of men . Each man then swung a carcass across his horse , the white fleece of the sheep smeared here and there with blood and clotted with dirty snow , the flesh still warm . . . To one side , Ghashun and Gedesu , tired and drippingwith blood , but vastly polite and happy in some final conversaonwith Lev , now turned to stare at the men while Lev mounted hisare . As Subutai raised an arm and the men started to move , Vasilov , resscd in good boots and a warm cloak , leaned out of his saddle and - kcd back at Ghashun and then at Gedesu . Without a smile , with-t even a twinkle in his eyes , he bleated like a sheep . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and then , turning back to Gedesu , they made the Inc bleating sound themselves . Gedesu shouted at them ; but this ly seemed to scare them off a short distance , where they were quickly ned by others , bleating , a whole chorus of jeering sheep , at the unrtunateGedesu .. .  | " Great friend , " said Lev to Subutai , " such people ! But are they very rich ? " " Yes  --  that 's about all you can say for them ! " said Subutai , who now recalled with shame how readily his brother 's tears had earlier taken him in . He added angrily , " People of wealth have little else . " " But mighty lord , my friend ! " said Lev . " You sound like a man who has no use for riches . " " None . " " That 's so , " Lev said thoughtfully . " What use is gold , I say ? Or even the paper I gave them . . . Does it represent some man 's sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it a sheep , good for wool or food ? It can no longer be worn or eaten . . . It is nothing  --  a mere yellow good-for-nothing  --  a scrap of paper . Ah , my warrior friend , how I envy you ! With one breath you scatter the paper and gold , with your lance you skewer whatever you need or want . I merely garner men 's sweat and call it wealth , though it no longer exists ; whereas you are like death itself , mighty prince , setting things to rights , clearing the way for new life . " Subutai rode along beside Lev , disturbed and silent ; finally , pickinghis way among words like a horse among rocks in the dark , he said : " But I am no mighty prince  --  nor know I much good of death . " " Ah , but death is a necessity , " said Lev musingly , as though speaking to himself . " For if all things continued to live , then I ask  --  how could any find food or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Jehovah , who created life , created He also the famine and flood and disease . Just as the man who writes many promises to pay , only writes new paper to get rid of the old ; just so , many lives have been written like promissory notes . Now mark you well , my young friend  --  would the Lord Jehovah be less wise than a banker ? Just as the banker , every so many years , sends his good agent bankruptcy through the world to tear and destroy his notes , so too , Jehovah discounts the promise to pay with new life issued , new hope  --  and he sends his own good agent , death , to collect the old people like bankrupt notes . " " But then , " said Subutai , " if you think all these things  --  then why is it you deal in paper and gold and all such tricks ? " " Why , young friend , great captain , what a question  --  do n't you know , there are two parts of a man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be  --  but so long as I can shape things to come , perhaps I shall someP127day be free ; for that man , and he alone , is free who can determine how life will be . . . And still again , " he said musingly , " sometimes at night I think , perhaps I do such things merely to keep from becoming bored with life . " " Bored with life ? " said Subutai . " Ah yes , " said Lev , sighing , " you would n't know . " Several hours later , having traveled many miles through the bustling encampment , they entered the outer hoshuns of Zebek 's ulus . Here , Tate in the afternoon as it was , the people had put things so well to order that their tents and yurts seemed to have been established for days . The arrival of Subutai 's troop excited great interest ; and the people stood about , in the snow still lightly falling , staring at the Russianand the Jew riding at Subutai 's side . An old man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group gathered around a nearby cart and came riding importantly toward Subutai . " A good omen , " he croaked , " an excellent omen . . . His eyes have ken flowing and now the flowing has ceased  --  clearly a sign the snow will cease . And there is already a thin ice on his face , clearly a sign the snow will soon freeze . " The people around the cart made way . All breathed heavily , looking down at what had once been Captain Dudin , commander of the Cossack hostages captured near the Volga . 11is body , lying on a coarse matting , looked like a bundle of greenish lumps done up , as it were , with mighty effort ; but actually , the uncuredthongs had been applied rather loosely so that only as they became short and dry , with time , had they shrunk into his flesh . . . " See , like a torn bank-note left on the Tsarina 's door-step , " said Lev t last , in a curious voice , " so that the debtors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . "   THAT NIGHT , AFTER IIE HAD POSTEDhis men in a sentry line to the southeast of Zebek 's ulus , Subutai , utterly exhausted , lay down to sleep for a while . Here on the Aral plain there were few trees , and so there were no great crackling fires , as at Koulagina . Subutai drew his long coat tightly about himself and lay down to sleep under a snow-bank . " Wake me at moonrise , " he said to Vasilov . While Subutai slept , the Cossack paced up and down in the soft dark snow . Now that he was cold sober again , Vasilov felt a great disgust for himself . And he felt sad , too , thinking how his life had cost Subutai the last of his sheep . He walked over to where his friend was sleeping , breathing unevenly as he slept in the cold shadow of the snow-bank . Vasilov removed his new sheep-skin cloak and threw it over the sleeper , and then he swung his arms to keep warm when he paced back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of Subutai . What a true friend the Torgut was ! he thought . He recalled the day they first met , a spring day .. . Spring had been late in coming , that year , the horde was still in winter quarters . Armed with a sling-shot Vasilov was exploring the high rocky bank of the Volga north of Jevat , looking for birds . Suddenlyhe saw a Torgut boy swimming the Volga with his pony , coming through the shimmering waves of the spring flood-water . Vasilov crouched down in the bushes and sighted his sling-shot with excitement . Was n't it all right to kill a Torgut ? They were something like animals , were n't they  --  birds , rabbits , and the like ? But as the boy and his pony scrambled out of the water , sparkling wet in the spring sun , Vasilov could hear the boy singing  --  fragmentsp129of a tune sad but lightly sung . . . And Vasilov , on the verge of letting a sharp stone fly straight at the boy 's eye , for some reason changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pony 's left forefoot . The pony stumbled , scrambling for footing among the slippery pebbles , and seemed to bruise his knee . The Torgut boy broke off his singing and glanced upward quickly , as though he could see where Vasilov was crouching behind a bush . Then with a fearless air of disdain  --  which he was far from feeling , as he told Vasilov much later - the boy turned tenderly to his frightened pony . Now Vasilov was aware of a curious feeling of guilt and remorse , . ind nakedness  --  as though his every act were being watched by some ( ) Id-faced judge . He furtively hid his sling-shot in the bushes , and t hen he stood up , further impelled by the feeling that he had already been seen . Assuming a bland air of pre-occupation , as though he had no idea anyone else was near , Vasilov went sliding and jumping down the rocky bank to the pebbled shore . Suddenly he turned , almost face to face with the Torgut boy , with a startled expression in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , " What a start you gave me  --  t did n't know anyone was here ! " And Vasilov then bent solicitously , whistling between his teeth , feeling the pony 's foreleg in a professional manner copied from soldiers at the fort .. . That had been the beginning of their friendship . Once they explored Sarepta together . They spent two days at the autumn fair , running errands for merchants , sleeping in the shadow of a booth at night . Their reward was some tobacco , which Vasilov had seen men chew occasionally , instead of using a pipe . He and Suhutai , misunderstanding the process , not only chewed but swallowedc stuff , for a time boasting and pretending to one another that theyere enjoying the stature and trick of manhood thereby . But after a time they became so desperately ill that they could do nothing but lie on their bellies and glare at one another 's greenish complexion , thinking , " Ah , but he looks much worse than I ! " Sometimes in winter , when Subutai 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet and fish through holes cut in the Ice . Each learned something of the language , the mode of life , the oulles and superstitions of the other 's people . . . And once , wheny were full-grown boys , they had spent a whole two weeks togetherthe winter , camping out and trapping for marten.  | All these things , Vasilov recalled . In the dark nearby , some cattle and sheep were stirring uneasily ; a thin snow was still falling , but it seemed windless and warmer . How close , Vasilov thought , he and Subutai had been  --  yet how far apart , really , they seemed these days ! To the Cossack , Subutai and his people seemed changed somehow ; they seemed like people walking in sleep , seeing and hearing things like ghosts  --  nothing seemed real . . . He shuddered to recall Captain Dudin , a bundle of green lumps in a cart , the still-living remains of a being that had once bellowedand cracked a whip . How far away , the Volga , the Fort Jenat ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and what could they possibly gain , running away , wandering all over the strange face of the earth ? And what of himself  --  what had he in common , really , with Subutai and his people ? Likely as not he would get Subutai in deeper trouble , as time went on . If he could escape , if he could return to the Volga , somehow , then he might hide in the woods , find Pugatchev , hide under the Magyar woman 's floor  --  and then some night ! He tried to peer through the cool and isolating flakes of snow , in the dark , to the southwest . Out there , beyond , there were only a few sentries  --  and then , freedom ! Nearby were the strange people , sleeping in the dark night , the sheep brushing like ghosts against his legs when he paced too far to the north .. . Ah , thought Vasilov uneasily , but his place was with Subutai  --  he could n't flee without leave , it was up to his friend , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad when , through a hole in the clouds , the waning moon could at last be seen like a silver sickle gleaming in mountainousbanks of snow , up there . . . First he removed his coat from Subutai and then he woke him , saying : " The moon 's been up a little , but only now it came through the clouds . " Together , he and Subutai rode away from the slumbering camp and out to the end of the sentry line . It was quiet . Now and then wolves could be heard , far distant . The unbroken snow became more luminous as the moon rose . The snow , still falling , was thin and fine , like mist . Here on the barrens , the wind had almost ceased ; but far overhead the clouds were blown and tattered , moving at great speed , as though pursued by a mighty wind from the moon . Finally Subutai said :   " The snow is too deep , too soft . " " For what ? " " For travel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vasilov , ingenuously . Subutai smiled . " How I 'd like to trap with you once more , my Russian brother , " he said . " Those were good times . Remember when we caught a wild boar in the snare ? " " How he slobbered and fought ! " " Yes , but you were the bold one , though ! " said Subutai . " Putting your arm down his throat , when we were n't yet sure he was dead ! " " But my heart was pounding , I 'll tell you ! " said Vasilov , laughing . " Nobody but kids would do a thing like that . . . But remember the way you showed me how Grandma cooked the marmot  --  buried with hot stones in his stomach and a fire above ? " " Yes , she was a great one , " Subutai said . " Now she 's dead . " " All must die sometime , Subutai my brother . " " Yes , " said Subutai sighing , " ah well . . . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate ways . " " I 've given you great trouble  --  my life has cost you many sheep " I give it all back to you gladly , just so you go in safety . " " But the snow is too soft , too deep . " " In a few days it will freeze . . . You saw what has come of your captain ? " " No great loss ! " Vasilov said , gruffly concealing his emotion . " Such fellows make life unpleasant  --  such men , perhaps , are the reason your people go one way , and mine another  --  " " No people are more kindly than mine , but now evil things have me among us , " said Subutai . " It is the will of God . " " Yes , perhaps it 's the will of God . " " I saw people looking at you , Vasilov  --  many think you should lie a cart like your captain , Dudin . " " I know , little Subutai , " said Vasilov , sighing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " But for a day or two , the weather remained uncertain , warm and misting . Then came several days of clear warmth , during which the snow melted a little , settled and packed more solidly on the Aral steppe . And after this , the wind blew again , a cold rain fell that sleeted and crusted the snow . Only on the sixth day did the weather turn clear and cold . During this time , Subutai learned what he could of the mood and condition of Zebek 's people , of their herds and flocks , and of the extent of Zebek 's personal wealth  --  which had increased under Lev 's guidance and again more recently , since , because of the five hundred dead sheep he personally took of the thousand received from Gedesu to provision Subutai 's men , he had five hundred the less to slaughter of his own flock . And during this time , too , Subutai tried not to think of Cedarchabwith her eyes downcast and Zebek holding her arm  --  a thought which occurred frequently , nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete poverty and of Zebek 's princely rank . During these six days and nights while Subutai and his men patrolled the southeastern waste-lands , only one incident occurred worth reporting . In the early dusk of the fifth day a small band of Kara-Kalpaks suddenlyappeared , not far from where Subutai was riding with Vasilov . The Kara-Kalpaks were large , soft fellows , good herdsmen but not warlike ; they were allies of the Kirghiz of the Little Horde , however , and had probably been requested by Nurali 's messengers to reconnoiter on this side of the Mugadir hills . They had been riding in the frozen bed of one of the few water-courses on the Aral plain , and , coming suddenly up the low bank , saw only Subutai and Vasilov at first . After a brief consultation among themselves , they fanned out and started galloping toward the two men , brandishing their spears in a halfheartedway . But when Subutai , shouting fiercely and riding straight toward them , was suddenly joined by a few other Torguts who were patrolling nearby , the Kara-Kalpaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Subutai and his men turned back , laughing at the flight of their enemies . And on the way back to the sentry line Subutai , winking at Vasilov , said : " When Kara-Kalpaks go riding , the snow must be fine enough for even a woman to travel . " It was on the next day , the sixth day , that Zebek , who had returned from Ubasha 's ulus , summoned Subutai to his yurt . " Great captain , young sir , " said Lev , who brought the message , " the Prince Zebek would like a personal report of the Kara-Kalpaks . " Subutai followed Lev , feeling some misgivings . He had rarely seen Zebek at close hand , and had never really talked with him . But he knew much regarding the khan 's cousin , from Batu and Norbo and'I ' 1IE TORGUTS 133the younger warriors , and from Temuru , too ; and none of the things Subutai knew of the prince made him feel less worried . Zebek and Ubasha were descended from brothers , Chakdur-shap and Gund-shep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ayouka 's death , these sons , both headstrong men , had been set aside in favor of the khan 's weakest son , Cheren Donduk , under whose rule the authority of the khan was lessened and the Torgut people became vassals of the Russian tsars . When Cheren Donduk died , the son of his eldest brother became khan , a man named Donduk Ombo . Dunduk Ombo was a strong khan , but not very wise , and his son Galdan Norbo rebelledagainst him . Galdan Norbo was driven into exile by his father , to Kazan , where his son Zebek-Dordzhi was born and where he himselfdied among the Russians , cursing his own people . When Donduk Ombo died , the young Prince Zebek came back among the Torguts , claiming to be the rightful khan , since he was ( Irscended from Ayouka 's eldest son . But the people had already chosen Donduk Taisha , son of Ayouka 's second son , Chakdur-shap . And once again , when Donduk Taisha died , Zebek claimed to be khan . He went among the Torguts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land among them , as the boyars had done with the Russian people 's land . But the people chose Ubasha , thedung son of Donduk Taisha . Zebek fomented a plot against young Uhasha , but when this was discovered he fled to Tcherkask . Safeong the Russians , he claimed that the Torgut friends of Ubasha ad tried to assassinate him , Zebek , the rightful khan of the people. c Tsarina had already approved the election of Ubasha ; but she detieda Torgut Council , the Sarga , of which Zebek would be presint , and which would further undermine the khan 's power . Underbek 's urging , too , the Tsarina ceased making a gift of two thousandks of flour and two thousand golden coins each year to the Torgutople ; and instead , she sent one hundred coins a year to each membert the Sarga .. . Thus , Subutai knew , had been the story of Zebek and his struggle for power , until now . In recent years , Zebek had become far more subtle , no longer appearing to deny Ubasha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to demanding more power for the Chief Lama of the Torguts , Loosang , claiming that Ubasha was too tolerant of Shamanist heresies and of the Christian encroachment among their people . Too , he maintained that the Torgut lands should be divided among individuals , and he supported various other measures which he called reforms . Only in the last year , when he realized that the Tsarina 's intention was to weaken not only Ubasha but himself , he had taken to militant speeches , strong arguments , for the return of the Torguts to their old home , Djungaria , now unpeopled . In short , he seemed to blow with the wind  --  " but always on his own axle , " as Temuru once said . But from the first moment when the great migrationseemed a certainty , Zebek had never once mentioned Djungaria as a goal ; and he seemed , really , like Ubasha , in such a time of hardship , to desire only the quickest road to well-being for his people . Subutai knew , too , the stories about Zebek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the animals and wealth inherited from his grandfather , the Donduk Ombo , by inattention and by gamblingin the Russian towns  --  and how he was reputed to have stayed up six and eight nights in a row , with his Russian friends , drinking , gambling , and enjoying their women ; until at thirty-five , although his face was still attractive , he looked dissolute and gaunt-souled , and had great difficulty sleeping at night .. . Such , then , was the man Subutai now went uneasily to meet . Zebek 's yurt , contrary to the rumors of his poverty , was richly furnished . The interior walls were hung with silken tapestries , and there were several Russian beds along the walls . The thing that most struck Subutai , entering clumsily and looking around , was that Zebek , the champion of the church , had no Buddhist altar where it should have been , opposite the door . There was a fine glowing fire in the brazier . And Zebek , with his feet covered by a pile of red Turkey rugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged with a quill . After he had kept Subutai waiting a short time , Zebek raised his head and passed a hand over his face in a weary gesture . In the resultantinterview , his manner with Subutai was pleasant , but bored and patronizing . He asked the young warrior many questions , about the Kara-Kalpaks and about his own men . And then he said : " But tell me , captain  --  is n't it true , the Kara-Kalpaks are a bunch of old women ? " " By themselves , yes , because they do n't like to fight , " said Subutai . " But not when the Kirghiz stand back of them with lances and guns . " Zebek smiled up at the young fellow who stood awkwardly on thefar side of his French desk . How could he ever have thought suspi-P135ciously of such a mere boy ? Zebek raised a strong brown hand , not aged like his face , and said : " Ah well , but the Princess Cedar-chab tells me you are the greatest fighter of all our young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by yourself , I 'll wager ! " Subutai flushed and shuffled his feet , stammering : " Well , but  --  but the Princess  --  but I have n't fought yet , really  --  " " Nonsense , " said Zebek with a weary smile , " Reran is a fine fighter ... But now , captain  --  regarding these cowardly Kara-Kalpaks . " He went on to point out that little was to be feared from such a source ; and he requested Subutai not to alarm Ubasha unduly , when the troops returned to their own ulus within a day or two , with any frightening stories about the really un-warlike peoples who might try to hinder the Torgut 's entry into Asia . " I suppose you all know , we plan to travel still eastward from here ? " Zebek said . Subutai not only had heard this rumor himself , but it seemed to have spread generally even among the people of Zebek 's ulus . " Yes , it 's rather well-known we go on , " he said . " Ah ! and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subutai said , feeling uneasy again , " some people complain , - but most think it 's a good thing , since there seems little fodder here for even such animals as are left . " " Good , " said Zebek , pointing his quill at Subutai , " good ! " For a time he tapped on the desk with the quill but finally he said , Mill pleasantly : " Now captain  --  I understand you have a Cossack whom you let ride  --  round free as one of your own men . " Subutai wet his lips and said : " But " " It would be a matter of great significance to our people , " Zebek did firmly , " if he should get loose . Supposing he should escapebutorally , he 'd first of all seek the Cossack troops , and he 'd spread word ut how drastically we 've been forced to deal with Dudin and the t . This would make any chance of our return to the Volga , captain , t of the question . " " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I thought e had decided  --  " " The council has decided , captain , " said Zebek , smiling and looking frankly at Subutai . " What about yourself ? Do you want to return ? " " Never ! " said Subutai . " Ah well , " said Zebek , who had been sitting forward , now sinking back in his French chair . " But you understand  --  I must ask you to assume full responsibility in this matter . You understand what I say , captain ? " Thus the interview closed ; and Subutai , unable to answer , unable to put his finger on what he intuitively felt to be some hidden trick of Zebek 's , blushed and mumbled something in reply , and was dismissed . Only later , thinking over what had been said , like a man going back over the snow to find where he had lost his way , Subutai discoveredthat Zebek had somehow put him in the position of determining the direction the horde might take . Clearly enough , he saw that Zebek wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ubashawhosevacillating nature Subutai had vaguely come to realize  --  might raise no further doubts regarding a decision the Sarga had already made . Yes , thought Subutai , this must have been the whole meaning and purpose of the interview  --  and as such , it was perhaps a good thing to let Vasilov go . Even from the viewpoint of the people it would be a good thing  --  making them act on a decision , instead of allowing them to dissent and argue again . For Subutai had come to feel strongly that the Torguts must never return  --  that the good of his people lay somewhere else , beyond , over the Mugadir , somewhere in Asia . The only thing  --  still puzzling him , even when he had decided that in freeing Vasilov he should be acting in the mutual interest of both friend and people  --  the one small irritating thought was that in so doing , now that he had talked with Zebek , and even though it might be a doubly good thing , he , Subutai , would somehow become an accompliceof Zebek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a cold , clear night  --  moonless , for the new moon of ChaganSarawas only a day away  --  quiet , windless , and intensely cold . The stars glittered , the frozen snow sparkled like silver . Vasilov and Subutai embraced , neither one of them able to say a word . The Torgut had given Beran 's horse to his Cossack friend as P137dark cold wilderness , they took leave of one another forever , as though the Ural divide had already risen between them . Only a short distance to the east lay the vast strange regions of Asia ; and to the west , over snow now frozen so solid a horse could travel it like a rock , were the Caspian outposts of Russia and Europe .. . Sadly Subutai watched his friend ride away , dwindle in size , merely a black speck far on the dim glimmering snow . Now Subutai felt alone , desperately alone for a time , committed to loneliness  --  for all the familiar things of his youth were now gone , the last traces of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gone somehow for good with Vasilov . Gone too , with Grandma , was the whole intimate paraphernalia of his earlier life , yurts , house altars , a brazier of coals and a warm dry bed , even the world of cattle and sheep . In that moment , Subutai felt done forever with all such things , committed to a new way of life  --  the only way a man could follow , now , the lonely vigil and proud melancholy of a warrior . Even though some might try holding to the old domestic ways of life  --  treating as merely an unseasonal migration what was now , really , to become an act of legendary sweep  --  this was no longer possible for Subutai ; and he sat his white horse in the dark , lonely and apart among his own people . P138DURING THESE SIX DAYS , THEslaughter of animals had been carried out all through the horde , and preparations had already been started for Chagan-Sara , the Feast of the White Month , the New Year 's moon . In all the hoshuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughtered cattle and sheep had been frozen , salted , and dried in the cold wind . Women smoked the cattle hides until they became translucent as horn . Skins were tanned with a mixture of salt and a residue of milk curds left after arrack was made , sometimes with a mixture of salt and ashes . The dressed skins were rubbed with putrid livers from the slaughtered sheep , mixed with milk and sour cream . The hides were made into , or saved to be made into , leather straps and boots , bottles , long whips for tending sheep , jars , and many new shields and breast-plates . Sheepskins were cured , and dressed , and made ready for wear . From the poorer wool , new felts were made . The wool was first wetted and beaten with sticks . Women 's hands became raw , cracked and chill-blained , from boiling snow for water and working the wet wool . Then the felts were pressed dry as possible and tied to ponies ' tails , letting the ponies drag them across the snow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hair were gathered and made into ropes . In this time , too , men saw to their weapons and armor . Among the people there was much speculation , and some complaint , regarding the order to kill half their animals . A rumor spread among the hoshuns that the council had decided to cross the Mugadir into Asia , rather than to remain here and seek terms with the Tsarina . Certain people said :  | " It 's as plain as the nose on your face , we 're going a long way  --  maybe all the way to Djungaria . Otherwise , it would be silly to slaughter our animals , is n't it so ? " " Not Djungaria , " others said wisely . " We 're going to the land of the Turgai , near Lake Chalkhar . " " Nonsense , " still others insisted , " we 're staying right here . I have it on good authority  --  it 's all a matter of poor forage , and saving the best of our herds . " " Why , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to widen camp , not to slaughter . No , it 's quite plain  --  we 're just waiting for Chagan-Sara , and then we 're moving again . " The argument waged back and forth . Some people insisted that , regardless of the outcome , it was a good thing to destroy the poorest of their herds and flocks , anyway . Such people argued that animals , like men , became weak and soft when good times lasted too long ; these were the same people who believed that death , war , and pestilence were benevolent acts of god to keep people strong and fit . Such people , however , were only a few . Most of the Torguts slaughtered their animals with misgivings , and even with sorrow . They had worked ! ird to improve and increase their cattle and sheep , and it seemed wanton to kill on such a large scale , no matter what the cause . And even when the rumor of further migration became generally accepted among the people , nonetheless most of them grumbled : " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've come , still , tan there be no forage ? We 've done pretty well so far " Yes , by feeding the animals all of last summer 's forage we brought along ! " some people pointed out . " Perhaps , " admitted the others . " But again , animals travel more easily on their own feet , is n't it so ? " " The slower , then . This way , we 'll be able to travel so fast the Russians will never find us . " And still others , looking at the huge stacks of carcasses all about , said with gloomy humor : " Well , no matter what comes , at least we sha n't want for food ! " During these days , too , there was much sickness among the people , and the lamas and the shamans were kept busy . The shamans mastered human aches and diseases by incantation ; it remedies appealed , somehow , to the more superstitious and norant among the people . P140The lamas pretended to smile tolerantly at such unscientific therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather capriciously allowed the shamans as many cures as themselves . The lamas ' principal specific was gin-seng , " the little root in the shape of a man , " a remedy whereby all the ills common to man were combated . But their supply of gin-seng and various herbs came from Tibet , where all things were endowed with special virtue ; and no caravan had arrived from the Holy Land for several years . The lack of such remedies was not a real obstacle , however , since the actual presence of god was not essential to do his work  --  his name being quite enough , axiomatically . So the lamas , for a proper fee , scribbled recipes in Tibetan script on little papers , made like wafers from crushed corn-stalks and sheep 's hair ; and they solemnly fed these transsubstantiationsof god 's body and wisdom to their devout and hopefulpatients . Thus the lamas had the advantage , among such wiser and less superstitious people ; but they had little or no success among the animals . For instance the camels , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fierce ill-humor of the ignorant when such wafers and pellets of paper were offered them . Their feet were sore from stones under the snow and jagged ice ; some had mange , their hides festering with foul-smelling wounds . They groaned and spit , and shied irritably away from the lamas . The shamans , who relied on herbs and medicaments of the ordinary variety , as well as on incantations more legendary than the days of Genghis Khan , achieved many cures among the animals . The camels submitted , although with ill grace , to such remedies as goatbrothfor mange , tobacco rubbed astringently on their wounds , tamariskleaves for colds . They even let themselves be thrown on their sides in the snow while the shamans , placing strips of leather over their sore feet , pierced the callosities of their hooves with thongs to bind the leather shoes in place . This success of the shamans among the animals was very cleverly explained by the lamas . The shamans , they said , were priests of a god who sat lower in the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man and animal , there were many ranks and grades of incarnation . It was natural , therefore , that the shamans should achieve lucky cures with ordinary remedies , among the animals and the lowerP141incarnations of men . But for cures among the higher incarnations , only the supreme wisdom of the lamas would suffice . The lamas were very clever in such metaphysical debates . Sometimesthe shamans , resenting the high fees the lamas received for their paper pills inscribed with Tibetan words , would callously suggest that a translation of these foreign words might be well  --  to allow people , so to speak , to get hold of god with a more everyday comprehension . The lamas invariably replied that , even if they themselves were unable to say what the curious words meant , surely their meaning was known to god and would , accordingly , have the proper effect . In spite of these occasional conflicts , the two priesthoods impinged only slightly on one another 's sphere of influence . Generally speaking , the lamas attended the rich , gaining large fees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor , gained many small fees and a close bond with the majority of the people . Thus the good work , sacred and secular , continued among all classes of men and animals during this busy time . People like Gedesu and Ghashun were far from idle these days . " Look here , " Gedesu said pettishly one time to Merghen , " people who think I have an easy time just because I 'm successful  --  they 're fools . I work fifty times as hard  --  and then , all the things I have to worry about ! " Merghen shrugged . " Perhaps your life would n't be so hard , " he said cynically , " if you had n't taken sheep , one way and another , from nearly every man ht sight . " " The very fact that you work for me , " said Gedesu , after a moment 's reflection , " proves I 'm better fitted to own your flock than you are . " " You 're a liar , a skin-flint , a man without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and an old woman , too  --  since you have n't the ; tits of a man . " This sort of thing exasperated Gedesu . Among his neighbors , 1 more and more people were beginning to regard him with mockery instead of respect , with hatred instead of envy . " To show them my true nature , " he thought irritably , " what must I do ? " He felt that an injustice was being done him , blindly , since his neighbors failed to see that his wealth was really a burden he dutifully bore , or that his cowardice , as they called it , really came from compassionand forgiveness . " Come , " he thought angrily , " I ca n't waste time on such things . There 's the matter of all these animals . . . Let them know , at least , I 'm a godly man . " Adopting a device of the lamas , Gedesu unearthed a bone rosary , to demonstrate his godliness and facilitate his counting of animals at the same time . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing him thus preoccupied with his beads amid the slaughter and dressing of meat . " Oh , " said other folks  --  the kind always ready to impute the worst intention to devout acts of the rich  --  " oh , he 's just counting how many sheep he lost by sleeping too soundly at night . " Gedesu was surprised to learn the full extent of his cattle and sheep . Eight thousand two hundred and forty sheep  --  who could have guessed ? The eight thousand , perhaps  --  but surely not the two hundred and forty ! The idea of slaughtering less than half of his animals occurred to Gedesu . But Ubasha , suspecting that some people might think of such a thing , sent agents all through his ulus to see that the wealthy took no such advantage . At night , Gedesu brooded uncomfortably , wishing that the Jew , Lev Zolotsky , were here to counsel him . . . How could he and Ghashun eat four thousand one hundred and twenty sheep ? And even granting that such feats of gluttony might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things  --  like a man eating half his body with no perceptible gain ! ... Finally , thinking of his neighbors , Gedesu concocted a scheme . To transport such a cargo of meat , he would need a great many carts . He rode through his neighbors ' hoshuns casually , yet eyeing their carts and equipment and flocks with a practiced eye . Here and there he noted carts in good condition , various articles of value , casting up quickly in his mind their worth in sheep . . . He also noted that some people , people with small flocks , had n't carried out the decreed slaughter , it seemed . This made him genuinely angry , as though he himself had been cheated , somehow . " So that 's what we 've come to ! " he said bitterly . " **25;5997;TOOLONG a man , just because he 's been more careful and successful than others ! " " But if we destroy half our flocks , " these people said , " then we 'll not have enough for milk and wool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , a man might as well kill all  --  for flocks ca n't be renewed from half of nothing ! " " Ah , what a pity ! " Gedesu now said , assuming a pious expression . " Surely , there 's truth in such a complaint . . . How many sheep did you say , neighbor , one hundred ? What would you say , " he went on , in a confiding whisper , " to one hundred of my sheep ? Then you 'd have an equal number of live and dead , and nobody could tell ! " " Why , such a thing would be fine indeed ! Look , Aunt Sarkhulookat this  --  here 's our good neighbor Gedesu , offering us some of his slaughtered sheep ! " " I try to do good , " Gedesu said , " in my own way . " " What does he want here ? " Sarkhu said suspiciously . " He 'll wring us dry of everything we own . " " Go away , Sarkhu  --  get back to your work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gedesu 's neighbor said . " I know it cost you a pretty penny to get rid of the khan 's agent ! " Sarkhu cried sharply . " This one will milk you dry as an old cow , I warn ! " When Aunt Sarkhu had gone , Gedesu said softly : " Why neighbor , all I 'd like in return is yonder cart and a few little things  --  perhaps that copper pot , a few coins if you have any , things of little or no use to you . " " It 's a bargain , then , certainly it is ! What do women know of such things ? " the neighbor cried . " Here , Sarkhu ! Pichak ! Clear this rubbish from yonder cart ! Gedesu our good neighbor takes it home ... " But when the cart had been drawn through the clearings and corridorsof snow to Gedesu 's hoshun and one hundred dead sheep had peen stacked rigid as stone to one side , the man scratched his head and said : " Good neighbor Gedesu , how do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gedesu said . He seemed to ponder the problem cply  --  while his neighbor , to convince himself that the bargain was vcrtheless good , kept slapping the frozen meat and exclaiming over its solidity . Finally Gedesu said , " Well , I 'll tell you . Supposing I carry your sheep in my cart . " " Why , such a thing would be fine indeed ! " " Yet in so doing , " Gedesu reflected , " there will be no room for my own carcasses . " " Ah , that 's bad . " " And in addition , there 'll be the feeding of the oxen , the care , the wear on the cart " " That 's not right , that 's not a good bargain for you . " " But how would it be , " said Gedesu , squinting with his good eye , " how would it do if , for conveying your meat , neighbor , I took a small amount for myself  --  say , half ? " " Fifty , you say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves me fifty , is n't it so ? " " And someone to drive the cart , too , " Gedesu added quickly . " It 's a small fee , considered every which-way . . . After all , neighbor , you had no meat to start with , at all , and now you have fifty . " " That 's true  --  it 's like you 've given me fifty , in a way of speaking . Is n't it so ? " Thus , in devious ways , Gedesu managed to turn a large portion of his slaughtered sheep into tangible and more permanent forms of wealth  --  carts , pots , silver and gold ornaments , a few pieces of Chinese jade , Russian coins , including silver and some golden roubles as well as copper money  --  while , at the same time , he managed to regain more than half of his bartered sheep as a fee for the use of his carts . These successes restored his self-esteem , but they neither won the respect of his neighbors nor solved the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's animals , Tenek capered about like a madman , brandishing an ax , frothing at the lips , shouting wild threats at Gedesu . And the people became more angry than ever at his cleverness ; now they had time again , like lazy goodfor-nothings , to send their children bleating like sheep at Gedesu  --  as though he were some kind of a clown , a fat fool of a man ! . . . Gedesu turned these matters over and over again in his mind , but he could find no solution . On the day before Chagan-Sara , however , a chance came to settle both problems at once . A little girl , sent by her own grandmother , an old friend of Grandma 's , brought a small offering of butter to the cairn of snow-P145blocks Temuru had ordered built over the frozen body where the tent had been . Tenek , not seeming to mind the cold , was lying there with some of Grandma 's dogs . He leaped to his feet and began thrashing the air with his ax , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl dropped the butter-god , the dogs licked it up . The ax struck her arm , a glancing blow which grazed the skin and made it bleed . She ran home shrieking .. . There was considerable talk of what should be done . Gedesu was quite outspoken . " According to our law , " he said , " a madman is an outcast and may be killed on sight . Such a man is Tenek . " Others were reluctant to take such drastic action in the case of the poor hump-back . It was true , they agreed , something had to be clone . But they shook their heads dolefully , recalling how harmless Tenek had always been . Still others had superstitious scruples , feeling that bad luck would come from any hostile act toward a man whose deformed body obviously housed such demons . All seemed inclined , as though by common agreement , to leave the matter to Gedesu . " After all , he was your grandmother 's man , " they said , " it 's your grandmother 's tomb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to polish the silver mountings . " Subutai will be angry , " said Ghashun . Gedesu sputtered . " Since when am I afraid of Subutai ? " he said . " This is according to law . The others are afraid  --  not I ! " He laid the musket aside and stirred up the argol coals in the brazier . Then he took Beran 's chain-mail armor from the top of a chest , and tried to get it over his head . He managed to tear and force the armor part way down over his flesh , and there it stuck . Ghashun burst out laughing , bitterly . " What a sight ! " she said . " If Subutai could only see you now ! " Puffing and red in the face , he managed to pull the armor back over his head again . With his head bent , he began picking at some of the silver links with a knife , trying to split the armor down the back . " Yes , I see the whole thing , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see what you mean . You had to take his friend , you could n't get him to do it , eh ? No wonder , with your face like a goat 's behind ! "  | " Shut up , I warn you ! " cried Ghashun , trembling . Gedesu continued to probe with his knife . " Aha , " he said , knowingly , " do n't think I 'm not right ! Look at your face  --  red as raw leather " I warned you ! " shrieked Ghashun , springing toward his gun . But Gedesu , moving swiftly for a man of such bulk , knocked her against the wall of the yurt . She lay there sobbing . He returned to his place , sitting on the musket and continuing to pick the links of the armor apart . She began to mutter . " Ah god , " she said , " I wear out my fingers , my face , grubbing for sheep and cattle  --  no wonder I look as I do . And then he says this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own empty eye ? his finger , cut from his hand ? Yet my face , the lines , the hardness , the things gone from it , these things , too , have earned wealth When she talked like this , it was impossible for Gedesu to remain angry with her . He stood up ; he had managed to open the chainmaildown the back , and now he began forcing it over his head again . When he thought about how she might return to her father with some of their sheep , Gedesu felt a great compassion for his wife . " Come , pretty Ghashun , " he wanted to say , " with a face like the sun or stars , with a face like a soft beautiful white mare ! " He picked up the Persian helmet and pressed it down on his head . How warlike he felt , how strong ! He reached for the silver musket , suffering a little difficulty in bending , and turned to Ghashun . " My dear wife , " he finally said , his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " Let us forget about Subutai . . . The question is Tenek . In addition to being mad , he has stolen our grandmother 's wealth . Someone must deal firmly with such a man . " She sniffled and said : " But it 's bad luck  --  it 's bad luck to kill a hunch-back Gedesu shouldered the musket bravely . " Gedesu will do a man 's duty , " he said , " good luck or bad . " With these words , he marched from the yurt . Outside , it was already dark . A few children whom he passed scampered away with shrieks of fright . Indeed , Gedesu was a fearsomeapparition , clad in star-lit armor , vapor curling out from under his metal casque , shouldering a silver-mounted musket . He strode on , P147mindless of shrieks and laughter . It was a cold night , the snow crunched and creaked underfoot . The pleasant bustle of Chagan-Sara Eve , reassuringly , was all about . The stars were bright . Tenek lay with the dogs on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his hand , and he seemed to sleep .. . The sound of the musket  --  with the muzzle pressed into Tenek 's hack , just below the hump  --  was less frightening than Gedesu had xpected . Perhaps it was the armor , the casque on his head , that tiered the sound . But the frightening thing was , the cairn caved incnek'sbody tumbled from sight . Gedesu crept off a short distance . All was quiet , dogs barked mewhere . Yet now that the act was done , now that nobody came tinning to compliment him on a brave act well done , Gedesu felt ss certain and easy than ever . Looking back at the broken cairn , e began to shiver like a cold man , he slunk deeper among the sheep . he cold and remorseless eyes of Grandma , the bright wild hatred of crick 's eyes , circled him in the dark . Casual , distant sounds became r Gedesu the ghostly portents of revenge for his act of bravado . vcrywhere , there seemed whispers and murmurings in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , cold ud tremulous in the silver armor . All about him , the sheep bleated , ogs howled in the starlight , the wind made a hollow sound blowing vcr the broken tomb of snow .. . Chapter FourteenCHAGAN-SARA ! WHAT HAPPY MEMoriesthe festival recalled to Subutai  --  everywhere , the happy bustling , the sound of music , the smell of good things cooking ! But it was different now , without Grandma . Returning from Zebek 's ulus , Subutai rode for many miles through the corridors and clearings of Torgut hoshuns spread over the Aral plain like a vast and labyrinthine city . A gay , excited hum rose frorii the tents and yurts and the hoshun squares where people were already gathering around great crackling fires . Overhead the sky was glazed with nightfall and stars  --  like a festival cake , Grandma used to say .. . Subutai felt more somber and lonely than ever . Now and then he passed a white temple yurt . One of them , the door open , was filled with people . Subutai paused , looking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braziers were burning and warming the air drawn through the opening ; smoke and the warm sour air from the depths of the yurt rose through a ventilator cowl of iron in the roof . It was a large yurt , one of the more important temples , and the interior walls were hung with colored scrolls and tapestries in honor of the occasion . Subutai could see the altar , over the heads of people  --  the gods on the top level , the offerings on the lower dais . Among the offerings were those marvelously sculptured flowers , principally lotus blossoms , which Subutai had always admired . One thing that he could dimly recall from his brother Gedesu 's youth  --  before Gedesu became greedy , when he was studying for the priesthood ; before Gedesu was told he could never become a lama unless he brought two thousand sheep into the church  --  was the fascinating skill with which Gedesu had been able to fashion such flowers and things from butter . But butter was scarce , now , and so most of the offerings were modeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lack of cool fresh water . Subutai stared at the altar , the long slender columns and the delicate lace-like tapestry of stuccoed brick , colored and fragile as a mirage in the shimmering sky of spring . Many lamp bowls were burning , with wicks that sputtered and then burned clear , some with blue and greenish and some with pure white fire . There were two lamas at the altar , chanting and praying , dressed in long scarlet robes , with yellow hoods surmounted by mitres . To one side , priests of the second and third class were seated on a low platform , making a music that was sweet and melancholy , sometimes disharmonic , always hypnotic . On this festal occasion , all the instrueatswere in use  --  timbrels , the Chinese gongs and cymbals made f copper and brass , horns made of shells from the sea , copper flageolets , rums , and two long telescopic horns which had to be supported onops . The orchestral priests wore dresses of many bright colors , ' chly brocaded with silver and gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things  --  the sweet and acrid incense , the glitter and the calth , the music  --  had formerly entranced Subutai . But tonight all emed meaningless , alien to the time and place . Most of the woriperslooked poor , cold and homeless in the rich temple yurt , facing New Year with dwindling hope . But perhaps , thought Subutai , was really his weariness , the monotony of sentry duty , the loss of randma and Vasilov , a personal ill-humor , that made him feel so cak , so dull with disinterest . . . Oppressed by loneliness and disenantment , he turned away at last from the temple yurt . He collided with Bagha the shaman . " What  --  you here ? " said Bagha . " But why so pensive and sad ? " Subutai shrugged . " I do n't know  --  perhaps they ought to be thinking of more serious lugs , " he said , " such as , for instance , what lies beyond the Mugadir . " " Well , I 'll tell you , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's camel and I get a sheep 's tail ; I cure Yelden 's wife of the vils , and I get a bowl of broth and What a great magical man you I ' " he mimicked . " But then look  --  what do people do ? They flock the temples like sheep , and they bring butter and rich things , and y stare at the priests ' horns as though music were some kind of a re-all ; and they fasten their eyes on the lamas ' behinds as though den eggs were going to drop into their hands any minute .. .   " Look here , Subutai . One of the Yellow-Hats wanted to make a hole in your Grandma 's head  --  for her spirit to escape , ' he said . But I knew that all he wanted was some of her sheep . So I said to Temuru , He wants some of her sheep , that 's all . ' And I said to the Yellow-Hat , Listen , ' I said , she never held exactly to those ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disease . And she had much too big a spirit , ' I said , for a little hole in the top of her head . Her spirit was as big as all outdoors , and you could n't make a hole big enough , ' I told him . . . So I separated her body and spirit the proper way , beating off the devils trying to hold her prisoner in the deadflesh  --  I freed her , I kept calling to her , Go ahead , Linga , go ahead ! ' all the way over the long bridge , until she was safe and happy at last in the White Palace . " " Thank you , Bagha , " said Subutai , smiling a little , touched deeply , " but I 'm sorry , I have nothing left to give " " That 's all right , " Bagha said gruffly , " I did it for nothing . I liked the old lady  --  often she gave me a whole sheep at a time . . . But look . Do you remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What 's that ? " " The matter of a certain person , " Bagha said with polite delicacy . Subutai flushed abruptly . Bagha peered at him in the dark and said , " I see you remember . . . " He cleared his throat several times , and then he said , " I did n't want you to think I 've been sitting idle . First of all , I hit on the idea of Ghashun and the Cossack . " " You ? " Subutai said incredulously . " Why certainly , " said Bagha , defensively , " how else ? By incantation  --  well , and by shoving the arrack jug under the tent . It was mighty cold , waiting in the snow , I tell you . I waited until I was sure what they were up to , and then I shoved the jug in , next to them . " Subutai laughed . " Even so , " he said , " I do n't see how it helps much  --  it cost me a hundred sheep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't see ! " Bagha cried excitedly . " He does n't see that , now , nobody will believe her word ! . . . Look , Subutai  --  a jealous woman is worse than ten thousand devils , is n't it so ? If she 's virtuous , to boot , then many may listen to her malicious poison . But let her once be caught in sin and drunkenness , then none will listen  --  her fangs are drawn , and her devils , unable to damage others , begin to eat at her own bowels. " 151 " Perhaps you 're right , " said Subutai . " Certainly I 'm right ! " said Bagha . " Now , with the proper use of magic and incantation , I 'll have her under the control of powerful spirits who 'll keep her harmless as an old bitch with no teeth . " " Yes , but that part , Bagha , that 's nonsense  --  about the magic . You just told me you did it with arrack . " " There you go ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks there 's nothing to it ! .. Next thing , you 'll be running to the lamas like all the rest , " Bagha said aggrievedly , " forgetting your old friend Bagha . . . And just when I was going to tell you what I learned from the bones , too , about a certain person , " he added mysteriously . " Ah  --  forgive me , Bagha ! Tell me  --  what did you learn ? " " Oho ! Now you change your tune fast enough . Sweet Bagha , dear Bagha , 0 wise magical Bagha ! ' . . . No thanks  --  I do n't tell things to disbelievers . " " But Bagha , I believe ! " " Well then , " said Bagha , appeased a little , " the bone steamed a bit , sweating a few drops of moisture . Ah , she 's unhappy about something , ' I thought . . . As a matter of fact , I saw her the next day  --  at a distance , you know , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on , Bagha ! " " Then all of a sudden , I put a new bone in the fire . Mind you , this was all beyond our bargain . " " Never mind , I 'll make it up to you , Bagha . What shade was the first bone ? " " White , naturally . " " Yes , white it would be . . . But then , the new bone  --  what shade ? " " It , too , was white . " " Ah , " said Subutai heavily , " then it was n't my bone . " 13agha wrinkled his forehead , like a merchant who has made a mistake in his customer 's identity . " But you father 's the White Bone , is n't it so ? " he said . " Yes , so he was made . But I 'm still of the Black Bone , a free shepherd without sheep , a warrior perhaps . " " So it was , " Bagha said eagerly , " there was blood on this new bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not actually . In the fire , you see , immediately it became black ith smoke . " " Ah ! "   " Yes , the other was white all along , steaming a little . But this new bone became black . " " And then ? " " Then the first bone rolled toward the second . " " By itself ? " " By itself . The steam dried away mighty fast , I tell you  --  and then what merry sparks went up ! The new bone became white as the first , would you believe it ? There they were  --  sparks going up like laughter ! " " Bagha , a million thanks ! " " Hey  --  what 's your hurry ? " Bagha shouted after Subutai . " Do n't forget old Bagha when you become rich ! " " Never ! " Subutai called back . Now he rode rapidly as possible through the hoshuns . How gay everything was  --  music , laughter , good things to eat and drink  --  like old times almost ! And how good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Three enormous yurts had been raised for the khan and his family , with inter-connecting doors . Around these yurts there was great activity . Throngs of people stood about , watching great fires in the clearing , where whole cattle and sheep were being cooked . The air was filled with appetizing odors of charred flesh and hot dripping fat ; the people were commenting excitedly on the skill of the cooks . Subutai sprang from his horse and was ushered into the khan 's presence . Ubasha waved him aside , for a moment . He was sitting crosslegged on a rich Turkey carpet , studying some China ware . There were some small wine pots , with air holes and little spouts , belonging to the " green family " of biscuit enamel . But the two large pieces that Ubasha was studying most closely had been set directly before him , soj that they obscured all the small pots and bowls . One of these large pieces was a tall tea-pot of pure white porcelain , glazed with blue and golden butterflies , grasses , flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tall as a child , a work of extreme simplicity by art . . . These things Ubasha studied , like one trying to store the memory of some fleeting beauty in his head . " How can I destroy such things ? " he said softly , as though speak in to himself , unaware of Subutai 's presence . " All the way from thp153Chinese khan they came , by Tu-li-shin  --  a gift of great beauty to Ayouka , my own great-grandfather  --  " He lapsed into silence again ; and then after a time he looked up , as though seeing Subutai for the first time . " Well  --  could you destroy them , soldier ? " he said . " They take much room in the carts . " " But , " said Subutai , unsure what answer was expected of him , " but need they be destroyed , then ? " " Yes , we must set an example , " Ubasha said . " For who knows , how far we go ? There are many things we must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these are things to think about now . And all manner of poor useless things of beauty , such things must be left behind . Ah , butterflies , flowers ! " he said softly again , as though he were alone , " could we bury you under the snow , perhaps ? Ah no  --  for what happens to flowers , the hawthorn , the butterfly wings , when summer loosens her grasp ? Do they remain somewhere , green and sweet , blue as the summer sky , golden as air , waiting for winter to trample their wings ? Rather when summer retreats , looking back over her shoulder with gentle melancholy , they crumble to dust .. . " Tell me , " he said abruptly to Subutai . " Did you learn the extent of Zebek 's wealth ? " " Nearly as I could learn , " said Subutai , who was embarrassed by the khan 's mood , " there are fewer than three thousand sheep , and not above one hundred head of cattle . " " Ah , so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth has Increased . . . But good  --  many thanks ! " he said . " And now , what 's this I learn of your Cossack ? Zebek tells me you let him escape , " Ubasha said pleasantly . Subutai flushed and said : " He was my friend . For his life I gave my last sheep . There was a long friendship between us , beautiful as yonder Chinese pots  --  no more could I see him destroyed . " " Well spoken , " Ubasha said softly . " Now , go to the aimak of omotubash . There you will find the Princess Cedar-chab , distribut-g her annual fund , with her the Prince Zebek . Remain with ; cdar-chab , if you please , and ask Zebek to come to me . . . Wait  --  and me yonder fire-tong -- - " When Subutai had done this , the khan struck the Black Hawthorn vase several light blows . The object gave off a deep silver tone , like a muffled bell . Ubasha said meditatively : " Surely I am a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , one must go unencumbered with friendship or beauty . " And squeezing his eyes tight shut , he struck the vase a great blow . Subutai moved away , silently as he could . Near the door of the yurt , it seemed to Subutai that he heard the khan sob ; and he fled .. . Zebek and Cedar-chab , in the aimak of Momotubash , a few miles away , were visiting some poor families among whom there were many sick and comfortless because of the cold and the hardship of mid-winter travel . In most cases , the best shelter such people had been able to contrivewas still inadequate . Those fortunate enough to own two carts had stretched tent-cloths for a roof , with snow banked around the carts for walls . In cases where there was only one cart , shelter was still more limited . Subutai found Cedar-chab in one such family enclosure . There was little room , she was sitting with her legs doubled under her  --  an uncomfortable position , obviously , but she was smiling as though quite at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time , smiling politely , sipping some of the wretched millet-water which his host , overwhelmedby such visitors , had made his wife prepare hurriedly . But overcome by the nauseous odors of four dirty children , one of whom was sick ; of several mangy dogs ; of a grandmother dying of lung trouble with much coughing and spitting ; of a sick lamb which the little sick girl had saved from slaughter by demanding it as a pet ; and further nauseated by the effusive but uncultured politeness of his host and hostess , Zebek had felt forced to retreat into the cold air . When Subutai gave Zebek the message from Ubasha , at first the prince frowned and made an impatient gesture . Then suddenly he smiled , gave Subutai a friendly stroke on the arm , and called for his horse . He rode off without looking back . Subutai shrugged . Inside the shelter he could hear Cedar-chab 's voice . His face grew pale , he trembled as he crouched to enter . Cedar-chab , without seeming to know that Subutai was squatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stuffy shelter was lit by a single tallow lamp , the light ofP155which flickered violently every time the old lady coughed . Near her some Tibetan incense which Cedar-chab had brought was smoldering , seeming to cleanse the air a little . Tea and incense were the only gifts available this year from the Princesses ' Fund , which ladies of rank were distributing tonight , principally among the sick . Such gifts were rare enough , and welcome . But ordinarily there were other things  --  dolls made of wool and horsehair by the princesses , little pieces of fine embroidery , knives bought at the markets from Turks . . . To lessen in some measure the little sick girl 's disappointment at receiving no personal gift , such as a doll , Cedar-chab was plying her with riddles . " Thirty poles in a ditch . " " Teeth ? " " That 's right  --  are n't you smart , though ! . . . Half a copeck on a cushion , a patch on a sheepskin ? " " The moon ! " both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . " You keep still , " the mother said to the little boy , " you are n't sick . " " I do n't want to be sick , I do n't want to be sick , " the little girl began wailing abruptly . " There , there , " said Cedar-chab soothingly , " I 'll ask you another mc . The little girl stopped crying . The grandmother smiled with iIifliiculty , wheezing . " The same things we did ! " she said in a tone of wonder . " The same things we talked , one time ! " She turned her face aside , coughing spasmodically . " Now this one is a hard one , " said Cedar-chab . " Four in the morning  --  twoat mid-day  --  three in the evening ? " There was silence for a moment . " I give up , " the little girl said . " Let me tell , I know that one ! " cried one of the other children . " Well ? " " A sheep and a goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep and a " Everyone burst out laughing . But none seemed to know the right answer . Even the man and his wife looked at each other blankly , with vague smiles , scratching their heads . " Well  --  Subutai ? " Cedar-chab said in a curiously soft whisper , as though she 'd known all along he was there . He blushed furiously , smiled like an intoxicated man , and could think of nothing to say  --  although he recalled the answer from childhood . " Does n't anyone know ? " said Cedar-chab then . The dying grandmother stirred , her fingers fluttered ; she stared at her little granddaughter , and tried to indicate with her fingers a crawl , a walk , and a limp . Finally she gasped the words , " A man ! " and burst into a new fit of coughing . " That was too hard , " the sick girl said , " ask me something more . " " Yes  --  ask her the finger-times , " said one of her brothers , " she 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The girl held up her hands . " Seven times seven , " said Cedar-chab . The little girl bent two fingers on each hand . This multiplication device was an ancient one , based on the bending-down of one finger for each digit over five in a number  --  as for instance , eight-times-nine would require three fingers doubled on one hand and four on the other . Then the bent fingers were counted , " four-plus-three equals seven , " and the unbent fingers were multiplied , " two-times-one equals two , " giving the answer , " seventy-two . " The girl stared through her fingers at Cedar-chab , who said : " Well ? Seven times seven ? " " Forty-two , " the little girl said at last . " That 's wrong ! " her brother said , " She 's not playing right  --  she knows the answer ! " " Come , baby lamb , tell the pretty lady the answer , " the girl 's mother said coaxingly , " you know the right answer  --  why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though getting ready to cry again . She said , all in one breath : " Because if I say the right answer then the lady will go and I do n't want her to go . . . Forty-nine ! " she ended abruptly , sticking out her tongue at her brother , who was making faces . " But I 'll come again soon , " said Cedar-chab . . . There were a few more places to visit . Once in a while , on their way from shelter to shelter , Cedar-chab looked curiously at Subutai ; but she made only a few casual remarks . Yet Subutai had the feelingP157that there was something important to be said between them , and his heart beat fast , looking at her from the corner of his eye . Here and there among the hoshuns , the more well-to-do were having meats broiled for the feasting that would follow the midnight entry of the New Year ; on a smaller scale than at Ubasha 's , the same preparations were going on , people were milling around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits , she looked at the crowds of people all about and clutched Subutai 's sleeve . " Take me somewhere , " she said quietly , " we must talk a little . " This command was so abrupt that Subutai , blushing and confused , looked at her blankly . " Do n't look at me like such a ninny , " she said , " am I so ugly you want to go off and leave me alone ? ... Come , there 's not much time till midnight . I declare  --  I think you must prefer other company to mine ! " Subutai managed to say : " But how can I answer  --  you beat me with words , like sticks  --  you do n't let me answer properly with things that are true " For a moment she lowered her eyes . But then she bit her red lips , and said : " Look you , Subutai . Where is your grandmother 's hoshun ? " " She 's dead . " " I know , " Cedar-chab said gently , laying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me there  --  so that I might leave her a gift , a butter lotus ? " Subutai could find no proper words , merely they turned and rode side by side among the fires and excitement of Chagan-Sara Eve . And as they rode Subutai kept thinking . What could it be ? What could Cedar-chab wish to say at his grandmother 's tomb ? Finally they came to the dark and deserted carts , the howling dogs , the broken cairn of snow .. . Subutai leaped down from his horse . " Hello , what 's this ! " he cried sharply . " . . . Tenek ? " There was movement among the sheep , bleating sadly , milling In the dark like a churning mass of snow . Tenek , whose feet protrudeda little from the crushed dome of the cairn , was stiff and cold . Stihutai tugged at his feet until the hunch-back 's corpse lay with only the head and arms dangling limply into the dark hole .   " He 's dead  --  shot in the back , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side , cowering close to him in the dark . " Down ! " Subutai said to the dogs who were trying to lick his hands . One of them ran off a little , toward the sheep , and then looked back . Subutai frowned , trying to think what to do . The dog barked and ran forward a few more steps , scattering the sheep , looking back again . Now Subutai turned , closely attentive to the dog and the sheep . It was difficult to see  --  was there someone among the sheep ? He moved after the dog , followed by Cedar-chab , saying with soft encouragement to the dog , " Good fellow ! good boy  --  what is it ? " Among the sheep , Gedesu turned this way and that in panic . Had the demons spilled out of Tenek 's hump , where they coming to get him ? " I did n't want to ! really , I did n't want to shoot ! " he sobbed , struggling to run in the dark among the sheep . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him stumble and fall . " Come out ! " Subutai called now . " Come here ! " Gedesu , floundering hysterically among the sheep , heard his brother 's voice . Surely it was Subutai  --  surely Subutai would keep the demons from seizing his legs , from choking his throat , from murdering him in the dark ! Gedesu rose and groped his way in blind haste toward Subutai , flinging himself , abject and pathetic in his misfit armor , at his brother 's feet . " Save me ! " he cried hysterically . " I did n't mean it , I do n't know why  --  I 'm so unhappy , brother , nothing is good  --  everyone laughed , it was Vasilov too , even children mock me like sheep  --  take my sheep , dear brother Subutai , take all ! do as you like with me  --  only save me , brother , save me  --  " " Stop your blubbering , " said Subutai quietly . " Get up . " Gedesu struggled to his feet , his whole fat body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out again , saying : " Take all , no man of killing am I , rather will I walk barefoot in poverty , a monk begging with a bowl . . . You remember , Subutai ,  --  say you remember , surely I wanted to be a priest ! To cheat , to steal , to kill  --  how could I come to do such things ? Take all , Subutai my brother  --  let me amend my life , let me become only a monk " But ironically , Subutai , who had been so deeply affected by Gedesu 's hypocritical grief when Grandma died , listened with a contemptuousscowl to this present outburst which was , actually , muchP159more sincere . . . Probably Gedesu , safe again in his yurt , counting on his rosary all the sheep and good things of wealth accrued to his life , would have denied his renunciation . Yet perhaps , too , here was a moment decisive for such a man as Gedesu . The whole structure of his life , glitter though it might through the tabulating beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a man , in his own way , longs for the warm solid substance of compassion  --  like the worm , who burrows greedily for the tender earth yet lives only in empty corridors , through whose lonely body the earth , the sweet rich earth , only passes like golden sunlight through the hollow trunk ( ) f a tree . Perhaps , had Subutai taken Gedesu at his word , the greed of the man might have been tempered , or transformed a bit to compassion , had Subutai said a kindly thing or uttered a forgiving word .. . Finally Gedesu ceased blubbering , feeling there were no longer demons or dangers to fear , and he began peering around from under the visor of Beran 's helmet , which was twisted grotesquely on his head . From the nearby hoshuns came sounds of festival laughter and stings ; and beyond , far as all space and time , it seemed , the night I.ty in a lonely white realm of peace , serene and empty under the stars . Cedar-chab stood , aloof in her furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional breeze , gazing with impersonal curiosity at Gedesu . And Subutai , with no sign of compassion , was staring at his brother with a cold and indifferent contempt . Gedesu drew himself up , trying to adjust his ridiculous armor , already detesting himself for his baseless fears and his mad gesture of renunciation .. . Subutai said , at last , in a toneless voice : " Go you , Gedesu  --  take your animals and your wife , and go from the aimak of Temuru our father  --  else I kill you . Go where you like . Itttt for such a man as you , there is no place in the ulus of Ubasha Khan . " Gedesu raised his head , and his chest began to puff with anger at such words . But when he saw the cold and intent eyes of Subutai , his glance wavered and without a word he began to retreat . Feeling uneasily that his back was exposed to Subutai , he quickened his step , until he gained the protection of a shadowy bank of snow . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity , muttering angrily all the way home .. . P160WHEN GEDESU HAD GONE , STILLSubutai and Cedar-chab hesitated a while to face one another , as though they had nothing to say . Their horses nuzzled in the dark , waiting near the carts , whinnying now and then with vaporous breath white as snow . Cedar-chab toyed with the ribbons of her cap and said , vaguely looking where Gedesu had been : " You ought n't have said that  --  perhaps he might really go  --  " " Let him go , then , " Subutai said harshly . " Thief , killer , coward Now Cedar-chab turned and laid her hand quietly on his arm . " But Subutai , " she said gently , " he 's your own brother . " " Yes  --  as you were my sister , once , " Subutai said angrily , shoving her hand away roughly . " Ah god , " he said miserably then , " why do you torment me so ? " Her lower lip trembled , she looked down . " I meant not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down too . " From the beginning , it was always so , " he faltered , " always I dream of you , yet it were better " She stood very still . " Better what ? " " Better if you were gone , too , " he said unhappily . Her hand flew to her quivering mouth . " Wait , not that , " he said desperately , " but you make me wild and hopeless  --  like for you I 'd kill , or thieve " Now for the first time she smiled , tremulously , and she touched his arm again . " Poor Subutai , " she whispered , " yet I love him . . . " He spun around , seizing her mittened hand . " Who ? "   " A man who could never thieve  --  nor kill , unless in battle , " shesaid mysteriously , " one I have known a long time as brother " Subutai opened his mouth several times , looking stunned . " You mean , " he stammered , " you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But that night , " he said , " you did n't say  --  that night on the Saratov Road , you said  --  " " In the morning I knew , " she said , fingering the buttons of his coat with her free hand . " In the morning , when we started over the snow  --  I saw you a long way off  --  " " Then you saw me ? " Subutai said , as though this were something incredible . " And then that night , " she said , toying with his belt , " you came rousing the whole hoshun , hunting for me . . . What a commotion  --  you even woke Loosang ! ... Do you know where I was , that night ? " " Ah ! " said Subutai , breathing fast and remembering , his heart pounding furiously to recall his torment . " I was looking on the sentry line , " she said , " for you . " " But , " said Subutai , bewildered , " but Norbo said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " That was a trick , " she said , looking up suddenly and smiling again . " Do you think , could I tell all the same thing ? " " No , but " " And the day you came home from Koulagina , my heart nearly burst  --  yet you gave me scarcely a glance " Ah , that day , yes , " Subutai muttered , " that day Zebek was holdingyour arm . " " Zebek , " whispered Cedar-chab , suddenly shivering . " Listen , Subutai  --  youwere at his ulus . Has he many animals now ? " " Three thousand sheep . Your brother asked me to learn . " ... And what did Ubasha say ? " " ' Good ! ' " " Ah ! Then he plans to ask much kalim ! " " But Cedar-chab , " Subutai said , clinging to her hand , " even if %cbek could pay " " Rather I 'd run away , Subutai , somewhere with you ! " " Do you remember , Cedar-chab , " Subutai said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave ? " She smiled , too.  | " Yes  --  and they looked for us half the night ! Your father found us , is n't it so ? " " How he scolded ! " " Perhaps we knew , Subutai , even then ! " Suddenly , from all the hoshuns surrounding the dark cairn where they stood , a wild tumult burst out . Gongs , bells , cymbals , shell trumpets , horns , all filled the midnight air with a discordant , exciting clamor . " Chagan-Sara ! " cried Subutai . His eyes gleamed in the dark . The vast midwinter sky and steppe , the wild cymbals and horns , the excited shouts and the cries of startled beasts , the nearness of Cedarchab , so that in spite of the cold and furs he could smell her musty sweetness  --  these things intoxicated Subutai . He dropped her hand and crushed her savagely against his chest . For a moment their eyes met , gleaming , frightened but excited by what they saw in the depths of their gaze . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lids fluttered and closed . A gust of wind shook the red ribbons of her fur cap against their cheeks . " Ah god , Cedar-chab ! " he muttered . " Now I have broken all our laws but one . " She stirred , slowly her eyes came open . " Even that , " she faltered , " for I am yours , do as you will " He stared desperately into her eyes . " I am only a poor soldier , " he said , " not fit to touch the toe of your little red boot " Yet you touch my lips , my breasts , " she whispered , " they are yours  --  " " There is a price for each law . God so wills . " She stared at him more calmly . " Are you afraid ? " " Never , Cedar-chab ! " he cried . " Not for . myself  --  gladly would I pay my life ! " " Then what ? " " Only for you , " he said , unhappily . " Perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his chest . " I fear , too , " she said faintly , " it was evil of me  --  "   " No , it was II " " But Subutai  --  " " Yes ? " " Never forsake me , never let me go  --  " " Never , no matter what comes , I swear ! " " This I swear , too , Subutai , " said Cedar-chab . The wind , blowing from the hoshun squares , brought the odor of cooking meats and the sound of merriment . Near the broken cairn , Subutai and Cedar-chab lingered a moment more , uncer-t a i nly ... From somewhere nearby , suddenly , from somewhere beyond a wall of snow , came a muffled sound of hooves . " Now we must go , " Subutai whispered ,  --  " we must return to your lather 's yurt . " He frowned , reluctant to free Cedar-chab from his arms , trying to express in words the despair and desire , the strange confusion that he felt . " And yet , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah yes , " she whispered questioning , " somehow , 0 Subutai ... " There was a sweet melancholy about her last word  --  like , in the carols which children all through the hoshuns were singing , under a tinkle of little bells swinging from their green dresses as they went here and there in groups , swaying , singing , raising and stamping their feet as they swayed , there was the same sweet and questioning melancholy of their carols rising to the starlit but silent sky . Cymbals and gongs were still filling the midnight air with wild clamor , people were thronging the hoshun clearings and corridors , laughing and shouting . Among them , though , there was this same undertone of sadness , of doubt , of not knowing where they might go or what might come . Yet tonight , here on the Aral plain , there were fires blazing luxuriously ; there were steaming , sizzling meats or all . And from one yurt to another the people went , calling on one another , according to the custom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about carrying clay bowls ( filled with boiled snow ; floating in the bowls were balls of honey and flour , and there were long silver needles with which people tried to spear the bobbing delicacies . The housewives , too , carried pots of buttered tea from yurt to yurt , and large gilt plates piled high with tiamba-cakes . Men carried jugs of arrack , offering drinks to all . Inside the yurts , cedar and aromatic leaves were burnt .   In one of the hoshun squares , where a great fire blazed in the clearing , a clown was tumbling about and dancing , to the great delight of a crowd of shouting , stamping , applauding adults and children . The clown was dressed , according to the tradition of ChaganSara , in ballooning white pantaloons , a green smock with a yellow girdle ; and he wore a black mask with a long flowing white beard . Symbolizing the joy of the occasion , yet with a melancholy touch , suggesting the passage of time , the clown capered and tumbled about in the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already begun . The rich Turkey rugs had been taken from the center of the floor and placed along the walls , where people sat . On the flooring of powdered manure and sand , which only princes and rich people could afford , Sand-chab and a younger brother of the Lama Loosang were dancing . Musicians sat near the door , cross-legged on the floor , playingtheir flutes , their two-stringed lutes , their drums . The women , wives and daughters and mothers of saissangs and princes invited to Ubasha 's yurt , were seated along the left wall , smiling , clapping their hands in time to the music , bobbing their heads as they watched Sand-chab advance and retreat in the dance , her eyes downcast and a secretive smile hovering about her rouged lips . Opposite the door , there was a connecting passage-way between this yurt and the next ; and against the far wall of the second yurt , which was crowded with visitors and servants , could be seen the khan 's family altar where , among the lamps and incense steadily burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from butter , tallow , and in some instances , ice . Both these yurts , which were open to the khan 's guests tonight , were brightly lighted by many tallow lamps , their vari-colored wicks burning in silver bowls fastened to brackets along the walls . In the main yurt , the men were seated along the right wall . The khan sat in the center , smiling pleasantly at all , while serving women passed and refilled cups of warm liquor . The Lama Loosang sat next to Ubasha , watching Sand-chab and his young brother Bambar . Zebek was nearby , propping his chin with his hand , looking on with a weary smile . On the right side of the khan , too , sat Chereng ; 11u1 other princes , including Erranpal , Ubasha 's father-in-law . Choktu and the old Prince Bambar , however , were seated to the left of thep165khan , among the saissangs , where the old warriors , Temuru and Momotubash , were heartily recalling and toasting old victories and fallen heroes .. . Once , Momotubash turned for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sand-chab , retreating in the dance , twisted her body beneath the red gown . Then Momotubash called , with coarse soldier humor : " Watch your step there , young Bambar  --  keep your eyes on your feet , man ! " Across the yurt , some of the ladies tittered modestly . They were all clad in their best clothes , colorful gowns puffed out at the shoulders , wearing massive three-cornered earrings , glittering buckles in their plaited hair , coral and glass beads around their necks , bracelets on their arms , red lacquer on their finger-nails . . . Somewhat selfconsciousin all their finery , the ladies were gossiping in whispers . " How she dances , that one ! " " No shame at all ! " " I think , " one whispered hoarsely , " she has nothing beneath her gown .. . " " She may well not , " said another , cattishly , " she 's been worn down by many lovers , they say ! " " What a pity , really , I pity her  --  see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sipping arrack daintily , Mandere nodded and beamed happily . How wonderful , she thought , that she , the daughter of a petty Khoshote chief , should be sitting here , wife of the Torgut khan ! And she thought , too , of her children , and the one yet unborn , stirring uneasily in her belly  --  feeling , then , a twinge of worry about the newcoming Year of the Tiger , the renewed migration , wondering where the way led , over what strange mountains andfearful plains , to what far goal . . . Yet the arrack was pleasant , andthe whispered gossip of the ladies had a safe and familiar sound. in a looked up , for some new people were entering the yurt . Manderewas short-sighted , she had to wrinkle the skin of her round foreheada little frown , to squint , in order to see . Why , it was Cedar-chab and the tall smiling Subutai  --  and how happy they seemed ! She said , inking aloud : " What a nice couple they make ! " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you say  --  something about Cedar-chab ? "   " Why , it 's only Subutai , " said another . Mandere blushed . " I mean Bambar and Sand-chab , " she faltered , " what a pretty pair , dancing , so graceful ! " " She ca n't fool me , " hissed one of the ladies , " she meant Cedarchaball right ! " They whispered excitedly . " But surely , you do n't think that the khan " No , I hear she 's all but promised to Zebek . " " Yes , that 's so , it 's a matter of kalim . " " Personally , I 'd choose Subutai  --  how tall , how strong ! " " Yes , but he 's poor as poor  --  " " No matter , love finds a way , " someone simpered , " is n't it so ? " " Yes  --  if ever I saw a guilty pair , " hissed the first lady , " look at them ! there 's something between them , take my word ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to strike everyone . Necks were turned , for a moment all looked toward the door ; the dancers paused , even the musicians seemed to miss a beat . The fluteplayer , who had been keeping his lips glued to his instrument just as his eyes seemed glued to Sand-chab 's hips , now , as though some connection of thought had been broken , raised his eyes to peer at Cedar-chab and at the same moment raised his lips from the flute . The drum-player , who had been smiling fatuously in every direction , turned to his companion and muttered . The flute-player , curiously embarrassed , as though in glancing at Cedar-chab he had been guilty of some indelicate idea , spat to one side  --  rather officiously , so that he might appear to have lowered his flute only to wet his lips ; and fastening his gaze intently on Sand-chab 's hips once more , as though further to emphasize his complete morality he began playing more plaintively than before . The dancers began moving again , as though they had never paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking and watching the dancers again . Here and there , however , a few still glanced meaningfully at Ubasha , at Zebek , who lowered his eyes to scowl at the floor , and at the newcomers making their way toward the khan . . . " And why do you come so late ? " said Ubasha , pleasantly enough . " Where have you been ? " " To his grandmother 's tomb , " said Cedar-chab , glad that the coldP167night air had so colored her face that her blush might n't be seen , to take her a small gift , a lotus of butter . " " Ah , poor woman , " Ubasha said softly , " it was thoughtful of you , sister . And many thanks , young warrior , for bringing our Cedar-chab safely home . " Cedar-chab crossed the yurt , to where Mandere and the ladies sat ; and Subutai made his way to the next yurt , where the younger men , the lesser guests , and the servants were gathered , where he was immediatelybesieged by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't he drunk to the Chagan-Sara , yet ? " " Off with your coat , man  --  here 's food and drink , and dancing ! " And the young sons of visitors in the khan 's yurt surrounded Subutai , shouting : " Show us how to shoot , Subutai  --  show how you speared the Kirghiz ! " And there were people taking his coat , laughing , slapping him on the back , offering arrack and meat , dancing and smiling all about , in contrast to the cold and suspicious stares that had met him in the khan 's yurt . Subutai 's eyes misted happily . He drank , danced , tossed children high in the air and caught them again , laughed , and slapped men exhuberantly on the back , himself . Great platters of meat , cut from sizzling carcasses outside , were carried through here to the khan 's yurt . The carriers of the silver platters laughed good-naturedly when the people , here and there , seized fragments of steaming meat as they passed . " More where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get served , in time  --  make way ! " And balls of colored felt were tossed , from person to person , likeme hilarious game , for each to wipe his greasy fingers upon. ' fall jugs of arrack were brought in , too ; it seemed that the khan 's bounty would never end . And now the khan , in the next yurt , got to his feet to drink a st to the New Year and , perhaps , to say a few words about where tjhey went .. . Outside , bitterly hearing the music and noise within , Ghashun shivered and lurked unhappily in the dark . The merriment , even the fragrant odors of meat , nauseated her . Now that she had come thisP168far , to the dark elbow formed between the two main yurts and the sleeping chamber of the khan , Ghashun seemed unable to move . In her yurt , after Gedesu had marched off to murder Tenek the hump-back , she had lain for a time on the floor . All the time she had been thinking , What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Subutai 's friend , the Cossack Vasilov , the shame and the laughter ; and she thought of tonight , certain words about Subutai , how she had taken the gun to Gedesu . Surely it was all Subutai 's fault  --  he disliked her , he wished her harm ! she thought . After a while , she got to her feet . She put more argols on the fire , she stood listening to the shouts welcoming Chagan-Sara , outside . She scowled ; but when she heard a noise near the door of the yurt , she smiled . Surely it was Subutai , coming to pay his holiday respects ! She thought of what she would say , how she would look , how Subutai would see she was a truer woman than Cedar-chab . But the steps passed by . And it was Gedesu , finally , who entered the yurt . He cringed and blustered , all at once , telling what had occurred . She stared at him blankly , not hearing his angry remarks about whether Subutai could order them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed , was the name of Cedar-chab ; her face twitched with jealousy . " But then he was n't alone ! " was all she could say , stupidly . " Eh ! you 'd think she was the wife of Subutai , not mine ! " Gedesu said angrily , addressing the argol fire , tugging at his chain-mail . " Here , help get this off ! " Silently , moving like a sleep-walker , Ghashun got into her heavy coat and started to leave the yurt . Gedesu , struggling with the chainmailtangled all about his arms and head , was still shouting about all sorts of things  --  Subutai , the ulus , Lev Zolotsky  --  a jumble of things that had no meaning . Ghashun had one thought in her mind , like a demon now , and it drove her out of the yurt . She took a horse and rode , avoiding people , keeping in the shadow of snow-banks , her heart beating wildly against the drum of her ribs . When she came near the carts , the clearing where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode softly . Then she saw them , Subutai and Cedar-chab , and they were embraced . Her body sagged , and she leaned down , pressing her forehead against the cold snow wall of a corridor , feeling sick . She sat thus ,  |p169until  they mounted their horses . And then , spurred by a demon of thought , she followed them at a distance all the way to the yurt of the khan . Here , avoiding the glare of the great crackling fires , she rode to the dark side of the yurts . She dismounted from her horse , and stood motionlessly in the cold , listening to the music and laughter within . Here she stood for a long time , unable to move . But it seemed , as she stood there , that the whole shape of her life unrolled like a map  --  the pain , the ruin of dreams and beauty and happiness , the long hard travel from the Volga with all its losses and troubles , the empty and nauseous present ; and even the future , hard travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed , then , as though all this were the ill-work of Subutai . In that moment she lost all pride , all shame , like a woman so lost that nothing could stay her , now . Like a naked woman , cold and lonely she felt , fearsome as life stripped of all glitter and tinsel , like the deathly skeleton of the new year seen through the pretty tatters of Chagan-Sara .. . In such guise , now , moving with deathly passion , Ghashun passed around the yurt to the door , pushing her way blindly through guards and people , a frightening apparition , straight to the place of the khan . llbasha , holding a small bowl of arrack , had just this moment been speaking . " Now ends the Year of the Hare , and the Year of the Tiger begins , " he was saying . " When the feasting is done , with the will of God , going in peace  --  " The abrupt entrance of Ghashun , like a sudden rush of cold wind , like a portent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spilling some of the liquor from the silver bowl . All gazed in horror at Ghashun , come like death among them . After what seemed an eternity she fell to her knees. " 0 khan , noble lord , " she said at last . The tension among the people eased , they stirred . Angrily now , all felt it was only a woman who had come among them , of all times , merely to complain about something and spoil the pleasure of ChaganSara . Somebody moved , trying to draw Ghashun away . But the khan said : " No , let her speak . " And people changed their opinion again , murmuring in approba- tion of the khan 's kindness , now feeling that Chagan-Sara was exactly the proper time , amidst all the bounty and merriment , to listen magnanimouslyto some poor woman 's complaint. " 0 khan , noble lord , " Ghashun repeated , in a high sing-song voice , " our travel we bore with hardship . The wheel on one of our carts was broken , it draws with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals we lost , many animals we have had to slaughter . " " Yet all these things , " said Ubasha , quietly , " our whole people suffer . " " Yet more ! " cried Ghashun . " My husband has lost an eye , a finger , a slave  --  " " These things happen , " said Ubasha , sympathetically , " these are bad . But all things happen . " She seized one of his hands , covering it with tears . " But all this , " she cried , " all this is the work of one man who wills us evil " People leaned forward now , interested . Even those in the next yurt became quiet , crowding forward in the passage-way , trying to hear , asking : " What 's up ? " " It 's Gedesu 's wife . " " No ! can it be ? " " Sure  --  just listen to that whine . You could n't mistake  --  " " Subutai ! your brother 's old lady ! " " Sh ! be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun again , in a more fanatical voice . " Such a man , lord , is Subutai ! " she cried . " My husband Gedesu is a far-sighted man  --  his eye , Subutai tears out . Gedesu is a hardworkingman  --  his finger Subutai takes . My virtue belongs to my husband Gedesu  --  yet this , too , Subutai had his Cossack friend , our slave Vasilov , steal in the night ! ... Can such things be , 0 khan , such evil things ? And all because he covets me , lord  --  Ghashun , a virtuous woman , his brother 's wife  --  " Temuru , speechless with rage , tried to leap to his feet . His face was purple , his hands groped murderously . But his old friend Momotubashheld him back . Ubasha and the others , however , began to smile a little , shaking their heads . Surely it was a poor demented woman , saying such things ! The khan , trying to remain kindly , said :   " But surely you see , good woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring them to court , this is neither the proper time nor place . " Ghashun looked up , she looked all around the circle of unbelieving faces , her lips twisted bitterly . " I want no court , " she cried , " only belief ! " There was a polite silence , during which someone tried once more to draw her away , but Ghashun struggled to her feet . " Wait , " she shouted frantically , " wait ! that 's not all ! Now he tries to drive us from his father 's aimak  --  from your own ulus , 0 khan ! " This caused a slight stir . Even Zebek , who had appeared bored all evening , looked up with a sharp interest . The khan said firmly : " For this , he has no authority . " But Temuru said , in a thick voice : " Yes , get out  --  the both of you , Gedesu and yourself ! You 're none of mine , you hear me ! " " Think you I came here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was to find such words I came ? " The poor woman swayed , as though drunkenly , she glared blindly all about , like a beast in a cage . The people sat smiling with empty pity and disbelief . Surely there was a word , a way to make them realize ! Even Ubasha seemed impatient , annoyed . Like a woman possessed , hopelessly , trembling and livid with shame , Ghashun now turned and glared straight into the eyes of the khan . " Think you  --  none of this man 's evil is on your own house ? " she cried , her words coming in jerks . " Fool  --  shame ! Less than an hour ago your sister Cedar-chab bewitched him , stole him from me , do you hear ! on the ground , in his grandmother 's tomb  --  rolling about like beasts  --  " She could n't go on . People gasped , there was a dreadful silence . So enormous was her offense , so fantastic her charge , that those who might have believed a little gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All looked at the khan , in silence . At last he spoke . " Now you may go , " he said , his voice trembling with anger . " Go from my ulus . " Subutai , caught among the people packed in the passage betweenP172the yurts , tried to move ; but Bagha the Shaman , standing close , nudged him in the ribs . " Nobody believes her , " he said , chuckling , " what did I tell you ? Nobody believes her lies . " Subutai laughed brittly . But Ghashun , having retreated a few paces from the khan , turned again . People were about to seize her , to force her out of the yurt . But when she turned , none touched her . For once again , as when she had entered with so strange an effect , inexplicably , she seemed something other than herself . In a strange distant voice she said : " On your house , evil  --  on your people , evil . None believe , but I have seen it . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst and heat are on your people  --  death  --  these things are upon your people For a moment she stood there motionlessly , her eyes closed , like a person transformed , fearsome as the image of death itself , she stood . So she seemed , somehow for a moment , standing in the midst of the people . Then the curious illusion fell away , and she was merely a wretched woman , torn by jealousy and madness , standing there . She looked all about , like one waking in a strange place , shivered , turned again , and fled . She was gone , like a wind that has brushed chilling in sleep , forgotten . None spoke of her . But people stirred about ; meats and drinks were brought . People talked , laughed . Soon all was as it had been before she came . Now Ubasha stood again , raising the silver basin which he had set aside . His arm trembled a little , but he smiled slowly and his hand became firm . " On the morrow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we go in peace . " " God 's will , " said Loosang , bowing his head . The people stamped and applauded vigorously . Bagha stood to one side of the people , with a melancholy smile . " As I foretold , " he said , " none believe her  --  not even when , at the very last , she speaks the truth . " P173THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY 2 , 1771 , broke over the Aral plain with a dawn staining the snow like blood .. . All through the preceding day , the feasting and laughter of ChaganSarahad lasted . People slept wherever they were , snoring , leaning against walls , leaning against one another , only to wake again and rejoin the drinkers , the singers , the dancers , the story-tellers , the eaters . Musicians were replaced by others ; in the temples new people came and went , and even the priests , feasted and rested , returned to the temple yurts and relieved one another , chanting with fresh vigor , splendid in their scarlet and golden robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  when even the dogs , for the first time one could recall , were sleeping fat and replete . Yet in the midst of such feasting , all knew that this was an unnatural plenty , derived from the slaughter of half their animals . Who knew what would come , on the morrow ? All feasted and laughed unnaturally , persistently , as though they could never get enough , as though , perhaps , for the last time such plenty might be . But the festival had ended abruptly when horns and gongs sounded the second midnight . Laughter and music ceased , and the yurts and hoshun squares lost their festal air . The fires no longer sizzled with savory meats , rather the flames crackled with things being destroyed . People , following the example of Ubasha with his fine Chinese pots , were throwing onto the flames all those odds-and-ends of broken chests , worn-out saddles and cordage and mats which they had thought somehow to mend , earthen pots and platters which chipped and broke in travel , all manner of things which ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , who had managed to bring the poles and frames of their yurts thus far , now seeing their carts and animals over-laden with new leathers and felts and with huge quan- tities of dried meats  --  many of these people abandoned their bulky frames and poles at last . From midnight on , carts had been packed and prepared for travel again . Animals were segregated . Dogs barked , people ran shouting among the herds and flocks , separating their goats , sheep , cattle , oxen , donkeys . There was a terrific bellowing and bleating ; all seemed in wild disorder . Camels twitched their shaggy sides , little bells tinkled on the pack-animals of the rich , chests and bales and cordage lay all about in confusion . As the cold twilight before dawn came , children began to cry , animals became restless , making irritable sounds , dogs barked , men shouted . . . Yet just before dawn , the whole horde reached the order of migration again . Now morning had come . The brass cannons hurled iron balls at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiter light , the sun changed from deep red to a pale yellow disc as it slowly rose over the glittering snow . The lamas doffed their scarlet mitres , offering their ancient morning mantras , chanting in shrill and somewhat hysterical tones : " It has arisen , the sun of happiness has arisen ! Om Maricinam Svaha  --  bless us and fulfill our desires ! Protect us , O Goddess , from all the eight fears  --  of foes , robbers , wild beasts , snakes and poisons , weapons , fire , water , and high precipices --  " And the coming of day , like the shuddering breath of dawn , touched and stirred all the people and animals , waiting on the plain . The lamas , at the last sound of the cymbals and gongs , the last sonorous noise of the trumpets , replaced their scarlet hats . The horde shuddered , wheels creaked , they finally moved ; and the great migration , after the long halt here in the southeastern corner of Europe , was at last resumed . Beyond the Mugadir Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lay Asia . " God 's will , " said Loosang . Cart-wheels sank a little in the crust of the snow , leaving long shiny ruts behind . The hooves of beasts scarcely marked the crystal surface on which they trod . The sun rose in a sky of winter blue . The white plain stretched cold and serene as far as the eye could see , except where in the east the hills now loomed more solidly . People , particularly women and children , smeared their faces with rouge to lessen the glare of sun and snow . Now that they were moving again , P175it seemed they had never paused  --  yet all were rested , even the old and ill seemed to have new vigor . The day was cold , but there was little wind . The weather was ideal for travel , the bright world all about was empty and harmless . Or so it seemed . Yet the warriors under Prince Bambar in the rear , chatting idly as they rode , occasionally stooping to retrieve some trinket  --  a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an animal of the rich  --  turned and carefully scanned the western horizon from time to time . Nothing unusual was seen , behind  --  nothing but a few fires still smoldering under the cold sky and a host of black crows , buzzards , and vultures , soaring over the remains of fire and tomb , their black wings lazily flapping .. . And forty miles ahead , too , the vanguard riding over the unmarked snow kept a constant watch . But all seemed well ; and as the sun rose toward its winter meridian , soldiers here and there began to sing , cheerful to be living and moving again , enjoying the cold clear day . As the afternoon came on , now and then someone glanced ahead at the hills  --  but nothing moved , there were no signs of life , only a flock of black crows from time to time . When the sun began to decline , shadows began to take shape blackly among the cleft rocks of the hills ahead , deep shadows reaching among the snow-covered rocks and trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ural divide , seemed a refuge , a bulwark against Russian attack  --  a wall between two worlds , in the more ancient of which they now placed all their hopes . Thus their approach to the darkening hills was eager ; songs continued , a subdued excitementpervaded the long Torgut columns when the Mugadir loomed directly ahead . The vanguard of warriors , spurring their horses , started to gallop up the long slope of the pass . A musket shot rang out . Instantly all stopped ; silence , a terrible stillness ensued . Whence came the shot  --  who fired ? The long wall of the Mugadir was still , as before . To the north was Darik Tagh , crest of the hills , its fifteen hundred feet heavy with snow . The perpendicular walls of the hills , sheer granite to which no snow could cling , glistened peacefully in the late afternoon sunlight . Here and there , clefts in the rocken hills couldp176be seen , deep with snow , dark-shadowed . The pass lay between Janan and Jaksi Tagh , a little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dark defile reached over the rising ground , which was traversible for carts and pack animals at this one point . All the clefts , the shadows , the granite hills were still , as before . Slowly , the line of soldiers moved forward again , bewildered , but cautiously . Now there were several clear shots  --  and one of the warriors clutched at his side . Up the long slope , in the shadowy pass , a few puffs of smoke could be seen , rising from behind boulders covered with snow , bluish-white in the cloven gloom . Back through the whole horde  --  animals , people , all halting abruptly  --  a chill of shock , danger , terror , traveled like a cold dark wind . Orders rang out . " Musketeers down ! Archers behind ! Lancers and swordsmen , rear ! " But there was little need for such commands  --  all knew the order of battle . Soldiers with muskets dropped from their horses , which were led to the rear . The musketeers flattened themselves on the cold snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pass above . Behind came the archers , clad in cow-hide breast-plates , their great bows strung with arrows two feet long , ready to shoot over the heads of the musketeers . And behind all came lancers and swordsmen , some with wicker-work shields . The Torgut blue-and-white banner was raised . Ubasha , Temuru , and Momotubash held a quick council . The two old fighters were agreed . " The pass here can be held against a frontal attack , " Temuru said . " Unless we 're willing to sacrifice many men  --  no matter how many the enemy , nor who they are  --  the advantage is theirs . " Ubasha gnawed at his mustache . " Yes  --  a vast commotion must be made directly against the pass , " said Momotubash , " so they may believe we attack directly . But in secret , we must dislodge them from flank and rear . " " It 's so , " said Temuru . For a moment more , Ubasha remained silent . . . Only last night  --  only a moment ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly at the treacherous pass . But hearing a rattle of musket shotsP177again , the yells of some of his men on the slope , Ubasha 's face became grim . " So be it , then , " he said , " let it be thus ! " And the great red battle flag was unfurled , revealing , like the stripping away of some mask , the terrible face of the Mongolian god of war . The attack on the pass began . Ubasha remained in command of the slope . Temuru galloped north with a large troop , seeking a place to cross over the hills ; he and Momotubash , who rode south , were to attack from the rear . Several smaller troops , under Choktu and Rabdan and Subutai , were to try flanking the pass from above . Subutai looked for a path up the steep wall of Janan Tagh . He made a false start , up a deep cleft in the rock that led nowhere . He wheeled and shouted to the men , doubling back . Soon they found a precipitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passable . Subutai led the way , his horse scrambling sturdily up toward the ridge . On the crest , he waited for the others , looking back for the last time on Europe . People and animals stretched in long turbulent columns far as the eye could see ; the declining sun glittered goldenly . The Asian side of the hills , sloping gently to the east , was already shadowed , so that the deep drifts of snow seemed blue . For a moment Subutai waited on the crest of the divide , feeling unaccountably sad yet deeply exultant , too . Then he saw Temuru 's men coming from the north , riding fast on the Asian plains below , coming swift and silent in the blue shadow of the hills . His own men had already gained the ridge , behind him , and he gave the signal to proceed . The crest of Janan Tagh descended toward the pass in a series of terraces , covered with boulders and stunted trees . Occasionally a hush of ground-pine could be seen , shaggy with snow like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wind . Across the pass , where the formation of Jaksi Tagh seemed much the same , some of Choktu 's men appeared from behind boulders , descending the terraces . From the pass between them , shouts and musket shots echoed vaguely ; sometimes a puff of smoke rose clearly in the still air . Subutai and the horsemen went cautiously forward.  |p178Someone  dislodged a boulder . With a sound of shearing ice , it tore free and began to roll slowly down over the hard snow . Subutai dashed forward . But there was no staying the stone  --  it rolled faster , crashing through a pine bush , leaving sharp dents in the snow  --  topplingwith a crash , finally , into the pass below . Instantly there were shouts , much closer than before . Men were in ambush , it seemed , just under the lowest terrace of all . A few heads were cautiously raised , hands clutching the icy rock , startled eyes peeringup where the boulder had come from .. . " Kara-Kalpaks ! " one of the Torguts shouted contemptuously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Torgut horse and rider went crashing below . Some of the others dismounted hastily , creeping behind boulders , muskets ready . " Back ! On horse ! " cried Subutai  --  for the Torgut horses were more sure of foot on such rock and snow than the men . " Spread ! " he shouted . " Fire ! . . . Forward , slow ! " Now the Torgut muskets began . Several of the Kara-Kalpaks were hit , they fell from the rock , and the others ducked . But suddenly a long lance whizzed through the air , barely missing Subutai . Someone behind him caught it , as it slowed , examining the fine ash and the tassle of feathers at the end of the lance . " Kirghiz-Kazak ! " he shouted . And now , swarming up a ledge from the pass , shouting and scramblingover the terrace , waving lances and swords , came a host of those fierce warriors , Kirghiz of the Little Horde , mortal enemies of the Torguts . They had obviously made an alliance with the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the Torguts from passing through into Asia . But some of the Kirghiz seemed to think , now , that they had been betrayed by their allies  --  for one of them , scrambling past a clumsy Kara-Kalpak , dealt the latter such a blow that he shrieked and tumbled from sight . Shouting and blood-thirsty , like men betrayed , the Kirghiz came . The Torgut musketeers had little time to reload . Muskets were quickly swung over shoulders again . Knives , swords , and lances were seized . There was a terrific hubbub of shouts . Not many of the Kirghiz had guns . A few had carbines , a few had old pistols with no percussion locks . One fellow , not far from Subutai , raised his weapon.  |p179He  had fired it before . His face was blackened by powder smoke , he held a live coal clenched between his teeth . But this time , when he leaned forward with the coal to fire the powder , the charge burst back at him . When the smoke cleared , his face had been torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But most of the Kirghiz fought with lances and swords . The enemies clashed , on the white terrace , shouting and screaming , and only the sure-footed horses kept deathly still . Subutai 's lips drew back tightly from his teeth , involuntarily , so that his face seemed fixed in a smile . His heart pounded wildly , he seized a sword , shouting fiercely : " Ya-bonnah ! " But it was a sickening feeling when his sword , bursting through : t thin leather shield , encountered nothing but a substance that seemed U ) cut like butter . The Kirghiz 's eyes , only a moment ago locked with his own so fiercely , began to glaze . And when Subutai withdrew his sword , in spite of the din he seemed to hear a sickening sound , and blood and a few fragments of flesh were on his blade . Ah , war was something else than fighting Beran  --  something other  --  killing was different than he had believed .. . But there was no time to think , to remember the Kirghiz 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . On the opposite wall an equally fierce battle was being fought . Choktu 's men had crowded rashly forward , almost to the wall of the pass , so that the combat was occurring there on a precarious sloping ledge . Many warriors , Torgutand Kirghiz both , tumbled into the shadows below . From the rear , Temuru and Momotubash were beginning their attack , advancing up the blue slope in battle array . And from the western plain , suddenly , there came a terrific noise  --  and something Mattered and crashed furiously in the echoing depths of the pass . The cannon ! A great cheer went up from the Torguts . They wheeled their horses dangerously , they slashed at their foes with triumphant vigor . A clever man , the khan  --  a general ! The enemy was demoralized , their ambush had turned into a trap for themselves . The Kara-Kalpaks wanted to flee and hide . What armor they Wore covered only their breasts . The Kirghiz , cursing such cowardice , Speared the backs of their allies.  |p180That  all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die like men , killing ! They swarmed up the walls of the pass , rising from places of ambush behind stones and boulders , charging with blind fury at the Torgut encirclers . The air was filled with shouts , a clatter of steel , expiring cries . Many Torguts were killed before the pass was captured . Terraces , ledges , the floor of the pass itself , all were littered withdead and dying . One huge Kirghiz warrior clung to a jutting rock . His leg hung limply , swinging a little , loosely , like a bloody pendulum . It had been slashed through at the hip . Below in the pass , a Torgut archer strung his bow . Heavily the Kirghiz hunched himself on the rock , and with his knife he cut through the last shreds of clothing and flesh . Seizinghis severed leg like a war club , he dashed it down at his foe . And then , with a startling humorless laugh , with a last effort of his dying strength , he plunged his body down from the rock with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kara-Kalpaks escaped , no Kirghiz remained alive . Now up the European slope the horde began to advance . Weapons , clothing , were stripped from the dead . The bodies weretrampled into the snow . The blue-and-white pennons of the Torgut Banner , the great standardof the Torgut war-god , blazing red as the sun now setting in the west over the fiery snow , were advanced through the Mugadir pass . No longer coming in peace , the Torgut horde followed , shouting wildly . Carts creaked and bumped against one another drunkenly . People , with mad exhuberance , clutched at bodies still caught on the walls  --  bodies of Kirghiz and Torguts alike  --  shouting fanatically whenever they succeeded in felling one like dead fruit from the stony limbs of the wall . Animals packed the pass , bellowing and trampling the snow , plowing bodies underfoot , scarring , like a raging torrent , the very walls . Like a savage flood , the Torgut horde burst through the pass and down over the long slope , deep blue in the dusk , returning to Asia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hare , the Year of the Tigcr began . P183IN ASIA , MANY WINDS BLOW , ANDthe land is old . Likely the land over which the Torguts now traveled was formed by the first blocks of rock rising from the sea . On these plains and plateaus much of the earth has been powdered to sand , dry and unwatered , and the winds of all season struggle for precedence here . Of these lands the Khan Genghis once wrote , " Here the rivers have long been misused , and they fall like sighs into the dry hot earth . " The great caravan routes  --  known to the Greeks and Romans , and re-opened during the Middle Ages by Genghis  --  passed through these lands . On the great roads of antiquity were dry lakes , deserts without grass , a few rivers with canal-systems of dense green fields , and occasionalcities of white sand and stone in the desert , such as Khokhand and Tashkhent and Samarkhand . These were the roads between China and Babylonia and Phoenicia , and in the time of Genghis , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay south of the forty-fifth parallel . In the north there were few cities , and much of the land was seasonally impassable because of the vast swampy lakes and the marshes between the rivers . The moisture of western Asia seemed to concentrate in these northern lands , ironically , bringing a heavy rainfall which benefited no one . So dense were the reeds and rushes , so marshy the soil , that neither caravan nor pastoral settlers came to these northern ands . Yet it was toward this ancient and abandoned country in the northeast , once the mountains had been crossed , that the Torgut people traveled . Almost from the day the Mugadir was crossed , the weather and the conditions of travel changed . Spring came early in 1771 . Even in late February , the snows were already melting underfoot . Great drifts of snow were encountered on the Asian slope , in which many carts and animals were lost . Later , when the melt began , travel became still more difficult and losses increased . During late February and March the land was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotting snow . During the nights , a great mist rose from the snowy bogs , and the air was cold and damp . And in the daytimes it often rained , cold and heavily , and opposing winds blew fiercely over the gray and watery world .. . From the time the Torguts crossed the Mugadir and began moving over this Asiatic land , the people no longer grumbled about slaughteringhalf their animals , for all realized that it would have been impossible to travel here with their original herds and flocks . Most of the fodder carts were empty . Sheep and cattle had to live on what they could find under the snow . Even the present number of live animals seemed far too great for the forage and care required in moving through these desolate lands . The first night across the mountains , the Torguts camped on the vast white slope . Through the blue winter dusk and night , new hoshuns continued to press forward between the high dark walls of Janan Tagh and Jaksi Tagh , traveling , as they descended , farther and farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great torches of tallow-reed flamed in the rocky pass . In the morning , more than half of the hoshuns still remained on the European side of the Mugadir . During the whole second day , carts and animals came into Asia , creaking , rattling , plodding , crowdingthe pass . Those who had crossed the mountains during the preceding night or afternoon now slowly gave way to the newcomers . They began to spread widely over the drifted land , letting the pony herds trample the deep and uncrusted snow ahead of the herds and flocks . Animals were allowed to straggle somewhat , foraging under the packed snow for winter grasses and nourishment . From the pass it seemed , looking down , that Asia was a white rolling sea covered with infinitely many small dark figures scattered over its most distant reaches , even beyond the glittering horizon . And from out on the distant plain , from the foot of the slope , looking up at the rocky hills tufted with snow , the pass seemed a high and narrow corridor through which  --  ten carts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , slowly , were escaping from darkness into a white and unpeopled world . By the third day , all of the five thousand hoshuns of the Torgut Manner had safely crossed the Mugadir divide . The migration was resumed . But now , instead of traveling in three long broad columns as before , the Torguts proceeded in a vast concourse with no apparent order . The hoshuns , the aimaks , it seemed , all went where they willed , in search of forage , in order to avoid drifts that were too deep  --  or later , when the snows began to melt , to avoid freshets and bogs of muddy snow . The troops  --  the vanguard and flank and rearguard companies  --  seemed , alone of all the horde , to maintain order and discipline . Yet this seeming disorder  --  the widely scattered hoshuns , the slow and cumbrous foraging procedure of the horde  --  was the usual migratoryorder of the Torguts . Hoshuns maintained contact with aimaks , aimaks with the proper ulus . The authority of the demschis and the shulengas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . Actually , that which was diminished  --  necessarily , for the time , in view of the tremendous difficulty of victualing so vast an army of animals in this mid-winter migration  --  was the rigid military order which had existed before . The barren and wind-scored land , the uncrusted and melting snow , made such martial progress impossible now . Only a few miles could 1 ) c traveled each day . But with the Mugadir at their backs , there no longer seemed need for haste . What could the Tsarina , the Cossacks , the Russians under Traubenberg , do to them now ? The animals had to forage for food ; drifts and bogs had to be avoided . Travel slowed still more , migration became more arduous and difficult , as the spring weather of 1771 came during early March . The horde , feeling its way over the desolate and treacherous land , lost all semblance of the swift and compact army it had formerly been . The slow diffused movement of migrating and foraging millions took the place of a fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lost through insufficient pasturage or carelessness . lint the penalty of such travel , - no matter how necessary it might be ,  --  was the constant danger from lurking enemies . Few , but carefully ambushed , savage bands might swoop down suddenly on outlying herds and hoshuns of the cumbrous horde . Par-P186ticularly toward dusk , when animals were apt to stray far , to stumble in drifts , the soldiers had to be called upon to herd the cattle and sheep safely , to haul carts from muddy drifts . At such times , frequently , bands of savage warriors would suddenly appear in the neighborhood of an isolated and unprotected hoshun or herd , seizing a few animals , often killing a few old men , women , and even children . There were no large-scale attacks on the horde during this time . But as March drew to an end , small bands of Kirghiz-Kazaksseemingto multiply persistently as the insects that already swarmed above the misting sloughs of snow-water  --  continually harassed the most vulnerable borders of the plodding horde . Little could be done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered over a vaster number of miles than ever before , seeking forage and safe passage . The Kirghiz-Kazaks , whenever a troop of Torguts appeared , sped away in the rain or dusk . Pursuit brought the Torguts little or no results . Stars and sun were consulted whenever the skies cleared , and a northeasterly course was followed as nearly as possible . Some days , practically no distance at all was gained ; and in the whole two months of travel beyond the Mugadir , little more than three hundred miles of land were crossed . Yet the maintenance of their northeasterly course was reassuring to most of the people ; every step they took , no matter how slowly , was a step toward those lands of the Turgai  --  of which they had heard so much since leaving the Emba , and in which they all hoped to find a new home . " Listen , " they said to one another . " If we were going to Djungaria , then we 'd have traveled south of Lake Chalkhar  --  there 'd be no point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it so ? " Some , who still clung to the idea that the horde was really going to Djungaria , nevertheless said mysteriously : " Wait and see . This ear has heard other things . " " What the ear hears , " said others , quoting an old proverb , " is misleading . What is seen by the eye , is true . " And finally , near the end of March , when the migration headedabruptly north to avoid the shores of Lake Chalkhar , then even theskeptics had to admit that the Turgai country , truly , seemed their goal . Sometimes , from a slight prominence of land , the dull gray waterof the lake could be seen , distantly in the west . Over the distant reedsand waters , too , flocks of ducks and geese began flying , the heralds ofP187spring . Ahead , as the banks of the Irgiz River were slowly approached , a few trees were seen with green buds ready to burst in leaf . There were still two rivers to cross before the Turgai country would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northwest ; and the Turgai was the other , coming from the northeast . Both flowed into the great lake , forming a wide delta of marsh-land between their courses . The Torguts , nearing the Irgiz , felt a renewal of hope , which dispelled , for a brief moment , the gloom and the weariness of their damp , leaden days of travel . The vanguard of warriors had been riding well in advance ; and already on the bank of the Irgiz River they were busily constructing a large number of floating bridges . Strong tough reeds , often fifteen feet in length , were gathered together in great sheaves , bound and joined by cow-hide thongs and whips . Stomach casings of slaughtered cattle were used , too , inflated and tied to rafts of reeds , for carrying the lesser loads . For many miles along the high western bank of the small but swiftflowingIrgiz , the scene was one of great bustle and excitement , in spite of a gray rain that fell steadily through several days . As the first hoshuns and aimaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , great shouts went up . Carts began lumbering over the reeds , animals plunged down the bank and into the stream with a terrific medley of sounds . Often the bridges were submerged , letting the frightened draughtanimalssink knee-deep in the water . Women and herdsmen , shouting and cracking long whips tipped with metal thongs , rode into the muddy stream , swimming their horses alongside the reed-pontoons , keeping the oxen and pack-animals from lunging into the river . Sometimesa bridge broke , and then animals and carts were frequently lost ; and the weary soldiers sped away for new rushes to repair the damage done to the bridge . The marshes between the Irgiz and the Turgai were covered with dense fields of reeds , and many wild-fowl rose screeching from these haunts as the mighty migration approached . At times the air was so thick with their whirring wings that it seemed likely a lance , thrown casually , might easily spit a dozen birds or more . Yet nobody thought of hunting ; all thought only of escaping from the marshes of Chalkhar . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from theP188swamps and reeds , little dry footing could be found . The whole delta land , here between the Irgiz and Turgai , was a vast green bog . The distance between the rivers , where the Torguts crossed , was little more than thirty miles  --  yet it took fourteen days for the advance hoshuns to reach the west bank of the Turgai River . On the way , a full third of all remaining animals were lost , drowned in swamps , mired in bogs . People , animals , household goods , all were covered with mud . Carts were overturned , vast quantities of dried meat were lost underfoot . And when the cart wheels sank over their axles in the marsh and mud , then the carts had to be abandoned where they stood , often with no chance of transferring their loads . When people remembered how hard the winter travel to the Emba had seemed , now they laughed bitterly , for this was the most calamitoustravel of all . Gedesu , who had joined the ulus of Zebek-Dordzhi when the Mugadir was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamps . There even came times when he cursed his accumulated wealth , for it seemed only that he had more than others to lose . In addition to his original herds and the carts he had shrewdly bargained from neighbors , he had taken better than half of Grandma 's animals , leaving the balancein Yelden 's care for Temuru and Subutai . Most of his carts , piled high with slaughtered meat , were without drivers , for only two victims of his bargaining had been willing to follow Gedesu into Zebek 's ulus , the others thinking to claim their share of the meat later . Puffing and shouting , Gedesu tried to tend his vast wealth , cursing at Ghashun whenever one of the carts mired itself , frantic and choking with hopeless anger , watching his wealth dwindle by half , cursing the great burden of loss that had come upon him . Yet most of the Torguts , in spite of the steaming gray skies and the soggy marsh , plowed heavily on toward the Turgai , aiding one another when they could , bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud if possible , saving what sheep and cattle they could , traveling through the water and bog-lands with bitter fortitude . A few people , in the dark wet night , spoke in whispers of the reason for such calamities as these . Some said it was a natural tragedy , trying to cross such terrible lands . Others thought it might be the result of Russian or Kirghiz witch-craft . But still others whispered that it was vengeance upon them ,  --  punishment for the lives they had taken  --   |p189first  the murder of Cossack hostages , and then the slaughter of enemies in the Mugadir pass . " It comes on us , now , " one would whisper in the dark night , " becausewe slaughtered without need . " " But then , we needed the pass ! " " Yes , but we need n't have taken so many lives  --  compassion is good , too . " " You 're getting soft  --  what are you , a woman , a priest ? " " No , but the war-flag  --  the god of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple  --  if you cross a marsh in the spring , losses are natural , is n't it so ? " " There 's something to what you say . . . But all the same , it 's Kirghiz wizardry , nothing else . " " Then what of our own magicians ? " " Listen , " whispered the first speaker , " we shouted like mighty heroes because we killed a little  --  it was a fool-hardy challenge , " he whispered hoarsely . " These are the lands of Asia , now , where our fore-fathers brought much death and destruction ; and the land remembers . Loss and death lie in wait , do you hear ? " Some shivered , hunched in the chill spring night . " Ah , that 's all nonsense , " someone said . All nodded , without much conviction . " First it was the Year of the Hare , " said the first speaker . " Yes , and we traveled like hares  --  and now it 's the Year of the Tiger ! " someone said boldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first man , " Yes . . . But who , neighbors , is the Tiger ? " All shivered now , sitting in the dark . At last someone said : " Whatever comes , neighbors  --  it 's the will of God , is n't it so ? " They nodded slowly , without much conviction , cold in spite of their long coats , for the night seemed damper , more chill than before . And each morning , when the two brass cannon fired their iron balls eastward over the smoking marsh , the lamas chanted their mantras toward a sun that never appeared , and Loosang murmured , " God 's will ... " The thirteenth day on the marsh-land was worst of all . More carts and animals were lost in the swamps of Lake Rinkul , a bayou of the Turgai that barred their approach to the river bank .   Here , the brass cannon were hopelessly mired and had to be left behind . Beasts panted and slipped in the mud , men grunted and groaned  --  but nothing would budge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such pride , no longer shiny but covered with mud , were abandoned . Desperately the horde plowed forward , making a last effort to reach the Turgai . In all this time the princes and people of rank , as well as the merely rich , fared little better than the rest of the horde . Their losses were equally great ; their discomforts , during days of plodding travel and nights that were cold and damp , were nearly the same . It was only rarely that a mound of firm soil , clumps of debris and grass could be found sufficient to pitch a shelter-tent . Mostly such people slept , like the others , on top of their carts . Cedar-chab made no complaint . But she had been used , not long ago , to sleeping on the ground in summer , living close to the people , sharing their experiences . Her single comment on all the hardships and disasters that mounted each day , was that such losses and sufferings were needless . She felt that weak leadership and bad counsel were responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horde might well have summered on the Asian slope of the Mugadirs  --  or , if the Turgai lands had to be reached this spring , then they might have crossed the Khara Kum desert to the south of Lake Chalkhar and there turned north . These things were on a map Zebek and the Lama Loosang had drawn , which she had found in Ubasha 's yurt when the Chagan-Sara feast was ended . Puzzled by such things , she thought surely someone ought to have known that the marshlands between the Irgiz and the Turgai were nearly impassable in the spring . Yet so conciliating had Zebek seemed lately , so unassuming , and the Lama Loosang more and more humble each day , that she could scarcely find reason to blame them directly for what had occurred . It was their bad counsel , perhaps well-meant , and Ubasha 's weak and compromising leadership , she thought , which had brought the Torgut people to such a sorry point . Then too , she was largely pre-occupied these days with attending Mandere , whose time of confinement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camel whose silver bells , caked with mud , no longer tinkled ; she would look up at her sisterin-law , who , from the pannier in which she rode , leaned down with ( lark frightened eyes toward Cedar-chab . And Cedar-chab would try to think what she might do , of things to say that would lessen the worry in Mandere 's mind . Such times , Mandere would often lean down with a cold hand and touch Cedar-chab 's cheeks , as though it were Cedar-chab , not Mandere , who needed compassion . And when Cedar-chab felt her sister-in-law 's cool hand on her own flushed cheek or brow , then sometimes she turned her head away , so that none might see the sudden tears in her eyes . . . Yet why she should feel thus , easily moved to tears , Cedar-chab was unaware ; and she ascribed it once to compassion for Mandere , and another time to sadness for the whole Torgut horde . It was Sand-chab , however , who surprised everyone by her lack of complaint . The elder sister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter , never allowed to run and ride with the herds like Cedar-chab ; and at an early age she had been married to the rich Prince Galdan , chieftain of the Derbet ulus on the western bank of the Volga , a man who lived more in the Russian style of luxury , it was said , even than Zebek . Sand-chab had left such wealth in order to go with her people  --  and with the Lama Loosang , as gossipers never failed to mention ; yet most of the way from the Volga , to the very bank of the Irgiz , she had complained unceasingly . From the day the Irgiz was crossed , she changed . In the heartbreakingmorass through which the Torguts struggled for fourteen days , it was Sand-chab rather than her younger sister who made light of their troubles , who found a good word for everybody , who helped eagerly as though with no cares of her own , who sang and amused the two small children in a pannier on the far side of Mandere 's camel , who crooned them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the children in the dusk of these misty spring nights , seemed truly happy for the first time in her life . One day , the thirteenth day on the marsh-lands , she rode back to banter a little with the three Cossack hostages who traveled in one of her brother 's carts , bound and guarded by an old warrior who always rode at their side . These three were the only ones left of the seventeen Cossacks originally captured by the horde  --  for twelve had been killed in the first ten days , Vasilov had escaped , and the mutilated body of Captain Dudin had finally died . Of the three , Sand-chab best likedp192Lieutenant Michailov , a jolly young fellow with whom she had waltzed and flirted on a recent birthday of the Tsarina when the officers of Fort Jenat and their ladies had entertained some of the west-bank Torguts . Thinking what she might say to cheer Michailov and the others , Sandchabrode back through the mud looking for their prison-cart . She found it bogged deep in the marsh , in a water hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men nearly drowned . The old Torgut guardsman , with his mouth half open , was watching them choke . When Sand-chab ordered him to cut their bonds , he began to argue , savage-tempered because of the endless mud and rain . " Clearly it is God 's will , " he said . " Let them drown . " With a grim smile , she seized the knife from his belt . " Get along , you old goat , " she shouted at him , leaping into the cart , " I 'll be responsible for them from now on . " When she had cut the thongs binding the Cossacks , Michailov could barely grumble his thanks  --  but the eyes of all three men were eloquent with gratitude . " Come on now , wake up , " Sand-chab shouted , for the pouring rain was rattling loudly all around . " You can have three of my brother 's horses , if you 'll promise not to escape . " Michailov , who was filthy and unkempt , bowed stiffly , standing in the mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile , finding his voice at last , " you have our word  --  and our humble hearts . " An hour later , at dusk , when the Cossacks appeared on three of Ubasha 's horses , they delivered to Sand-chab their prison-cart , which they had miraculously rescued from the bog  --  cleaned thoroughly , bedded with fresh straw , covered with felt  --  a sleeping-cart fit for a princess , as Michailov said , in such times as these . Sand-chab , deeply touched , offered the cart to Mandere and her children . But Mandere smiled fondly at her sister-in-law and whispered : " I am comfortable here , yet for a few days . Go and sleep well , and see that our little sister sleeps one night in peace , too . " That night , Cedar-chab and Sand-chab lay in the cart , listening to the rain falling steadily outside . Sand-chab told how she had found the Cossacks drowning in the bog , and how she had freed them . " Yes , " Cedar-chab said listlessly , hearing the monotonous rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had he been here . "   " Look , " said Sand-chab , suddenly , her eyes wide open in the dark . " You 're in love with this fellow Subutai , is n't it so ? " Cedar-chab nodded tearfully and her cheek groped toward her sister 's hand . After a while , Sand-chab said : " Listen , is he so poor ? " Cedar-chab broke into tears , her whole body quivered ; and Sandchabtook her in her arms , trying to think what to say . Outside , it seemed that the rain would never cease . The chill damp of the night penetrated the cart , where the sisters lay . Then Sand-chab , unable to think of anything beyond her own experience , whispered : " But there are ways  --  other ways " Cedar-chab 's body trembled unhappily , she shook her head . Sand-chab sighed . " No , I guess not , " she murmured gently , " you 're not the same . " She stroked Cedar-chab 's hair , and after a while she said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry . Why , just think , Cedar-chab ! " she said , ironical but tender . " Your young hero may capture Nurali himself , next . Surely the Kirghiz Khan will bring a khan 's ransom , is n't it so ? Yes ,  --  anything may happen ! " " Nothing will happen , " sighed Cedar-chab , inconsolably , " there 's no way , nothing , there 's no end  --  " And outside , the cold spring rain still fell . Throughout the horde , that thirteenth night on the marsh , it seemed to most people that there was no way out , no end , too  --  that the world was nothing but bog and water , gray and without hope .. . But in the morning , after the gray mist of dawn rose like smoke and dissolved , the sky grew suddenly clear and blue , a clean warm wind swept over the marsh , fragrant with spirng ; and in the air , sparklingwith sunlight , bird wings seemed no longer ominous portents but flashed , white as new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when the people started ahead  --  even though the marsh still clutched at the wheels of their carts and the feet of their animals  --  all seemed light as the air , the birds , the sun itself , buoyant as a golden bubble in a blue sea . The waters of Lake Rinkul , to the south , were deep blue too , sparkling and rippled by the warm wind . The marsh grasses , the reeds , were fresh and green  --  and green , too , were the trees not far beyond , where the Turgai flowed .   Spring had come at last , after a long hard winter of little hope ; and already the marsh was crossed , as though it had never been . The soldiers , whistling and singing cheerfully as they busied themselves cuttingand binding the reeds , were already floating their bridges over the Turgai . Beyond , far as the eye could see , the sweet green grass of the Turgai country lay waiting , peaceful and unpeopled in the bright spring sun . And Cedar-chab , like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new buoyance in her heart , new hope where only a cold loneliness had been , shouting like a released prisoner , all through her young body , that now a new life , somehow , was about to begin . P195THE GRASSLANDS STRETCHED TO THEnortheast of Lake Chalkhar and the Turgai River , well above sea level , watered by occasional springs and small streams flowing down to the lake and the Turgai . The land sloped gently upward , producing fine deep grass . Yet no people were here , except a few bands of Andins , stray nomads whose tribal and racial origins were unknown . Along the northeast borders of this country , where the land was more wild and hilly , where the River Tobol flowed , lived the main tribes of the Little Horde , the Kirghiz-Kazaks  --  a savage and predatorypeople . These Kirghiz possessed few flocks or herds of their own , scorning the animal husbandry of more civilized nomadic people , such as the Torguts , calling them slaves . Their women raised a few coarse cereals on the summer hillsides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by raids upon whatever pastoral people came near . Thus the grasslands of the Turgai , despite fine pasture , were uninhabited . Within a few days after crossing the Turgai , the Torgut horde had densely occupied this fresh green country . The new spring grass was already well grown in places , the waters of springs and streams were clear and sweet . Men and beasts alike had been cruelly worn and tired . But the spring air , the fine grass , the cool and sparkling water , soon refreshed them all . From Ubasha 's camp , situated on a green mound near the center of the horde , the khan could see the carts and animals of his people spread far and wide . It was midday , the air was warm , a pleasant breeze was stirring . At the foot of the mound , where there were a few trees and spring-water bubbling out of the ground , the blue-and-white banners fluttered on their golden poles . On the little hillside , the khan 's white summer   tents were pitched ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a golden knob . On the crest of the mound a pavilion of heavy blue Chinese silk had been established , its open sides yielding a view of the countryside for miles in every direction , its blue ceiling , luminous with sunlight , seeming like a patch of deeper blue sky directly overhead . Here the khan sat , bare-headed , feeling the spring wind brushing his black hair drawn tightly back over his head to a short queue . He wore a kalat of deep blue silk , buttoned with silver discs , and a silver belt girdled his waist . His red silk cap and lambskin cloak lay on top of the ancient chest where the Torgut census rolls were kept . Several drawers of this chest were open , and the parchment lists were spread before him on a broad low table . But Ubasha , alone for a few moments , was gazing far away over the countryside . The Torgut horde , pending the reports of scouts , was still compactedto an abnormal density over these pasture-lands . In the distance , a solid blur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every foot of ground was occupied ; but nearer , in the foreground of this vast panorama , patches of grass could be seen . To the Torguts , it seemed that each man and beast had his own bit of space again , no matter how small . Ubasha sighed deeply ; for the fine spring day , the new exhilaration of the horde , made him recall the more keenly how many of their people and animals had been lost on the way . . . For a moment , closinghis eyes , his sensitive face quivered as images recurred , brutally real , of cold and death on the frozen steppes , in the Mugadir pass , on the marsh  --  as though he were still living each foot of the thousand miles they had come , each hour of the hundred and thirty days that had passed with such slow anguish . Yet when he opened his eyes , then the panorama of pastoral peace that stretched beyond the horizon , that shimmered gently in the fresh sunlight , made remembered images of death seem unreal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitter taste on the tongue , that makes clear water seem less sweet than it is  --  giving a gentle melancholy to his gaze . Once , Ubasha looked toward the tent crested with a golden knob , where his wife Mandere lay in the care of his sisters . But he could hear nothing , all seemed peaceful . He looked far off again , over the congregated hoshuns and aimaks of the people . P197The horde , although packed less densely than in migration , still retained the appearance of a military encampment . Corridors of green grass , radiating to all points of the horizon like the spokes of a Russian carriage-wheel , seemed to narrow and disappear among carts and animals not more than a mile from where Ubasha sat . But this was an optical illusion , he knew ; for the green swathes led nonetheless through miles upon miles which the horde occupied , to the unknown grasslands that lay beyond . Ubasha kept watching the points of the eastern horizon where he knew these corridors led  --  as though , somehow , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning from their survey of the outer lands .. . Suddenly a Turkish slave emerged from the gold-knobbed tent ; site hesitated a moment , and then ran up the mound and flung herself tilt the grass just outside the blue pavilion . " Master , " she said . Ubasha 's eyes closed tightly , his face became expressionless . " Pain , she begun now , " said the slave . He could hear , it seemed , a muffled cry from the tent . His face twitched , and then he opened his eyes . " Has the shaman been sent for , and the lama notified ? " he said . " Master , yes , " said the slave , getting to her knees . " Then return , " said Ubasha gruffly , " and let me know when the shaman arrives . " The slave got to her feet and ran down the hill to the tent . Now the time of the midday meal was ended , and Ubasha saw the Lama Kirik , his clerk , approaching the mound . The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his yellow gown as he started tip the hill . The khan looked at him with vague interest . Seen thus , without his cloak , the young Lama Kirik , who had always been thin as a lance , seemed rounder in the middle . He lowered his eyes apologetically , still munching , still wiping his fingers , as he climbed toward the pavilion . Ubasha swallowed dryly , hearing a sudden cry from the tent . But he said pleasantly to the young lama : " Kirik , you seem to be gaining weight , is n't it so ? " The lama gulped the last of his meat and raised his eyes to the sky , murmuring : " The will of God , 0 khan . Surely it is a sin to let the good dead meat rot in the sun , without use . . . Have n't you eaten ? " he saidp198abruptly , for he was a familiar of the khan , of the same age , having been reared and educated with Ubasha . The khan glanced toward the tent , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Ah , " said Kirik , smiling . " May God reward you with a son . " They resumed their clerical labors , sitting cross-legged on cushions of red and yellow silk stuffed with fine soft wool , bending over the census rolls on the low table . Ordinarily , a census of people and animalswas taken among the Torgut horde each fall . But in view of the terrible losses during the long migration , in view of planning a new life here in the Turgai lands , Ubasha had ordered a tentative spring estimate of people and animals . From all the shulengas of hoshuns , the saissangs and darkans of the aimaks , the princes and chieftains of the Turgut uluses , reports had been accumulating during the seven days since the Turgai was crossed . The Lama Kirik read these reports , while Ubasha made notations on the census rolls . He used a French quill and German ink , gifts from the Tsarina for the Russian Christmas of 1770 , which he had received in return for his gifts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " much please Her Imperial Majesty , " according to Kichinskoi 's blunt hint  --  consisting of twenty-five fine Bar-Kul ponies , one hundred poods of the finest wool , two thousand furs of marten and badger , and various minor items . Ubasha dipped his quill in the ink and made notations , while Kirik read in a sing-song voice : " Ulus of Sapsor , thirty-nine hundred and ninety yurts . Estimate of the lost and dead , twelve hundred old people , one hundred and fifty children , forty warriors . Animals lost and slaughtered , sheep fiftytwothousand , goats twenty-seven thousand , cattle twenty-nine thousand . Pack animals lost and died , oxen twelve hundred , horses and ponies three hundred , camels five . Estimate of the births , children two hundred male and two hundred thirty-five female , lambs none , calves fifteen hundred  --  " Ubasha was aghast at these calamitous figures ; but when Kirik read the estimate of births , the khan 's attention wandered and he looked over his shoulder toward the white tent on the slope . Bagha the Shaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemble , on the lower slope near the spring , to watch the conjurorp199prepare his device against evil luck and the devil . Bagha glanced covertly up toward the blue pavilion . He was dressed in the full ancient regalia of the Mongolian priesthood , a sight that always stirred archaic fears and superstitions , no matter how deeply buried or forgotten they might seem , even among the more devout and sectarian Buddhists who professed to regard Shamanism as only an ancient Mongolian barbarism utterly without meaning . Even the Lama Kirik ceased reading and he looked down the slope , narrowing his eyes , at the conjure-priest . Bagha wore a leather cloak covered with tassels and long strips of leather , each tipped with iron . A red stoat-skin hung from his shoulder , and two black-and-white furs hung from his waist to the ground . His girdle was covered with brass balls and small pieces of iron which jingled whenever he moved . His head-dress consisted of a red leather cap , from which several crane plumes hung down his back , and a circlet of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temples , and little brass balls and droplets of glass hung over his eyes . Bagha , conscious that all eyes were upon him , now assumed an air of complete aloofness as he began his preparations . He drove bloodredpoles into the ground and spread a net in the air before the door of the tent , to trap the devil if he came near . Then , hearing a sudden sharp cry from Mandere , he began furiously beating a drum . Ubasha rose slowly and walked down the slope . For a moment he stood near the door of the tent , his face turned away from the small crowd of people assembled under the trees near the spring . Then he turned back , facing the people impassively , and he took a war club which the shaman handed him . Several times he beat the air with this club , shaking it in every direction , crying in a hoarse voice the traditional words , " Devil , be off ! Chart-cheter ! Be off , devil ! " When he had performed this ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club into the air . Once more he faced the tent , which seemed mysteriously silent now that Bagha was belaboring his drum so frantically . Cedar-chab 's head appeared for a moment , her face flushed , her eyes mysterious . She looked at her brother and nodded slowly , with a tremulous smile , and then she withdrew . Bagha ceased beating the drum and picked up his croziers , two rods covered with little bells and fragments of iron . He waved these in the air , beginning to whirl and leap about under the net , the fur and leather strips on his cloak snapping back and forthP200around his body , all his bells and glass balls and trinkets of iron jingling , stamping the earth with iron-shod boots and shouting wildly as he danced . Ubasha , leaving the tent where Mandere 's screams could no longer be heard , returned up the slope to his blue pavilion . The khan and the lama resumed their work with the census rolls . But all the time , now , the khan 's gaze kept wandering along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears kept listening acutely for Mandere 's screams , which he feared yet hoped to hear , somehow , in spite of the shaman 's frightful noise . Once in a while , he thought of the appalling figures of loss he was noting on the edge of the census rolls . Nearly a tenth of the horses and beasts of burden , much more than half of the cattle and goats and sheep ! and nearly a tenth of the people , mostly the old , but the young as well , had died ! Could such things be ? . . . But when he looked over the fine broad land of the Turgai , thickly dotted with people and beasts , then all seemed serene and stirring with new hope under the afternoon sun . Surely the herds would soon be replenished by births , he thought . And of the people , fewest of all had been lost . It was the Torgut people , really , who comprised the true wealth of the horde . From them , too , was already springing new life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more secure , more happy than before , here in their new home . And when Ubasha thought these things , his gentle eyes misted a little , straining his ears for a wail from the tent , straining his eyes for riders from beyond . It was mid-afternoon before scouts and messengers , long overdue , began to arrive . The early reports were pleasant . Scouts who had been in the east told that the land stretched in a gentle slope more than a hundred miles before the eastern hills , barren and dry , began .. . The reports came in more rapidly , now , and new people arrived at the pavilion , Chereng , Bambar , Choktu , Zebek . They listened to the final tally of estimated losses , and to the news the messengers brought . They asked , too , for news of Mandere . Zebek , who seemed in fine humor , was most solicitous . But neither sound nor sign came from the tent , nothing but Bagha 's continual shouts and imprecations . New reports from the border-lands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the south brought news that the pasture grass gave way to desert growth not more than thirty miles down the eastern shore of Lake Chalkhar , except for a narrow and rather reedyp201strip of land along the very edge of the lake ; messengers from the southeast brought word that desert lay in that direction , too , not far south and all the way east to the barren hills . Bambar and Choktu frowned at these reports , and only Zebek seemed unperturbed ; Ubasha listened with an abstracted air , glancing more and more frequently toward the tent with the golden knob . Then the khan 's chief herdsman , Shamba the Old , came deferentiallyup the slope and paused . He bowed to the princes seated on silk cushions in the blue pavilion , and he motioned to the khan . Ubasha rose and went part way down the slope , where he squatted in the grass with Shamba . The herdsman took a pouch and a pipe from his cotton kalat , which was grimy with blood and grease , and he offered tobacco to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , the old man said : " The ewes are beginning to lamb . " Ubasha blinked , he puffed hard on his pipe . Then he said slowly : " This is interesting , Shamba . " " Yes , they 're lambing all right , " said the herdsman , looking curiouslyat the khan , who had spoken in a strange tone of voice . " Ah , " said Ubasha , relaxing a little , " that 's good . " Old Shamba took his pipe from his mouth and pointed to a large flock of Ubasha 's ewes who had been segregated not far from the foot of the slope . He gestured toward those which had been marked for lambing , and said brusquely : " Yes , but the lambs so far have been poorly , some misformed , many dead . It 's all a result of things , you understand . And the ewes are laboring too hard , look at my kalat  --  there 's far and away too much blood  --  " The khan 's face twitched , he jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face white as wool . Shamba the Old , looking after the khan , scratched his head and then went back down the slope , muttering and scratching his head all the way . Ubasha , back in the blue pavilion , took one furtive look at the lambing ewes beyond the foot of the mound , and then turned his drawn face toward the goldknobbedtent . But there was still nothing , Bagha was whirling and shouting , there was still no further news from Mandere . Ubasha rejoined the princes . The latest reports , now coming by messengers from the northeast and the north , were conflicting . Good pastures lay fairly well to the northeast , perhaps one hundred and fifty miles ; although the valleys in that direction were steep and narrow , yet their floors were grassy and well-watered . But in the north , the hills of the Tobol were barely a hundred miles away ; access to the river itself would be extremely difficult for flocks and herds , although the hills could easily be scaled by riders . And while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orsk and Orenberg  --  the latter of which was named after the provincial capital many miles to the west , where General Traubenberg and the Russian army were said to be  --  nevertheless , messengers had seen great troops of Kirghiz-Kazaks on the northern slopes of the Tobol valley , all making their way westward toward Fort Orenberg , it appeared , which was situated on the Tobol near the Turgai headwaters , not much more than one hundred miles to the north .. . The princes heard these reports and began talking excitedly . Choktu and Chereng began an argument about this Turgai country to which they had come , whose shape and extent they now vaguely knew . Altogether , it seemed less broad and wide than fifteen thousand square miles , bordered by deserts and hills and savage plundering tribes on the north . Choktu pointed out , half-heartedly , that such grasslands were large enough for their depleted flocks and herds . But Chereng , smiling , said : " For summer pasture , perhaps it will do  --  with great economy and crowding . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands ? " " Another point , " said Bambar , " I 'd like to know , what about those rascally Kirghiz ? They 're up to mischief , count on that . Are we going to have them around our necks till doomsday ? " " Yes , " Choktu said with sudden conviction , " what about that ,  --  du we want to fight every foot and hour of our lives ? It 's one thing for warriors , and another thing for shepherds , I tell you . " " Well spoken , 0 Choktu , " said Chereng , softly . " These lands are not very large , it 's true , " said Choktu , with a defiantlook at Chereng . " If they were , I 'd say other words than these . " " And what says our good khan , Ubasha ? " Chereng said , with a mocking smile . Ubasha looked around at the princes , bewildered and harassed . What were they saying ? that the land of the Turgai was poor ? All of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only Zchck ,  |p203smiling  and watchful , had nothing to say . Ubasha wet his lips and said : " But whose messages are these , that we take such things for truth ? " " From Momotubash , in the south , " said Zebek , speaking for the first time . " And in the north ? " " Temuru , " said Zebek , gently . " Ah , " said Ubasha unhappily , gnawing his mustaches , glancing toward the tent where his wife lay in labor . He listened a moment , absently , to Bagha 's screeching and jingling . Then , as though with great difficulty recalling himself , he said , " Perhaps the reports have come to us wrong , likely these are false things . For this is fine land , and here we stay , " he said vaguely . " Likely enough , " said Zebek , surprisingly agreeing with the khan . " These are groundless fears , perhaps  --  and as Ubasha says , here we are , and here we will likely stay . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervently , unable to speak . Zebek took the occasion to draw Ubasha aside , not releasing his hand . " And now we are settled in such fine country , cousin , " he said quietly , with a deprecating smile , " perhaps it 's time to speak of a certainmatter in more specific terms . " Ubasha tried to withdraw his hand , flushing . " But , " he said confusedly , " but nothing is settled  --  now is a time of uncertainty  --  " Zebek retained the khan 's hand in a strong grip , smiling brightly . " Nonsense , " he said loudly , concealing their hand-clasp under the folds of their silken kalats . " I do n't recall when prospects were better , more sure . " He pressed Ubasha 's hand gently twelve times . Perspiration formed on the khan 's high and delicate forehead . " But my herdsman Shamba the Old , " Ubasha said , " tells me the ewes are lambing poorly . " Zebek smiled , and he pressed the khan 's hand fifteen times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from fifteen hundred sheep , one can expect a good harvest of lambs , is n't it so ? " Chereng nudged Bambar , and whispered something behind his hand . The old prince stroked his mustaches and smiled . Only Choktu remained somber , listening to a new report from the north.  | The khan looked down the slope toward his white tent , where Bagha was beginning to beat his drum again . He muttered des-perately : " But cousin , we are expecting new mouths to feed --  " May it be a boy , " said Zebek , closing his lids over a cold glitter that came into his eyes , pressing Ubasha 's hand with two heavy clasps , saying , " It is time that our Torgut people have a strong heir of the khan . " Merghen , who had joined Zebek 's ulus as Gedesu 's herdsman , just now arrived with Lev Zolotsky ; they dismounted near the trees at the foot of the slope , and came halfway up toward the blue pavilion . Merghen blinked , the late afternoon sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said to Lev : " Two thousand ! He just offered Ubasha two thousand sheep ! Can he afford it , friend Lev ? " " Great herdsman , fine companion , " said Lev , smiling benevolently , " what can not a great prince afford ? " " Listen , it 's all right with me , " Merghen whispered excitedly , " I do n't care if you milk Gedesu dry as an old goat . But surely , two thousand sheep ! " " Young shepherd , unthinking cowhand , " said Lev weightily , " with two thousand sheep one buys much more than Cedar-chab . " The Khan Ubasha was thinking much the same thing as Lev . He sighed deeply , his hand prisoned tightly by his cousin . Zebek , after a short hesitation , squeezed three times . Ubasha glanced nervously toward the white tent where Mandere lay . He thought of Cedar-chab , he could n't afford to offend his cousin . If what Shamba the Old said were true , hard times were upon them , no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock as Zebek was offering would be needed before long . Across the pavilion , Ubasha noted a few herdsmen arriving , embarrassedand shy in their dirty clothes , reporting to the princes that the ewes had begun to lamb poorly . Ubasha wet his lips , perspiring in spite of the cool dusk beginning to creep over the Turgai land . He thought of Mandere , he thought of Cedar-chab . Yet there were the Kirghiz on the north , the lack of winterpasture , not enough land ! Zebek and the princes , even two fellows standing on the slope , were staring at him . Ubasha saw the Lama Kirik , his clerk , portly and slow , coming through the trees at the footP205of the mound . He thought of the census rolls , the great losses , the hard times ahead , the long and terrible migration just ended ; and his eyes misted in the afternoon dusk , thinking how the people needed rest and security more than all else . Yes , he thought more firmly  --  more than Cedar-chab , more than all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was why Zebek had spoken agreeably  --  perhaps Zebek would be content , with Cedar-chab , to remain in the land of the Turgai . Slowly Ubasha turned to face his cousin , feeling confused and helpless , about to yield to Zebek . But suddenly , from the corner of his eye , the khan saw that Kirik was followed by the Lama Loosang , clad in ceremonial robes , and that two altar-boys preceded them , carrying candles and incense and the silver baptismal basin of the Torgut khans . Ubasha 's mouth had opened part way , but he said nothing . All became silent now , watching the procession toward the white tent with the golden knob . At the door of the tent , Bagha and Loosang stared at one another a moment . The lama looked down with smiling tolerance at the little man in the outlandish clothes . And Bagha , now quiet and crestfallen , gathering together his paraphernalia , could only snort with contempt for the lama 's mystical tools , the candles and incense and silver baptismal font .. . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torguts entered the tent of the khan 's wife , bearing with him the holy symbols of birth . There was a scream , ending in a long wail , and then a faint quaveringcry . Ubasha 's face blanched , perspiration poured down his delicate face , he clenched his hands . The tent was silent , overhead the black and white birds sailed in the golden air of twilight . Finally the Lama Loosang came from the tent , and he came slowly up the slope to where the khan stood nervously at the edge of the blue pavilion ; and the lama whispered quietly in Ubasha 's ear . Tears came to the khan 's eyes , and he turned for a moment to look over the twilit land of the Turgai . Here and there , all the way to the glowing horizon , fires were springing up pale but luminous as firefliesin the dusk . Slowly he turned back to the princes . " God 's will , " said Choktu hoarsely , " what is it ? "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
