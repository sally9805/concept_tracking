France and Britain , who between them call most of the League 's tunes , abruptly reversed last week their lenient attitude of the past 16 months toward Japan . <P> France , alarmed by the sudden pole vault to power of Adolf Hitler , began to stickle for Japanese observance of the " sanctity of treaties , " preparatory to stickling later for German respect of the treaty-created Polish Corridor , etc . Britain was said to have taken her new line because : 1 ) President-elect Roosevelt was reported by Ambassador Sir Ronald Lindsay to be resolved to continue the so-called " Stimson Doctrine " of nonrecognition of Manchukuo ; and 2 ) Sir Miles Lampson , British Minister to China , was said to have cabled warnings that if the League fails to deal with Japan , China may declare in desperation a boycott so sweeping as to choke off not only Japanese but also other foreign exports to China . <P> Whatever his motives , French League Delegate Rene Massigli startled the League Committee of Nineteen by proposing that the League Assembly ( expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for nonrecognition of Manchukuo by any League state , but should back this up by a declaration of noncooperation by League states with Manchukuo . In a strong speech British Delegate Captain Anthony Eden urged the Committee to urge the Assembly to declare " essential " the nonrecognition of Manchukuo . <P> Meanwhile , during the past month , the Committee of Nineteen 's sub-Committee of Nine had been playing a diddling game of questions &; answers with Japanese Delegate Yosuke Matsuoka , each side trying to outdo the other in feats of diplomatic finesse . This parlor pastime abruptly ceased as the sub-Committee buckled down to drafting the suggestions of M. Massigli and Captain Eden into form for action by the Assembly . <P> In Tokyo the abrupt Geneva volte-face put fear into Foreign Minister Count Yasuya Uchida , who was most earnestly counseled by the Last of the Genro ( " Elder Statesmen " ) Prince Saionji not to break with the League " until every possibility of compromise has been exhausted . " The Count flashed fresh instructions to Japan 's Geneva Delegation . Soon with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League 's Lytton Report as a basis for conciliation , merely stipulating that the League shall " take into consideration actual conditions in Manchuria since the conclusion of the Lytton Report . " <P> Fair enough ? Geneva 's statesmen did not think so . Since the Lytton Report was drafted , they pointed out , Japan has recognized Manchukuo , has seized Shanhaikwan south of the Great Wall , has occupied parts of Jehol and launched a campaign to occupy the rest . If all those " circumstances " were to be considered by the League another Lytton Report would have to be made , and by the time it was finished there would be fresh " circumstances . " Angrily the Committee of Nineteen proceeded to pop a big , blunt question back at the Japanese Government , would they or would they not agree to restoration of Chinese sovereignty in Manchukuo as provided in Chapter IX of the Lytton Report ?
