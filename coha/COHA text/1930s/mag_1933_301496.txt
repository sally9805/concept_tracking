( See front cover ) <P> In a front gallery of Washington 's tacky old Smithsonian Institution stand the plasticine ghosts of 33 famed U. S. women . Once the hostesses of a nation , their attitudes are models of spectral graciousness . Sitting placidly in her painted rose silk , motherly Martha Washington has raised her head as though she has just recalled that another of George 's huge hose is hanging by the fire and needs mending . Mary Todd Lincoln , who loved style as much as her homely husband detested it , enjoys an elegant moment of respite in her pansy velvet gown , serene in the knowledge that her exquisite little fan and parasol would be the envy of many a prairie lady back home in Illinois . Lucretia Garfield stands resolutely erect , prepared for tragedy . Edith Carow Roosevelt placidly reads her book . Only the faintest notes of discord jar the harmony among the ghostly ladies in the Smithsonian gallery . Pale Ellen Axson Wilson has joined Mmes Taft and Roosevelt in their glass case , while her successor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace Goodhue Coolidge , whose short skirt and sorority pin would have mystified many in that quiet company . <P> Some day from a studio in the nearby National Museum Building will come another plaster figure to join the silent party . It will be a long-legged model probably dressed in Eleanor Blue and posed to suggest energy , cheer , simplicity . The face , which in the living original is dominated by a generous , tooth-filled mouth , receding chin and warm , humorous eyes , will be indistinguishable from the faces of all the other First Ladies . For Sculptor William H. Egberts of the Smithsonian avoids arguments with friends , relatives and the subjects themselves by giving all the Presidents ' wives the face of Frances Pierce Connelly 's bust of Cordelia , daughter of Lear . Her costume , contours and hairdress ( a loose , high knot ) will be preserved but completely lost will be the unrouged freshness , the amazing vitality of Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt . <P> Until Eleanor Roosevelt came there , the White House 's most energetic mistress had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gilt chairs built in France , had the good sense to hide the Lansdowne portrait of Washington and fly to Virginia when the British invaded Washington . But when the British left , Dolly Madison came back home . As every reader of newspapers is by now aware . Franklin Roosevelt 's Eleanor uses No. 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . less as a home than as a base of operations . Mrs. Madison was limited to horses as her means of locomotion . Mrs. Roosevelt rides her horse Dot in Rock Creek Park for fun . To get herself places she has at her command airplanes , trains and a blue Buick convertible coupe . Since March 4 she has traveled incessantly up &; down the nation , across it and back , visiting all manner of places and institutions . She has traversed its skies and its surface so thoroughly that , in epitomizing her ubiquity for the ages , the New Yorker pictured two coalminers at work in the earth 's bowels ( see cut , p. 12 ) . One miner is saying : " For gosh sakes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
