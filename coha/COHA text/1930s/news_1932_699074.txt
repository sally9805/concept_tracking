txt Mr. Rogers Finds an Industry Not Hit by the Depression To the Editor of The New York Times : BISHOP , Cal. , Aug. ** a Los Angeles bank robbery last week , due to the bravery of a bank official and the efficiency of the police , two robbers were killed and all the rest were caught . I think it was four captured . Well , I wish you could read the crime and jail records of all those six men . They had been pardoned or paroled from every institution in the State at least once a month for the last fifteen years . Their records read like they had just played a series of one-night stands in each jail . They was n't prisoners . They were traveling men , making hotels out of jails . And that 's not an unusual case in any State . Pardoning has been one industry that has n't been hit by the depression . When have you read anywhere of a crime being committed by an amateur ? Yours , WILL ROGERS .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
