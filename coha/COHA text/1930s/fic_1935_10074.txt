VEIN OF IRONpierce the heart in its search for truth . When she first came as a bride , the ruling elders had requested her to wear a veil in church , so that her beauty might not distract men 's thoughts from the eloquence of her husband . After that , she had worn a green barege veil over her bonnet . But it was not Mr. Fincastle 's father , John III , who had built the brick house . They had John II to thank for that . When he was well on in life , a relative in Scotland had left him a legacy . Not a fortune as people thought nowadays , but enough to build a brick manse and to enlarge the church over the old house of worship . With what was left , he had placed a sandstoneslab at the head of every Fincastle grave in the churchyard . His father , John I , was buried there . A week before his death , when he was out of his head , the Shawnees had brought him back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How in the world , Grandmother still asked herself , had those early settlers been able to enjoy living without such simple comforts as feather beds and kettles of hot water ? In fear , too , whenever they had taken time to stop and think , of the savages . Yet they also had loved life . They had loved it the more , John would tell her , because it was fugitive ; they had loved it for the sake of the surprise , the danger , the brittleness of the moment . Her husband , she knew , had felt this , though what he had said sounded so different . Life will yield up its hidden sweetness , she had heard him preach from the pulpit , only when it is being sacrificed to something more precious than life . They had believed this in the old days . Time and again , they had risen from the ruins of happiness . Yet they had gone on ; they had rebuilt the ruins ; they had scattered life more abundantly over the ashes . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cabin twice when others fled to the stockade . For the sake of his crop , he had held his ground . All within the space of ten years , he had seen two wives and two families of children scalped and killed by the savages . He himself had once been left to die , and a second time he had escaped from an Indian village and made his way home through the wilderness . For the rest of his life he had worn a handkerchief tied over his head , and one Sunday morning , while the congregation sang the Doxology , he had fallen down in a fit . In his later years he had married a third wife and had brought up a new family , after the manner of Job , to inherit the land . Though he had seen men burned at the stake , he had never lost his trust in Divine goodness . And nearer still , there was her own grandmother , MarthaTod . She had liked the young chief too well , people had whispered . He was a noble figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came to redeem her . One story ran that her Indian husband had come to the settlement in search of her , and that her two brothers had killed him in the woods , from ambush , and had hidden his body . This may have been true , and again it may not have been . The age was a wild one . Many of the men who had come to the wilderness to practise religion appeared to have forgotten its true nature . Whatever happened , Martha Tod 's lips were sealed tight . No one , not even her mother , had ever won her confidence again , or heard her speak of her life with the Shawnees . But as long as she lived , after her marriage to an elder in the church , she had suffered from spells of listening , a sort of wildness , which would steal upon her in the fall of the year , especially in the blue haze of weather they called Indian summer . Then she would leap up at the hoot42 VEIN OF IRONof an owl or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she returned from these flights , her husband would notice a strange stillness in her eyes , as if she were listening to silence . But gradually , as her children grew up , ten of them in all , fine , sturdy , professing Christians , her afflictionbecame lighter . To the end of her days , even after her reason had tottered , she could still card , spin , weave , dye , or knit as well as the best of them . Grandmother had heard that when she was dying her youth , with the old listening look , had flashed back into her face , and she had tried to turn toward the forest . But that was too much to credit . It could n't have happened . Not when her mind was addled , not when she was well over a hundred . Grandmother remembered her well , an o1 ( 1 , old woman with a face like a skull , mumbling over her pipe in the chimney corner . Was it true , Grandmother wondered , looping the yarn round the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blood ? Could Martha Tod 's spells have skipped her own children and broken out again in John 's heresy ? Yet Martha Tod had been as innocent as a lamb . Never , even in captivity , had she doubted that only through the blood of Christ could she be redeemed . Jerking up her head , which had nodded a moment , the old woman glanced at her son on the other side of the lamp , and thought in surprise , " But he has a fine face ! " Whenevershe looked at him , no matter how many times in the day , she was startled afresh , as if she had never seen him before . How could a man who denied the Virgin Birth wear a countenance that seemed , when he was plunged within , to be cut out of light ? He had looked like that , she recalled with a pang , when he had stood his trial for heresy and schism ( nothing , not even the loss of her husband and herTOWARD LIFE 43seven children , had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since his hair had whitened ( though he was only forty-four ) , the thinness and clearness of his features had become more striking . She had ascribed it all , his loss of zeal , his backsliding , the resignation from his church in Queenborough , the final trial before the Presbytery that deposed him  --  all these misfortunes she had ascribed to the influence of the British Museum , and to the sinister volumes ( never would she have glanced into one of them ) that he had bought at such sacrifices ( he had gone without a greatcoat ; he had even gone without food ) when he was a student . Mary Evelyn , too , had encouraged him when she should have admonished . A cruel doctrine , she had called predestination , and once , while the trial lasted , she had cried out that she believed anything John believed , that she would rather be damned with John than saved without him . Yet Grandmother had loved her better than she loved Meggie , who was one of the elect , assured of salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made the heartbreakingappeal of the dying or the poverty-stricken . Though she was happy , her happiness , like her beauty , was too ardentto seem natural . And she had never had a family of her own . Her parents had died before she was old enough to remember them , and she had been left  --  an orphan , and what was far worse in the Tidewater , a poor orphan . The relatives who had brought her up had been elderly and unkind . It is true that she had been , for a few years , a belle and a beauty , but worldliness , as nobody knew better than Grandmother , was without staying power . After Mary Evelyn 's marriage to John her worldly friends had forsaken her . Then the last of her relatives had passed away , and she had turned to Grandmother , when44 VEIN OF IRONher children died of diphtheria , as she might have turned to the Rock of Ages had her mind been less given to flightiness . A cross she had been , ' t was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only her love for John had been a strength instead of a weakness . And worse than a weakness . In some obscure way , almost an infirmity of the flesh . For how could a man like John , with that queer absent-minded attitude of a thinker who is more dreamer than thinker , satisfy any woman ? His father had been different . Blessed with a robust constitution , he had loved , as he had lived , robustly . They had had perfect sympathy and great satisfaction in marriage . When Grandmother looked back on it now , it seemed to her that she had enjoyed everything , even childbirth . There had been pangs , of course ( though never the long spasms of agony that had tortured Mary Evelyn 's frail body ) , but the pains were so soon forgotten in the joy of bringing a child into the world . Could her children be born again , she would bear with gladness every pang , great or small , that she had suffered . But nothing could take her family away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead and the living . And Mary Evelyn was one of them , as dear as her own . Yet she was wasting away . Year by year , she was wasting away under John 's eyes , who had never so much as noticed the change in her . He thought her perfect , he said , when what she needed was plenty of milk and custards and delicate food . That was the worst of being poor , you could n't give the right things in sickness . But it was a mercy , with the mortgage falling due , that John had been able to pay the premium on his insurance . Small as it was , they had had a struggle to meet the paymentsand to find something they could turn into money . TOWARD LIFE 45There were only a few silver spoons left , and these were so old and thin and brittle that they would break when you washed them . Three thousand dollars would n't go far nowadays . But if anything should happen to John , even that little might tide Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evelyn nor Meggie would let her speak of the insurance . For her part , she had a practical mind ; she had always looked ahead ; she had never expected life to be easy . Not after John 's trial , not after he had told the Presbytery he rejected the God of Abraham but accepted the God of Spinoza . That was the beginning  --  or was it the end ?  --  of his ruin . The most brilliant mind in the church , they had called him , and then he was ruined , he was finished , he was forgotten . For what place was there for eloquence outside the pulpit ? What future was there in a Christian country for a man who had denied his Redeemer ? In the eighties people were more strict than they were in this new century , which was already slipping from its foundations . A scholar outside the church then was as blind as a bat in the daylight . To be sure , he had tried his hand at other work , but that , too , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; he could not even stand on his feet and sell drygoods . All he could do was to think , and nobody ( here Grandmother picked up a dropped stitch ) could earn a livelihood in America by thinking the wrong thoughts . Then , when they had come to their last crust ( for a year there had not been a scrap of meat in the house except bacon for gravy ) , they had called in Dr. Updiketo see Ada , who coughed as if she had croup , and he had stumbled , by chance or benign curiosity , into the bare storeroom . They had the doctor ( a better friend never lived ) to thank for the school in the parlor . At first the people46 VEIN OF IRON in Ironside had protested , but at last they had remembered her ; they had reminded themselves of all they owed to their Fincastle ministers , from John , the pioneer , down to Adam , her husband . A closed memory unfolded as a fan in her thoughts . She saw the pale red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , the narrow valley , deep as a river , and the Endless Mountains thronging under the April blue of the sky . More than fifty years ago , but it seemed only yesterday ! From the changeless past and the slow ac- cretion of time , the day and the scene emerged into the firelight . . . from the falling leaves . . . and the sifting dust . . . and the cobwebs . . . and the mildew . . . . Suddenly , without warning , descended upon her a sleep that was not sleep as yet . IIer eyes saw ; her ears heard ; and in her stiff fingers the needles did not slacken . But she was immersed in profound stillness ; she rested upon an immovable rock . And about her she could feel the pulse of the manse beating with that secret life which was as near to her as the life in her womb . All the generations which had been a part , and yet not a part , of that secret life . The solid roof overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night without , the flames and the shadows of flames within , the murmurs that had no voices , the creepings that had no shape , were all mingled now . Weaving in and out of her body and soul , knitting her into the past as she knitted life into stockings , moved the familiar rhythms and pauses- now  --  of the house ; and moved as a casual wave , as barely a minute 's ebbing and flow , in the timeless surge of pre- destination . " Grandmother 's nodding . She 's dropped off . She 's beginning to snore , " Ada whispered triumphantly . " Maybeoh , maybe she will forget about prayers . Father "  --  she turned to pluck at his sleeve  --  " Father , does n't God ever get tired of just listening ? " O man who has to provide for a family , JohnFincastle thought , has a right to search aftertruth . Perhaps not anywhere in the world . Certainlynot in America . But were the Renais- sance and the nineteenth century in Europe the only ages when men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold mine ? When men believed that the search alone was worthy of sacrifice ? Missionaries , Mary Evelyn declared , sacrificed their families all the time , but his mother insisted there was a difference when people were sacrificed to a truth that had been revealed . Well , there might be . He did n't know . He could n't pretend to care . That , he supposed , was what religious education had done for him  --  only his mother thought it was the British Museum . It had condemned him to poverty and isolation while it denied him the faith that makes poverty and isola- tion supportable . Not that he had been unhappy . Working over his book was sufficient happiness for one lifetime , if only he could have taken care of those who depended upon him . Deep within his consciousness , so deep that the wish had never floated to the surface of thought , there was a buried regret for the solitary ways of the heart . In London , as a student , when he had lived in Bloomsbury on next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been contented to drift . He was on fire then for knowledge . He had believed that , if only he knew enough , he might defend the doctrine of his church , he might even justify God . This , he saw now , bend- ing over with his gaze on the fire , was the first mistake of his youth . Knowledge does not justify God . All the learning48in the British Museum does not prove that man can apprehendGod ; it proves only that men have invented gods . A multitude of gods , and all to be reconciled , one with another , before they could be vindicated . He had turned then to translating Plotinus , and while he pondered the Enneads he had been happy . Happy , yet a failure . For he had been born with an otherworldliness of the mind . He had never felt at peace except when he had strained toward something beyond life . A year later , when he had returned from his studies abroad ( he had held a scholarship for six months in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place the church had to offer would have been open to him . But he had wanted a charge among the dispossessed of the earth ; he had preferred the independence of spirit that comes from not owning things . His world , he knew , was not , and could never become , the world of facts ; he was , and would always remain , out of touch with what men call realities . During a brief visit to Queenborough he had received a call from the largest Presbyterian church in that city . There had been no question in his mind of acceptance . Then the next day , a day in June , while the letter was still unanswered ( " Having good hopes that your ministrations in the Gospel will be profitable . . . " ) , he had met Mary Evelyn ; and in an instant , or so it seemed to him , his past and future had been divided by the clean thrust of a blade . Even now , after fourteen years , this was a secret spot fn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Evelyn had never suspected that the meeting with her had swept away his vocation . Ada believed that he was the pastor of his church in Queenborough when he had fallen in love with her mother . But that first glimpse of Mary Evelyn50 VEIN OF IRONhad brought ecstasy , and the touch of ecstasy had released the desire for a home and children and close human ties . For a moment Mary Evelyn returned to him . Not the woman who sat within reach of his hand , frail and worn and used up by living , but a girl who was tender and radiant , with eyes like smothered flames under black lashes . Well , he had loved her . No woman , only his seeking mind , had ever divided them . He would have given all he was for her , but he could not give what he was not ; he could not make himself over ; he could not prevent that involuntaryrecoil now and then , as if his whole existence were overgrownand smothered by the natures of women . Even the wincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright , monotonous , inexpressibly sweet , was beyond his control . It was true that the external world and all the part of his life that people called " real life "  --  his affections , his daily activities , teaching the young , hoeing the garden , cutting logs , picking up sticks ( he must remember to tell Ada that the poet Wordsworth picked up sticks fer firewood )  --  all the outward aspects of living seemed to him fragmentary , unreal , and fugitive . He had not willed this ; he had struggledagainst the sense of exile that divided him from the thought of his time , from his dearest , his nearest . Nevertheless , it was there . His inner life alone , the secret life of the soul , was vital and intimate and secure . He could remember the year , the month , the day , the hour , the very minute even , when the outline of his system had come to him . In the church in Queenborough he had been a success ; Mary Evelyn was happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two little sons , the eldest only three . For a few weeks he had come back to visit his mother , and he was planning to write his work on God asTOWARD LIFE 51Idea , a history of religious thought through the ages . It was a morning in April . There was a changeable sky and new life on the earth . He had been reading philosophy ( was it Schopenhauer ? was it Spinoza ? ) , and when he closed the book he had turned and looked over the valley to the companionablemountains . In the very act of turning in his chair he had seen that sudden light on reality , that reconciliation between the will and the intellect . For years the idea had lain buried . Yet in those years all he was , and thought , and felt had gathered to the bare outlineand clustered over it as barnacles cling to the sides of a sunken ship . But when he began the Introduction to his history , the idea came again to the surface and he found that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven into obscurity , into poverty , into the strange kind of happinessthat comes to the martyr and the drunkard . Why ? Why ? Who could answer ? He might have been false to himself , and who would have suffered ? But he had craved truth ( yet who knows what is truth ? ) as another man might crave a drink or a drug . Was this endless seeking an inheritancefrom the past ? Was it a survival of the westward thrust of the pioneer ? He had a sudden vision of his grandmother , the one who had been Margaret Graham , with her young blue eyes and nimbus of snow-white hair . Even in her old age she had not lost a certain legendary glamour . Women were not supposedto be students in those days , yet he had never seen her kneading dough without an open book on the table beside her . With much difficulty , no doubt , she had gained a fair knowledge of history and languages . After her marriageshe had still kept up her studies , and when her husband had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threeI 'VE forgotten something , " Mary Evelyn said under her breath , " but I ca n't think what it is . " If she did n't remindherself Saturday night , she would be sure to neglect it on Monday . There was the rent in John 's greatcoat ; there was the turpentine liniment for Aunt Abigail ; there was Ada 's best dress to be washed and prettiest hair ribbon to be pressed for the festival  --  Oh , the new doll 's dress ! That was what she was trying to think of ! Sunday always made a breach in her work ; but perhaps she might steal into the closet when they came back from church and look for the pink gingham she had put away , though , to save her life , she could n't remember where she had put it . It was dreadful the way she forgot things . Her memory was growing worse all the time . Her bringing up was to blame , said Mother Fincastle , who was upwards of seventy and never forgot anything . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she should scream , and then Mother Fincastlewould make Meggie or John set a trap . She did n't mind stepping on spiders , but she could n't bear to kill things that squeaked . Flightiness was her infirmity , Mary Evelyn mused , foldingher worn hands in her lap , and trying to restrain the impulse to jump up and sweep the hearth clear of the wood embers that had just broken and scattered . Little things filled her thoughts . They rattled about in her mind , like dried seeds in a pod . Important facts would slip away , but her whole inner world was cluttered up with the sweepings of yesterday  --  mere straws in the wind . It was n't that she had n't struggled to be sober and steady . Nobody knew how ashamed she felt just now when Mother Fincastle spoke5352 VEIN OF IRONsons , she had prepared them for college . They had made their mark , too , not one but had done honor to her and her training . How , he wondered , had she been able to overcomeall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in mind and body , but what he remembered most vividly was the impression she gave of invincible poise . He had heard his father say that she would have felt at home in any epoch , in any circle . He had never forgotten , though he could n't have been more than ten , that several of the elders in the church had surprised her one September morning before breakfast when she was walking barefooted in the wet grass on the lawn ( somebody had told her that the Indians considered dew a cure for swollen feet ) , and she had received them without a word of excuse , and invited them , with her grand air , into the house . Yet she had cherished the queerest jumble of superstitions . Though she was scholarly for her sex , she was not above calling in old Aunt Jerusalem ( Aunt Abigail 's mother , and a step nearer the savage ) when she wished a mole or a wart conjured away . Until they put her to bed for the last time , she had warded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But these beliefs were more absurd nowadays than they had appeared in that credulous era . Would the time ever come when all superstitions , even those about God , would seem as ignorant as his grandmother 's faith in an Irish potato ? The muscles in his leg twitched , and he glanced at Mary Evelyn , who smiled and said something in a whisper when she saw he was looking at her . His mother thought he had not noticed the change in Mary Evelyn , but she was mistaken . There were moments when he would have believed anything acted any part , if only he could have saved her . VI54 VEIN OF IRON reverently of her husband , John 's father , who had been dead thirteen years . Mary Evelyn had the sincerest respect for his memory . He was a man of God , an earnest Christian , a great preacher , a true father to the poor and the afflicted . All his life he had labored in the field at Ironside , and he had built up his church here and founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary Evelyn knew . Yet , when- ever she heard his name , the first thing she thought about him was that he chewed tobacco . His godliness ought to have obliterated that recollection . But her mind would n't record in the right way . No matter how long she lived she would remember that Father Fincastle chewed tobacco . And she would think , " How dreadful to be the wife of a man who chewed tobacco ! " It was like this , too , in the present . She was burdened by the litter of trifles . Her appetite was so fastidious that the sight of a bleeding rabbit or a mouse in a trap would take it away . Mother Fincastle said all that was mere silliness . She had the robust relish of the pioneer , and she could n't understand how one could be sickened and made to turn away from food when one was hungry  --  or at least empty , for Mary Evelyn could never feel hungry for corn bread and bacon . Well , love was a great power when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could wear rough clothes and eat coarse fare without a regret . But there were other trials , too , so small that she was ashamed of them . Those black bristles in the mole in Mother Fincastle 's eyebrow ! For twelve years , ever since John had brought her to live in the manse , she had worried over those bristles . If only somebody would do something about them ! Again and again , she had opened her mouth to speak of them and had shut it quickly , deterred by the austere dig- nity in the old woman 's demeanor . It was safe , she knew , to venture just so far , but no farther , with Mother Fincastle , who commanded respect and disapproved of familiarities . Not even little Ada would have dared to speak or think of her as " Granny . " Still , the bristles were preying on Mary Evelyn 's mind , which had become , she felt , more and more flighty . It 's such a trivial thing , she told herself now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . For Mother Fincastle had been more than a mother to her ; she had been a fortress of strength . The evening was very long . John was too tired to read . She had never seen him more exhausted by a day 's trip . That mortgage was wearing him out . If only they had a little money . Not much , just enough to keep out of debt . When she thought of the power of money to ruin lives a dull resentment against life , against society , against religion , awoke in her heart . For there was no sorrow greater than living day and night , in sickness and in health , in the shadow of poverty , watching that shadow spread darker and deeper over everything that one loved . There was no sorrow greater , yet there was something , she told herself , greater than sorrow . Turning her head on the back of the chair , she looked out into the night , where the shutter flapped at the side window and the wind had risen in gusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creaking of boughs , the rustle of dead leaves on the ground , the small tongues of wind lapping the walls under the ivy . Inside ( she touched Horace with the tip of her shoe , for he had growled in his sleep ) there was the glowing center of life . She had much to be thankful for . Nobody was ill ; nobody was hungry ; nobody she loved was out in the cold . Aunt Abigail had a good fire , and Horace56 VEIN OF IRON ( she glanced down at his black and tan head ) was warm onthe hearth . But I must keep Ada happy , she thought the next minute . I must keep her as happy as I have been . For it was true . Looked at from any angle , she had been happy . Life had been eager , piercing in flashes of ecstasy , tragic at times beyond belief , but never drab , never tedious ; never , not even at its worst , when John was standing his trial , had it been ugly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she picked up her hooked needle and returned to the counterpane she was crocheting . I 'm glad John mended that leak in the roof . Half of her mind was still in the next room , where she had turned down her own and her mother 's bed , started a fire to undress by , and hung two outing nightgowns and two red flannel wrappers on a small clothes-horse in front of the flames . The woodhouse had been well filled in the summer , and with the help of chips and sticks the backlogsought to last until the winter was over . While John was away she had had the place tidied up and the paths swept with a brush broom by old Beadnell Geddy , who would work for a cast-off flannel shirt or a worn-out pair of shoes . She must remember to tell John , who would never notice the loss , that she had given the old man a pair of woolen stockings because he suffered from chilblains . Though she had little patience with John 's religious doubts ( had n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put unsound views into his book ? ) she could not deny that he was unselfish in little things and ready to help her with any work that she wanted done . And she could never forget ( nobody who saw it could ever forget ) the way he had nursed his wife when she had pneumonia six years ago . He had never left her bedside , even to change his clothes , until the crisis was over , and then he had fallen asleep from exhaustion with his hand on her pillow . Mother had covered him with a blanket and had left him there , with his knee on the floor , until he awoke . While she watched him Meggie had felt her heart soften . She still loved him ; he was her brother and a Fincastle , and5758 VEIN OF IRONshe prided herself upon the strength of the family ties . But she could not forgive the headstrong will that had affronted his father 's memory ( who should know more of truth than their father , who had been a servant of God ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have him live a lie ? " Mary Evelyn had asked passionately . But why should he set up his own belief for the truth ? Who was John that he should know more of truth than his forefathers had known or the Bible had revealed to them ? Bending over the counterpane , she reached down into the big splint basket near the hearth and tossed a knot of resinouspine on the fire . She loved to watch the colored flames shoot up quickly , branch out from the stalk , and unfold into flowers . Another pale spider ( how she hated spiders ! ) was lowering itself on a cobweb from the top log on the woodpile . That was the pile they kept there in case of a snowstorm . She must make Uncle Beadnell move the logs on Monday and look for the spiders . A mouse , too , had been worrying Mother in the night , and she must remember beforeshe went to bed to bait a trap with middling rind in case Ada had eaten the last crumbs of cheese . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all eyes , and in spite of her high color , the skin looked waxen . She was not strong like the Fincastles . When that pain in her back stabbed suddenly , her hand would fly to her heart , and a look of terror would flash into her eyes . Yet she would work on until it killed her . Nothing could stop her . Energy had fastened upon her like a disease . John ought to speak to Dr. Updike about her . Perhaps he would suggest a tonic of bitters or some cod liver oil . Mr. Greenlee , the apothecary , would always let them have medicine and pay for it when they were able . TOWARD LIFE 59Years ago when Meggie was a young girl ( she was only thirty-three now , but she felt older ) , Dr. Updike had treated her for spring fever . His figure was less burly then and there were no pouches under his eyes . He could n't be over forty now , but he had traveled the roads at all hours in all seasons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , though it was so long ago , a pale flush seemed to spread more within than without . Not that she had had any sentiment ( for her life was too full of useful activities and her heart was too full of her family ) , but for a little while she had wondered if  --  well , if he had cared more than he showed on the surface . She had never forgotten the time he kept his hand on the inside curve of her arm ( she was noted for her pretty arms ) , stroking it softly while he sat by her bed and asked questions about her health . That was all . Yet she had felt startled and shy , with this pale glow break- ing out in her mind . It was queer she should remember that after all these years , after he had married Hannah Kelso and had a family of children . For herself , she had never thought of love-making or mar- riage . It was n't that she had been plain or unattractive . She was better-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh , with a neat figure . But she could n't run after men the way some girls did even in Ironside . In the old days there had not been women enough to go round , and all had been sought after . There were belles among simple people like themselvs , as well as in the more distinguished circles of the upper Valley . Mother said it had been different ever since the war , with most of the young men going away to make a livelihood and marrying in strange places . Well , she had n't worried about that . If the Lord had appointed60 VEIN OF IRONher to marriage , He would have arranged it all in His own good time . As it was , she had put her hope in little things , and she had been happy . She was the only member of the family who was never low-spirited , not even in the long winters , when sometimes they were snowed in for a week . VIIITHE taste of sugar is like pinks , Ada thought . It 's like verbena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melt and fade as soon as it had gone down ! And when you had n't had sweetness for a long time ( Father had waited because he could get coffee and sugar cheaper from a wholesale house over in Doncaster ) it tasted different and sharper . She wished pleasant things lasted longer , and other things , like evening prayers when you were sleepy , would n't drag on forever . Father was n't going to read tonight . She wanted dreadfully to hear what happened next in Old Mortality , but Mother had whispered in the kitchen that she must n't ask him to read . If she could n't listen to that , she wished they would let her shut her eyes tight till morning . Mother had promised to get up early on Monday ( Sunday always came when you 'd rather it would n't ) and cut out the dress and bonnet for the new doll before breakfast . Nellie had never had a pink dress . She had never even had a sunbonnet . Maybe , after a long time , she might get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always short , except Christmas Eve , which was longer than anything . She hoped it would be snowy this Christmas .

But if there was n't any snow , he had promised to take her for a climb to the top of Lost Turkey Hill . She had never been more than halfway up when she was picking huckleberries , but this time they would start early , with some bread and meat in their pockets , and climb to the very6162 VEIN OF IRONtop . Then they could look down into the gap between Thunder Mountain and Old Man Mountain . Oh , she wished Christmas would hurry up ! Mrs. Tiller , who kept a cake and candy store down in the village , had sent Grandmother some raisins and currants and citron for a fruit cake . Aunt Meggie was trying to save enough sugar and butter , pinch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Christmas , except Ada , because Mother said children could n't be expected to do without sweets . Childrenand old people , she had said , handing the sugar bowl to Grandmother . But Grandmother had replied that she was n't old enough yet to be childish . " Wait until I 'm a hundred , my dear . Do n't hurry me into my dotage . " Last Christmas ( it seemed miles away ! ) had been splendid . Ralph had given her the doll 's bedstead , and she had had a good package of fire-crackers for him . They had gone out together , and he had set off the fire-crackers , only not all at a time . He had shown her how to light one and let it go off a little and then stamp it out , so it would last longer . She had another package for him this year . His mother had to give him only useful presents , like shirts and stockings , and things to keep him warm when he had n't a greatcoat . Grandmother had knitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Father . He wore it over a flannel shirt , under his thin coat , and he said the cold never really got to him . Ralph was the brightest boy in school , though Grandmotherinsisted he was too headstrong . Already he was savingmoney to go to college , and he worked part of the day in Mr. Rowan 's machine shop . In summer he and his mother lived on the vegetables they raised in their back yard . Ralph was a fine gardener , too , but no matter how hard he workedTOWARD LIFE 63he could never put by enough , Father said , to take him to college . A gifted boy , though , might find some other way , and Father was teaching him everything that he could . Ralph was going to be a lawyer when he grew up . Though he was only twelve , he knew already what he wanted to be , and he read everything he could find about law and lawyers . He would make up all kinds of games with a trial in them , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trial for her life . She did n't know why , but that was the part she could act best . Janet would want to be the judge , but he would n't let her . He did n't like Janet . She fibbed , he said , and was a telltale . Blue eyes and yellow curls did n't make her any better to play with . She trotted after them wherever they went , and she was always begging him to make her a doll 's bedstead . There was that white spider again . Did spiders have ghosts ? Did they have skeletons ? Did they have hearts ? She must remember to ask Father when he woke up . But Ralph might know better than Father about things like spiders . There was a mouse , too , that crept out when it thought they were all asleep . She wondered if Aunt Meggie had caught it in her trap . Mother hated to hear them squeak when they were caught . But Grandmother did n't mind any more than Aunt Meggie . She said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why ? " Ada had asked , but nobody had answered . Only when she had asked a second time , Mother had replied sharply , " Your father must tell you . " Then she had asked over again , " Why , Father ? " and he had answered slowly , " God alone knows why , my child . " Father and Mother worried over such questions . Why God does this ? Why God does that ? What is the reason for everything ? But Grandmother and Aunt Meggie64 VEIN OF IRONknew straight off , without any thinking . Grandmother said she answered questions " out of conviction . " The wind was blowing loud and rough . She could hear it crashing through the trees , as if it were bringing snow . Lots of sticks would be shaken down . They would have to lie there till Monday , because nobody ever did any work , except cooking and making fires , on Sunday . Picking up sticks did n't look like work , but even if ' t was only useful play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel jumpy , she said , and she did n't like the taptap-tappingof the ivy on the window-pane . " I hope Aunt Abigail has plenty of cover , " she would say . Or , " Have the sheep sense enough to go into that shelter ? " Or , " Are you sure none of the chickens were shut out , Meggie ? " It did seem dreadful that their sheep had so little sense . They were old sheep , and Job , the pet ram , was almost as rheumatic as Grandmother . When Ada was little they had had more . One of the first things she could remember was going into the kitchen one morning in the midst of a spring blizzard and seeing a new lamb , wrapped in Grandmother 's red flannel underbody , lying on an old feather bed in front of the stove , while Aunt Meggie fed it from a rag dipped in a mixture of milk and water and a little sugar . That was the sort of recollection , she felt , that stayed with you till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live out in winter , like a bird or a sheep or a wild animal . She wondered if the small furry creatures in the woods could snuggle down under the dead leaves at night and keep the cold wind from nipping them . The wind was the worst . It sounded then as if it had blown off a bough . She hoped the wind would spare their oldest oak , " the pioneer , " even if it damaged the younger trees . So many bird and squirrel families would be madeTOWARD LIFE 65homeless if the storm stripped the pioneer . When you looked up in the branches you could see nests sprinkled like houses in a village , and in spring and summer the tree hummed all the time , Mother said , as if ' t were a harp in a breeze . Last year , when Aunt Meggie raised three turkeys ( though one of them was mistaken for a wild turkey and shot by a hunter , who took it away with him ) they would never roost anywhere but on that low-hanging bough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be frightened , out by Murderer 's Grave . You 'd think the hovel and the pigsty would be swept down into the gully , with all the pigs squealing . Grandmother said the church helped Mrs. Waters because , though she was a bad woman , Toby was not to blame for being an idiot . Well , she was glad , too , that she was n't an idiot . But why did God make idiots ? It seemed worse than making mice to be caught in traps . When she had tried to find an answer to that , Grandmother had replied tartly , " If you ask any more foolish questions , Ada , I shall be tempted to box your ears . " And Father had said over again , " God alone knows why , my child . " But , whatever God 's reason might be , it was a mercy that they lived almost in the village and not , like the Waterses , in a pigsty on the rim of a gully . They could n't be too thankful , Mother kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before , for a warm room and a good fire and plenty to eat . The words had a singing sound that Ada enjoyed , and they reminded her that the taste of sweetness was still somewhere far down inside her . ' T was nice , too , to feel Horace 's head , as soft as velvet , resting on her foot and keeping it cozy . If the evening did n't stop soon , she was going to slip down on the rug and let Horace be her pillow and sink away , away , while the flames66 VEIN OF IRONcrooned and the kettle sang and the shadows danced and the spider swung to and fro on his cobweb . Suddenly Father was saying , " It 's almost time for bed . Shall I read a page , Ada ? " " Oh , if you would , Father ! " She raised her head from the softness of Horace and sprang to her feet . " I want dreadfully to know if they caught Morton . " The leaves fluttered as John Fincastle opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He glanced at his mother 's face , furrowed into an expression of grim goodness , at Meggie 's cheerful features , which were still comely , at the drooping head of his wife , transfigured by the firelight into its old loveliness . A sigh passed his lips , but his voice when he began reading was strong and thrilling. " lu st , ' he said , I hear a distant noise . ' It is the rushing of the brook over pebbles , ' said one . It is the sough of the wind among the bracken , ' said another . It is the galloping of horse , ' said Morton to himself , his sense of hearing rendered acute by the dreadful situation in which he stood . God grant they may come as my deliverers ! ' " The pages rustled as they turned , and the book was closed . " He 's safe , my dear , until Monday . I 'll let Horace out for a minute , and then we 'll lock up and have prayers . " Every night Horace ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front hall on the sofa with the sagging bottom . The chamber door was left open , and sometimes Ada would be awakened by the nose of the hound on her cheek . " He 's had a bad dream , " she would think . " I reckon dogs have bad dreams just like other people . " Tonight , after she had said her prayers and slipped intoTOWARD LIFE 67her trundle-bed and drawn the blanket up to her chin , she dropped to sleep saying , " It is the sough of the wind among the bracken . " Those were glorious words to have in your head ; they seemed to go round by themselves . At midnight , when she awoke suddenly , they were still turning . Outside , the wind was blowing harder than ever . Could the last leaves hold on until morning ? Underneath the crashing and the whistling she could hear the murmur of the dying flames in the fireplace , and then the sudden squeak of the mouse in Aunt Meggie 's trap . She hoped Aunt Abigail knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps her Indian blood made her wise in such matters . Well , anyway , Flora would n't have heard about that . Rising softly , she picked up the new doll from beside Nellie , who was used to sleeping alone , and brought it to bed with her . Grandmother thought it was only silliness to pretend that things like trees and dolls had real feelings . But they may have , she thought ; you never can tell . Part TwoTHE SINGLE HEARTIYES , it was true , Ada thought , she could n't remember the time when they had not cared for each other . Ralph had always been there , no matter how far back she went , with his bright auburn head , his gay nut-brown eyes , his sudden smile that had a power over her heart . There was an Irish strain in his blood . Mother said this gave him his charm and his amused , friendly manner . Midway between the garden and the front porch , she stopped in the June sunshine and looked toward the rocky road , which plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly , as if it shied away from the houses . While she stood there she felt that the little girl of ten years before was pausing close beside her in the tall bright grass . She thought of this other Ada , who had never grown up , not as herself , but as a shadowy companion . She would be happy now , even though she was invisible , because the girl of twenty , who was herself and yet not herself , would be married to Ralph as soon as he had finished his law course . One year at college had used up whatever he had been able to put by , and even then he had worked as a clerk in a hotel at night and had sent home every penny he made to provide for his mother . After that , he had thought he would be obliged to give up the study of law and accept a position Mr. Rowan had offered him in his machine shop . But Father , who could do everything exceptearn a living , had made the way easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lee University , had engaged Ralph as his secretary for several hours every afternoon ; and Father had arranged with the Dean of the7172 VEIN OF IRONFaculty that all the classes of the law course might be taken in one year . " With Ralph 's wide reading and fine memory , he will be able to do the work , " Father had said . " The boy has a brilliant mind , he has a natural bent for the law , and he has read and remembered now more than most lawyers ever know and forget . It is not often , " he had concluded , " that life is so straight and so simple as this . " In front of her swallows circled over the steep roof from which shingles were peeling . When she moved nearer the porch , she could sec the outline of Mother 's head at the window , while a shadow darted as swiftly as a gray wing into her mind . All the past year Mother had suffered from an obscure malady , an injury to the spine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every day she sat from morning till night in a wheel-chair sent to her by one of Grandmother 's friends in the Ladies ' Aid Society . The strangest part to Ada was that she still wore her cheerful look and talked breathlessly , without stopping or waiting for a reply . She looked as pale now as a wax flower under the greenish light cast by the ivy , with her lovely head , which was still brown and glossy , turning as quickly as a bird 's when anyone came into the room . Presently the bulk of Grandmother 's figure moved toward the window . The girl could see her massive features , carved into granite fortitude , bending down over Mother . At eighty , Grandmother was still the strongest member of the family , except for her rheumatism . And the happiest , too , until Ralph came home from his year at college , and surprised that shy , startled ecstasy in Ada 's face when she looked at him . " Love , love , love , " she said over to herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . Sudden stillness dropped into her mind , and through this stillness there floated presTHESINGLE HEART 73ently the absurd recollection of the doll with china hair Father had brought her from Doncaster . Why should she think of that now ? Some minds are no better than ragbags , Grandmother had remarked disapprovingly . But there was Flora beside Nellie in the bedstead Ralph had carved , just as she had them tucked away in that old tin trunk in the attic . For she had never had the doll with real hair , and Flora still wore , even in bed , her pink sunbonnet . Aunt Meggie had promised her a doll . Then something had happened . She could n't think what it was . Had the hens refused to lay ? Had they needed the money for medicine ? Well , it did not matter now . It seemed silly that she should ever have wanted a doll so much . Grandmother thought it was because she was jealous of Janet . But it was n't . No , she had never been jealous of Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with her . Was that because she felt safe ? Was it because she knew that Janet had always wanted Ralph , but Ralph in his heart had always disliked Janet ? The other boys in Ironsideadmired her . It may have been because Ralph had never liked her that she ran after him . For it was no secret ; everybody but her parents had talked of her ways with men . " That was the trouble of a village , " Father had said . " All likes and dislikes are inbred until they become like the half-wit families over in Panther 's Gap . " Grandmother had added severely , " Too much tittle-tattle , that is the worst of it . " Then Mother had asked , " But what can you do ? If you 're different , you have to be sacrificed , just as they used to sacrifice living things on an altar . Heaven knows you were sacrificed , John . " Father had looked at her with his vague but hopeful smile . " Do n't make a martyr of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRON me to make one of myself . And a self-made martyr is a poor thing . " " I can never understand , " Grandmother had insisted , " what has got into the young folks nowadays . It looks to me as if they were clean daft , every one of them . Well , well , I reckon I 've outlived my time . Things were not like this when I was young . " " Nor when I was young , and that was n't so long ago , " Aunt Meggie had agreed . " If you 'd told us in the eighties that boys and girls would be so wild in 1911 , we 'd have laughed in your face . Mrs. Tiller was saying yesterday that some of the boys , sons of decent parents , too , think it manly to go up to Lightning Ridge to buy moonshine . Mrs. Mel- rose had to break up her daughter 's birthday party , she said , because several boys were unsteady on their feet . She thinks ' t is all this round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waltz is the only dance worth dancing , " Mother had laughed . " I adore it still , and I was so sorry for John when I found he had never learned even to heel and toe in his childhood . " " Mark my words , " Grandmother had retorted , " when customs like that come in , moral responsibility is the first thing to go . I may not live to see it , but remember what I have said when you are compelled to live in a world that has lost the sense of responsibility . I doubt if you 'll find it any more to your taste than the one you were brought up in . " " There 's a point in your argument , Mother , " Father had replied , after a pause . " I am inclined to believe that a man may be free to do anything he pleases if only he will accept responsibility for whatever he does . " Grandmother and Ada had exchanged a mystified look . It was n't always easy to decide how strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks . " I do n't know what you mean , John , " the old woman had rejoined tartly , " but I know very well what your grandfathermeant when he used to say , If you flosh the water , you will have scum without fish . ' " No , she was n't jealous of Janet  --  well , not what you would call really jealous . But there had been a queer twistingpain far down beneath a tight lid in her heart when Ralph had seemed to like Janet for a few weeks last summer . Janet might have all the pretty clothes she wanted , even pink nightgowns , which Grandmother and Aunt Meggie agreed were unrefined , and silk stockings for the day as well as the evening . She might even have a dogcart with red wheels and a high-stepping bay . All these things did not matter . But when it came to Ralph , Ada knew that she would n't give up without a struggle , that she would fight for her own . That was what Grandmother meant by the flaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart holds on to its own . " I wo n't let her have him , " she had resolved , " no matter what happens . " Then Janet and Ralph had stopped speaking to each other after a quarrel ( they were always fussing about trifles ) , and immediately Janet appeared to become infatuated with Hunt Patton , the son of a well-to-do farmer in the Shenandoah Valley . All winter they had been together from morning till midnight . But early in March , Hunt gave up his work in Judge Melrose 's office and returned to the farm . When he went away so hurriedly everybody was astonished that nothing was said of Janet 's engagement , that the very next week she should begin flirtingwith Charlie Draper . In April , Ralph went into Mr.76 VEIN OF IRONRowan 's big store and machine shop , which dealt in everything you could need on a farm , from a garden rake to a reaping machine or one of the new automobiles , and after that Janet was obliged to be friendly with him , on the surface at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only until he went to Washington and Lee in the autumn . She had been looking toward the house , and when she turned her head she saw that Ralph had entered the gate and was coming across the lawn , where the sheepmint in the grass gave out an aromatic scent when it was crushed . Whenever he came back , after even a brief absence , a sensation of freshness and surprise rushed over her , as if she had never seen him before  --  as if she had never seen anyone else . He was tall and thin and strong ; he was warm and sunburned and eager . " You 're early , " she said , smiling . When she was happy words seemed to stop coming . " I 'm on my way to work . I had to see you a minute . " They had turned away under the oaks , and she was in his arms while the whole June landscape and the unearthly blue of the mountains spun round them . " I simply had to see you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leanness and hardness of his body , as if his warm young flesh had turned to bone and muscle . Suddenly , she felt that she wanted to stoop and kiss the dark freckles and the reddish down on the back of his hand . But all she could bring herself to say was , " I know . But you must n't be late . " He laughed . " Do you want me to go ? " She shook her head while a quivering sweetness ran over her . " I know you don't. " he said presently . " I can tell byTHE SINGLE HEART 77your eyes even when you do n't speak . They are dark gray in the shade , but in the sunshine they are exactly the color of huckleberries . That 's why I like you in that blue dress . " Her glance dropped quickly . It was n't that she was shy , she told herself , only she could n't let him break down some deep reserve he had struggled against ever since he had known she loved him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . " I have two blue cotton dresses , but both are worn out . I wish , " she added , " I had something better than my pink gingham to wear to the dance on Wednesday . " " You 'll look all right . You 'll look right in anything . " " Janet has a white organdie . Her mother ordered it from a catalogue . " " It does n't matter . You 'll look better than Janet . " " But Janet 's lovely . She has real blue eyes . " Why had shesaid that ? Was it to hurt herself ? Was it to make himpraise her ? " I do n't care about Janet 's eyes . I like yours better . " Takingher face in his hands , which were eager and strong , he began kissing it very slowly all over , from the backward wave of dark hair to the full white throat . " There 's something about you . I do n't know what it is , and I do n't care . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you 've got faults , then I like faults . I like a blunt nose better than a sharp one . I like a large mouth better than a small one . I like sunburn better than a peach-bloom skin . Sometimes I think I fell in love with you because of those silly freckles on the top of your nose . " His arm slipped to her bosom , crushing her to him . " Well , I ought to go . I 'll come as early as I can tonight . " He took a step away and turned back to kiss her again . " It wo n't be much more than a year , " he said . " I 'll be through by next summer , and then I 'll go into somebody's78 VEIN OF IRONoffice , perhaps down in Queenborough . Would you like to live in Queenborough ? " Her eyes dwelt on him . " Anywhere with you . I do n't care , except for Mother , and of course Father . " " Well , a year is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . " No , a year is n't long . " " But it 's hell waiting . " She laughed tenderly . " If Grandmother heard that , she would n't want me to marry you . She thinks all the young people today are headed to ruin . " Then she caught his arm . " Did you ask Judge Melrose to lend us his buggy for the dance ? Flow are we going out to the Padgetts ' ? " " I forgot to tell you . Janet wants us to go with her in her father 's spring-wagon . " " I thought we were going alone . " " I wish we were , but I did n't see how I could refuse . While I 'm working for Mr. Rowan I have to be nice to Janet . Do you know , he is going to buy an automobile , " he added in an interested tone . " Is he ? " she answered indifferently . " I 'd like to see Janet in the sort of motor veils and goggles they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the dance ? " " Charlie Draper . And she has asked Willie Andrews to take a girl who is spending the night with her . " " That 's Bessie McMurtry . " " It 's all right , is n't it ? But why do you always get miffed when I mention Janet ? The only quarrels we 've ever had were about her . " " I do n't . " Her face felt scorched  --  but it was true , though she denied it . Once she had left him at a picnic for a whole afternoon because Janet had dared him to take a drink ofTHE SINGLE HEART 79moonshine whisky with Willie Andrews and he had n't had the courage to refuse . No man , he had said to her then , would " refuse to take a dare from a girl . " " You do n't ? " he laughed teasingly . " Well , you do n't , darling . It 's all right , is n't it ? " He had started away , and when he looked round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , which changed from nut-brown to yellow as the sun touched them . Then , while she hesitated , the sudden smile broke on his lips , and she felt that her heart was a wheel turning . " Oh , yes , it 's all right , " she answered in a voice that vibratedwith tenderness . At the house she saw him stop for a minute to speak to Horace , who awoke from a nap on the sunken millstone at the foot of the steps and greeted him with the air of an elder statesman . I ought to go in , she told herself , but they would see that I am all in a flutter . There was plenty of work to do helping Aunt Abigail . Or , perhaps , Grandmother would be waiting on the kitchen porch beside the big splint basket . Grandmother liked to lean on the garden fence , or walk along the paths , if the dew was not on the weeds , and watch her gather the early vegetables , while they talked of the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort to steady her mind she walked over to the sagging gate which failed even to keep out the hens . Inside the broken palings , once straight and white , Aunt Meggie 's sunflowers were shooting up in tall rows which would bloom in July and August . Beyond Aunt Abigail Geddy 's cabin the narrow hayfield ran on until it sank and was lost in the stony hill , where three sheep and two lambs were nibbling the high weeds . Job was gone , but a sprightly young ram had in-80 VEIN OF IRONherited his place . From where she stood she could barely distinguish the huddled gray stones from the browsing sheep . Though they had had the little flock only three seasons , the wool had come in well for Grandmother 's knitting and to make warm , light interlinings for several of the old quilts . Grandmother and Aunt Abigail Geddy were still as good as ever at washing wool , carding , and spinning . Aunt Abigail and Marcellus sheared the sheep , but Grandmother always watched because she said she couldn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grandmother looked after everything , and Father said she could feed a whole family on what Aunt Abigail threw away . When she was a child they never saw a store , she would say proudly . Their coffee was made of sweet potatoes , just as in wartime , and once or twice her father had been obliged to write his sermons in pokeberry juice . Yet she had been as happy as she was after she learned to crave real coffee . I hope she has taught me how to live , Ada mused , as if she were smoothing out some tumult within , some exultationand overflow of the heart . I hope she has taught me how to make the right kind of wife . There was no fear of poverty in her mind . She was prepared to meet the future on its own terms , and to take what it gave . If only she had Ralph , she could find happiness , and no one could be easier to make happy than Ralph . Grandmother called urgently , and Ada turned away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard she could see the nearer valley laced with the crystal blue of streams , and beyond the valley the throbbing azure light on the mountains . God 's Mountain ranged far and free toward the west , beyond the heavenly twins , as Father called Rain and Cloud Mountains . But directly in front of her the SINGLE HEART 81dark brow of Thunder Mountain frowned through its summerfoliage , with the colored hills flowing away from it fold on fold . I never knew before that happiness hurt , she thought . Happiness like this hurts . Suddenly , from an old lilac tree by the side of the house , a bird 's song sprinkled the air with joy . It was a catbird . The pair ( was it the same pair ? ) came back every spring . IION the porch her grandmother was waiting . " You must run down to the store , Ada , for a box of mustard . ' T was all used up last night . " " Is Mother worse ? " " That stitch in her back is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last two nights . " " I 'll go straight down . It wo n't take me any time . " At the sound of her voice Horace peered inquiringly from the side of the house , shook himself twice , and ambled after her when she hurried through the gate into the road. r ' As she went on , picking her way among stones , Thunder Mountain seemed to push back the brushy hills and move nearer . She had seen the mountain in all aspects and in all seasons , dark-browed , frowning , remote , or ringed with flame while terrified deer and the humble furred and featheredcreatures of the forest fled , with the eagles , the buzzards , and the hawks , from the furnace that had once sheltered them . But today she felt only the June softness of the fields , sown with small powdery daisies which looked as if they had been plucked from the stem and strewn over the long grass . Wild lupine was still running in a bluish fire down by Smiling Creek , and clusters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and softness and color streamed within and became a part of her mood . But ( Mother was in pain . Resolutely , prompted by some inheritedinstinct , she accepted the fact of pain as the deeper- .. reality . When she reached the church she threw a glance over the field to the hovel and the evil-smelling pigsty , where Mrs. Waters and Toby scratched the hard soil on the edge of the82THE SINGLE HEART 83ravine . She had never spoken to Mrs. Waters , and she tried not to look at her if they met in the road . Though she pitied the old woman ( it seemed so hopeless to be old and bad together ) , she was embarrassed when they passed each other , as if a bodily disfigurement had been thrust under her eyes . Years ago , she had wondered how Mrs. Waters , who was then robust and not ugly , with plump legs in tight black stockings that bulged over her shoes , was able to live and even gain flesh on a pigsty alone . That earlier banishment , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , differed in some curious particular from the present self-inflicted retreat . In the past she had at least kept her curves in those places where curves were desirable , and she had never failed in summer to flaunt a few gaudy blossoms , usually prince's-feather or cockscomb , before the door of her hovel . One spring , it is true , she had come down with pneumonia at planting-time . Then the church had paid Uncle Beadnell Geddy to hoe her garden and to look after the hogs which Toby would neglect whenever he was given an opportunity . For a week or more the woman had lingered near death . It was only natural , Ada realized now , that Ironside should have been divided between relief over the removal of sin and reluctance to accept the burden of Toby , who would remain an idiot boy if he lived to be eighty . Dr. Updike had attendedMrs . Waters as faithfully as if she were one of the redeemed ; Grandmother had made mustard plasters and sage tea , and had carried a soft pillow and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society had taken up a collectionand had engaged Uncle Beadnell 's wife , Aunt Pomona , to sit up at night . But the minister and the elders , supported by the entire congregation , including Grandmother84 VEIN OF IRONand Dr. Updike , had decided that she could not be buried among professing Christians in the churchyard , but must sleep beside the hanged , and no doubt damned , sinner in Murderer 's Grave . Even Mother had thought that the decisionwas " merely human , " and Father had remarked , " If they turned her out of the church , it is scarcely logical to expectthem to welcome her in the churchyard . Dead Presbyteriansare still Presbyterians , only more so . " " Why is it , Father , " little Ada had asked , after pondering the fact , " that Mrs. Waters never has any visitors in the daytime ? Willie Andrews says she sees company late at night after her lamp is turned down . They are tall dark people , and Willie is sure they 're witches . Are there any men witches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Perhaps they are charitablepersons who come to bring her food or swill for her hogs . Let us hope , " he had concluded , " that Mrs. Waters may live long enough to make peace with God and the con-gregation . " He had had his wish fulfilled , though only in part . If Mrs. Waters had made peace , it was with God alone , and there was a flaw , or so it appeared , in that tardy reconciliation . After her illness she had fallen into a decline ; her bouncing curves had flattened out ; the dark company had ceased its nocturnal visits . Presently she had begun to beg for broken bread or hogwash at the back doors in the village . There had been talk of putting her in the almshouse . But the county almshouse was too proud to receive women of a certain character , and at last the village fathers had banished her , on a bare pittance , to her hovel out in the fields .

Like the shadow of a crow , the image of Mrs. Waters flapped over Ada 's mind and was gone . Only a mild wonder remained . Was religion like that ? How could she tell ? How could anyone tell ? she asked herself , looking at Horace ( Mother said dogs were dumb poets ) , who raised his nose from the cow manure in the road and gazed up at her . She passed the church and the churchyard . Light shadows were playing over the tombstones . Birds were singing high up in the trees . Uncle Beadnell was trimming the grass on the graves with a sickle . Close by the church , they were painting the shutters and small square porch of the parsonage . Mrs. Black 's hollyhocks were gay and bright , and the climbing red rose on the porch was in full bloom . They had it tied back while old Mr. Potter and his son were painting the posts . Mrs. Black , who was watching them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a small , active , managing woman , so thin that people said you could see every bone in her body , with a shiny look that ran over one like a swarm of ants when she was excited . But her heart was too big for her , Grandmother insisted ; she would go out of her way to do a kindness to anybody . " She 's not so well today , " Ada answered . " I 'm going for mustard . " She passed the doctor 's house , and saw him coming out in an alpaca coat with a crape band on the sleeve . He was in mourning for Mrs. Updike , who had died in the winter . But his stout figure and ruddy face , with the beaming smile that warmed the hearts of his patients , appeared as sanguine as ever . Though he had never complained of his marriage , Ada had heard that his wife had been a trial to the flesh , and that86 VEIN OF IRONin her last years she had formed the habit of drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to drop in to see your mother on my rounds , " he said .

" She passed the big white frame house of the Rowans andsaw Janet in a dress of green linen watching her from anupper window . She passed Mrs. McBride 's small cottage , lost in rows of potatoes , tomatoes , beets , and turnip-tops thatwere running to yellow . She passed the post office , where several horses were tethered to the hitching-bar in the street . At the end of the square , which was bordered by wire-grass and dandelions , she went into the general store , and waited for Mr. Robinson to finish wrapping up a parcel before hegave her the box of mustard . " Hope nobody is sick up at your place , " Mr. Robinsonsaid . " Is your mother feeling bad again ? " " She has that pain in her back . It comes and goes all thetime . " " I 'm sorry to hear that . I 'd hoped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustard , she went out into the streetand stopped to draw breath . I did n't know how fast I waswalking , she thought . Missing Horace , she looked about her and found him lying in the speckled shade of a younglocust tree . The tree was in blossom , and she paused a moment to breathe in the fragrance . Ironside , so bleak andhostile in winter , was charming in summer , with its leafy shade trees and the hollyhocks and roses in the front gardens . " I know you 're feeling the heat , Horace , " she said , " butwe must start back right away . " THE SINGLE HEART 87As she reached the Rowans ' house , Janet came running down the walk to the gate . " Oh , Ada , come in and see my new dress . I 've just unpackedit , and it 's too lovely for words . " " I ca n't , Janet , not now . Grandmother is waiting for this mustard .

The only flaws in her loveliness were two front teeth that projected from her short upper lip and a dimpled chin that receded abruptly . Yet even these faults had worked , oddly enough , Ada thought , to her advantage . " She 's the living image of Queen Victoria as a girl , " Mrs. Rowan declared . " That engraving in our parlor of Princess Victoria in a tall comb , picking up a rose from a table , might have been taken from Janet . " " Oh , do come in , " Janet begged . " No , I ca n't stop now . " Ada walked on , and Janet opened the gate and fell into step at her side . " What are you going to wear to the dance , Ada ? Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just finished , and they are going to put up Chinese lanterns and chairs and tables around the walls . " Ada sighed . " I have n't anything to wear but my pink gingham . " Ralph had said she would look prettier than Janet in all her finery . Still , she wished she had something better . The recollection of the pink gingham pinned on the clotheslineat home floated into her thoughts , swayed upward in88 VEIN OF IRONthe breeze , was puffed out in rosy billows , and covered , in a single immense wave , the whole field of vision . It did n't seem fair , she reflected , being human , that Janet , who was so lovely , should have finer clothes than any other girl in the village . No , it was n't fair . Yet Janet might think it was n't fair that Ada had Ralph , whom Janet wanted more than she had ever wanted white organdie . But , even then , Ralph was n't the only man Janet wanted and had run after . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who went away so suddenly  --  too suddenly , the malicious old woman had whispered , for Janet 's good . Only women , Ada had noticed , were severe with Janet . " I ca n't come any farther , " Janet said when they had passed the churchyard , " but I want you to see my dress . This is Monday . There is n't much time . " " I 'll come tomorrow if Mother is n't worse . I 'll run down in the morning . " " You 're going with us , are n't you ? Ralph said you would . " " He told me you 'd asked us to go in the spring-wagon . " " I thought we could all crowd in . When did Ralph ask you ? " " Days ago . I ca n't remember when . " " He would have taken me , " Janet said , with abrupt vehemence , " only we 'd had a falling-out . " Looking at her in surprise , Ada remembered the Sunday morning when Janet had had her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was older now , and the fibs had matured into lies . " I do n't believe he ever thought of asking you , " Ada retorted , while her face , flushed already from the sun , burned to a flame . THE SINGLE HEART 89 " Oh , he would have , only we had a falling-out , " Janet repeated . " He felt dreadfully when I told him this morning that I was going with Charlie Draper . " She bit her lip and her voice trembled with irritation . " Oh , I wish I could go away ! I 'm so tired of Ironside . Do you ever feel that you want to go away and never come back ? " " I 'm going away next year . Ralph and I are going to be married as soon as he has settled in Queenborough . " Her tone was defiant , as if she were flinging back Janet 's falsehood . Yet she had not meant to tell anyone , not even the minister , until next autumn . It was unwise , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? was it jealousy ? ) had been more than she could bear . The instant after she had betrayed her secret she began to regret it . " I ought to have known better , " she thought in self-reproach , " but I suppose I 'll never know better than to let Janet hurt me . Even when I know she is lying , she still hurts me . Well , no matter . . . If only she will leave us alone . " For a minute Janet 's breath came and went with a rustling sound , as if something alive in her bosom struggled to break out . " Even when we were children I was the only girl Ralph would play with , " Ada added . " You and he always quar-reled . " Janet laughed , without effort apparently . " Well , you 're welcome to him , " she said . " I hope you 'll be happy . Yes , it 's true we were always falling out . He was never , even when we were children , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You will come to see my dress , wo n't you ? " " Yes , I 'll come . I 'll come in the morning . " Ada 's anger had faded , though she still blamed herself for betraying her secret . " You wo n't repeat what I 've told you ? " she asked 90 VEIN OF IRON " Oh , no , I sha n't repeat it . After all , you 're my best friend , are n't you ? It was natural that you should tell me first . " That was a nice way to take it . Janet had her pleasant side when she was n't crossed , and it seemed that Ada 's confidencehad not ruffled her temper . She did look rather like Princess Victoria in the old engraving , with her small stubbornmouth , red as a cardinal flower , above her childish receding chin . " I 'll keep the dress in the spare room for you to see , " she added sweetly . " Be sure to come early . " IIIHEN she passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Adafelt she had entered an invisible networkof affection and security and that something more which is the essence of fortitude . The pine planks of the floor splintered under her feet ; the plaster was sifting in a yellow dust from a crack in the ceiling ; the walls were streaked and splotched under the peeling paint  --  hut the unity of the house , the way of life , had survived the pi cesses of destruction .

But I suppose it would take every minute he has ( . o keep the place from falling to pieces . Horace stopped to drink from the earthenware bowl in one corner , and , after quenching his thirst , looked up at her with moist velvety eyes and his attractive dog 's smile .

When she did not go upstairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wagging tail , into her mother 's chamber . Grandmother was standing in the middle of the floor , erect from the waist up , but bent slightly in her rheumatic hip . She stood much of the time , because her joints were more painful after she rested , and she believed that it was a mistake to give in to infirmities . " Sit with your mother while I make the plasters , " she said . " She has n't touched a morsel today , and she 's trying to sip a glass of milk . " 9192 VEIN OF IRON " It 's delicious milk , " Mary Evelyn said in her excited voice from the wheel-chair . Ever since her illness began Dr. Updike had sent her a pitcher of milk from his Jersey cows every day , and she insisted that it had kept her alive . She sipped very slowly , holding up the glass first in one wasted hand and then in the other , and raising her head as a bird does when it drinks . " Yes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered . " Did you see anyone in the village ? " " Nobody but Janet . Oh , Mother , I told Janet ! I did n't mean to , but she made me angry , and I told her . " " Did you , dear ? Well , I suppose it wo n't make any difference . " In her wrapper of lavender lawn , with a faded purple shawl over her shoulders , Mary Evelyn looked as transparent as a shadow against the greenish light at the window . Only her voice was strong , animated , and intensely alive . " Your grandmother does n't like Janet , but I doubt whether there 's any harm in her . " " She promised me she would n't tell anyone . " " Even if she does , it wo n't matter . Everyone knows that you and Ralph were made for each other . It makes me happy when I think of it , just as if I were living my own youth over again . " " All the same I wish I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sip your milk . " " Yes , I know . " Mary Evelyn raised the glass to her lips . " You and Ralph have known each other so long and you are so much alike that you ought to understand without having to explain . It 's a pity you are both quick-tempered . But you will have to be patient . Women always have to be patient . " " His mother is n't . Does it matter very much that I can'tTHE SINGLE HEART 93make myself like his mother ? She made Ralph unhappy when he was little . He used to say that he felt closer to you than he did to her . " " She 's a good woman according to her lights , but your father says "  --  Mary Evelyn laughed at the recollection  --  " that her religion has curdled . Calvinism does curdle in some natures . I know how angry I used to feel when she kept Ralph in all Saturday evening because he had n't had time to learn his answers in the Catechism . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " If I ever have children , I sha n't make them learn the Catechism . And it is n't only about that . I believe Mrs. McBride enjoys making Ralph miserable . He has n't told her about us because he knows she will be sure to say the wrong thing . Do you think I shall have to call her Mother McBride ' ? Nothingwill ever make me call anyone but you Mother . " " I 'm afraid she 'll expect it , darling . But that is n't really important . You must n't say she likes to make Ralph unhappy . You must n't even let yourself think it . " " It 's true . And Ralph does n't really love her . You ca n't make yourself love people . " " But he 's working to make money for her . He told me he would give her every penny he made in Mr. Rowan 's store . It ought to take care of her while he is at Washington and Lee . " " That 's because of the obligation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being his mother . But it is n't because he loves her . You can do a great deal for a person without love . She tried to stand in his way even about the law . There 's some bent in her , he says , that makes her recoil to the contrary whenever he wants to do a thing . It is n't exactly spite , but it works the same way . " 94 VEIN OF IRONGrandmother Fincastle brought the plasters and applied them to Mary Evelyn 's back under the lawn wrapper and the muslin chemise . " Let them burn well , " she said . " Do you want me for anything , Grandmother ? " Ada asked . " Not just yet . Stay with your mother until the plasters burn too hot . Meggie will give you the peas to shell while you 're waiting . Does that feel right , Mary Evelyn ? " " Perfectly right , " Mary Evelyn answered sweetly , though she shifted the plasters as soon as her mother-in-law had taken the empty glass and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in with the peas in a yellow bowl . " Would you like me to iron your pink gingham , Ada ? " " Oh , Aunt Meggie , if you have time ! You iron so beautifully . " As her aunt turned away , she said a little wistfully , " You never wore gingham to a party when you were a girl , Mother . " " No , dear , we wore a great deal of mousseline-de-soie . That was all the fashion when I was a girl . But your pink gingham looks very well on you . " " Aunt Meggie says you were perfectly beautiful when you were young . " " That was long ago . " " Father thinks you have n't changed . " Mary Evelyn smiled . " He sees me as I used to be . He never really looks at the outside of anything . But he has to give his whole mind to his book . That is his life 's work . Each volume has taken many years , and he has still two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Mother . Three yearsago , when his third volume came out , nobody , at least nobody in America , seemed to take any notice . " " More than you think noticed it , Ada . There were letters , you remember , from philosophers in Europe . " " They are so far away they do n't sound as if they were real . Is the plaster too strong ? " " No , it 's my skin . Everything hurts it . " " Your nerves are like that too . It must have been hard on you when you first came to live at Ironside . " " I had to learn . Everyone has to learn . Then I 'd just lost your two little brothers . It did n't matter whether I had things or went without . " " Aunt Meggie says you were always in high spirits . " " I had to choose between high spirits and low spirits , and I chose what I thought would be easier on others . Those first years were a trial , but gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got used to their being bad . You were only a baby , and you ca n't remember the time when there was n't enough to eat in the house . It was then I fell into the habit of laughing too much . A light spirit , Aunt Abigail called me . " Her mouth twitched convulsively , while Ada stopped shelling the peas and bent over her . " Is the pain worse , Mother ? " " No , it is n't the pain . I was thinking . " She made a sudden gesture as if she were brushing away a recollection . Then animation quivered through her nerves in a spasm , and she sprang upright in her chair . " You could never guess , " she said in a changed voice , " what was the hardest thing to get used to . After the death of my babies , the hardest thing was having to do without running water in the house . Even going hungry was less of a trial . There were times when I 'd have given years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRON water running into a bathtub . Your grandmother and Meggie have the kind of skin that nothing irritates . They could wash with homemade soap in cold water ( though your grandmother was fond of her warm bath ) , but I used to chap and have chilblains that first winter . Your grand- mother bound up my heels in mutton tallow , and when she could n't get Castile soap for me , she tried her hand at boil- ing down the tallow and scenting it with rose-leaves . Aunt Abigail began then bringing in the big tub every morning to fill with pails of warm water . After they saw how I suffered , they never forgot to keep my kettle steaming on the trivet in winter and the stove in summer . " " I like to splash in cold water . It 's the first thing I do when I get out of bed . " " You have the Fincastle skin . It 's a blessing because it makes life so much simpler , like the Fincastle constitution . That gives you your fine color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother . " " You would n't say that , darling , if you knew everything . Many and many a time I 've been no better than a thorn in the flesh . Nothing is more trying than nerves to people who have none . " " They love you . " " That has helped rLove has been stronger than religion . But they would smile if they knew how much of my courage depends on little things . These little things mean more than themselves . They mean an attitude of soul , a ceremony of living . Your grandmother could never understand that my blue bowl has helped me more than morning prayers . For me , bare Presbyterian doctrine was not enough . I needed a ritual . That is why I have never , not even when we were poorest , let myself think poor . That is why I havenever failed to put the crocheted mats on the table , and the candlesticks , with or without candles , and the flowers or berries in the blue bowl . " " I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm like you . " " Well , I 've been happy , dear . In spite of everything , I'vebeen happy . But it was a hard struggle at times . I like tolook ahead for you and think that your life will be easier . " IVTHE Rowans ' hall was fragrant with the smell of hot gingerbread when Mrs. Rowan , wearing an apron over her fresh print dress , met Ada at the door and told her to run upstairs . She was a stout , unshapely woman , with flaxen hair just going gray , smooth pink cheeks , and eyes like periwinkles that had been rained on . Janet was her only child , and since she should never have been without a baby at her rich bosom , she had spent an immoderate maternal sentiment upon a single daughter . Like all the wives of the upper Valley , she was a conscientious housekeeper ; her drip coffee and salt-rising bread and her " light hand " for sponge cake were celebrated even in that region of plain thinking and good living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said as cheerfully as if she had not spoiled her husband 's digestion and her daughter 's disposition . " I 'll bring you a glass of lemonade and a piece of gingerbread as soon as it 's done . Janet has n't been herself for the last day or two . She wo n't touch a morsel at the table , so I 'm trying to make her take a bite between meals . I ca n't imagine why in the world she should be in the sulks now , and her father and I are driven almost out of our wits trying to think of something that will please her . I 've just been up to see about her . Running up and down stairs at my age , " she added , pushing her hair back with her wrist , " is no joke . " " She asked me to come and see her dress , " Ada answered , while her gaze wandered over the spotless hall and staircase and through the open door of the parlor , where the dim light rippled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table . THE SINGLE HEART 99 " Yes , I 've laid it out on Janet 's bed . She was wild with pleasure when it first came , but she 's so moody that nothing ever pleases her for very long . " " She has asked us to go to the dance with her . " " I know . She was going to take a party in the springwagon . But this morning she said she was n't sure she wanted to go . I should n't worry about that , though . She always goes contrary at the last minute . " " I know she 'll be the prettiest girl there , " Ada said , because she knew nothing else would cheer poor Mrs. Rowan so much . " But Aunt Meggie says you were prettier than Janet when you were young . " To her astonishment , Mrs. Rowan appeared vaguely offended . " Oh , no , I could n't touch Janet , " she rejoined stiffly . " There 's never been a girl in Ironside who could hold a candle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeanie ' after me even when she was little . It seemed too common a name for her . It 's a pity she would n't study ; but you ca n't have everything . After our sending her away to boarding-school for two years , she does n't seem to know as much as you learned at home . " Ada frowned . " Father taught me . " " Yes , I know . I 'm not denying that your father is a scholar . Mr. Rowan says you can know a great deal withoutbeing sound in doctrine . Everybody thinks he 's done as well as a college by Ralph McBride . That 's a fine boy , " she continued . " Judge Melrose would have taken him into his office this summer , but Ralph 's mother insisted on his working for Mr. Rowan because the salary is higher . There 's Janet calling now . Yes , honey , I 'm sending her right up . It 's a blessing the child has n't inherited my prattling tongue . " 98100 VEIN OF IRONYes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended the stairs . There was no denying , however , that the silence of her pouting red lips could be eloquent . " Oh , it 's you ! " she exclaimed as Ada entered , looking round from the window , where she was drying her hair in the sunshine . " Wait a minute . I 'll show you my dress as soon as my hair stops dripping . " " What a pity you have to put it up . " " I 'm going to let one large curl hang on my shoulder . That fashion has come in again . " " Well , it 's nice for girls who have curls like yours . " Ada turned to the organdie flounces on the bed and took up the blue and pink ribbons . " Oh , how lovely ! " she exclaimed . Janet laughed with pleasure while she tossed back her hair ( it was like a spray of silver gilt , Ada thought ) over the checked apron she had slipped round her shoulders . " There are roses at the waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artificial one , in my hair . Mother wants me to wear a natural rose as she used to do . She has a perfect half-blown bud she 's saving on her rosebush . But nobody wears natural flowers any longer . " Ilcr sullen mood had vanished ; she was fresh and animated for the moment at least . " It 's a pity you have n't anything but that everyday dress . If you were smaller , I might lend you something of mine . " " Oh , I could n't . " Ada flushed and shook her head . " My pink gingham is good enough . I ca n't help it if it is an everyday dress . " An everyday dress and an everyday figure , she thought , glancing into the handsome mirror over the dressing-table . Above Janet 's face , like a young moon in an empty sky , Ada 's own features spun suddenly into vision . A perfectly good face , she said to herself , with a laugh , but more pleasTHESINGLE HEART 101ant than pretty when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contour , like the picture of a head on the prow of a ship . " There 's Mother , " Janet said in an angry whisper . " I wanted to talk to you alone , but she never leaves me a minute in peace . This morning she tried to make me swallow sulphur and molasses . " Panting from her exertion , Mrs. Rowan pushed open the door with her foot , and brought in the lemonade and gingerbreadon a painted tray . " I stopped to rinse out your best stockings , " she said , as she put the tray on the table where Janet could reach it . " Alberta 's hands are so rough , I was afraid she might tear them . " Silk stockings too ! Ada thought , with a stab of envy . How lovely it must be to wear silk stockings to a dance ! Her own best pair ( a gift from Aunt Meggie at Christmas ) was woven of a fine mixture of lisle thread and cotton . " I wonder how it feels to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her mind on the future , " Some day I shall know . " Mrs. Rowan was pouring lemonade into tall amber glasses . " Well , I 've never had any myself . We were too poor when I grew up to bother about what kind of stockings we wore as long as we were n't barefooted . But Janet has so many she wo n't even take the trouble to darn them . " " She 'll have to marry a rich man , " Ada said , thinking of Ralph , who was so poor that he had his shoes half-soled until they were dropping to pieces . " Oh , Father will take care of that , " Janet retorted . The doting bliss in her mother 's look faded to anxiety . " He will as long as he is able , honey , " she replied . " But your father is n't so well off as he once was . I know he102 VEIN OF IRON THE SINGLE HEART 103worries to think what would become of you , with your expensivetastes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what could possibly happen to him ? " Janet inquired . " He 's as strong as an ox . No , I do n't want any gingerbread . Just give me a sip of lemonade . " Mrs. Rowan seemed disappointed . " I made it the way you like it , Janet , with plenty of butter . " " Well , I do n't want it now , " the girl returned , so pettishlythat Ada could see she was longing to be rid of her mother 's attentions . " I wish you would n't keep poking things at me . " " I declare , I do n't know what is the matter with her , " Mrs. Rowan remarked helplessly . " She is n't often like this . You 'll take a piece , wo n't you , Ada ? " she asked almost timidly . " Of course I will . But I 'd rather take it home with me . Grandmother has such a sweet tooth . " " No , you eat this now with your lemonade . I 'll wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the hall table . " Her tone was sprightly again . " Well , I 'd better be going down if there is n't anything I can do . Poor Alberta is crying with toothache , but I ca n't persuade her to have her tooth pulled . If you want anything before dinner , just call me . " As soon as she had left the room and her heavy tread was heard descending the stairs , Janet flew to the door and turned the key in the lock . " I thought she 'd never go , " she breathed impatiently . " I never can talk before Mother . " " She 's so devoted to you , Janet . It makes me feel sorry for her . " " I know . I love her , too , but she fusses over me until I feel as if I should scream . " " What is it you have to tell me ? " " Nothing much . Only some of the boys went up to Lightning Ridge yesterday , after they stopped work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the loft tomorrow night . Of course , it 's just for fun . They do n't mean anythingbut a joke . Willie Andrews started it , and you know how he is . " " But they ought n't to . Nobody has anything but lemonadeat a barn dance . The Padgetts would n't like it . " " Tommy Padgett is one of them . He is going to fix a table up in the loft because his mother wo n't let him put anything in the punch . " " How do you always hear things ? " " Oh , the boys tell me . They know I wo n't give them away . You must n't say a word about it , you know . " " Who are the others ? " " Charlie Draper would n't go . But there was Fred Robinson , and there was Ralph McBride . " Ada started and put down the glass of lemonade she was holding . " What made Ralph go ? " she asked . " He ca n't touch that whisky without its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . That 's why they do n't drink anything . " Janet laughed . " Oh , the boys were teasing Ralph . You know Ralph ca n't bear to be teased . I suppose Willie Andrewsdared him to go . But he 's all right today . I saw him when I went to speak to Father in the office . " " Well , it may be just fun . I do n't know . But why did n't you stop them ? That moonshine is too strong . " Janet shook her head . " I 'd rather be anything than a killjoy . " That was meant for her , Ada told herself , with a flash of104 VEIN OF IRON anger . Janet thought she was a killjoy . Well , no matter . . . Beyond the window a cloud of bees had settled on a blossom- ing locust tree , and she thought , I never saw bees so golden . " Would n't you like to have some pink roses tomorrow ? " Janet asked sweetly . " Mother will give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . " " If I can come for them , but there 's so much to do at home . Mother has been sick , and neither Grandmother nor Aunt Abigail can stoop to pick up things . " " I should think you 'd need a more active servant . " " Aunt Abigail stays for her cabin and meals . She does n't do much , and we have to bring in all the wood . But it 's a help having her in the kitchen . Anyway , she 's like one of the family . She 'll never leave us as long as she lives . " " That 's the trouble , " Janet remarked , " with family serv- ants . They always hang on after they 've ceased to be useful . I 'm glad we have n't any old ones left . Then , if I do n't see you before tomorrow evening , Mother will send the wagon at half-past eight . " There was n't any reason in the world , Ada thought , de- scending the stairs , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , it was foolish of those boys to go up to Lightning Ridge , but then , were n't young people , especially boys , always doing things that appeared foolish ? Ralph was only twenty-two . His mother had been too strict with him as a child . When he became a man , Father said , he would feel less need to assert his personality . And , strangely enough , this headstrong will was one of the quali- ties in Ralph that moved her most deeply . There was some- thing childlike and helpless in his defiance . She felt the wish to protect him in the very moment when she surrendered . THE SINGLE HEART 105Well , she would n't change him if she could . She loved him for what he was . On the hall table she saw the neatly folded red and white napkin , and as she picked it up Mrs. Rowan came out of the dining-room . " I put in some sponge cake for your mother . It is n't so rich as gingerbread , and I hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Yours is always as light as a feather . " " How did you leave Janet ? She has n't been a bit like herself . You 'd never believe that she has one of the sweetest dis-positions . " " Anybody would be cheerful with that lovely dress . I never saw anything so perfect as the sash with those artificial flowers . " " You 'd think she 'd be pleased , but she takes everything for granted . " " That 's because she does n't know what it is to do with-out . " Mrs. Rowan sighed so heavily that her stiff apron rustled . " I hope she never will . Only sometimes "  --  her voice quavered  --  " Iwonder if doing things for people is the best way to make them happy . " From the front porch Ada looked back with a kind of stem sympathy . Though she felt sorry for Mrs. Rowan , who tried so hard to please , she distrusted the unbridled motherlovethat had spoiled Janet . " Oh , she 'll be all right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll forget she did n't know what she wanted . " VSTOPPING where the path twisted away from the churchyard , Ada unfolded the napkin and broke off an end of the gingerbread . I 'll give it to Toby , she thought . Grandmother would like him to have it . Across the field , she saw Mrs. Waters squatting between the rows of her cabbages . Toby was not in sight , but Ada called to him on the chance that he might be inside the hovel or carrying slops to the hogs . Little pigs were his only companions , and he seemed to grow fond of them . " Toby ! " she cried , and over again as shrilly as she could pitch her voice , " Toby , here 's cake for you ! " But the call drifted away on the air , and a sentinel crow , posted over a cornfield on the other side of the road , flapped his wings in suspicion . Caw ! Caw ! floated after her cry like a derisive echo . Well , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she wrapped up the gingerbread . It was a pity , because the taste of sweet was heavenly bliss to the idiot . Grandmother was on the front porch , shading her eyes from the strong sunlight with a palm-leaf fan bound in a rim of black cambric . She had put on a freshly starched calico , and the ribbons on her cap were still warm from the iron . " Were you looking for me , Grandmother ? " Ada asked as she ran up the steps . The old woman shook her head . " I thought I heard somethinggoing by in the road . My right ear has got so bad that every sound seems to come from the left side . " 106THE SINGLE HEART 107 " I wish you could see Janet 's dress . It has a pink and blue sash with artificial flowers . " " I reckon your pink gingham is more suitable than organdiein a barn . " " Janet says the Padgetts ' new barn is as fine as a ball-room . " Grandmother sniffed . " Who on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bring anything your mother might fancy ? " " Mrs. Rowan sent you some gingerbread . The sponge cake is for Mother . " " Well , I hope it will put a taste in her mouth . I 'm at my wit 's end trying to find something she is able to eat . " " The doctor did n't think she was worse yesterday , did he ? " Ada 's voice sank to a whisper , and she glanced from the porch to the window under the ivy ; but her tone was so low that the words were lost on Grandmother 's bad ear . " She looks much better this morning , " the girl said more distinctly . " What will she have for dinner ? " " A cup of tea , she says , and a soft-boiled egg . I tried to make some tapioca , but the milk curdled in the pan . Dr. Updike sent it early , and it was sweet when your mother had her glass at eleven o'clock . But it must have turned in the spring-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan fall to her side . " I 'm always put out when I ca n't make something to tempt your mother . " For an instant Ada stared in perplexity . " Effectually called , " she thought , repeating the words she had heard on Grandmother 's lips , " justified , adopted , sanctified , and saved , " was it still possible for one to be upset because a pan of milk curdled ? " I wish we could have ice for her , " she said . " It must be a comfort to have ice every day . " 108 VEIN OF IRON " On the hottest days I try to get somebody to leave it . But we ca n't afford to have it left regularly , and usually the springhouse keeps the milk and butter all right . It must have stood too long this morning before Meggie went down with it . I ca n't recollect that such a thing ever happened when I could get about on my feet . " She broke off and cupped her ear in her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , he 's calling me . I 'll come to help you as soon as I see what he wants . " Ada went into the hall , threw her hat on the sofa beside Horace , and opened the door of the library . " Do you want me , Father ? " He looked up with his expectant air which seemed to come from something he saw far away . " Yes , I 've had a letter from Dr. Ogilvy . IIe would like Ralph to come to the university before the middle of September . I suppose he can arrange it ? " " Oh , yes . He will be only too glad to go . It is the opportunityof a lifetime . " " Ogilvy seems interested . He may do a great deal for him . Ralph wo n't be the first promising lawyer he has started on a career . " He was seated at his desk , with the manuscript of his fourth volume spread out before him , while the sunshine from the window illumined his features and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face bore that inner warmth which proceeds less from a state of mind than from a climate of soul . One was always sure , Ada thought , watching him while he pushed the papers aside , of a meaning , a purpose , in whatever he said or did . He had not acquired fortitude , she felt , he was fortitude . THE SINGLE HEART 109 " Oh , Father , it 's wonderful . I am so happy . " " Then I am happy , my child , and so is your mother . We ask nothing better of life . " Turning his head toward the window , he appeared to withdrawinto the morning brightness beyond . He was silent for so long that she wondered whether he had forgotten her . Persons and objects , even the nearest , had a way of slipping out of his vision . Moving noiselessly to the door , she went out and shut it behind her . Poor Father , she thought , as she crossed the hall to her mother 's room , he has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , I 'd ask a better reward than just being able to bear it . Yes , it was true , John Fincastle reflected , his life would be justified in her happiness . Even his work , which had meant much to him and nothing to the world , would be repaid . There were hours even now , before daybreak or at the close of dusk , when a chill , soundless and swift as the flight of time , brushed his mood , and he paused to ask himselfwhether this book he was writing had not cost him too dear . Removing his spectacles , he rubbed his hand slowly over his eyes . As he pressed his tired eyeballs , a light flashed in sparks , and a half-forgotten recollection started out of the dimness . An autumn afternoon in Bloomsbury , and the scent of falling leaves in Bedford Square  --  or was it in Russell Square ? Not that it mattered . What he had treasured across the years was not a scene but a sense , barely more than a distillation of joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mind was at rest . But while he walked under the yellowed leaves , so pale beside the brilliant coloring of Shut-in Valley , he had determined to spend his life among the poor and the miserable , not as a bringer of good tidings , 110 VEIN OF IRONbut as one of themselves with a message of brotherhood . Was this the cause of that strange joy , which had never returned , which he had never forgotten ? Other joys more intensehe had felt , but not that one again . Never in its own likeness , its own essence . For the life he had lived and the life he had planned had been as far apart as the poles . Among the poor he might have been useful , but whatever he had to give was not needed , was not even acknowledged , by his well-to-do and self-satisfied congregation . Within , he had been attacked from the first by a sense of futility , and this deepening sense had come at last to signify failure without . Then it was that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect demanded an escape , he had plunged back again , with renewed vigor , into his book . What he had not considered was the simple fact of falling in love . But it was love , he perceived , that had altered everything , great or small , in his life , that had seemed to change the very beat of his heart . Instead of a single self , he had become a double self , and then , with each child that was born to him , he was divided into other and separate selves of his being . Not until five years after his marriage had he found a publisher who was willing to risk money on a work of philosophythat owed nothing to the dynamo . That the money would be lost was an accepted conclusion . Yet ten years later the same publisher , a Hebrew mystic , had issued the second volume , and three years ago the third volume had appeared . So far as John Fincastle was aware , his book had reached only six readers  --  an English metaphysical poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student of Neoplatonism in Alexandria , a French scholar at Lyons , and two obscure German professors . This group ofTHE SINGLE HEART 111readers , diverse but faithful , had compensated for neglect in his immediate place and time . Of what was he thinking , he now asked himself , before he had heard Ada 's voice on the porch ? With his eyes on the level crest of God 's Mountain , he groped in bewilderment . Then , suddenly , he remembered . Had pure philosophy , he was speculating , ever advanced beyond the Three Hypostasesof Plotinus ? Was there a swifter approach to Deity ( granting an approachable Deity ) than the flight of the alone to the Alone ? Perhaps not . Perhaps in some distant future man might turn away , disillusioned , from the inventivemind , and human consciousness might stumble back again along the forgotten paths of blessedness and mystic vision . Clouds had gathered farther away , and a watery violet light , as fresh as rain , streamed over the summit of the mountain . Blessedness is there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the little things also . . . . Though his inner world was builded of thought , not of emotion , he had found contentment in many minor activities . The part of life he had called fragmentary and unfinished had woven the peace that is more lasting than happiness . As for his deeper consciousness , the crystal globe holding the light within the light , this had been always remote and inviolable . Nothing had broken through . Not joy , not pain , not love , not passion , not sorrow , not loss , not life at its sharpest edge , had been able to break or bend this still pointed flame that burned upward . VIF life were always like this , John Fincastle thought , while he watched the lovers meet in the hall , therewould be no need of religion , there would be no needof philosophy . Ada was looking her best , he observed , though he seldom noticed a change in her appearance . Not so beautiful as her mother had been at her age ( no woman could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face was colored like ripe fruit and eloquent with emotion . Her eyes , though less striking than her mother 's , were large and deep , with something of the same dusky radiance . The bloom of love is over her , he said to himself , and sighed without knowing why . Was it because of remembrance , of some stir that was scarcely more than a breath from the past ? Or was it from the old Scottish superstition that life will bear watching whenever it appears simple and well-disposed ? For Ralph , he reflected , he had a different , and perhaps a more understanding , devotion . Like a son , like one of his own lost sons , the boy had grown to be in the past few years . His very faults were the faults that endeared . The stubborn willfulness , the periods of introspection and irresolution , which came and went without evident cause , the recklessness for the sake of recklessness , the disbelief for the sake of disbelieving  --  all these were flaws of character , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's death , and brought up by a mother who had become a religious fanatic , what else , John Fincastle demanded of the invisible Powers , was one to expect ? Even to meet Mrs. McBride in the road was like facing the grim doctrine of predestination . A strange marriage that had112THE SINGLE HEART 113been , though most marriages appear strange to spectators . Hearing Ralph 's eager voice , John Fincastle was reminded of Barney McBride , whose mother , Molly O'Boyle ( people in Ironside still remembered her ) , had come from Ireland when she was a child . Barney 's hair had been redder than Ralph 's , and his yellow-hazel eyes had held that same gleam of amusement . His marriage to Rebecca Muirhead , of a dour Scottish family , had been a surprise to John Fincastle 's womenfolk , though he himself had never given it so much as a thought . Yet Mary Evelyn , who had an ardent interest in all marriages , had told him that Mrs. McBride had passionatelyloved her husband . Only in widowhood had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to pity her than it was to forgive her for ruining her son 's childhood and destroyinghis faith in himself . If any woman could save him from his upbringing and his mother 's influence , it would be Ada . Yet there were moments when John Fincastle felt that they were too much alike , Ralph and Ada , for a union of even average success . Joy , perhaps , they might find , but not peace , for joy is a restless thing . After all , Ralph might be saved by work in the end . Never in the young had John Fincastle found such power of concentration , provided the subject absorbed him , or such completeness of assimilation . This much , at least , he owed , not to his father 's charm , but to the stern integrity of the Muirheads . Glowing with delight , the lovers went into Mary Evelyn 's chamber , and it seemed to John Fincastle , as well as to Aunt Abigail , who had brought a cluster of moss-rosebuds from the bush by her cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . " Good night , Mother , I hope you will be asleep before we come in. " 114 VEIN OF IRON THE SINGLE HEART 115 " Good night , dear . You could n't look any lovelier . Could she , Ralph ? " " She could n't , " Ralph answered , eager and confident . " Nobody could look any better . " The yellow wagon , harnessed to Mr. Rowan 's two stout grays , had rolled over the grass and sheepmint and was waitingbeside the old millstone in front of the house . " Good night ! " " Good night ! " Voices rang out gaily as Ralph and Ada ran down the steps and sprang into the wagon . Then the wheels turned from the square of light into the darkness beyond , and the glimmer of the kerosene lamp in front of the vehicle flitted through the gate and over the wheel ruts and the broken stones in the road . Standing on the porch , with the scent of crushed sheepmint around him , John Fincastle heard the happy laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began again farther away , like dance music that is played in the memory . Yes , if only life , if only what men call civilization , were not hostile to youth and to joy ! Suddenly , a thought surged up out of the past , on that distant laughter , now rising , now falling  --  I , too , have known ecstasy ! For an instant he hesitated , then , turning back into the house , he crossed the hall and entered the chamber . The lamp was lowered , and the familiar shapes in the room had shifted and altered . At the windows a faint breeze was stirring among the tendrils of ivy , and the night air vibrated with a universe of winged creatures . Mary Evelyn had not moved from the window , but Meggie and Aunt Abigailwere turning down the bed and arranging her medicines and the mustard plasters on the small table beside it . In front of the empty fireplace , his mother was thrusting herknitting needles through the rolled stocking before she laid it away for the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abounding vitality of her prime , when his father had called her " a daughter of earth and sky . " He hoped that Ada , who was like her grandmother in many other ways , had inherited that intense relish for life combined with that eloquentresponse to the things of the spirit . Compared with his mother , he told himself , he had never known the true zest of experience . " Can I do anything for you , Mary Evelyn ? " he asked tenderly , the more tenderly because he was longing , against his will , to escape from the room , from the trail of anguish that quivered through his nerves at the sound of his wife 's voice . I could n't bear it if she were not here , he thought , and then , with a throb of pain , And I can not bear to be with her . Had he loved her less , it would have been easier to watch her suffer and change and grow , day by day , a stranger in the flesh to the Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For it was true that the passion he felt for her was an agony too great to be borne unless there were hours of release into solitude , into silence , where emotioncould no longer survive . " Nothing now , John , but sit by me till I feel sleepy . " Dropping into a chair at her side , he reached for her fragile hand and began stroking it gently from the wrist , which was so thin that the bones seemed scarcely covered , to the tips of her fingers . Sometimes he would sit like this for hours , not hearing a word that she said , yet never pausingin that soft pressure from wrist to finger-tips and then back again more slowly from finger-tips to wrist . " Have you finished your day , Mother ? " he asked presently. 116 VEIN OF IRON " Aye , my son . I never like to sit long in summer after the light fades . Your father used to say the cock in the barnyard sets the hour in a village . That was the way you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on after midnight . " Steadying herself on her swollen feet , the old woman slipped her work behind a cow in Staffordshire ware on the end of the mantelpiece . While he looked at her , John Fincastle pondered the history of that cow , which had lost her horns but still preserved a suckling calf at her udder . In some fantastic flare of memory ( the laws of the mind , he told himself , are still barbaric ) , the cow reminded him of India , and he thought of the favorite prayer of Schopenhauer , that ancient supplicationof the Hindus , " May all that have life be delivered from suffering . " Aloud he said , " Has it never occurred to you , Mother , that the night has more room than the day ? It is only at night that I can find time to range like the lone wolf I am . " " He gives up so much of his time to me , " Mary Evelyn sighed in her breathless tone . " Not nearly so much as I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's Ralph and the school until it closes , " his wife continued , as if he had not spoken . " Besides that , the work out of doors is enough for two men . " " I have a strong constitution . " Her husband was still stroking her hand . " Work in the garden and at the woodpile keeps me active . " " He never had a day 's sickness as a child , " his mother remarked . " It 's fortunate for Ada that she has inherited his constitution . " " Yes , it 's fortunate that she did not inherit mine . " There was a tremor in Mary Evelyn 's voice . THE SINGLE HEART 117 " She will never compare with you , Mary Evelyn , " John Fincastle said , while a lump swelled in his throat . " You are too precious for the hard life I have given you . " " ' T is a miracle that she 's stood it so well , " Grandmother Fincastle assented . " I 've always said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Fincastle than you are yourself , John . " " You 're right , Mother . I was a variation from type , as biologists say . Such oddities occur even in the best breeds . " Bending over , the old woman kissed her daughter-in-law 's forehead with one of the rare caresses she never bestowed on her own children . Then , leaning on the old-fashioned ebony cane that had belonged to her husband , she limped across the floor and into the adjoining room , where she had slept alone since the beginning of summer . " But for my legs , " she muttered , as she went , " I 'd be as spry as I ever was . " " Would you like me to read to you , or is it too warm ? " John Fincastle asked . " It is too warm . I 'd rather stay like this unless you are neglecting your work . You have so little time . " " All I have is yours . Anything can wait when you need me . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat motionless by her side and listened to the soft whirringof a bat at the window . Meggie , having measured out the dose of bromide , was placing the night lamp , with loweredwick , behind the screen in one corner . Aunt Abigail , who was still active from the waist up , like Grandmother Fincastle , but had stopped trying to stoop , was hanging a knitted shawl on the headboard . In a little while the chair would be wheeled across the room , and he would lift his118 VEIN OF IRONwife into bed , after Meggie had arranged the pillows in the way that made Mary Evelyn 's pain more endurable when she awoke in the night . The first sleeping-draught would usually ease her suffering until three o'clock . Then she would waken him if he had fallen asleep , and he would measure out a second dose and repeat one of the Psalms to her until the sedative had taken effect . When her preparations were over , Aunt Abigail turned away from the bed . " Good night , Miss May Ev'lyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Aunt Abigail . Good night . " " Good night , Miss Meggie . " Then , opening the crack of Grandmother 's door , the old servant raised her voice : " Good night , ole Miss . Sleep well an ' wake up peart in de mawnin ' . " " Good night , Abigail . I f the moon ai n't up when you go , be sure to light your lantern . You remember that bad fall you had the last ( lark of the moon . " " I sho ' do , ole Miss . We ai n't needer uv us de highstepperswe use'n ter be . " She waddled out , while Meggie went into her mother 's room to help her undress . " Are you in pain , my dear ? " John Fincastle asked , as his wife moaned softly under her breath . " Only a stab . It will pass in a minute . I am so happyabout Ada , John . If only life will be good to her . " " It will be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Not until I am in bed . Meggie will come as soon as she has seen Mother settled . When I look at Ada 's happiness , it makes even pain bearable . I long to see her with children . She is a born mother if ever a woman was . " " Yes , I remember the way she cared for her dolls , and THE SINGLE HEART 119the time I disappointed her . I failed then as I have so often . " " All I ask , " Mary Evelyn continued in her excited voice , " is that Ralph will make her as happy  --  as blissfully happy  --  as you have made me . " " My dear , my dear ! " If only the spirit could be reached through the flesh ! If only he could pour himself into this anguish , this tenderness ! " You made your own happiness . I was always unworthy . " " I could n't have done it without you . As a girl , I was n't satisfied . Then you came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vanished in the moonlight that was beginning to fall through the window . How little she knew him ! How little did any human being know another ! " I grew up in a sterner age , " he answered . " The world has softened nowadays . Nobody but Mrs. McBride believes any longer that the will must be broken if one is to be saved . " " Yet you have always been happy . In spite of all the struggle , the tragedy , you have been happy . " He pressed her hand . " Happiness is a hardy annual . " " You would live your life over again , would n't you ? As it is , I mean , taking the good and the bad ? " Without appearing to do so , he evaded her question . " And you , my darling ? You have had more to bear than I have . " Laughter quivered and died in his voice . " For you have had to bear with me . " " Oh , John , John . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a triumphant note in her answer . " I would take it all again with you , the joy and the grief , even this last suffering . Yes , I would take it all with you if I could . " His pain was so intense that , for an instant , the pulse of120 VEIN OF IRON his heart seemed suspended . " You are a joyous spirit , " he said at last . " I have a darker mind , or a less courageous one . " Why had he made that answer ? It would hurt or at least sadden her . " It is n't that , but life has meant so much to me . Even now I cling on . I ca n't bring myself to let go my hold . " Leaning over her , he rested his forehead on her hand . It was possible sometimes when they were alone to break through the reserve he had inherited with his rugged body and embattled mind . " Do n't leave me , " he pleaded . " I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if feeling had exhausted her strength , and he sat on beside her , sunk in meditation , until she asked , after a long silence , " What are you thinking of , John ? " " Of nothing , my clear . My thoughts wandered . I was won- dering what kind of world we might have had if all the love that has been spent on personal God and an individual human being had been spread over the whole of creation . " She shook her head . " That will never be . " The door into his mother 's room opened and shut . Then a fragment of shadow detached itself from the border of lamplight and floated toward then . As it approached , he dis- tinguished Meggie in her gray wrapper and heelless slippers . " Do you feel as if you could sleep , Mary Evelyn ? " " Is it time for my bromide ? " " Yes , I 've measured it out . You 've had a long day . " " But a happy one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placedher in bed , John Fincastle stood watching while Meggie gaveher the medicine and folded back the sheet over her bosom . " It may turn cooler in the night , " Meggie said , " so I'veput a blanket on the foot of the bed . Ask for it , Mary Evelyn , if you feel a chill in the air . " " Yes , I 'll ask for it . Is my shawl where I can reach it ? " Sinking into the pillows , Mary Evelyn put up a trembling hand for the shawl before she settled down into the inner peace of the sedative . " The bottle and the teaspoon are here where John can give you another dose . " With her capable touch , Meggie rearranged the glass , the medicine , and the small brown jug of water on the bed table . All night the lamp burned very low behind the screen , which was papered in a Chinese patternof temples and peacocks , sent by a missionary to GrandmotherFincastle when she was a young woman . " You will sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'll have a good night . " " Shall I sit by you awhile ? " asked her husband , with his hand on her pulse . " No , do n't wait . Go back to your work . I 'm falling asleep already . Bromide is so wonderful . " Her soft , eager voice dropped to a whisper . " You will sit up , John , until Ada comes in ? " " Yes , I 'll sit up , and I 'll hear if you call . " " Do n't have me on your mind . Meggie is going to stay downstairs with Mother tonight . " " I 'll leave a crack in the door , " Meggie said , " and you know I 'm a light sleeper , even when I do n't have to be up and down with Mother . She says I can hear a leaf turning . " THE SINGLE HEART 123near or distant sounds trembled and fell without sinking below the surface , as leaves tremble and fall on a pond  --  the whispering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plaintive cry of a night bird over the spring , the ceaseless patter of unseen but intimate presences in the ivy or higher up on the roof . During the hours between dusk and daybreak the manse seemed to separate itself from the village , to shed the covering of communal life , and to slip back into the wilderness . And in his own nature , too , the link between himself and the community would be broken . Again and again , his look would fly through the open window , and over the sheep pasture and the stony hill , to the unconquerable solitude . So might old John Fincastle have gazed toward some visionary frontier when he shook the dust of the settlement from his feet and marched away to the savages . Two hours passed , and he was still writing . Only two hours , he told himself with a sigh , as he glanced at the clock . Then the sound that had disturbed him grew louder . There was the rattle of wheels over the rocks in the road , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate and a buggy rolled over the lawn to the old millstone . Perhaps it was not Ada , after all , but a call from the dying or the bereaved for his mother . No , it could not be Ada . He remembered that she had gone , and would of course return , in the spring-wagon . Then , as he was about to go out into the hall , his daughter 's voice floated in from the porch . " Thank you for bringing me home . Good night . " Immediately the wheels started again , and a minute afterwardsthe grinding noise began over the rocks at the gate . While he waited , pen in hand , the door in the hall was shut very quietly , the bolt was slipped into place , and AdaVIIDA would not come home until well after midnight , and ahead of him there were three hoursof the loneliness that he loved . He loved hisfamily more , of course , John Fincastle thought , but that was an attachment spun by habit and association and the complex need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt and thought , human beings were more im- portant than ideas about God  --  at least in the lot of man . Before striking a match , he went to the window of his library and looked out on God 's Mountain in the light of a moon that had just risen over the house . While he watched the glimmering rays grow brighter and stronger , he felt the external world break up and dissolve , as the shredded clouds dissolved in the luminous sky . Here , apart , withdrawn from the enveloping glow of time , he was wholly himself ; he was Mary Evelyn 's lover ; he was the student in Bloomsbury ; he was the scholar in exile ; he was the laborer in the potato field . He was all these things , and yet he was none of these things alone . The moon sailed upward , the mist vanished , God 's Moun- tain receded . Where a mystic presence had brooded , there were only dark masses on the horizon . Turning away from the window , he removed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wick , which sent up a thin blue flame and then began to burn brightly . Tomorrow a leak in the roof must be mended , the loosened boards must be nailed down on the porch , and several shingles must be replaced on the eaves of the kitchen . But tonight he had escaped , for a while at least , from the boundaries of the immediate and the necessary . Stillness enclosed him , and over this stillness122124 VEIN OF IRONspoke in a low voice to Horace before she came into the library . " Is Mother asleep , Father ? " she asked in a whisper , closing the door . " She took the bromide , and she has not called . " " I hope I did n't wake her when I came in . " " She would have spoken to you if she 'd been awake . You are home early . " " Yes , I 'm home early . " " That was n't the Rowans ' wagon ? " She shook her head . " It was Ross Greenlee 's buggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine . " " Where 's Ralph ? I thought he was studying too . " " Ile did n't know I 'd come away . I had a headache , and I asked Ross to bring me when I saw him leaving . " As she answered she moved from the shadow by the door into the yellow orb of the lamplight , which seemed to quiver faintly and then to lie still again under a wave of emotion  --  orperhaps only a dying breeze . A strange note in her voice , or something unusual in her look , arrested his gaze , and he remained with his pen transfixed in his hand while an impression stabbed into his mind . Was it true  --  could it be possible that he had never really known her ? With the question , all his theories about life toppled over , like the lofty towers in a dream , and crumbled to dust . Not his philosophy alone was threatened , but all that he had discovered , or imagined he had discovered , about human beings . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Has anything hurt you ? " " Nothing has happened . Ralph was dancing in a figure , and I wanted to come home . " Her voice trembled , and sheTHE SINGLE HEART 125repeated quickly in the effort to steady it , " I do hope Mother has n't waked . " Stooping over , she put out her hand as if to stroke Horace , but the old hound , after following her into the room , had retired to his sleeping-place on the sofa . " You must not take things too hard , my dear . It is so easy when we are young to make mountains out of mole-hills . " It seemed to him that her eyes were beseeching , but she made no sound as she stood there in the lamplight , winding and unwinding a crocheted scarf over her wrist and hand . His heart ached for her . He felt her suffering as he felt the inarticulate distress of a child or an animal . " I know , " she assented after a pause . " I do exaggerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are young . " She shook her head again , and he felt that she was wrappingher pride about her . Even as a child she had a way of withdrawing into her pride when she was hurt . " I 'll go upstairs now , " she said . " Our voices might wake Mother or Aunt Meggie. " r " Are you sure nothing has hurt you ? " " Oh , nothing . I 'll be all right in the morning . " Then , after she had turned from him , she stopped and looked back . " Why are we this way , Father ? " " What way , my child ? There are so many different ways . " " Why are we always doing things we did n't mean to do and did n't want to do ? Why is something always tripping us up when we try to be happy ? " " Many have put that question , my dear , and no one has been able to answer it . Some have said that Nature is the antagonist of happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing has occurred that ca n't be put right tomorrow . " 126 VEIN OF IRON " Oh , yes . It will be all right tomorrow . Only it tears you inside to be angry . I wonder if I 'll ever get over flaring up quickly ? " " As you grow older . But be patient . Ralph has had a hard upbringing , and he needs all the patience you have or are ever likely to have . " " If only I could remember that . I do till something happens that hurts my pride , like . . . like . . . Oh , well , I sha n't even let myself think of it . It was mostly my fault , because I did n't have patience . " " Then promise me that you will forget your pride and remember Ralph 's mother . " " I promise , Father . Good night . " The door opened and shut softly ; he felt rather than heard her steps ascending the worn staircase , and then the slight creak of the boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , and he knew also that he was powerless to shield her from her own nature . She must fight the conflict alone , as his mother had fought alone in her youth , as his great-grandmother Tod had fought alone in captivity . With a sigh , he turned his gaze to the window and waited until the shiver of apprehension was over and the life of reason spread its protecting wings in his mind . VIII0 , nothing had happened , Ada repeated in herroom under the sloping roof , nothing had hurther . Moonlight fell in flakes through the twodormer-windows , but the side window , cutting into the triangle of the wall , was in darkness . Through the rustling leaves she could see the few scattered lights that still burned in Ironside and , flung far out into the silvery dusk of the fields , a single wavering spark in the hovel by the ravine . Slipping out of her pink gingham , she said , " Nothing has happened . " Carefully folding the skirt before she laid it away in a drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right again in the morning . " As she dropped her chemise about her feet , and drew her cambric nightgown over her head , she looked down at her strong young arms and high pointed breasts , as smooth as cream in the moonlight . And then , while she let down her hair and shook it in a dusky veil over her shoulders , she spoke aloud in a tone of surprise . " I wonder what it is about Janet ? " What was it ? She could n't answer . She did n't know . It was true that she had not wanted to go with Janet ( Ralph , she insisted to herself , had never liked her ) ; yet they had gone ; she had had her way as always with everyone . " Even when you like to be with her , you do n't like her , " Ralph had said . And Ada had not understood . She did not understandnow , with her eyes on the lights in the village . One light went out while she watched it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she had been happy , and then something , as dark and mysterious as that mountain spur thrusting out in the moonlight , had broken into her127128 VEIN OF IRONlife , into her happiness . If only she could think it over . But she could n't think . She could only feel this sharp thrust , this twisting pain in her heart . " It was my fault , " she said aloud , while the cloud in her mind became lighter and seemed to evaporate . " I ought to have had patience . Ralph did n't want to go up into the barn loft with Janet . She asked him to go . I heard her . " He had n't wanted to go , but he had gone . He had n't wanted to drink whisky , but he had drunk it when they dared him . Yet he was always like that . When he was a little boy and his mother had whipped him for playing with Toby Waters , he had stood it without a whimper , and as soon as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over the fields to the pigsty . That was what Father called Ralph 's need to defend his personality . His whole childhood , Father said , had been warped by forces he did not understand , though he felt they were destructive . But perhaps Grandmotherwas right when she insisted that she did n't hold with such newfangled ideas and willful children should be made to obey . Then , without effort , as soon as she had stopped trying to think things out clearly , Ada began to live over all that had happened , or had not happened , to turn eager expectancy into vague disappointment . A few hours before , in the evening , life had been simple and straight , and now , at midnight , it was ruffled and complicatedand obscured by this smoky vapor of apprehension . And she had wanted life to be simple . She had asked nothing more than a certain security for her life , for her love , for her happiness . They were on the back seat in the big wagon ; Charlie Draper and Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be waiting for them on the Rowans ' porch . When they started down the rocky road , THE SINGLE HEART 129Ralph put his arm about her and kissed her in the darkness . She remembered the warm pressure of his mouth on hers , and she remembered , too , the roll of the wheels , turning within and without , and the yellow gleam from the wagon lamp flitting over the tufts of grass and weeds which stood out illuminated , each blade or leaf separate and distinct , on the edge of obscurity . Later , moonlight would pour down over the hills into the valleys , but while they drove on past the churchyard into the village they were swallowed up in the darkness . It was a tender darkness , soft , warm , clinging , not like this burned-out silver light which seemed to drain the world and her own mind of emotion . " I had hoped we were going alone , " he murmured , as she lived the evening over again . She laughed from sheer delight . " It was your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with Janet . Is it true that some of the boys went up to Lightning Ridge to buy moonshine ? " He nodded . " Who told you that ? It was exactly like Janet . " " I do n't care so long as you were n't one of them , " she replied , ignoring his question . The arm she leaned against hardened slightly . " A man ca n't be a killjoy , " he answered . " That is what you and your father can never understand . It is easy to be noble in the woods , but among other people , it makes you a kill-joy . " His tone had roughened , and in some strange way the roughness increased his power over her . She felt ecstasy stabbing through her flesh into her heart , piercing every cell of her body with tiny splinters of flame . Why ? Why ? She could n't tell , she did n't know . It was nothing that he had130 VEIN OF IRONsaid , only the eager seeking of his lips and the ruffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling charm of his mouth , his eyes , his smile , his imperative tone and gestures , seemed to envelop her and crush out resistance . Yes , it was true . You could not live in the world and be a killjoy . How she loved him ! What a miracle love can make of life ! Nothingelse mattered , not Janet , not moonshine whisky , not being alone in a crowd . Then , as they stopped before the Rowans ' gate , she whispered , " I hope you will be nice to Janet . " She could feel , and see , too , when a light flashed from the porch , that he was smiling . " Oh , no , you do n't , " he retorted . " You do n't really . " Before she had time to answer , Janet and Bessie were calling to them as they ran down the walk , and the three boys jumped out of the wagon and flung open the gate . Charlie held up a lantern , and the light danced over Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her neck . She was so lovely that Ada caught her breath as she looked at her . " Oh , is n't she beautiful ? Does n't her dress suit her ? " To her astonishment , Ralph was not looking ; he had turned away and was fumbling with the reins that had dropped from the wagon . Even when they had all crowded into the wagon , and were driving up the street , Ralph did not turn his eyes from the broad backs of the grays . He did not speak until Janet leaned over and touched his arm . Then he looked at her and looked away again before he replied to some trivial question . She possessed some power , Ada felt , that Ralph despised and resisted but could neither ignore nor deny . A boy brought up so severely would always retain some secret allegiance to duty , Grandmother said , no matter how far he wandered . Even if his senses fell intoTHE SINGLE HEART 131sin , his conscience would always remind him that it was not pleasure but sin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rooted more in aversion than in attraction , Ada wondered whether Aunt Meggie had meant this when she called Janet " a born trouble-maker . " Somewhere in the fields a hound was howling . The small darkened light still shone , like a vindictive eye , in Mrs. Waters 's hovel . Was the woman ill or in want ? Perhaps Toby was sick . Tomorrow , she must tell Grandmother or Aunt Meggie . Aunt Meggie had told her not to bother about Mother 's salt-rising bread , which had to be put down at four o'clock for a third rising . No matter how early she went downstairs , Grandmother , who never slept a wink after the first crack of day , was sure to be ahead of her . A winged shape flew out suddenly from the darkness of an oak and sped through the moonlight into the shadows . There was a swift rush , a startled squeak , and then silence woven of innumerablewhispering leaves , of soundless wings , of a multitude of soft-footed creatures that lived only at night . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada told herself that there had been moments in the evening she could never forget . Yet they were as empty as dried husks . There was n't anything to remember but that uneasiness , that undercurrent of impulse  --  or was it violence ? And what had brought on the quarrel ? It was true that she and Ralph had quarreled before ( they were both easily hurt ) , but only about Janet , the trouble-maker . It was n't his being self-willed that Ada resented . It was something different , something that had to do with Janet , not with whisky in the loft , but with Janet dancing up and down the floor of the new barn . The more the boys drank in secret ( Mrs. Padgett was a leader in the temperance movement ) , the132 VEIN OF IRONhappier they appeared to become , and the happier they became , the louder grew their attentions to Janet and Bessie . Not that anything was really amiss on the surface . None of the boys had tasted too deeply to mind his steps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loft were the wiser . The row of watching matrons , who would help presently with the supper , had no suspicions . But there was a difference . A feeling that she had never known before had come between her and Ralph . Pride ? Jealousy ? Or only the shyness that made her draw away when she was hurt ? Well , whatever it was , she was to blame for it . She would n't have been like this , she knew , with anyone else ; but love , as Mother had warned her , made people act so strangely , made them do such unbelievable things , that their closest friends did not recognize them . She wished that hound would stop howling . It sounded as if it were hurt or in distress . Perhaps the moonlight made it feel lonely . Tomorrow she would find out why the lamp burned so late and the hound howled . But tonight she could not bother about such things . She must rid her heart of anxiety and impatience . When had the quarrel begun ( think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown suddenly so angry that she had broken away from the party and come home with Ross Greenlee ? For an instant the scene whirled before her eyes in a revolving mass of impressions . A dance had just finished , and the music of another was beginning . She had danced with Charlie Draper and Fred Robinson , and she was waiting for Ralph , while she watched Janet smiling and nodding to him from beneath the Chinese lanterns in the doorway . " I wonder what it is about Janet ? " she said aloudTHE SINGLE HEART 133to herself and , looking round at a touch , saw Ralph at her elbow . " What 's that about Janet ? " he asked in a tone that sounded excited and irritable . Then , before she could laugh away the question , he added in a lowered voice , " Do n't let 's dance . It 's too hot in here . Let 's go out into the fields . " That was the beginning , that was the turning-point which cut her evening in two parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance . He had been drinking that mountain whisky because Janet and the other boys had teased him , and when he drank he grew sullen and curiously defiant . She should have had patience ; she should have remembered that he needed her now more than ever . But instead she felt that stab of pain in her heart , and her indignation flared up because he yielded to Janet , because he had not kept away from the wilder boys in the loft . " I was waiting to dance with you , " she said , " but I do n't want to dance with you now . You 'd better ask Janet . " Why had she said that ? She had not meant to reproach him . The words were spoken by some inner voice over which she had no control . " Do n't let 's dance , " he urged . " It 's cooler out in the fields , and we 'll be by ourselves . " " Not like this . " ( She was not remembering ; she was livingthe scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you when you 're like this . " " Like what ? " " I do n't want to be with you when you 're not yourself . " " But I am myself , and if I 'm not , you 're to blame . " At that she should have laughed ; it was so absurd that she should have laughed it away and tried to keep near him until his temper wore off . But she flared up again , and they quarreled  --  as always , about Janet ! They quarreled for134 VEIN OF IRONa few minutes as bitterly as ignorant mountain people , she told herself , who did not know how to bear themselves when they were in love . For , strangely enough , love had had a part in it too . Love had driven her into saying things that had never entered her mind , that were uttered straight out of the air , without the slightest connection with either the past or the future . A sob escaped her . " You never know love , " Mother had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it would be over tomorrow . He would come in the morning before he went to work , and the making-up would be happiness . Never again would they quarrel . Never , never again ! What had come next ? Was that another screech owl or only the shadow of a moving branch under the trees ? " But you 're coming ? " he insisted . " No , I 'm not coining . Not until you 're yourself again . " He laughed under his breath . She could never forget that laugh , though it meant nothing . A dull ache from the stab it had left was still in her heart . " Maybe you 'd rather I asked Janet , " he said . " Janet says it 's cooler outside . " A sensation she had never felt before , a stinging darkness , swept over her . Was it love ? Was it jealousy ? Was it anger ? Was it Ada Fincastle or some strange girl who was speaking ? " If you leave me for Janet , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You could n't at night . It 's nearly five miles . But why wo n't you come out ? My head is too heavy for dancing . " " That 's because of the whisky . You let Janet and those boys make you drink . " " Well , you ca n't be a killjoy . Do you want me to ask Janet ? " A sob burst from her lips . Yet she had not given way ; THE SINGLE HEART 135she would not go out into the fields with him . A girl with proper pride did not go off alone in the moonlight with a man who had been drinking . No matter how much she loved him , and even though he was n't drunk , only just not himself , she could protect them both ( Grandmother had told her this ) if she stood on her dignity . CI do n't care . I do n't care what you do when you 're like this , " she flung back at him . " Then I will , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned away and walked straight to the open door , where Janet was waiting . They were behaving like two children , Ada thought , two children who ought to know better . While she stood there and watched him cross the floor , it seemed to her that joy was slowly ebbing away from her heart . Yet something stronger than joy , the vein of iron far down in her inmost being , in her secret self , could no : . yield , could not bend , could not be broke.a  --  t Then , as Janet smiled up at him with her rose-red mouth , Ada turned away , walked the length of the barn with an unhurried step , and went out of the other door into the road . She would have started to walk home , driven by some force that seemed to be outside her thoughts and yet to have control over her words or acts . But just as she was about to leave , Ross Greenlee came out to his buggy , and after a few meaningless sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to the manse . It was too hot to stay inside ; she was anxious about her mother ; she wanted to go home . He seemed to understand , and made it as easy as possible by talking the whole way , without putting a question . A nice boy , fired with ambition , who would probably go North and become a success in his profession . Men with ability136 VEIN OF IRONnever stayed in a village . That was why Ralph was going to Queenborough . " But it was all my fault , " she said aloud , before the sentence had taken shape in her mind . " It was all my fault because I did n't have patience . " As if self-reproach were a blessing , anger and apprehension faded out of her thoughts . A moment later , when she turned her cheek to the pillow , she felt that sleep and peace were closing about her . IXT six o'clock Ada awoke with a start . What hadhappened ? Why did yesterday seem to be stillgoing on ? Jumping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed with Grandmother 's strong homemade soap and cold water . She was glad her skin was not fine and brittle like Mother 's . It must be dreadful to have everything hurt you , and not be able to wear flannel next you in winter , she mused , while she combed back her hair and wound it in the figure eight on the nape of her neck . In the kitchen she found Grandmother stirring batter in a big yellow bowl . Already the loaf of salt-rising bread was in the oven , and the fresh smell of baking would presently fill the room . Mary Evelyn ate only this kind of bread , which was fine and close in texture and supposed to be good for an invalid . " What can I do to help , Grandmother ? " Ada asked , tying a checked apron over her blue cotton dress . " You might slice the bacon very thin . My hands are so bad I ca n't manage that small knife . I begin to dread the time when I shall have to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needles a help ? " " They wo n't be if my joints get more crooked . And they do n't knit right . I 've had to pull out the armhole in that sweater I 'm making for your father . " The old woman was seated by the table , which was covered with brown oilcloth , and behind her the red geraniums on the window-sill were in full bloom . In winter the family had their meals in the kitchen ; but in summer they opened the dining-room and used the walnut table , which had served so many preachers and missionaries and presiding137138 VEIN OF IRON elders when the pastor lived in the old manse . " It wo n't cost you a penny more to be particular than to be slat- ternly , " Grandmother would say . " Even in the wilderness Scotch-Irish housekeepers seldom become slatterns . If you have the proper pride , you may keep nice among sav- ages . " Bending over the yellow bowl , she stirred slowly and smoothly , taking care not to let the big pewter spoon drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobility with age , and though she wore the plainest clothes , except for her lawn cap and cameo brooch , no one , meeting her in the road , would have mistaken her for a peasant . " I 'm afraid Aunt Abigail is sick again , " Ada said , as she poured a heaping cupful of coffee beans into the iron coffee mill and began turning the crooked handle . The old coffee mill , nailed to the wall by the door , had been used every morning and evening , except in wartime , for the last cen- tury . As Ada ground the fragrant Mocha and Java beans , toasted by Grandmother and bought with Aunt Meggie 's savings , she glanced at the whitewashed walls and the strings of red peppers and the rusted dipper hanging above the wooden bucket on the small table . Ever since she could remember the kitchen had looked like this , with everything in its proper place and every withered leaf carefully pinched from the geraniums . " Little black Dinty ran over to ask for turpentine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as she can get on her feet . " " She 's getting worse all the time . " " Aye , it looks that way . If she 's bedridden by next winter , we 'll have to get her daughter Liddy to come and help out . It will mean one more mouth to feed , and we 'll have to stint more than we do now "  --  she looked up to sniff the stimu- lating aroma  --  " but of course we ca n't let Aunt Abigail come to want . " " You ought to be spared , too , Grandmother . " " I do n't worry about myself , " the old woman replied , rising to pour the batter into the baking-dish . " I 'm old , like Abigail , and my time has ' most come . I made this batter bread because your father would n't take his buttermilkyesterday , and I did n't want to throw it away . Batter bread tastes better when it is made with buttermilk . " " There 's somebody coming in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " I suppose he wants Father to advise him . Is n't it funny the way they come to Father for counsel after they 've turned him out of the ministry ? They even come before breakfast ! " Grandmother looked up at the stout hands of the walnut clock , which had ticked on for a century above a painted landscape . " It 's about to strike seven , " she answered . " Can you see who it is ? " " I think it 's Mr. Rowan . " Ada 's voice was charged with anxiety . " I wonder what he can want coming so early . They do n't keep as early hours as other people . Janet always sleeps late . " She slipped off her apron and rolled down the sleeves of her dress . " Had I better ask him to breakfast ? " " It seems more hospitable . We ca n't let him go away just as it 's ready , and we 're having a plenty this morning . " Running out into the hall , Ada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand for a second knock . " Father is in the library , " she said , smiling , " and Grandmotherhopes you will stay to breakfast . " He looked heavy and fat and overheated from the short walk , which must have been hurried , and his expression , she saw with her first glance , was not so hearty as usual. 140 VEIN OF IRONThere were pouches under his eyes , and the congested veins in his cheeks had turned purple . But his thin gray hair was neatly brushed , he wore an alpaca coat without creases , and he was holding a fresh straw hat with a striped band and one of the new narrow brims . " It smells mighty good , " he said pleasantly , " but my wife will be expecting me . I wish you could teach Janet to keep early hours . " Though he smiled at her as he entered the hall , she was quick to perceive that his smile was forced and unnatural . " I stepped up the first thing this morning for a word with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said distinctly , because it was always difficult to distract her father from work , " Here is Mr. Rowan to see you . " Then , turning away while the door was still ajar , she went back through the dining-room to the kitchen , where Grandmother sat in a deep study , with her knees apart , like the headless basalt image on the clock without works in the parlor . " He wo n't stay to breakfast , " Ada said , trying to speak cheerfully in spite of the hard lump in her throat . Emptying the ground coffee into the coffee-pot , she mixed it with part of an egg Grandmother had kept back , and dropped in the shell before she filled the pot with cold water and put it on the stove to boil up twice . " I hope there 's nothing the matter , " she continued uneasily , as she opened the door of the stove and thrust in some sticks of wood . Grandmother glanced up with a stolid expression . " If ' t was sickness , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Ada 's face was flushed from the heat of the stove , and she raised her free hand to push back a lock of hair fromTHE SINGLE HEART 141her forehead . " It must be something important to bring him so early . " " We 'll know in a few minutes . Tell me when you hear him come out of the library . It ai n't likely he 'll stay long with breakfast waiting for him at home . Well , whatever he has , it wo n't be a better breakfast than ours this morning . " " I wish Ralph could come in time for it . He has so little at home . " " His mother has to be sparing , poor woman . Be sure to have the bacon ready to go into the frying-pan as soon as the batter bread is brown on top . " Ada opened the door of the oven and glanced inside . " It wo n't be long . I wish Father could have become a great preacher , " she remarked thoughtfully , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's a poor conscience , " Grandmother retorted , " that leads into error . " " I 'll never believe that Father ever had a poor conscience . " Grandmother 's eyes softened while her mouth hardened . " It is a trial of faith to believe that a good man can be an unbeliever . All the Fincastles were men of spirit , but not one was ever before an open doubter . They never questioned God 's will , not even when it went against them , and they kept their word to Christian and heathen alike . It was told of old John , the pioneer , that he was strung up and half choked by a party of hunters because he refused to give away the hiding-place of some Cherokees who had trusted him . When the men from the settlement found him , he was lying unconscious at the foot of a tree , and as he came to , he cried out in a loud voice , What I have said , I have said ! ' Roaming white men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he added , Only a God-loving man can be a good hater . ' " " He 's going now ! " Ada exclaimed , at the sound of chairs pushed back in the library . Grandmother rose , patted her cap in place , and picking up her ebony cane , went out into the hall . " Wo n't you stay to breakfast , William ? We are about to have prayers . " " Thank you , Mrs. Fincastle , but my wife will be waiting for me . " " I hope ' twas n't sickness that brought you . " " No , ma'am , if it had been sickness , I 'd have come first to you . " Without a change of tone , he inquired after the garden , and Grandmother replied that the turnip salad was about over , but they were getting beets and onions and snaps , and there was a good promise of corn and tomatoes and black-eyed peas later on in the summer . Things to eat occupied a large part in her old age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , you have a fine garden spot , " he remarked as she finished . " Thank you again , and good morning . " His departure was too hurried , or so it seemed to Ada , who was watching through a crack in the dining-room door . A moment later she heard the tapping of Grand- mother 's stick and her imperative voice saying , " Breakfast will be ready by the time we 've had prayers , John . " " What has happened ? " Ada asked herself , as her father came out into the hall on his way to her mother 's chamber , where he read family prayers every morning . Her heart fluttered and sank as she followed him into the room . " Do n't let it be about Ralph , " she prayed mutely to her grandmother 's God  --  or to any god , even a heathen one , that would listen . " Anything but that . Oh , God , please , please , do n't let it be about Ralph ! " Outside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as blue as the traveler's-joy by the fence ; birds were singing in the bright green and gold of the trees . Yet , while she stood there and listened vaguely to her father 's solemn tones reading a Psalm , it seemed to her that the world beyond the window was suddenly troubled , as if a storm were approaching . On her knees a moment later , she entreated wildly , " Not about Ralph ! I ca n't bear it if it is about Ralph ! " Through her loosened fingers , as she knelt , she could see her father 's face , steadfast , inscrutable , confirmed in fortitude . Her mother , in the invalid 's chair , was bowed over with her eyes hidden in hands that trembled like leaves . By her side on the rag carpet Grandmother , who had bitten back a groan as she eased herself down , was praying aloud . Near the door , Aunt Meggie listened with half a mind for the sound of Aunt Abigail in the kitchen . " Oh , God , do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon over . Rising with a spring , Ada stooped to help Grandmother to her feet ( " You ought n't to kneel , Grandmother ; it is bad for your joints " ) while her father rolled the chair from the front window across the hall to the dining-room . Ahead of them , Aunt Meggie had darted into the kitchen , and she was already back again with the steaming coffee-pot in her hand . Her father , Ada noticed , with a shiver of apprehension , ate nothing . But then , she reassuredherself , he was seldom hungry and could go for a whole morning on dry bread with a radish . Only Grandmother , whose appetite never flagged , and Aunt Meggie , who enjoyed anything she did not cook herself , remarked144 VEIN OF IRONthat the breakfast was better than usual and ought not to be wasted . When at last the meal was over , Ada left Aunt Meggie to clear the table and went into the library to wait until her father returned from rolling the chair back to the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grandmother called . " I 'm not hungry . Give it to Horace . " " Do you feel sick ? Here , Horace , here 's your good break-fast . " " No , not sick . I want to see Father . I 'm waiting for Father . " " Well , he 'll come in a minute . Tie 's fixing your mother in her chair . " Was it a minute or an hour that she waited ? What was time after all ? Who had divided it ? Who could tell where now ended and forever began ? Perhaps there was n't any time . Perhaps there was only having or waiting to have . Across the hall she could hear her mother 's animated voice , and the sound seemed to pluck at her nerves . What on earth can Mother find to talk about from morning till night ? she thought , with a quiver of exasperation . A redbirdflew by the window and alighted on the branch of an oak . Then , without waiting , it spread its wings and flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That bird could fly away and leave things . But it could n't fly away from love and pain . An eagle looking down from the sky must see love and pain all over the world . Her father was coming . He had shut the door of the chamber , and then had opened it a little way when her mother called , " Leave the door ajar , dear , if you 're going for good . " His steps were in the hall now ; he had pausedTHE SINGLE HEART 145a moment to look out of the front door and exclaim in a raised tone , " Did you see that redbird , Mary Evelyn ? " Then he came into the library , walking as stiffly as an old man , as an old woman , and she saw that his face was a gray mask behind which pain burned and flickered . Her mind went blank as a wall , and out of this blankness a single thought flashed : " It is my fault . Whatever has happened is my fault . " Not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had spoken aloud . He turned back to shut the door , and then sat down at his desk and stretched out his hand , which was shaking a little . " Why , he is old , " she said to herself in surprise , " I did n't know he had so many wrinkles . " She could hear him swallowing when he tried to speak , and she felt her fear dissolve into nausea . " Poor Father , " she thought , but she could force no pity into her voice , only irritation because he prolonged the extremity of suspense . " It is my fault , " she said again in an angry tone , as if he had contradictedher . " I do n't know how to tell you , my child , " he began slowly . " I shall have to hurt you , and I do n't know how to do it . " " I can bear anything . Whatever it is , I am to blame . " Between her and desperation there was only this single thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only the way life has of trying our strength . " " What is it , Father ? I can bear anything better than waiting to hear . " A tremor had crawled up her spine and was spreading over every part of her body  --  millions of tiny tremors , like invisible creeping feet .

He does n't like Janet . He never liked her . " " Whether it is true or not , naturally Rowan is on the side of his daughter . It seems the whole house was alarmed . Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowan insists that her good name is damaged . " " Her good name ! Why , she 's never had any . Everybody knows how she is about men . " " Her parents do not . You ca n't blame them for defending their child . " " I do . I do blame them for not knowing . " Her voice rose on a sobbing breath . " Be careful , my dear . We must keep it from your mother as long as we can . " " Keep what ? What are we keeping ? " When she lowered her tone it was as hoarse , she told herself , as the " Caw ! Caw ! " of a crow . " Even now , in spite of all Rowan told me , I find it incredible , " John Fincastle said . Then , without warning , he asked , " Why did you leave the dance last night and come home with Ross ? We must try to get at the truth . " A sob seemed to tear her lips apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . " " He has said very little . It seems that Janet has been in trouble for some time . Nobody suspected it . Nobody knows it now except her parents and Mr. Black and Ralph 's mother . But she says that Ralph is responsible , and thatTHE SINGLE HEART 147seems to settle it for her parents . It is the custom , " he added dryly , " to accept a woman 's word in such cases . " " It 's not right , Father . " " I know , my child , but we can not alter a rule of conduct . No matter how wrong or absurd it may be , it is stronger than we are . Tell me why you came home with Ross . " Somewhere in the trees a bird sang the same note over twice and broke off . Before replying , she turned her head toward the window , as if she were listening for the song to be renewed . " Oh , we quarreled , " she answered presently , " but it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " For an instant she hesitated , trying to think clearly and wisely . Was it about Janet ? Or was it about nothing ? " He called me a killjoy , but it was my fault . " Her father sighed and looked down at his papers . " How often I have seen it happen like that in human relationships . You had everything , you and Ralph . All you needed to do was to hold fast to your happiness  --  but you let it slip through your fingers . " " I know now . . . I know . . . but , oh , Father , I did n't know then . Why did n't somebody tell me that life was this way . . . " " It is something we have to learn , Ada . I did tell you to have patience . " " And I did n't have . I did n't have patience .

" " They are trying to make him marry Janet and take her away from Ironside . They insist that her future here is impossible .

" " We are still savage , my child . What we call civilization is only a different and perhaps a higher level of barbarism . " Words ! Words ! Impatience twitched through her . " Do n't let them , Father ! " she cried out . " Do n't let them take Ralph away from me . " " Would they listen to me , my daughter ? Have they ever listened to me ?

I choseTHE SINGLE HEART 149the latter , and I may have been wrong . That may be why I am inadequate in dealing with circumstances . " But she was not listening . What did it matter ? What did anything matter ? She leaned forward , pressing her hands together until the knuckles stood out like white pebbles . Something that had been asleep in her nature awoke , flared up , and quivered into vitality . All the part of her that had been innocent and unawakened to passion became as living as agony . Pain had brought her to life , not pain of the heart or the mind alone , but of every nerve , every pulse , every cell and pore in her being . " Where is Ralph , Father ? I must find Ralph . " " He is coming , my dear . Try to be quiet . Your look makes me anxious . " " I must see Ralph . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I must go to find him . " " You can not , Ada .

" He looked at her without speaking , and his features , while she watched them , seemed to fade and reassemble and fade again into a watery mist . Only his long , fine hands , which were roughened and blistered from the hoe and the ax , did not waver . " How soon are they coming ? " she asked . If only that bird would stop whistling the same call over and over ! " At any minute now . They were waiting to have break-fast . " " To have breakfast ! " When suspense was eating into her heart  --  and into Ralph 's  --  they could wait to have breakfast. 150 VEIN OF IRON " Ca n't you leave this in our hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must bear the responsibility . There is no way of escape . " " But he has n't been at fault , Father , not really . " " By our moral code , my dear , an appearance of error is punished more severely than error itself . " " He did n't think . He does things without thinking . " " And he pays with thought in the end . " " If only I 'd stayed ! " She sprang up and dropped back again . " I ought to have gone out with him when he asked me . What does it matter now whether I did right or wrong ? But why did n't you tell me ? Why did n't Mother or Grandmother tell me that self-respect does n't help you when you 've lost happiness ? " " In the end it may make all the difference in the world to you .

" Somewhere , miles and miles away , it seemed , she had heard this voice and these words in another place . " I will send him to you if you will wait quietly . You must be brave . I would give my life to spare you this trial . " Life ? But what did he know of life ? Even his happiness , she thought , had no connection with the life that was jerking in her muscles and twisting like a knife in her bosom . For she did not want quietness ; she did not want to be brave and to suffer . " I ca n't sit still , " she said in a hoarse whisper . " I ca n't sit still any longer . " She could not bear that changelesstranquillity of the old which came from not wanting things . Turning away , she rushed out of the room ; and it seemedTHE SINGLE HEART 151to him that the very sound of her footsteps was alive and throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had suffered like that  --  long ago . Nothing of his old wound was left now . Yet he knew that while a single creaturehe loved remained alive on the earth his heart could never become wholly invulnerable to fate. x0 , she could n't bear peace , Ada thought , as she ran down the hall and through the open door of the dining-room . There would be time  --  enough for peace when she was dead , and shewould be dead then once and forever . Glancing into the kitchen , she saw her grandmother bent over the breakfast things , while small black Dinty scraped the grease from the frying-pan . Aunt Abigail , who had had a turn for the worse , had gone back to bed in her cabin , and Aunt Meggie would be feeding her chickens before the door of the henhouse . Usually Ada helped with the work , but this morning it did not matter to her whether the house was clean or stayed dirty . What she could not stand was the look in her grandmother 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing more that would drive her wild . After she had bolted the door of her room , she sat down in front of the mirror over the pine bureau and gazed at her reflectionas if it were the face of a stranger . Removing the hairpins , she let down her hair and brushed it until it shone with a dark luster . " If I am going to my funeral , I may as well put on a clean dress , " she told herself mockingly . Slippingout of her crumpled dress and into a fresh blue cotton with a white lawn collar that rolled back , she felt her strength flowing into muscles that were strong and free under the silken warmth of her skin . She would stand firm ; she would hold fast to her own ; she would not exchange a living happiness for the last refuge of fortitude . Even if that iron cross sustained her father and exalted her grandmother , it could do nothing for her . For she would rather suffer and keep alive than be crucified by God 's will into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought over and over , as if the words rose and fell and rose again on the steady strokes of her broom , I want to live while I 'm living . While I 'm living , I want to live . After she had made the bed and put the room in order , she emptied the water from the tub into a pail and carried it downstairs to pour over the hop-vines . The pail was heavy , but her arms were hard and firm , and today she felt the need to undertake fresh trials of strength . Since they depended on their old well and the spring at the foot of the slope , dry summers had taught the Fincastles not to waste water ; and the stern struggle with the wilderness had trained them not to fear effort . When she returned with the empty pail , three men had entered the gate and were walking slowly across the grass to the front porch . Three men , and one of them Ralph . Ralph with his head held up defiantly , and his boyish figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad dream , while her heart seemed to pause , she watched the three shadows marching ahead into the next minute , vanishingas they passed under the oaks , and then flitting back into step as they emerged into the sunshine . But it was all so vague , she felt , that it might be scarcely more real than a reflection in running water , which rippled on and on and mirrored always , as it flowed away , the same broken images . " Ada ! " her grandmother called in her Sabbath tone . " Ada , will you wait patiently until your father and I have talked over this matter ? " " I must see Ralph , Grandmother . " " Well , I 've sent Dinty to the cabin . Wait in the diningroomtill we call you . " Grandmother had changed into the alpaca dress she wore on Sunday or to funerals , and had put on her best cap with154 VEIN OF IRON a bunch of fresh ribbons . Only sin itself , the old adversary , which must be wrestled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company dress and the best cap in the morning . But who had told her ? Had Father spoken to her while Ada was upstairs in her room ? Had Mr. Rowan con- trived to let fall a warning ? Or had she been granted some special gift of foreknowledge ? Well , however it occurred , she always knew things before anyone else ; she was prepared , at any time , day or night , awake or asleep , for calamity . " Aye , you may see him , " the old woman continued , as she shut the door between the dining-room and the kitchen . " I 'll send him to you as soon as I can , but he 'll feel easier if you are not in the library . " This sounded true . It even sounded fair , which was by no means the same thing . " Then I 'll wait , " Ada replied . " I 'll wait in this very spot . I 'll wait all day if I have to . " What else could she do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move with a massive dignity , in spite of her stick , down the long hall to the front door . After the usual greetings , more formal because of Grandmother 's respect for her pastor , the men entered the house and fol- lowed the rustling skirt and the tapping cane through the door of the library . Sitting there at the dining-room table , Ada tried in vain to empty her mind and to fix her thoughts on external ob- jects alone  --  on the clustering branches of an oak by the window , on the shadow of a hawk as it flew over a brood of chickens , on the figure of Dinty skirting the garden fence on her way to Aunt Abigail 's cabin . But the instant she re- leased an impression , the whole pattern of her mind would shift and break up , and suspense , which she had driven out , would filter in with the green light from the window . It would be an eternity , she thought , before Grandmother called her , the worst kind of eternity , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Round and round in circles . What had happened ? What were they saying behind that shut door of the library ? A power , terrible for good or evil , was offended , and only sacrifice could appease its resentment . The wrath of God , said her grandmother . The law of the tribe , said her father . Well , no matter , since the wrath of God and the law of the tribe both demanded atonement in blood . Suddenly , it seemed to her that she was opposing a phantom . But it was a phantom that would prevailin the end because it was the stronger . She started back from the window as Grandmother came down the hall and into the dining-room . The old woman was saying something out of a tumult of sound , like the drummingof arteries . . . something about right . . . something about honor . . . something about duty . " What have they done , Grandmother ? " " You must prepare yourself , my child . You must remember that other women have endured worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about other women . What are they doing to Ralph ? " " You must try not to think of Ralph . You must bridle your wild impulses . " " I ca n't wait any longer , Grandmother . " " If he has harmed Janet , Ada , he will have to bear the blame for it . " " But everybody knows what Janet is . " " I am not defending Janet . I leave that to her father , who is well able to do it " 156 VEIN OF IRON " I must see Ralph . " " Your wild heart is speaking again . Try to bring your will to God before it is broken . " " I must see Ralph . " " You must remember that Janet is an only child . Her father and mother are broken-hearted . They insist , and Mr. Black and your father agree with them , that the girl can not be left to bear the burden alone . You have no share in this , Ada . You must be left out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left out . If Ralph is made to marry her , " her voice was a mere thread of agony , " he will be miserable all his life . " " There are more things than happiness to be considered , my poor child . " " He loves me . IIe would hate Janet . " Ralph 's suffering was harder to bear than her own , because Ralph would never , she felt , learn how to suffer . " There are more things than love to be considered in mar- riage . " Though the words were uttered in a refrain , the old woman gulped down a sob . " They have been talking since midnight , " she said . " I do n't see how the older men keep it up But Ralph anyway is worn out . He is sullen and de- fiant , but he has agreed to marry Janet and go with her to Queenborough . " " But he ca n't . . . he ca n't . . . Oh , Grandmother . . . " Misery broke over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an easy man to oppose . He is an elder in the church and a pillar of the community . He is able to ruin Ralph , and he will believe it his duty to do it if Ralph has disgraced Janet . And Ralph 's mother is on his side . Though Ralph does not get on well with his mother , she has a strong  --  almost an extraordinary  --  influence over him . " " She loves to make him suffer . " " That is unjust . It is only that she could not let her feeling stand in the way of God 's law . You must learn that , too , before life is done with you . " Before life had done with her ! " Oh , Grandmother , I ca n't bear it ! I ca n't bear what is ahead of me ! " " My child , my dear child . I would n't spare myself if I could help you . " " What are they doing now ? " " They are afraid to leave him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as they are married , William seems to think people will forget about Janet . He does n't know human nature any better than he knows God , though he is an elder . They will go away , he says , and begin life all over again . Of course Ralph will have to give up law . All his study will be wasted ; but William thinks he can do better as an agent for the new automobiles . There 's a kind of small car that William has taken the agency for in Queen-borough . " " It will ruin his life . Ca n't you see , Grandmother , that it will ruin his life ? " Grandmother groaned as she sank heavily in a chair by the table . Ada 's grief weighed on her mind as a catastrophe that some error of faith could not reconcile with God 's providence . All this Ada saw in the stricken old face as she looked at it through the mist of anguish that floated between them . " I know , I know , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't try to speak to Ralph while he is with them . Though he is so quiet , he looks ready to fly off the helve . " . . . The stick dropped to the floor as she reached out her trembling hand158 VEIN OF IRONto seize the girl 's dress , which slipped from her grasp when Ada turned away and darted out of the room . While the old woman sat there alone a sudden vertigo rushed over her , as if every object in the room had become menacing and alive . To save herself from falling out of her chair , she clutched the edge of the table and looked up , startled , astonished , incredulous . In front of her yawned the bottomless pit , outside and beyond the infinite mercy . Then , just as the room and the earth were about to give way under her feet , she said aloud : " The Lord has never failed me . I am in the hands of the Lord . " While the chant pealed through her mind , equilibrium was restored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy surged through her veins , and her withered heart , she felt , put on greenness . For she had spoken only the truth . The Lord had never failed her . She was in the hands of the Lord . XIE had come at the sound of her voice . He had broken away from the older men and had followedher through the door and down the slope of lawn to the willow beside the spring . The others had gone without him . She could see them moving in dark smudges over the grass and down the road to the village . On the other side , beyond the circle of love and terror that closed in about them , Aunt Meggie was scatteringdough for her hens . But while they stood there in that invisible circle , they were safe , they were alone together , they were still lovers . With her first glance at him , after they had joined hands and fled out of the house , she felt that something ( was it hope ? ) had died in her bosom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , and what was even harder to bear , he looked humbled . They had not only broken his spirit , they had humbled his pride . Worst of all , there was a flickering rage , like a dark fire , in his eyes , and his usually charming mouth sagged downward at the corners in a curve of brooding resentment . Yet never , not even in their happiestmoments , had she loved him so much . Never until she had seen him humbled , but still defiant , had she felt that her heart was flaming with tenderness . Nothing could ever change that . Nothing could make her stop loving him . Oh , Ralph . . . Ralph . . . She had again that sense of strugglingwith an illusion , of being swept away by an invisible current . " I am trapped , " he said hoarsely , as if his mouth had gone dry . " They 've got me in a trap . I ca n't get out . There 's no way . " He hesitated , swallowed hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm trapped . " His clothes looked as if he had slept in them , and the knuckles went red and white as he clenched his hands . " I ought not to have come away last night , " she said . " You were right to come . I was making a fool of myself . " " They 've gone back without you . " It was like catching ata leaf in a flood . " I told them I had to see you . I told them I would n't budge a step till I 'd seen you . " His mouth flattened into ugliness . " I told them . . . " " What have they done to you ? " " They 're making me give you up . They 're making me marry Janet . " Ile spoke in sharp bitten-off phrases , with a whistling sound in his throat . " They 're all against me , even your father . It is n't that they believe anything happened last night . I kissed her , that was all . Anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes . She pretended she could n't find the photograph . Then she screamed at a mouse . But there was n't any mouse . " " I know Janet . But why does she have to have you ? There are plenty of others . " " She thought you wanted me . " His laugh curled like a whip round the words . " That would be reason enough . " " Tell them . Let me tell them . " " They would n't listen . There 're some things a man ca n't say , not even if he 's trapped . Your father thinks I deserve anything . I reckon I do for being a fool . " " Ca n't we fight them ? I 'll fight them with you . I 'll nevergive in . " Her tears streamed down , and without wiping themaway , without lifting a finger to her convulsed mouth , shebroke into a sobbing moan , " Oh , Ralph . . . Ralph . . . " While he looked down at her , violent yet helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a tree in a high wind . " Do n't , Ada . . . . Do n't , my darling . . . . I feel as if I 'd like to kill something . But not an animal . I know how animalsfeel when they 're trapped . I want to kill something human . " She clung to him , sobbing . " You 're different . They 've made you different . " " The difference is that I see what a fool I am . I 've always been a fool , but now I know it  --  and I 've dragged you into the mess . " " You have n't . You have n't dragged me into anything . " " Yes , I have , that 's the worst of it . I love you . I 've never loved anybody but you , and I 've spoiled your life . " His rage leaped out in a running fire and subsided as quickly into disgust . " It is n't fair . I 'm no worse than others . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never did more than kiss her . You believe that , do n't you , Ada ? " " I believe it . " She stared through tears at a soaring hawk , which swooped suddenly , flashed downward like a curved blade in the air , and seized a small bird  --  or it may have been one of Aunt Meggie 's chickens  --  in its claws before it swept upward and onward . And she felt that the same claws had seized her heart out of her breast , and had swept away with it over the sunny land , over the tranquil blue of the hills . Until this moment of anguish , she had felt that she was a part of the Valley , of its religion , its traditions , its unspoken laws , as well as of its fields and streams and friendly mountains . But now her heart was torn up from its place , mangled and bleeding . Only a jagged scar was left in the spot where her life had been rooted . " I must go , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VEIN OF IRON love someone else . But . . . but we belong together . . . we 've always belonged together . Nothing can change that . " " Nothing can change that . " She looked round with a wild gaze , as a person looks on the verge of flight . " If only we could go away ! But where ? There is n't anywhere . " As he opened his lips , a sound between a groan and a sob strangled his words . There was a throbbing pulse in his voice , and when he spoke at last this throbbing made a formless tumult in her mind . " Will you come with me now  --  this minute ? Will you come up on Thunder Mountain ? We could walk over the old Indian trail to . . . somewhere . People have done things more reckless . " Then the flare of courage died down . " But we could n't go far enough . They could ruin us before I found work . The little I 've saved Mother has put away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the money to start on . " She nodded while her lips worked to keep back her sobs . Dumbness had seized her . At the moment when she needed words most , when she longed to pour out her heart , to utter vows , to speak prophecies , dumbness had sealed her lips . " There 's no place we could go . " The cry might have been wrung from him by the turn of some inner screw . " There 's no room in the world for a fool . " He crushed her to him till she felt there was nothing left alive in her but the burning sense of that pressure  --  nothing but his kiss , which was salt with tears , and the extremity of her despair . " I love you , " he said , and drawing away , looked at her with that dreadful humility in his eyes . " I 've loved you all my life . I 'll always love you . Not only this way , but every way . " Again her lips worked convulsively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shape syllables . Animals must feel like this , she thought , when they are trying to learn human speech . His smile swept away the darkness from his face , and she felt again that she had never loved him so much as in the moment when she must lose him forever . " I ought to fight , " she told herself . " I ought to fight for what is mine . " But how could she fight ? How could she fight an antagonist that had no reality ? She was alone now , alone with that phantom . He had kissed her again and said more quietly , " I love you . " He had taken her hands , folded them on her bosom , and kissed them over and over . While she was still struggling to speak he had turned away , and then , abruptly , as if the earth had opened under his feet , he was gone . One minute he had been there , his arms about her , his mouth on hers , and the next minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving over the grass . Far away , across an immeasurable vacancy , she heard the thin piping call of her grandmother 's voice . " Ada ! Ada , where are you ? " No , she could n't bear her grandmothernotnow . As the call was repeated , she fled from the willow , past the henhouse and the garden fence and Aunt Abigail'scabin , to the stony hillside where sheep were cropping . But the hill was too near the heartbreaking blue of the sky . She must go away . She must go away from peace  --  from beauty . Only ugliness could help her  --  only ugliness that stabbed into her eyes . Only the world 's pain could blunt the edge of her own pain . Turning her back on God 's Mountain , she climbed the board fence and skirted the edge of the meadow until she came to the old field and the gully of red clay by Murderer 's Grave . Here she dropped down on soil where nothing would grow , and stared into bright empti-164 VEIN OF IRONness . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it awoke only repulsion . Pain had thrust her out of the smiling meadow into this unhealed wound in the earth . The soil fell away , without a blade of green , into the rutted basin of the old watercourse . Nobody knew the spot where the murderer was buried . But somewhere below those reddish furrows , which the rain had worn into grotesqueshapes , lay the skeleton of a man who had been hanged because he had murdered a woman  --  his wife , the old story ran  --  though Aunt Abigail believed the woman had had her deserts because she had left her real husband to run off with her murderer . Not that it mattered . He was at rest now ; his grave had sunk down out of sight . They had cast him out from the churchyard , but for nearly a hundred years he had taken his revenge as a scar on the landscape . That was the way life left its brand upon happiness . Wherever life was , there was evil and ugliness ; there was misery . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything is over . " Her voice startled her , it was so toneless and gray  --  a drab voice . " It is all over , " she said again , still speaking aloud . But the words meant nothing to her ; the syllables were as empty as old wasps ' nests . A deep instinct , stronger than speech , superior to knowledge , told her this could not have happened . To someone else perhaps , long ago in that half-obliterated past when savages roamed the mountains  --  long ago a boy named Ralph and a girl named Ada might have lived through such shame and suffering and bitterness . If it were true , and not merely an evil dream , her heart would feel broken ; but now , after that first shock of agony , she felt nothing . There was only a numbness that began in her senses and closed in slowly about that beating pulse in her head . On the other side of the ravine Toby Waters was crawlingTHE SINGLE HEART 165on his stomach over the ground . Being an idiot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than death ; it was worse than losing your lover . It was so terrible , being an idiot , that she pressed the thought deeper and deeper , like a thorn , into her consciousness . If only the thorn would pierce sharply enough , it might bring relief . It might even separate the old past where such things happened from the new present in which she was dreaming about them . In her dream there was Murderer 's Grave ; there was the green valley ; there was Toby Waters crawling toward her ; there were the hovel and the pigsty and the squealing pigs and the chickens scratching among refuse . And , in some strange way , she seemed to deny her own suffering while she dwelt on the dirt and squalor and horror and inescapable misery of life . An unknown bird with a white breast flew overhead . Was it a dove or a hawk ? Her gaze followed it in its flight toward Thunder Mountain , and she remembered the Indian trail on one of the timbered ridges . One might live for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forest . Then , suddenly , like the shadow of a beast , pain sprang out on her , clutching , tearing , devouring . . . . Everything was over . There was nothing to expect , nothing to fear , nothing to dread . Flinging herself on the ground , she bruised her bosom against the hard furrows . All that remained now was waiting  --  waiting for nothing . Twenty years . . . thirty years . . . fifty years might be ahead of her . The Fincastles and the Craigies were long-lived . She was only twenty now , and she might live to be ninety ! And she had not fought for her own . She had yielded without a struggle to this tyranny of opinion , of the way people think about things . It was only air , after all . Words are only stale air  --  yet they had conquered her . She had been conquered by a mere mouthing . There are some166 VEIN OF IRONthings a man ca n't say . Who had said that ? Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuse her . Who had said that ? Not Ralph ? Yes , it was Ralph . It was Ralph who had said he could n't accuse Janet . He had sacrificed himself , and her also , to a last rag of chivalry , to a tradition in which he did not even believe . And her father ! Her father was a martyr to truth , but it was his own truth , not hers , not another 's . Oh , Ralph . . . Ralph . . . While she cried the name withoutsound , her anguish increased until it filled all the hollows . The June meadows and Smiling Creek and Murderer 's Grave and the emptiness in her own mind became only stark outlines of pain  --  mere skeletons of what had once been a living and moving world . An eternity ( or was it a minute ? ) afterwards a voice whined over her head . Turning on the ground , she saw the idiot 's face bending above her , holding out hands that were filled with purple larkspur , torn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugar , sugar , " he drooled , offering her the flowers . " Toby wants sugar . " Before springing to her feet , she sat motionless for an instant , as if she were only a larger lump of clay , and stared up into the grinning face , where yellow teeth protruded like fangs , and a crooked leer slanted up to the squinting eyes . Almost he had touched her . Never before had she been so close to his filthy clothes and his evil stench . Horror , less gnawing but more loathsome than pain , seized her . Yet he was a creature like herself , she thought , more repulsive than any animal , but born , as she and an animal were born , to crave joy , to suffer loss , and to know nothing beyond . His mother , she found herself thinking vacantly , ought to doTHE SINGLE HEART 167something about him . She ought to make him clean himself before he came out to beg in the road . " No sugar today , " she said sternly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odor of a bear , sickened her . Then she saw his eyes water with tears and his mouth stutter , and she added hurriedly , " There will be sugar tomorrow . Toby shall have a sugar cake in the morning . " Leering joyously , he held out the larkspur , which scatteredand dropped to die on the ground . No , she could n't touch them . Even the flowers would be tainted by that foul smell . Nothing could be worse than that , it was true . The village ought to take care of him , her father said . Yet his mother had buried two other children , both idiots . Mrs. Waters had a father , an old man , still living in Panther 's Gap . He had married an idiot girl from the almshouse , and they had four idiot sons , who worked in the cornfield . Once when Ada was little she had ridden by the place behind her father on his old bay mare , and she had seen three of these boys gathering sunflower seeds for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made that she had slipped down from the mare 's back . If Bess , the mare , had not been wise enough to stop , her father had said , there might have been broken bones for Dr. Updike to set . But people could n't do anything about idiots . It was God 's law , Grandmother said , that married people , no matter whether they were half-wits or not , must bring all the children they could into the world to share in the curse that was put upon Adam and Eve . Standing there , while Toby ran back to the hovel , she felt the sharp revulsion of her senses deaden for an instant her intolerable heartache . Life was like that . Life contained no security . Horror waited everywhere to pounce upon happi-168 VEIN OF IRONness , as the hawk had pounced upon the small bird . Under her feet there was the sterile clay , encircled by the flowersprinkledvalley which shaded from palest azure to deepest violet . Beyond the smaller valley the light was already changing on the lower hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear , even horror , but not beauty . Not the beauty that was like a knife in her heart , the beauty that made her believe in the joy she had lost without ever possessing . Hours later , when she circled the field , the light had changed again , and afternoon brooded over the valley . Within its clustering oaks , the old brick house was folded in quiet . The birds were silent in the trees , the leaves had ceased to quiver on their stems , and the shadows were so transparent that they might have been merely darker waves of the sunshine . It looked a place of happiness , she thought bitterly ; but the lost harmony of mood and scene was scarcely nearer to her now than was the girl she had been yesterday . For that girl seemed as remote and unreal as a snow image . She had never known pain , she had never known cruelty , she had never known life . As she crossed the lawn her father came out of the garden with a hoe in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " when the pen is heavier than the hoe . " Though he was stricken to the heart , she knew , he could still smile his inward , dreaming , faintly ironic smile . " Father , why did you let them ruin Ralph 's life ? " " You will understand better when you are older , Ada . But Ralph 's life is not ruined , nor is yours . You are both young , and to the young nothing , not even ruin , has finality . Don'tTHE SINGLE HEART 169lose your courage too soon . The future still belongs to you . " She shook her head . " No , I have n't anything left . Nothing again will ever make any difference . " Inside the house , she heard her mother 's voice , soft , eager , yet vaguely apprehensive . " Is that you , Ada ? I have not seen you today . Where have you been ? " " I 've been out in the fields , Mother . As soon as I 've washed my face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peering in from the back porch , Grandmother beckoned to her . " You have n't eaten a bite , my dear . I 've saved some cold buttermilk . " Ada slipped noiselessly past her mother 's door and went out on the porch . " No , I do n't want anything . " " Could n't you swallow a little of your mother 's tapioca ? " " I do n't want anything . " When she had finished hanging out a dishcloth , Grandmotherturned and looked at the girl from under the horn rims of her spectacles . There was sympathy in her face , but there was a tremendous power also , the equanimity of unruffled conviction . " Try not to take this too hard , my dear child . God would not have sent you a trial of faith if it were not for your good . You wo n't make it easier by taking it too hard . " " I take it the only way I can , Grandmother . " " Pray over it , and try not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll never pray again . I 'll never , never pray again as long as I live . " A shudder ran over Grandmother 's massive frame . So she had shuddered in church when Dugald Adcock had turned away from the bread and wine of the Lord 's Supper. 170 VEIN OF IRON " Bend your will , my child ! " she cried out in fear . " Bend your will before it is broken ! " For an instant Ada stared dumbly away into space . When her voice came at last it was barely louder than the whimperingmoan of a small animal in a trap . " I do n't care , " she said . " I do n't care what God does to me . " While she dragged her body , which felt cold and dead , upstairs to her room , she thought wearily , " It will always be like this . No matter how long it lasts , everything will be nothing . " XIIMARY EVELYN was dying . For weeks she had not moved from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed through the open windows , where the ivy had been trimmed back to let in the light . Outside , she could see the light drift on the grass and the sunflowers , heavy with brown seed , sway and bend over the garden fence . In the room her invalid 's chair stood empty , pushed into a corner but not put away out of sight . Hour after hour , day after day , week after week , her family listened anxiously to a murmur so thin and soft that it might have been the voice of the stillness . Not only the birds , but even the insects , were hushed in the trees ; the wind made no stir as it passed on ; only this whisper , rapid , fugitive , yet strangely alive , gushed out from the pallid lips and became a part of the silence . The bed , the room , the house , the whole of life , were saturated with the mingled smell of mustard and camphor . The odor of pain ! Ada thought . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor of pain  --  of the dying flesh , of the spirit struggling to release itself from the clay , of loss , grief , helpless pity , and heartbreak . " Is it time for her medicine , Grandmother ? " " I tried to give it , but she can take so little . " " Does she know what she is saying ? Does she know when she smiles or frowns ? " " I think so sometimes . Anyway , she is at peace . She has put her trust in her Redeemer . " " She is trying to tell us something . Oh , Grandmother , what is she trying to tell us ? " 171172 VEIN OF IRON " I think she is wandering . Perhaps you can catch the words , John . " " Can you hear , Father ? Oh , Father , she is trying so hard ! It makes her cry , she is trying so hard . " Still clasping his wife 's hand , John Fincastle leaned over with his ear close to the fluttering breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her face . Her head raised itself from the pillow and turned slightly in his direction . Then it fell back . Her eyes opened and looked through him , and through the room and the trees and the hills , as if they were all figures of shadow . While she looked , she spoke in a new voice . " I have been happy , " she said clearly . Grandmother measured out a dose of digitalis and rising softly , held a towel under Mary Evelyn 's chin . " She has swallowed a little , if only she is able to keep it down . " But the medicine came up almost immediately , and the old woman 's hand trembled as she wiped away the stains from the moving lips . " I ) r . Updike says there may be no change for weeks , " she whispered , " but the doctor from Queenboroughwas less hopeful . " How often had she heard those words ? Ada asked herself . When and where were they first spoken ? How long had they sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through hours that had no minutes , flat , timeless , everlasting , for her mother to die ? Was it yesterday ? Was it today ? Was it even tomorrow ? Her back was toward the window , and she saw only the rays of sunshine that trickled in through the leaves and settled in a still pool on her mother 's face . Near the head of the bed , beside the bottles of medicine on the candlestand , her grandmother was seated with her knees far apart , erect , tireless , watchful . Her gray hair straggled in wisps fromTHE SINGLE HEART 173under a cap that was now slightly askew , like the wrinkles across her brow , but at eighty-three she was still calm , austere , indomitable . Within the shadow of the headboard , John Fincastle 's features seemed to blend with this outline , though the serenity in his face was shattered by grief . To her father , Ada knew , death was a part of life , to be accepted with the animal faith which was nobler than vain conflicts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , and so justified . Yet they both valued existence ; they had lived more happily because they had believed , each in a different way , that life was something more than mere living . Her mother was now sleeping quietly , so quietly that fear shot through Ada 's mind while she watched . " Is it natural , Grandmother ? " she whispered . " She 's barely breathing . " " Yes , she 's sleeping . You 'd better go upstairs and lie down . " " I ca n't . I ca n't leave her . " In years to come she would reproach herself for every minute she spent away from her mother 's side , she would suffer over every remembered neglect . " But you need rest yourself , " she urged in so low a tone that the old woman was obliged to guess what she was saying . " No , I must keep watch . Old people can do without sleep . " While her stooping spine sprang upright , she said again , " I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fourteen years old now , if a day , and almost as rheumatic as Grandmother , padded in from the hall , raised his eyes with a wondering glance , and lay down on the strip of rug by the bed . They would n't keep him long , Grandmother feared , though a foxhound belonging to her husband had lived nearly seventeen years . It was seldom that he left the house , and then only for an excursion174 VEIN OF IRONinto the unmown grass or to the roots of a tree . " I declare that dog is almost human , " the old woman murmured . " I believe he understands every word that we say . " She laid her hand on his head , and he thumped his tail so gently that it was merely another vibration . I wonder whether Ralph knows ? Ada thought . But Ralph and her unhappy love were shapes without substance . When she tried to think of him , he evaporated into a mist . She could say to herself , Three years ago he married Janet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart is broken , that also meant nothing . The only thing that now lived for her was the slow ( lying , day after day , of her mother . " Grandmother , is n't there a change ? Does n't she seem to know more ? " " She is still sleeping , my dear . Dr. Updike says she does n't suffer even when she comes back . " " If only she would n't frown , if only she would n't cry to herself . " So it had been since the beginning of July . So it would be , the physicians thought , for months longer , perhaps into the autumn . But at the end of August she died very quietly , alone in the room with her husband and old Horace . Grandmotherwas making a fresh mustard plaster , Aunt Meggie was warming a little milk in a saucepan on the kitchen stove , and Ada had slipped out of doors for a breath of the late afternoon . At the door the girl had beckoned to Horace , but he had refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced round and smiled at his daughter , and for an instant it had seemed to him that his wife 's fingers played as softly as the touch of a fern over the back of his hand . Then the pale golden light of the afterglow had shone into the room , and somewhere outside , far up in the leaves , THE SINGLE HEART 175there was the startled cheep of a bird . At the call , Mary Evelyn opened her eyes and looked at him with a flash of her old animation . " It will be dark soon , " she said in a cheerful voice , before sinking back into a sleep from which she never awoke . For a few minutes he sat there beside her , apprehensive yet hopeful , while he listened to her breathing , which seemed to grow fainter and fainter , like a breeze that is dying away in the distance . Even then , after it had entirely ceased , without effort and without the horror of the death struggle , he did not realize that she was dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still holding Mary Evelyn 's hand . " I thought I heard somebody call , " the old woman said , " and I came as quick as I could . " Then , as she reached the bedside , she pushed her son away , and he saw her hands , knotted and worn with healing , pass over his wife 's bosom . What is it , John Fincastle asked himself , that has enabled human beings to build their indestructible fallacies about death ? Is it hope ? Is it fear ? Is it the long mingling of both ? As a part of life , perhaps , one could accept death without bitterness , as the only part of life that is endowed with finality . With his mind he had acquiesced ; he had triumphed over belief and denial . But one does not believe , one does not doubt , with the mind alone . The heart must be convinced , and the blood stream , and the nerves . " If only I had known , " he thought , confronting the universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . For there was much , there were so many things , that he had not known , that now he could never know . He had thought of himself as strong ; he176 VEIN OF IRONhad thought of Mary Evelyn as weak ; yet he felt tonight that , in some mysterious way , he had renewed his strength in her weakness . He had listened so long to the murmurous flow of her voice that he could not think in the silence . His freedom was so vast that he was lost in the midst of it . Beyond the open window , it seemed to him that the very brightness of the stars was dim and tarnished with grief . " Mary Evelyn ! Mary Evelyn ! " he cried without sound into a void that was bottomless . There was no answer . He had not expected an answer . Though her going had drained the world of life , she would vanish from his sight and his touch without pausing to look back . " Mary Evelyn ! " he cried over again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so near , before she had passed entirely out of the universe that contained them both . But there was no return from the abyss that was loss , no stir , no shadow , not so much as a vibration of light . She had left nothing behind her but this intolerable stillness . Yet in my flesh shall I see God , Grandmother Fincastle was thinking , while a few tears rolled over her eyelids and down on her furrowed cheeks . Even now , Mary Evelyn was beholding the face of God , though her body would wait in its grave , as in a bed , for the Day of Judgment . How could one mourn when one remembered that incorruptible glory ? When one remembered the promise that the righteous shall be caught up to Christ in the clouds , that they shall be set on His right hand , and shall join in the judging of reprobate angels and men ? A spasm of pain convulsed Grandmother 's features . But what of John ? What of her son ? Where would he stand among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Evelyn be asked to judge her own husband ? And could she , who had loved him so passionately , be happy after he was judged and cast out ? Could she be satisfiedeven in the company of innumerable saints and angels , " but especially in the immediate vision and fruition of God the Father , of our Lord Jesus Christ , and of the Holy Spirit , to all eternity " ? Who could answer ? Could even the Larger Catechism cast light into that darkness ? But it was God 's will , and so one must believe . One must see with the eye of faith , not with the eye of flesh , as her husband had said . And , meanwhile , the work of the house waited . She must leave salvation to God , and remind Meggie not to let her dish of batter bread burn while she laid out the dead . " If only I had stayed with her every minute , " Ada told herself in remorse , for she felt that her heart was breaking over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unhappy . If only I had n't let myself think of Ralph when she needed me . " But it was useless to try not to think of Ralph when Ralph was still the very pulse of her thought . If she tore him out , there would be nothing left of herself . He had been a part of her happiness ; he was now a part of her sorrow . She could not escape him by wishing . Not seeing him did not alter her love . Mother had wanted her to marry Ross Greenlee , but she could never think of any man but Ralph as her lover . Yet while her mother lay dying her self-reproach was so bitter that she would have married anyone , no matter how old or ugly he was , if only her mother had approved of him . " Oh , Mother , Mother ! " she called aloud , biting back the cry before it reached the ears of her grandmother . Noth-178 VEIN OF IRON THE SINGLE HEART 179ing , not even Ralph , not even her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring back her mother . But life was here , and the will was toward life . Nobody , not even the old , not even the despairing , wished to come to an end in time or in eternity . So her grandmother said , and her grandmother must know . Ada wondered now why her father believed that fear of the end was an ignoble delusion . Surely he also , like other persons , sound or unsound , must still wish to live on . Well , whatever came to her must be borne . " If broken hearts could kill , " Grandmother had reminded her , " the earth would be as dead as the moon . " Dressed in ill-fitting black , tearless and composed , Ada stood in the parlor , which was thrown open for the funeral , and thanked the neighbors who had flocked to the manse . The road from the village was crowded with vehicles , and with those too poor to own a horse and buggy who came walking . Many of them had brought mourning garments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mrs. Black and the Rowans and Dr. Updike and the Melroses and old Mrs. Tiller , stole across the hall and into the dimly lighted chamber , where Mary Evelyn , young again and indescribablyradiant , lay in her coffin . " She could n't look that way , " Mrs. Black had whispered to Ada , " if she had n't liked what she found over there . " " My boy has come to the funeral , " Mrs. McBride murmured , softened by death . " I 've always told him he loved Mary Evelyn better than his own mother . " In the churchyard Ada saw only the open grave , and heard only the clods of earth falling , falling . Her father 's arm felt as fleshless as a bleached bone in her grasp , and itseemed to her that the universe , with all that it contained , was pared down to a skeleton . All the Fincastle skeletons were lying there , within that rusty railing , under the old sycamore . The row of sandstone slabs , as yellow as old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright among the periwinkle and ivy . Oh , why did she think morbid thoughts at such moments ? Her grandmother , by her side , could keep her mind properly governed and fixed upon the hope of a joyful resurrection . When the last clod had been shoveled in , the flowers had been placed on the fresh grave , and Ada had driven home in a borrowed carriage with her father , her grandmother , and her weeping aunt , she cried out wildly that she could not bear the blank horror of loss , the unendurable flatness of grief.
