Ross , Administrator of the Bonneville Darn power project , asserted yesterday that the authority does not intend to duplicate any existing transmission lines in the Northwest for the purpose of conveying Government produced power . Following a final conference with President Roosevelt before returning to the West coast , Mr. Ross declared that he was going to build transmission lines to Portland , Ore .. as soon as possible and then would " shove the power along existing lines to other parts of the territory as rapidly as Bonneville could produce it . " He said , however , that at the present time the project had only 86.000 kilowatt installed capacity and for the time being he could only hope to build the Portland line , for which surveys are almost completed . Mr. Ross estimated WELL it would require roughly $30,000,000 to build the transmission lines which will carry the ultimate installed capacity of Bonneville estimated at the present time at 504,000 kilowatts . He pointed out that for the coming fiscal year the appropriation requested was only $1,450,000 . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry the work forward more rapidly . Mr. Ross was unable to say when rates for Bonneville would be fixed . The Federal Power Commission , he said , was now examining data upon which the price would be set .
