txt A Matter of Signs One evening last week a law-abiding wayfarer sought unsuccessfully to cross Lexington Avenue at 6:30 P. M. A traffic snarl extending for several blocks was vainly trying to unsnarl itself . No attention was paid or could be paid to the lights . The pedestrian looked hopefully north and south . No relief appeared . Instead , as far as the eye could reach on both sides of the avenue , he saw closely parked cars apparently without occupants . Glancing upward , a police department sign caught his eye . It was attached to an electric light post  --  one of many such signs in this locality . He saw the warning : " No Parking Between 5 and 7 P. M. " As later he thoughtfully threaded a circuitous and dangerous route between the stalled cars he decided that the Police Department should repaint those signs to read : " No Pedestrians Allowed to Cross Between 5 and 7 P. M. Because of the Parking Nuisance . " FRANK COENEN . New York , Dec. 2 , 1936.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
