Red B.B.C. <P> Sirs : <P> I read with amusement your statement under Radio ( TIME , May 22 ) that the news broadcasts of the B.B.C. are " straight and accurate . " Actually , nothing could be further from the truth , as the B.B.C. is as Red as they make ' em , and its distorted , lying and slanderous statements are equalled only by the foreign-language broadcasts from Moscow and the nightly French , anti-Fascist " news " bulletins in Italian from Nice . . . . <P> It may be , as you say , that the English broadcasts from Hamburg cause amusement in England ; that , however , would not be startling , as the English , with the possible exception of the Chinese , are the most hypocritical and misinformed people on earth . <P> Having recently returned from an extensive trip through Germany , I can testify to the fact that , contrariwise , the German and Italian broadcasts of the B.B.C. amuse the peoples of the Axis no end . <P> Incidentally , the " Giornale Radio " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate in Europe . If you do n't believe it , just tune in on one ( six times a day , 8 a.m. , 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 and 11 p.m . ) . <P> Naturally , I do n't expect you 'll dare to print this either , but I just had to get it off my chest . <P> CHARLES P. KIMBALL JR . <P> Cortina d ' Ampezzo , Italy <P> Church Manners <P> Sirs : <P> In TIME , April 17 , you published a review of a small pamphlet Church Manners , which we issued for the benefit of the people of this parish , whose manners , by the way , are perfect . Since that time we have been deluged with orders from all over the U. S. and Canada , Mexico , and the Hawaiian Islands , and the pamphlet has now run through four editions . <P> Our compliments to you . <P> THOMAS F. COAKLEY , D.D . <P> Sacred Heart Church <P> Pittsburgh , Pa . <P> Duke of Durham <P> Sirs : <P> Your great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Buck " Duke ( TIME , June 26 , p. 55 ) , brings up some of the Duke stories which cover the Carolinas like Buck Duke 's Southern hydroelectric power lines and are almost as numerous throughout the South as 5 bags of Duke 's Mixture and Bull Durham smoking tobacco . <P> There is one that Buck Duke used to tell on himself , of the time Mrs. Duke was dragging him through Europe into art galleries , cathedrals , etc. , and while visiting Canterbury Cathedral , Buck felt tired . He seated himself in the nearest pew which happened to be the choir stalls . Quickly a sexton came up and asked if he would move for he was in a stall reserved for nobility . Buck Duke is reported to have asked the sexton , " Who in the hell do you think I am ? " The sexton politely backed off and asked " Who , sir ? " and Buck answered " Duke of Durham .
