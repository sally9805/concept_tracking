While the San Francisco Examiner was celebrating its 50th year under William Randolph Hearst the San Francisco Chronicle was celebrating its first week of Kate McGrorey O'Connor . <P> For 25 years Mrs. O'Connor was a tower of moral strength in the San Francisco Police Department . Part of her job was to keep her door open to the less criminal among the city 's unfortunates , listen to their stories , advise them . Last month she reached the Department 's retiring age , 63 , and found that the law made no provision for pensioning a policewoman . The Chronicle thereupon invited her to become its Director of Social Service , privately interview and assist readers with troubles more grave than the heart , publicly comment on their letters in a daily column . <P> Last week when the Chronicle inaugurated Mrs. O'Connor 's bureau , every bigwig from Mayor Angelo J. Rossi down had a good word for her as she tackled her first day 's work : Advised a jobless old woman how to find a home , helped a mother control a wayward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother in San Quentin , rescued the residents of a trailer camp from ousting by health officials . Starting the other half of her job , Columnist O'Connor wrote : <P> " When people come to see me , they wo n't walk down a hall past uniformed policemen to the office of Policewoman Kate O'Connor . They 'll be coming in to see their friend , Kate O'Connor . ... In my time I have met all kinds of people and listened to all kinds of stories . . . . I have never been shocked at anything . ... I never think of myself as judge . . . . Please remember , you are n't coming to a police officer . My files will always be locked . I will talk to you alone . . . . It 's so easy to get in trouble and so terribly hard to get out of it . . . . " <P> Quipped the Chronicle 's Rhymester Kevin Wallace : <P> The Chronicle deems it an honor             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
