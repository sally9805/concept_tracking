John Billy was a bad Indian . He drank , drabbed , brawled in a way to shock his fellow Seminoles , who spend their lives manufacturing souvenirs , wrestling ' gators for Miami 's winter visitors , drowsing through humid summers in the Everglades . Recently Seminole heads shook ominously . Word went out that John Billy had assaulted the daughter of John Osceola , great-grandson of a great Seminole warrior , himself the venerable chief of Pirates ' Cove Village on the Miami River . Last week the heads of Miami authorities were shaking , too , as they tried to puzzle out what had happened to John Billy . <P> Only clear fact was that John Billy had been drilled by a shotgun at close range and buried in the Everglades 20 miles west of Miami . Shrugging Seminoles there said that he was an evildoer sent to be buried among strangers . In John Billy 's home village , investigators finally learned that he had been shot on Musa Isle outside of Miami , that the killer was none other than John Osceola himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pirates ' Cove sitting cross-legged and barefooted in his striped finery , placidly smoking a pipe . He did not deny the story . Mindful of the Seminole law that the friends of a killer must bring him gifts within three days or be forever branded as his enemies , police searched , discovered that John Osceola had just received some $50 in gifts . Then they arrested him . <P> Later , John Osceola , released in custody of his white attorney , was allowed to explain himself , through an interpreter , on the radio . Said he : " He my cousin , but he bad Indian too . I kill him by cuttem belly with knife . " Listeners wondered whether the police had arrested him for the wrong crime .
