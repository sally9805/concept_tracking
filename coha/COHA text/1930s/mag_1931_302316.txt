The Lords- Received into their House former Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden who , scarcely able to support the weight of his ermine-barred , scarlet robes , hobbled painfully on his two canes up to Lord Chancellor Sankey and piped " I , Viscount Snowden of Ickornshaw , swear by Almighty God that I will bear true allegiance to His Majesty King George , his heirs and successors , according to law . So help me God . " <P> Ickornshaw , derived from Norse words meaning " Oak in the Woods , " was the new viscount 's village birthplace . Because of his infirmities , stooped Viscount Snowden did not kneel to the Lord Chancellor as custom prescribes . Ostentatiously Lord Snowden 's former friends in the present Labor Party boycotted his swearing in . But present were Scot MacDonald , most of the Cabinet and the new peer 's longtime political enemy Winston Church ill , with whom he used to alternate as Chancellor of the Exchequer . <P> Impishly Mr. Churchill , in whose veins flows the blue blood of the House of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . Impishly low-born Lord Snowden grinned back . It was even scurrilously whispered that these friendly enemies exchanged winks . <P> The Commons- <P> Cheered the patriotic announcement that His Majesty 's Government will soon introduce a bill making it unlawful to sell flour in the United Kingdom which contains less than 15% of British wheat . So incensed was the French Government by this proposal that it " retaliated " last week by raising the compulsory proportion of French flour in French bakers ' bread from 90% , to 97% . <P> Passed 350 fo 50 and sent to the House of Lords the Statute of Westminster ( TIME , Nov. 30 ) by which all the Dominions achieve " full national status to stand beside the United Kingdom as equal part ners in the dignity and responsibility of the British Commonwealth . " <P> Saw the National Government 's over whelming majority split for the first time as the above vote took place . Momentarily into opposition bolted die-hard Winston Churchill and 50 Tory M. P.s who thought that that rambunctious Dominion , the Irish Free State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only ratifying a decision already made by two Imperial Conferences of British Premiers ( 1926 &; 1930 ) . Paradoxically the official Labor Opposition , led by old George Lansbury , bolted to support the Government , since Labor has always sup ported a policy of granting the Dominions all possible freedom . <P> Learned from Minister of Agriculture Sir John Gilmour that Britain 's emergency tariff on industrial products ( TIME , Nov. 30 ) will shortly be extended to tax up to 100% imports of fresh cherries , currants , gooseberries , hothouse grapes , plums and strawberries ; fresh asparagus , green beans , broccoli , cauliflower , carrots , chicory , cucumbers , endive , lettuce , mushrooms , green peas , new potatoes , tomatoes and turnips ; cut flowers , plants in flower , bulbs , foliage and rose trees .
