txt Mr. Rogers Joins in Task Of Trying to Salvage NRA To the Editor of The Now York Times : LOS ANGELES , Calif. , June 2 . ? Well , sir , a forlorn looking gentleman come to my house this Sunday afternoon . Said he was one of Roosevelt 's Cabinet , and he looked it . It wan Mr. Roper , Secretary of Commerce . I try to make it a point to never turn anybody away . First one of the New Deal I had seen since the Supreme Court took their matches away from ' em . But he was a game Southern gentleman . No kicks , no squawks . He and I searched around through the burned embers to see if any little New Deal object might be salvaged . We decided that with big business operating under the old " dog-eat-dog " plan , so many dogs would eventually get bit that parts of the NRA would look like a halo by 1936 . Yours , WILL ROGERS .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
