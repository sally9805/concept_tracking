Neither new King George VI nor any member of the Royal Family sat with Prince Edward during the abdication broadcast from Windsor Castle ( see p. 15 ) . His Majesty had become King and Emperor eight hours previously , and immediately dropped into a quiet routine of receiving British home &; Dominion statesmen at his home , No. 145 Piccadilly . As Duke of York he aroused only the slightest public interest , but British aristocrats said with particular satisfaction of the Duchess of York , " She is one of us , " and a popular knowledge that the late King George V was most fond of their little daughter " Lilybet " ( together with her marked facial resemblance to Queen Mary ) insures her great popularity with Britain 's masses . <P> Lilybet was riding out last week when she read on screaming red posters in the street that her daddy is King and asked , " But what has happened to Uncle David ? " She is now crown princess but not Princess of Wales for that title is never borne except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hon. James Henry ( " Jim " ) Thomas , who has been in scandalous eclipse since his resignation from the Cabinet after the Budget leak ( TIME , June 1 et ante ) , is nevertheless a Privy Councilor for life and last week was out in full regalia with the 300-odd other Privy Councilors in the Throne Room of St. James 's Palace to hear King George VI read his accession address : " ... I take up the heavy task . . . . My first act ... to confer on Edward a dukedom . . . . He will henceforth be known as His Royal Highness , the Duke of Windsor . ... I declare to you my adherence to the strict principles of constitutional government and my resolve to work . " <P> His Majesty at once set to work signing messages of congratulation to British near-centenarians which will be delivered on the 100th birthday of each . His Majesty commanded that his own 41st birthday this week be not celebrated or observed . He commanded that he shall be crowned May 12 , 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been crowned . The 300 Privy Councilors were asked by all their intimates one question : " Does he still stutter ? " No Privy Councilor could be found willing to be quoted as saying that His Majesty does not still stutter. * <P> Neither King George nor Queen Elizabeth has lived a life in which any event could be called of public interest in the United Kingdom press and this last week was exactly as most of their subjects wished . In effect a Calvin Coolidge entered Buckingham Palace with Shirley Temple for his daughter .
