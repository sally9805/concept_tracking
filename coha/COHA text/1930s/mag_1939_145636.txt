In San Francisco 's Museum of Art , 15 paintings went on show last week celebrating the eccentric , Slavic , bucolic conceits of Marc Chagall , a 51-year-old Russian with a flair for flowery dreams . Typical : Inspiration , showing a youth playing a fiddle with one hand while kneeling on the back of a deer . This is no mean stunt , and as a reward a Christmasy angel is presenting him with a bouquet . Behind is calm blue water with a calm blue couple in a rowboat.
