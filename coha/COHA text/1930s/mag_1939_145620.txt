Only a remarkably sturdy constitution could have withstood the series of painful breakdowns which sapped the strength of Pope Pius XI for almost three years . His early love for mountain climbing and his simple manner of living kept him in excellent health until he was well into his seventies . But for the last three years the sick man of Europe has kept devout Catholics , as well as reporters and radio commentators , awake many a night as he spectacularly battled death . <P> In 1936 he was attacked by arteriosclerosis with gangrene of the legs , and lay at the point of death . After his amazing recovery he had to give up his daily constitutional in the Vatican gardens , for leg pains , which often accompany hardening of the arteries , so crippled him that he was able to walk only a few steps at a time . He could not climb stairs , had to be carried from one audience chamber to another . Shrunken and pale , with hollow cheeks , he stuck to his job until last summer when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled him two years before . <P> Cardiac asthma , which has no relation to true or bronchial asthma , sometimes occurs with arteriosclerosis , is characterized by a sudden rise in blood pressure , frantic gasping for breath , and frequent attacks of coughing . He was afflicted with myocarditis ( inflammation of the muscular walls of the heart ) , and by this time his entire circulatory system was breaking down . <P> Even though he was too weak to take his daily drive , the Pope would have little to do with doctors , preferred to have his valet try " home remedies " to ease his pain . He ate only soft , bland foods : boiled chicken , thin vegetable soups , small amounts of rice pudding , occasional sips of red wine or champagne . Last November he had another serious attack of cardiac asthma , often had to get out of bed at night and sit in an armchair to relieve his coughing spells . <P> Last week he came down with influenza , suffered a third serious heart attack . Since his physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Filippo Rocchi was called . Scarcely had he arrived when the Pope became unconscious . His pulse was feeble , his heartbeat almost inaudible . As a stimulant , Dr. Rocchi gave the Pope an injection of camphor oil* and half an hour later he regained consciousness . <P> His frail body , however , could stand no further onslaught , and when he complained of pain in his bladder , his physicians realized that his kidneys were weakened and knew that the end was near . Dr. Milani rose from his own sickbed , administered adrenalin . But it was no use . In a short time the Pope 's heart gave way . <P> The 81-year-old Pontiff would have lived longer , said his physicians , had he not been confined to the Vatican until 1929 when the Lateran Treaty was signed . He remained within the Vatican grounds for seven hot , debilitating summers as a protest against Italian expropriation of papal property . <P> <P> *U . S. physicians do not often use camphor oil as a stimulant , claim that it does little or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
