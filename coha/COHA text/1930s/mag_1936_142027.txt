A year ago last March Congress ordered the Federal Communications Commission to look into American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , largely because it never had been investigated before . An original $750,000 appropriation became $1,150,000 , and FCC investigators began to find out all there was to know about the monopolistic Bell System . One thing they found out was that over a 22-year period A. T. &; T. had earned 10.9% on its long-distance business . Last January A. T. &; T. " voluntarily " reduced rates on night and Sunday long-distance calls , knocked $4,000,000 off the U. S. telephone subscribers ' annual bill . In September a reduction of rates on calls of more than 234 miles resulted in additional savings of $6,000,000 . Last week , just before the FCC hearing was due to resume , the third reduction within a year was announced with savings of another $12,000,000 . FCCommissioner Paul A. Walker said he thought the Congressional appropriation had been a " good investment , " prepared to ask the new Congress for more funds , so that the investigation can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Commission last week with a complaint against virtually the entire U. S. automobile industry for " false and misleading representation . " What the Commission objected to was the so-called " 6% plan " for instalment buying . The Commission named four finance companies-General Motors Acceptance Corp. , Commercial Credit Co. , Universal Credit Corp. , Commercial Investment Trust Corp. - in its complaint . <P> As many a disillusioned automobile buyer has learned by now , the 6% interest rate on instalment purchases has no relation whatever to the actual interest cost . It is simply an advertising slogan . To the unpaid balance on a car is added the cost of insurance , the total being multiplied by .06 to find the premium paid for the privilege of buying on the instalment plan . Since the debt is paid off in regular instalments , the borrower has the use of only about one-half of the original loan if the monthly debit balances are averaged . Thus the true interest cost in the " 6% plan " is approximately 12% . <P> Banned by the Robinson-Patman Antiprice Discrimination Act is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little customer unless the difference can be justified by actual savings on volume business . Everyone agrees that it is cheaper to handle a few large orders than many small ones but in a mixed business it is almost impossible to determine precisely what the saving is . To circumvent this legal and accounting problem U. S. Rubber Co. last week announced a novel method of meeting the Robinson-Patman Act . After the turn of the year a new subsidiary called U. S. Tire Dealers Mutual Co. will purchase tires from the parent company on an equal footing with big buyers like motor-makers and mail-order houses . Mutual will handle all distribution , passing on the profits , if any , to its dealers . Thus while the dealers will still have to pay more for their tires than volume customers , the difference will be exactly equal to the extra cost of selling in small quantities . U. S. Rubber will then look solely to a manufacturing profit .
