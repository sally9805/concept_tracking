Seven inches long , first cousin to the earthworm but with livelier ambitions , Ascaris lumbricoides is one of the commonest parasites found in the intestines of man . The worms , which usually plague children more than adults , enter the body in infected vegetables , may cause diarrhea , colic , convulsions . Standard anthelmintic ( worm-killer ) for ascarids is bitter oil of chenopodium ( wormseed oil ) , usually given in capsule form . Last week in Science , Chemists Julius Berger and Conrado Frederico Asenjo of the University of Wisconsin stood up for a primitive worm-killer which is sweeter , cheaper , and just as powerful : fresh pineapple juice . <P> Pineapple juice has long been swigged by wormy natives of India , but until the Wisconsin scientists put it to laboratory test , its anthelmintic virtues were unknown to modern medicine . The scientists dropped a pair of living ascarids , taken from hogs ' intestines , in a jar of juice freshly squeezed from a Cuban pineapple . Another group of worms was doused in " heat-inactivated " pineapple juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of 24 hours the worms in the heated juice and the salt water were " very lively and active . " But those in the fresh pineapple juice were " completely digested " ( dead ) . Reason : fresh pineapple juice contains an enzyme , or ferment , which acts like a corrosive acid on worms . No worm-killer is canned pineapple juice , said the scientists , for the boiling necessary to preserve the juice destroys the anthelmintic enzyme .
