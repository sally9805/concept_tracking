Growing Up . Christopher Robin Milne no longer goes hippity hoppity , nor looks behind curtains for tickly brownies , nor muses over a name for his dear little dormouse . The hero of When We Were Very Young , now 19 and a crack squash player , leaves Stowe prep school this term , goes next fall to Trinity College , Cambridge , where he is winner of a 100 scholarship in mathematics . <P> Literary Exercise . Pseudo-duels , arty riots ( incited by everything from Dadaism to literary prize awards ) , political squabbles and fishwife furies are traditional components of the French literary life . Dean of French literary stirrer-uppers is scrawny , deaf , 71-year-old Charles Maurras , libeling editor for 41 years of the Royalist-Catholic Action Francaise . Last Maurras scandal occurred a year ago when he was elected to the French Academy ( TIME , June 27 , 1938 ) , following close on the finish of his eight-month prison sentence for urging assassination of Leon Blum . <P> Last month , a few days before he was formally received among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a duel . Challenger was Jean Prouvost , publisher of Paris-Soir , whom Maurras had charged with " flattering the basest instincts of the masses . " Maliciously courteous , Publisher Prouvost offered , in view of Maurras ' extreme age and deafness , to fight any proxy he might name . Academician Maurras declined the challenge , but not because of old age . " So far as my age is concerned , " said he , " M. Prouvost can rest assured that it has left me all my strength . But I shall not employ it to whitewash him . " Thereupon punctilious M. Prouvost drew up a proces - verbal , which declared formally that , inasmuch as M. Maurras had not shown up , the duel was off .
