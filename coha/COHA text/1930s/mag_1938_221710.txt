In the House of Representatives for months a great race has been quietly but breathlessly going on between two committees . The contest is to see who can outstrip whom in helping The Veteran help himself to the U. S. Treasury . The committees : 1 ) Pensions , headed by South Carolina 's Allard Henry Casque ( pronounced Gaski ) , whose own military experience is limited to honorary membership in the United Spanish War Veterans , and 2 ) the Committee on World War Veterans ' Legislation , whose chairman is Mississippi 's loud , bushy-haired John Elliott Rankin . Congressman Rankin lists himself in his official biography as " ex-soldier of the World War " because he spent the 22 days before the Armistice at Camp Zachary Taylor , Kentucky . <P> Messrs . Gasque and Rankin and their committees are men dedicated to any &; every proposal to pay more money to anyone who wore a uniform , even though the bill for veterans ' benefits already tots up to $600,000,000 each year ( about 8% of the budget ) . Franklin Roosevelt pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who led the fight and passed the $2,000,000,000 Bonus over his veto . <P> Until last year law required that a World War veteran be at least 30% disabled for his wife to get a pension when he died . John Elliott Rankin proposed that this disability requirement be lowered to 10% , so more widows would get more money . Franklin Roosevelt reluctantly compromised on 20% rather than face another fight with veteran-conscious Congressmen . <P> But this year Pensioner Gasque began to outpropose Pensioner Rankin . While Mr. Rankin languished with laryngitis , shrewd Mr. Gasque assaulted the Treasury with no less than nine new bills . But last week found Mr. Gasque bedded in Walter Reed Hospital with a reported heart attack and Mr. Rankin 's lieutenant , Congressman Glenn Griswold of Peru , Ind . took his side 's opportunity to steal a march . He whipped the old Rankin 10% Disability Bill onto the floor , under the unusual procedure of suspending the rules . The bill could never have reached the House but for quick conniving by Administration Leaders Bankhead and Rayburn , whose orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rankin Bill ; maybe it will head off Gasque . " With but one loud NO the bill was passed by the House , swallowed by the Administration and sent to the Senate after Congressman Griswold assured his colleagues : " When you get the rate down to 10% the line of demarcation between the service-connected and the non-service-connected cases is very small . " <P> The Gasque Bills which the Administration is determined not to swallow* are two . The first would liberalize the interpretation of disability to include every soldier " unable to do manual labor , " would up non-service-connected pensions from $30 to the $40 they were before the Economy Act of 1933 . Cost estimate : $5,000,000 the first year . The " big " Gasque Bill carries out the announced aims of American Legion Commander Daniel J. Doherty : pensions for all veterans ' widows , regardless of whether their husbands ever fought anything but mosquitoes . Estimated annual cost : 1939-$34,000,000 ; 1940-$68,000,000 ; 1968-$1,300,000,000.                   @ @
