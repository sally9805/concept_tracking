THE HEMLOCK TREE A STORY BY VINCENT SHEEAN O LFE was no specialist in simple pleasures . He went trout fishing just as he rode horses and swam and played tennis , mechanically and from an unacknowledged sense of obligation . His secret impatience with these forms of amusement manifested itself now and then in a little spurt of argument with his friends , a weary little flash of disagreement . But in the general way his was no rebellious spirit ; he was content to accept the routine of supposed enjoyments offered a man if he happens to have been born a Rolfe of Westmoreland County in Virginia and has enough money to fill the part . To go trout fishing in unfamiliar country  --  to stand for hour after hour nearly waist-deep in the swift cold stream awaiting some lapse of intelligence among the wary fish  --  had been a recurrent experience to Rolfe for nearly thirty years . But , as he told himself in frank irritation , even with this overrated pleasure there were limits to a man 's endurance . To fish all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopelessly lost , was Rolfe 's idea of a limit overpassed . " This is the last time , " he vowed to the pine trees and the deeply setting sun , " that I 'll ever try it unless there 's a macadamized road and a comfortable car two inches away . From now on , " he swore to the inattentive ears of his horse , " trout and I are strangers . I'llstay at home and do jigsaw puzzles . " He came over the ridge and looked . down into a narrow hollow . The horse , aware in some obscure equine sensibility that this might be a good place to rest , lifted his head and sniffed . There was a cabin in the hollow , near the top , and there was wood-smoke coming out of a wide stone chimney . " There 's no sense in this , " said Rolfe aloud . " Might wander around all night . Let 's see if we ca n't get some food and a bed and somebody to put us on the road to-morrow morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , for he set out on the downward road with heightened spirit . The road was little more than a path , except that some intrepid flivver wheels had at some time or other struggled over it . It ran steeply down the side of the hollow , twisted through the brook at the bottom , and rose again steeply on the other side to the very door of the providential cabin . As Rolfe passed through the brook he looked up hopefully and was surprised . For the cabin was by no means an ordinary mountain shack , all picturesque filth and neglect . It had been placed with some care for its position : it stood just at the head of the ravine , with a bank of flowered hillside behind it and a great shade tree  --  a tree which surely must have been , at some remote period , planted and cared for  --  at its front door . There was a rosebush there too , growing not far away . Its pink flowers were lavishly blossoming , ready to fall ; they rhymed in color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside behind the house . Beneath the shade tree , soon recognizable as an old hemlock , were a table and two benches of pine logs . The smoke from the chimney , the table under the tree , and especially the glimpse of a barefoot girl vanishing into the house , gave Rolfe assurance that he would at least not go supper-less . His irritation dwindled . " Upon my word , " he told himself , " it 's a little paradise . You would n't think these mountain people had sense enough to build a cabin in such a nice place . Long table , big family . . . . Hello , here 's Pap in person . ' Ware the shotgun . " He urged his horse up the hillside and straight toward the hemlock tree . When he reached it , and the point at which his road apparently ceased to exist , he dismounted and walked to the cabin . The man in the doorway , with a double-barreled shotgun held in the crook of his right elbow , had not moved . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is John Rolfe . I 've been trout-fishing up the mountain there and got lost . I 'm staying at Oak Hill , Major Trumbull 's place down in Henry County , but there 's no way of getting there to-night . Could you let me have supper and a place to sleep and somebody to put me on the right road to-morrow morning ? " The man in the doorway shifted his position slightly , and at the same time shot a surprising quantity of tobacco-juice towards the roots of the rosebush . " You say you been trout-fishin ' ? " he asked , allowing his eyes to pass from Rolfe 's Jean and weary figure to that ofthe horse . " Major Trumbull with you ? " " He was , " said Rolfe . " He was downstream ; I was upstream ; we were to meet at a certain marked poplar tree , and I got lost . Stupid of me . But there 's no use spending the night going round in circles , Could n't you give me supper and a place to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger . Although Rolfe was no authority upon these mountain counties of Virginia , he was at least familiar with their chief industry : this man was unquestionably a moonshiner . And like other moonshiners , he suspected all the rest of the human race of being in league with the malevolent law . " I 'm pretty tired , " said Rolfe with the most illegal smile he could muster . " Trumbull 's a demon trout fisherman ? had me up at three o'clock this morning ; and except for a little rest in the middle of the day , I 've been at it ever since . I come from Richmond , and you know we city folks are n't much good at anything in the hills . " The universal joke about city folk and country folk did not fail of its immemorial effect upon the mountaineer . His lined and anxious face softened with a grin ; his lips even parted a little , so as to reveal spaces formerly occupied by the black thin teeth of mountain people . A loud bellow came from between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowed . " Budl Come hyah and git the stranger 's horse ! " The boy who came out of the cabin at this summons was slim , dark , sullen , perhaps eighteen or nineteen years old , with shoes on his feet . He led off Rolfe 's horse without a word . The man in the doorway put his shotgun down , leaning against the side of the door , and extended what was perhaps meant to be a hospitable hand toward the table and benches under the hemlock tree . " Sit down , " he said , " and rest up a little . We 'll git some supper before long . " And as if the duties of the host had been , by these words and gestures , more than amply fulfilled , he turned and went into the cabin , Rolfe , determined to make no claims upon the doubtful good will of the mountain people , did as he was told and sat down on one of the benches under the hemlock . Presently " Bud " returned to the cabin from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wild honeysuckle . There was an appeal in the look of the boy which Rolfe , to his astonishment , could not help feeling with inexplicable urgency . But the difficulty with all these wild creatures of the mountain was , he had discovered more than once in previous expeditions , to get them to talk . " Budl " he said now , obeying the urgency of the appeal which he did not in the least understand , " tell me  --  ertell me something . Your father  --  at least I suppose it was your father ? ? " " Yeh , " Bud said awkwardly with brown hands dangling , " that 's my daddy . " " Well , " said Rolfe , nearly as ill at ease as the shy animal before him , " he did n't say what your name was . I  --  wondered . " " Hit 's Larkin , " the boy said , looking up suddenly with dark eyes full of terror . " Larkin , our name is . " He turned round and went into the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly shameful admission . Rolfe lighted a pipe and sat over it meditatively for a bit . Mountain people were no novelty to him ; at one time or another in the thirty years of his adult life he had experienced their curious sauvagerie in the high counties of Virginia and elsewhere . Dirt and poverty and extreme isolation , inbreeding and a peculiarly inflexible diet struggled in these people againstthe natural advantages of the mountain life , developing in them a combination of high physical fitness and low intellectual capacity which had perennially fascinated Rolfe by its persistence . You got fewer downright morons and cretins in the backwoods of the Blue Ridge than in , for example , Switzerland ; but the average was lower here than there . It was partly a question of minerals in the water , he supposed . But then , what was unanswerably puzzling was the evidence here offered of the widest possible variation in human development from the same stock . Was not he , John Rolfe of Westmoreland County , a Virginian ? And were not these shy , wild satyrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more , from the same stock ? One part of the original settlers had remained in the opulent lowlands , had owned slaves and prospered , had maintained its relationship to the outside world , to New York , London , and Paris . Another part had climbed the blue hills and perched there . And to-day he , John Rolfe of Westmoreland County , had no more resemblance to these fawnlike imbeciles than a nightingale has to a jaybird . So his thoughts ran , complacent and contemplative and assured , as was right for a gentleman of his age and distinction . He was comfortably aware of his acres , his historic house , his handsome wife and his three beautiful daughters : no vagary of the mountain people could conceivably touch these . And although , sitting under the hemlock tree with his pipe , he could speculate upon the degree of relationship which might exist between him and these Corsicans of the Blue Ridge , in reality he must seem to them very much like a man from Mars . The great war had conscripted thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had returned were no longer quite like their fathers ; but in this heavenly hollow , among these Larkins , it was hard to suppose that war had ever stretched its avid fingers . Among the Larkins . . . The name suddenly acquired weight and significance in his mind , and he almost dropped his pipe in surprise . The Larkins ! Why , this must be the very family  --  it would be in this very part of the hills of Floyd County that the Larkins dwelt in their sinister celebrity . Of course ! No Virginian needed to be told who the Larkins were : they were as famous in their way as the great families of the lowlands , the Randolphs and Cabelis and Byrds to whom Rolfe traced his own relationship . Only that day Major Trumbull had been telling some long tale about one of the Larkin feuds , in which seven murders had been expiated at last , after an orgy of perjured testimony and intimidation , by a riotous hanging . The Larkin Trial  --  that was it : the Larkins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought to trial by due process of law at Christiansburg , until the sleepy little mountain capital had been invaded by the whole population of the blue hills round about , and martial law was proclaimed , and the militia brought in .. . Rolfe got up uneasily to knock his pipe out against the hemlock tree . He was not a timorous man , but it did not make him happy to reflect that his host for the night was a resolute and acknowledged murderer . Even though these people used murder purely in the service of the higher virtues  --  justice , or loyalty , or independence  --  the thought did not cause Rolfe any particular pleasure . He thought of his host 's double-barreled shotgun , poised so suKestively in the crook of his right elbow , and wondered how often the weapon had done service in the lingering disagreements of this romantic glen . The sun had altogether gone by now , and in the red glow of its departure even the wild honeysuckle on the hillside took on a savage and sinister look . Rolfe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at it stupidly . If he had known a little earlier .. . But it was too late . His own muddleheadedness had got him into this ; and now there was nothing to be done but stay the night . He was in no conceivable danger , and the sensible thing to do was to forget , if possible , that he had ever heard the name of Larkin in his life . A slight noise behind him made him turn jerkily . It was only the girl  --  a Larkin , of course  --  the same barefoot girl whose heels he had seen vanishing into the cabin as he came up the glen . She was beside him now , putting out plates and dishes on the pine table under the hemlock tree . She did not even look up at him after the first frightened glance , but performed her duties hurriedly and then ran into the cabin again . She might have been fourteen or fifteen , perhaps a little more ; a stringy , dark-eyed little creature in a clean print dress . Her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and smooth as paint . She would have looked coarse and gipsyish in town clothes . In the rudimentary garments of the hill people she was as natural as the wild honeysuckle and had something of the same growing grace . Rolfe tried smiling at her when she came out again . " I hope I 'm not making you a lot of extra trouble , " he said . She mumbled a phrase or two which defeated him altogether ; he was never an adept at understanding the speech of the mountain folk , and her accent was thickened by shyness and alarm . " How many are there in your famil ? " he asked , determined to extract a word he might recognize . " Five , " she said , leaning suddenly on the table and looking up at him . " Five is all ' t is . Four 's daid . " To this unexpected statement she added not a word but vanished into the cabin again . Rolfe had seen the strongest resemblance between her Iook  --  an urgent appeal , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But an appeal for what ? The thing was grotesque . Were they all out of their minds , he wondered . Or did they think he had something which might relieve their mysterious necessities ? He gave it up and wondered how long it would be before supper appeared . He had not long to wait . An oldish young man who looked like Bud  --  another Larkin , no doubt  --  came up the glen and lounged into the cabin . The toothless one , old Larkin , cause out toward the hemlock tree , followed by the young man and Bud and the girl . The girl carried a brown jug which she placed on the table . Old Larkin took it and handed it to Rolfe with a glass . " Drink , stranger ? " he inquired . " It ai n't the same kind of liquor y'all drink down in Richmond , but I reckon you 've tasted it before now . " His conversational powers seemed exhausted by this lengthy speech ; he fell back into silence . Rolfe poured himself a drink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cough . The stuff was raw corn whiskey , fiery and irascible in the throat . Jug and glass passed from hand to hand until every person at the table had had a drink . The girl , who was Iast , put sugar and a little water into hers . They all sat down at the pine table and the food , at last , arrived . It was brought out by the girl and her mother , whose acquaintance Rolfe thus made for the first time . She was a dry , hard , silent woman , as thin andinexplicable as the rest of them , incredibly wrinkled . She did not speak to Rolfe or look at him until they had all begun to eat . Then he occasionally caught her eyes upon him ; the same burning look was there , the look of urgency and appeal . He had seldom been so uncomfortable in the entire course of his experience ; what on earth , he asked himself impatiently , could he do for or with such people ? Supper consisted of the favored greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corn bread , hominy , green onions , and a cold smoked ham , from which old Larkin cut great slabs as needed . The food was plentiful , coarse , and very good ; Rolfe discovered in himself an enormous appetite , and consequently the total absence of conversation did not embarrass him . From time to time old Larkin or the woman or the girl would push more food at him , urging him with word or gesture to eat more . But aside from this there was no talk at all . The oldish young man , addressed as Steve , was the most silent of the whole silent family . Rolfe found time to wonder what was going on in Steve 's long wooden head , but there was no clue afforded . Occasionally the expressive dark eyes of the family  --  such eyes as Rolfe had seldom seen before  --  hinted at conflicts of a desperate and impossible urgency : there was sullen terror , the plainest sullen terror , somewhere in the relationships between them . Rolfe , made a little nervous by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine what might be behind those glances , but when he failed to do so he admonished himself severely . " This is all imagination , " he told himself . " These people are like all the rest of the backwoods mountaineers , shy and distrustful of strangers . They do n't talk , even among themselves . Why should they talk to me ? Forget it , Rolfe , forget it . You 'll be down in the valley to-morrow morn-ing . " When the meal was ended Mrs. Larkin and the girl carried the dishes away and did not come out again . Old Larkin and his son Steve lighted corncob pipes . The boy , Bud , sat there looking at the crumbs of cornbread on the pine table . Old Larkin made an attempt to speak about the weather . Rolfe , seizing the opportunity , talked with enthusiasm for about five minutes . When he had finished and looked round for encouragement , the same stifling silence had descended again . He gave up , filled his pipe , and leaned back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jug went the rounds twice ; old Larkin took what Rolfe would have considered a tremendous swig out of it . The older brother , Steve , in the half-darkness which had now gathered could be seen to fix his eyes on the younger brother , Bud . Rolfe had noticed that glance before : a melancholy , puzzled look , containing something deeper and more incurably mournful than mere trouble or dismay . No such glances between the Larkins were ever returned : their eyes seldom met ; whatever was at odds between them could not be communicated . The whole thing filled Rolfe with an overwhelming desire to go to bed and sleep . In the morning , he told himself , the behavior of the Larkins would seem altogether different . It was quite dark now , and the new moon would he rising before long . Old Larkin got up and knocked his pipe out . " Come on , Steve , " he said , moving toward the cabin . " Bud  --  upsta'rs , and stay thart " Larkin and Steve went into the cabin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the door for a moment , watching them turndown the hollow to the brook . It was too dark for Rolfe to see any of their faces , but he imagined that the bay was going to speak to him . He half rose , but nothing happened ; the boy slipped silently into the cabin , and the two eider Larkins disappeared into the hollow . " Fine madhouse l 've landed in , " Rolfe said to himself . " A nest of homicidal maniacs or half-wits . Why the devil do n't they give me a place to sleep and let me forget ' em ? And where am I to sleep , anyway ? Damn , damn , damn . If I ever go trout-fishing again .. . " A long time passed , nearly an hour . The only sounds Rolfe identified in the darkened hollow were the leafy whisper of the pine trees and the splash of a spring over rocks . A lamp was lighted inside the cabin and made a square of dim light in the door . Rolfe , leaning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened by the sound of weeping from inside the cabin . It was not loud weeping , nothing but the quiet , hopeless snuffle of an animal in a corner . He was wide awake in a moment . There were three people in the cabin , the old woman , the girl and the boy . Which one of them could be weeping , and why ? He got up and moved uncertainly toward the house . He could not stand much more of this , he told himself ; he would go inside and ask Mrs. Larkin for a place to sleep , and then the crazy lot of them could weep and wander all night long without disturbing him . But before he reached the cabin the girl  --  Nancy , they had called her  --  slipped out and stood before him . It was still dark in the hollow , although the sky was growing lighter over the ridges on both sides . He could barely see the girl and her shining eyes turned up to him . " Give my brother your horse , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything to you . You can say he stole it . " He stared down at her , tried to make out her features in the darkness . " What on earth are you talking about ? " he asked in an ordinary tone of voice . " Shl " she said . " Do n't talk out loud . " She moved into the full shadow of the hemlock tree and he , now definitely convinced that they were all insane , followed her . " Why should I give your brother my horse ? " he asked in an undertone . " Hit 's Bud , " she said . Her whisper , barely audible to him now , sounded desperate : she was having trouble to breathe . " My Daddy and Steve and all of them , the Larkins and Drapers , are over yonder , other side of the branch . Trying him . They say  --  they say he  --  he 's the one that told about the stills and got the money . If he had your horse he could get away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud wants to run away ; is that it ? " " No , " the girl said , gasping now . " I do n't know if he will . I reckon he might if I told him he could take your horse . He 's got to . He 's got to do it . " Rolfe was silent , trying to understand . Her thin hand reached out toward his sleeve . " Hit 's four Larkins been killed , " she said , bringing her face as close as she could up to his . Her eyes looked enormous and shiny . " Four brothers . And hit 's five Drapers been killed . Nine in all . Seven shot , and two killed by the law . And now they say ' t war n't no other Larkins nor Drapers that did it ever , only Bud . And spent the money on girls and movies and liquor in Christiansburg . He 's got to go now . He 's got to go quick . " " I see , " said Rolfe slowly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don'tgive me much choice , do you ? .. . Well , I do n't know . You sound scared . He can take my horse . " " Gawdamercy , " the girl said violently . He could tell that she was weeping now ; her hand on his sleeve was shaking . " You 'll git the horse back , " she said . " And nobody 'll do nothin ' to you . Well say he stole it . I reckon they 'll believe that all right . " She vanished into the cabin again . Rolfe returned to his place beneath the hemlock tree and sat there again for a long time , motionless . But this time he was in no danger of falling asleep . The situation did not appeal to him in the least . If it was true that the boy was an informer  --  had actually , if he understood the story at all , brought on the whole long war between the Larkins and the Drapers  --  it was impossible to refuse the girl 's request . But what to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He did not relish the prospect of facing old Larkin and Steve in the morning . He wished he had told the girl that her brother ought to stay at home and take his punishment . After all , whatever his father and brother might possibly do to Bud would be nothing in comparison to what they might do to a total stranger who had interfered in their domestic arrangements . A little rough treatment was no more than the boy deserved if his sister 's incoherent story had any sense at all . But it had been , in spite of that , flatly impossible to refuse her ; all the feeling of anxious entreaty which had bothered Rolfe through the evening , as he imagined it in the eyes of the old woman , the girl and the boy himself , had been concentrated into her few whispered sentences . In the leafy stillness of the glen , with the new moon rising coolly over the hills , things suffered a fantastic enlargement and distortion . In the daytime Rolfe would simply have laughed at the girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he obeyed almost without question , and sat there waiting to see his horse  --  his only means of transport into the sanity of the valley  --  led off into the dark by a frightened mountain boy . But the boy did not come . The minutes ran on interminably and nothing happened . There were the faintest sounds of talk from inside the cabin , perhaps from the upper room which Rolfe guessed must exist above the kitchen . But no figure appeared in the dimly lighted doorway ; the snuffling in the kitchen which must come , he decided , from Mrs. Larkin , resumed after a while , and the moon rose high . By now it was possible to see the whole exquisite contour of the glen , its dark shimmering chalice turned up to the light of the moon . Up from the depths somewhere there appeared , at long last , the figures of old Larkin and his son Steve , walking slowly towards the cabin . They approached it without haste , almost unwillingly . Rolfe thought the face of the son looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unwanted guest beneath the hemlock tree . Old Larkin entered the cabin and bawled Bud 's name twice . There was a silence ; then the clatter of shoes on wood , and the boy appeared in the doorway . He looked questioningly at his brother , and all three of them turned down again into the hollow . The only words Rolfe heard were old Larkin 's . " Come on , Bud , " he had said . The thing had by now decidedly unnerved Rolfe . He began to walk hack and forth in the moonlight in front of the cabin , smoking his pipe jerkily . What were these madmen doing , or about to do ? What could he do , or should he do ? What evil chance had thrust hart into theiraffairs anyway ? And above all , where was he going to sleep , to forget them ? The girl stepped out of the door and stood beside him . " Do n't say nothin ' , " she whispered to him . " Do n't tell my Daddy or Steve what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothin ' to them at all . " " I thought your brother was going to take my horse , " Rolfe said irritably . " What 's the matter with you people anyway ? Where have they all gone ? " " I do n't know , " she said vaguely , her young eyes fixed on him . " They 've . . . gone . . . Bud would n't take your horse . He would n't go away . He ' lowed he 'd better stay . You wo n't say nothin ' to my Daddy and Steve ? " " No , " said Rolfe shortly . " I wo n't . Where am I supposed to sleep anyway ? I 've had a long day and I 'm tired . " " I do n't know , " said the girl , expelling her breath in a sigh that was half a moan . " I reckon you 'll be sleepin ' upsta'rs . You wait until my Daddy comes back . And do n't say nothin ' . " She stood there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shinily round her face : she had a kind of archaic and nymphlike beauty for a few seconds in the still moonlight . Then she was gone again , a terrified little mountain girl with hare feet , and Rolfe resumed his restless walking to and fro . For a while he considered the advisability of taking the course Bud had refused : of looking for his own horse  --  odd how it seemed like stealing his own horse  --  and escaping from this accursed hollow over the farther hills . The place itself filled him with unreasoning apprehension . He smoked pipe after angry pipe , and was wider awake than ever . The monotonous whippoorwill down in the glen , the screech owl in the pines , the clamorous tree-frogs near and far , seemed to him to have acquired deafening power . What had been a singularly silent evening now shrieked along his nerves with all the night noises of woods and mountain . Pretty soon , if he did not get to sleep , the mocking bird would wake to its indefatigable complaint , and a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of the cabin a wandering breeze brought him a whiff of the odor of wild honeysuckle , and it affected him like ether . " Calm , Rolfe , calm , " he admonished himself . " You 're being a fool . There 's nothing at all the matter , nothing at all . " He came back to the front of the cabin , and just as he reached it a sound  --  two sounds  --  echoed mournfully from the far hillsides . He stiffened in horror , stared into the calm moonlit blackness of the glen . " What 's that ? " he said aloud . His voice sounded half-strangled . " What 's that ? " The voice of the girl came almost from beneath his feet . She was crouched in the doorway in the dark ; the lamp inside had gone out . " ' T war n't nothin ' , " she said . " ' T war n't nothing at all . They 've chopped down a tree , maybe . They work  --  they work at night , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choking noise , like a sob . " A tree ? " Rolfe echoed . " Sounded to me like a shot  --  two shots . Now see here . I want to know what 's going on . Do you know what that sound was ? " " They work at night , " she said painfully , speaking aloud for the first time since supper . " Yonder . Hit 's  --  hit 's a still yonder . They chop trees . ' T war n't no shot you heard . My Daddy 'll be back soon . " She got up slowly , like a little old woman , and went inside the house . Rolfe heard her murmuring inside somewhere , and then all was quietagain . He returned to his place beneath the hemlock tree and stared fixedly into the moonlit obscurities of the hollow . He did not know what he had heard , or what he would say to the wandering Larkins when they returned . If he could find a bed and sleep , no doubt it would all seem very different in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to keep hold of himself , to keep from venturing off with or without his horse into the hills , away from these terrors and these mysteries . In another half hour old Larkin and Steve came up the road through the hollow and walked past the hemlock tree to the cabin door . The old man looked bent and tired , the younger scarcely able to carry his gun . Neither paid any attention to Rolfe . He moved out of the shadow of the hemlock tree and spoke . " Where am I ? " He was going to ask them where he was to sleep , but they both turned on him at once , their guns ready . When the old man recognized him he made a weary gesture with one hand . " Come in , stranger , " he said . " I reckon we nigh forgot about you . Come in . " Rolfe preceded them into the cabin , which he now entered for the first time in all these hours . The room was square , large and gloomy , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone chimney at one end . The old man turned up a Iamp by the door , and Rolfe saw a table , two or three pine chairs , some guns , a rifle and a mandolin hanging upon the wall , a double bed in a corner . " Suet " the old man bellowed . " Whar that jug ? " The old woman , who had been half asleep in the chimney corner , awoke and reached for the brown jug . Larkin took it , drank deep , and passed it to Steve . Rolfe was about to ask something  --  anything  --  to put an end to his uncertainty , when the figure of the girl became apparent to him in the chimney corner . Her eyes , glittering in the lamplight , were fixed on his . They were imploring . " Do n't say nothin ' , " he seemed to hear . He turned toward Larkin and tried to speak quietly . " I was wondering where I was supposed to sleep , " he said . The old man wiped his toothless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta'rs , I reckon , " he said . " With Steve . You take Bud 's place . He ai n't comin ' home to-night . " The old man 's dark eyes were a warning and a defiance . Rolfe did not accept their challenge . He turned toward the staircase indicated to him ? a thin , ladderlike structure , leading straight up in a corner of the room to a square hole in the ceiling . Steve shambled over towards this now and began to climb . Rolfe followed him .
