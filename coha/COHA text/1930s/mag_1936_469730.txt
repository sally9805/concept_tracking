A RESIDENT of Park Avenue in New York City was sentenced not long ago to a term of imprisonment for threatening violence to the person of President Roosevelt . This episode , with the conclusions as to the man 's probable sanity , was recorded at length on the front pages of the newspapers of the land . In itself it was unimportant . Cranks with wild ideas are always to be found here and there in any large community . Yet it was significant as a dramatically extreme manifestation of one of the most extraordinary phenomena of our day , a phenomenon which social historians in the future will very likely record with perplexity if not with astonishment : the fanatical hatred of the President which to-day obsesses thousands of men and women among the American upper class . No other word than hatred will do . It is a passion , a fury , that is wholly unreasoning . Here is no mere political opposition , no mere violent disagreement over financial policies , no mere distrust of a national leader who to these men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distrust , however strong , are quite legitimate and defensible , whether or not one agrees that they are warranted . But the phenomenon to which I refer goes far beyond objection to policies or programs . It is a consuming personal hatred of President Roosevelt and , to an almost equal degree , of Mrs. Roosevelt . It permeates , in greater or less degree , the whole upper stratum of American society . It has become with many persons an icIt'e fixe . One encounters it over and over again in clubs , even in purely social clubs , in locker and card rooms . At luncheon parties , over dinner tables , it is an incessant theme . And frequently in conversation it takes a violent and unlawful form , the expression of desires and wishes that can be explained only , it would seem , in terms of abnormal psychology . In history this hatred may well go down as the major irony of our time . For the extraordinary fact is that whereas the fanatic who went to prison had lost his fortune and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who rail against the President have to a large extent had their incomes restored and their bank balances replenished since the low point of March , 1933 . That is what makes the phenomenon so incredible . It is difficult to find a rational cause for this hatred . I do not mean , of course , that it is difficult to find a rational cause for criticism , even passionately strong criticism , of the New Deal . One may quite reasonably be convinced that its policies are unsound , that its leaders arc hypocritical , that its total influence is pernicious . But the venom to which I refer is of a sort seldom found among men and women who have not been personally hurt , and badly hurt , by those whom they excoriate . Some members of this class have undoubted grounds for feeling personally hurt . Some , for example , have found themselves with income still depleted , and have warrant for attributing the still sorry state of their investments to various measures sponsored by the Administration . Yet others have prospered exceedingly since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their present circumstances much improved . As the New Dealers themselves have been at pains to point out , taxes on the rich have not been materially increased . Secretary Ickes , speaking before the Union League Club in Chicago recently , developed this at length , showing that a man with a net income annually of $50 , - 000 would pay no more to the Federal government in taxes this year than he paid last year ; with $60,000 annually he would pay $90 additional ; with $80,000 he would pay $775 more , and on an income of $1,000,000 , an added $1,875 . And although a new tax program is being drafted as this is written , probably no small proportion of the burden will be placed upon the mass of consumers through processing or excise taxes . Surely the explanation does not lie in the trifling changes made thus far . Nor would the fear of inflation seem to account for it . In the first place , the rise in prices from 1933 to date has , by and large , helped these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance in the stock market , which has doubled , tripled , or quadrupled the prices of stocks ? and indeed has multiplied some of them by ten . In the second place , there is no denying that , conversely , the deflation of 1929-1933 did great damage to the fortunes of the rich . In the third place , fears of the future possibilities of the credit-inflation policy of the Administration , whether justified or not , are at any rate not fears of immediate or definitely predictable trouble . Finally ? and still more important ? the rich are seldom the victims of inflation . It is well known that most of the very wealthy profited from the German inflation . Long before the storm breaks large investments have been safeguarded by diversification in real property or in stocks adapted by their nature to adjust to swiftly changing price levels . Manywealthy persons have already begun to shift their holdings to such things as farm land . That there is a widespread conviction among the wealthy that they are being butchered to make a Roman holiday for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a class the wealthy have suffered relatively less than any other from the economic events of the past three years ; and in that single word relatively there is a world of meaning . As for their feeling that butchery has at least been intended by the Roosevelt Administration , let us glance for a moment at some opinions from the other side of the fence . A great many liberals , and certainly all radicals , complain that President Roosevelt 's chief mission has been to save the fortunes of the very rich . Economists for the American Federation of Labor estimated in the annual report for 1935 that in the course of that year corporate profits ? dividends and so forth ? had increased forty per cent , while real wages had increased slightly less than two per cent . What is more , the wage increase had been in part offset by a corresponding increase in the work-week of an hour and a half . Surveying the present state of the nation ? stock-market boom , crowded Florida resorts , thronged night clubs , the revival of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich to be part of a subtle plot to return Mr. Roosevelt to office . For surely such uncritical vituperation , such blind hostility , must contribute to that end . Is that it then ? To throw the workers and the farmers off their guard , the American rich are simulating this rage against the man who ? if one listens to the other side ? has been their savior ? But such choler could not be simulated . Anyone who has seen it now and then at close range must be aware that it is too authentic for that . While this phenomenon has gone virtually unrecorded , it is familiar to most middle-class people to-day . Indeed , it has had its influence upon the middle class . There are those who have been only too eager to pick up crumbs of emotion dropped from the rich man 's table . In general , however , the violence of the hatred varies directly with the affluence of the social group . The larger the house , the more numerous the servants , the more resplendent the linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indictment of the President . II It may be useful to record certain recent examples of the present temper of the two per cent , if only because the rapid shifting of events may ' leave slight evidence of it for the notebook of the social historian . In the following scenes I have altered names and circumstances just enough to prevent identification ; but the episodes are not only in essence true , they are being duplicated daily wherever the very fortunate congregate . The fortune of the Skeane family is in the manufacture of textile-weaving machines , a closely owned enterprise built upon the inventiveness of old Jeremiah Skeane . Jeremiah 's widow ( it was a late marriage for Jeremiah to his attractive young secretary ) is , needless to say , very wealthy . The return on the family business dwindled in 1933 to less than two per cent and there was a panicky feeling among all the Skeanes ; result , " economy " ? the dismissal of gardeners , chauffeurs , the second girl upstairs . To-day the return on the family business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Oaks , where the widow lives two or three months a year , is at Elkins Park , a suburb of Philadelphia . She is leaving , in the middle of February when slush and snow make Philadelphia so dreary , for Florida in a private car with two of her grandchildren and their governess . Mrs. Skeane is giving a luncheon for eighteen , in farewell . The furs which the guests have left upstairs would make for any department store a costly , well-bred display . Thedining room , the table , everything about the establishment has the impeccability , the perfection , that is achieved only on fifty thousand dollars ( or more ) a year . From the long windows at one side you look out on a well-tailored landscape and beyond , far enough beyond , the roofs of another English country house . At the outset of the luncheon Mrs. Skeane has her butler pass on a silver tray copies of a radio talk given by Mr. Cameron of the Ford Motor Company . Mr. Cameron told his audience that wealth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own their homes , that the equity in industry is largely dispersed through ownership of common stock . There is an appreciative glow about the table over this gift . But Mrs. Skeane says , deprecatingly , " I just wanted to start you thinking ; it seemed to me so fine that I sent for as many copies as I could get . It answers so many things , you know . " The Cameron pamphlet serves at least to start the conversation going in a familiar channel . Al Smith 's Liberty League speech was to these women an event of the most vital importance . They speak of him now , nearly a month after the address , as one would speak of a folk hero , with a mixture of reverence and warm familiarity . And this , incidentally , is true of the whole group ; the Smith speech was treasured as though it had been wisdom handed down from on high on tablets of stone . Al 's wisecracks are quoted verbatim and in extenso as final proof of the case against the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a fine President for us ? " says Mrs. Skeane ardently . The table takes up this suggestion with enthusiasm until suddenly someone remembers Mrs. Smith and the things that these same people said of her in the presidential campaign of 1928 . For a moment this is a little dampening . " Oh , but do n't you see , " says Mrs. Robley , " Mrs. Smith knows that she does n't know anything . She would employ an efficient social secretary and things would be decently run in the White House again . She would n't be like that terrible woman who thinks she knows everything about running the whole country . " Thus the 1928 specter of Mrs. Smith in the White House is exorcised . Thereupon Mrs. Derouen offers her contribution . Her husband was in New York at a business conference yesterday with Mr. Blank ( naming one of the high officials of the Hoover Administration ) . And Mr. Blank told Mr. Derouen what the Republicans proposed to do when they came into office . They would stop all this nonsense about relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarge the police force . Then if there was any trouble , let it come . Mrs. Derouen reports this very solemnly , and it is accepted as bearing the authority of the inner sanctum , as having come from the holy of holies . Having discussed the issues of the day in relation to the high principles involved , Mrs. Skeane and her guests are free to come out with the real lowdown . That has to do with the personal conduct of the Roosevelt family . It is bad , very bad . There is , in fact , nothing good to be said for it . It runs a horrid gamut between divorce and dissipation . And these women air their familiarity with the shocking and manifold details . Creole broth , delicate sole , individual squab , and so on , are the dishes passed one after the other . Canards and rumored scandal are the intellectual fare . Faultlessly the luncheon proceeds to coffee and cigarettes and to farewells to Mrs. Skeane . Mrs. Skeane is exceptional only in her ardor ? her patriotism , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations , including the American Liberty League , that are concerned with saving the Constitution . She has small red , white , and blue stickers , with the words " Save the Constitution , " with which she seals her letters . Each of the five cars in her garage bears a plate above the license plate : " Save the Constitution . " Among the young in Mrs. Skeane 's circle the hatred of Roosevelt takes a particularly brash and violent form . There is the post-debutante whose complete disapproval of the whole Roosevelt family is expressed in terms of the utmost contempt and scorn , as one would speak of a degraded order of beings . The diatribe she offers for the obvious approval of her elders concludes with what is apparently in her eyes the most damning sin of all : the President is a traitor to his class . And what has he ever done , she demands ( forgetting that she herself is safely established in the bosom of a family that has had money for at least three generations ) , but live off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may explain something of the rancor that the mere mention of the Roosevelt name is certain to evoke . It may well have its origin in a primitive source . It would seem that we can forgive , or at least understand , an act of hostility from our enemy , but not from one of our own kind . Certainly if there is an aristocracy in the United States , the Roosevelts are of it . They have owned landed estates in the neighborhood of Skaneateles and Poughkeepsie since early in the seventeenth century . They have always had sufficient money to enable them to lead cultivated , pleasant lives . And so there is no forgiveness for their seeming disloyalty . Mr. Roosevelt , say the members of his class , has insinuated himself into a position of supreme authority and now proceeds to snipe at his friends . To attempt to make a reasonable answer , to point out a few stray facts , even to inquire whether the President of the United States should govern on behalf of a class , is soon seen to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless they happen by chance to serve the purpose , have very little to do with the emotion in question . III Let me turn to another characteristic scene . This one is in Florida . James Hamilton is the head of a firm of commodity brokers in Chicago . During the Roosevelt Administration the Hamilton firm has made a handsome profit handling various products for the Commodities Credit Corporation . And in other indirect ways Hamilton has profited from the great increase in governmental activity . He owns a considerable block of stock , inherited from his grandfather , in a flour milling company , and into the treasury of this closely owned firm the Supreme Court dumped a sum in impounded processing taxes greater than the net profits for 1928 and 1929 . But even the warm sun of Florida can not moderate one degree James Hamilton 's grim antipathy to the President and his every word and deed . At Miami Beach he sits on the porch of the cabana he has leased at one of the best beach clubs and vituperates . The President has deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the profit of Brazil . One may talk in vain about the decline in soil fertility in the cotton States , about the world movement toward national self-sufficiency , about trends and tendencies existing long before Mr. Roosevelt came into office . It is breath wasted . The President , says James Hamilton , is ruining the farmers of the middlewest by permitting the importation of corn . He will not hear you if you point out the exact number of bushels of corn that have been imported , a negligible number , or the fact that it is in considerable part corn unsuited for feeding to cattle , not to mention the graph that shows clearly how the farmers ' purchasing power has mounted . With James Hamilton is his son , James Hamilton III , also a partner in the firm . The younger Hamilton specializes in Roosevelt horror stories . He repeats with a knowing air , as having come from the inner councils , all the preposterous canards that have passed through the country by word of month during the past year . Many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A number of versions of this story havebecome familiar . The commonest one has to do with the strange laughter with which the President greets his visitors , a laughter that ? if one were to believe the story ? continues foolishly and irrelevantly during most of the interview . But James Hamilton III can improve upon these stories . He had it from a man who had dinner in the White House last week that ... James Hamilton HI becomes unprintable . He reveals with a kind of painstaking delight the horrible details of the intimate life of the first family of the land . And when this phase of the career of the Roosevelts has been exhausted , he will describe radical plots to undermine the Constitution , the church , and the state in all of which President Roosevelt has had a part . This is not idle talk . It is for James Hamilton III the gospel , and only slightly less so for his father , who occasionally puts in a word of moderation by way of restraining young hotheads . The elder Hamilton would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the President is insane now , but he might have been in 1933 when he seized power . For authority for the radical plots in which Mr. Roosevelt has had a hand , James Hamilton III will quote from a Hearst editorial article , from a speech by Governor Talmadge , or from any one of a half dozen weekly papers and pamphlet services that are feeding the fiercer anti-Roosevelt fires . The social historian would do well to make a collection of these obscure papers and pamphlets , for they will one day be invaluable source material . Perhaps the noisiest of these sheets , and therefore the one that is most frequently passed about , is The Awakener , which is " For The Americanization Of The Right " and " Against The Socialism Of The Left . " Its tone is not unlike that of the Communist New Masses prior to the shift in Communist policy toward co-operation with other social and economic groups , the united front . The Awakener goes in for headlines such as " Mrs. Roosevelt Approves Communist Youth Group . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt is a Communist . And having done this to his complete satisfaction , the columnist for The Awakener adds the following : " Embarrassing item number two came to light during an investigation into the death of Joseph Shoemaker at Tampa , Florida , some weeks ago . Shoemaker , an avowed radical , and a group of friends , all members of the Workers Alliance , a Socialist organization , were busily engaged in two collateral endeavors . On the one hand they were organizing in the political field as ' Modern Democrats ' while at the same time carrying on subversive agitation among the unemployed . A group of patriotic citizens resented their trouble-making activities and one night , unfortunately , they were set upon by vigilantes and flogged . Subsequently Shoemaker developed blood poisoning and died . At the time not even the most rabid anti-New Dealer offered to suggest that these ' reds , ' in organizing the ' Mod- , ern Democrats , ' had Franklin D. Roosevelt as an inspiration . A tell-tale letter , however , dated April 28 , 1932 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects , brands the President as being in thorough accord with basic Socialistic principles . . . . " This is enough to indicate the nature of The Awakener . And while it decants a stronger wine than the others , they all have a family resemblance . There has been a small boom in the business of issuing anti-Roosevelt publications . Although some are run for profit , others have financial backers proud to pay not only the printing bill but the cost of distribution too . " Confidential " news services that go out of Washington into Wall Street have recognized the value of the hate-Roosevelt theme . We change the scene again ? to New York . Joshua and Ellen Thornberry are giving a large cocktail party in their apartment in the east ' Sixties . The three floors of the Thornberry apartment are filled with things , things , things , a superfluity of things ? a collection of jade , a collection of Persian enamels , enough Georgian silver to furnish a museum . The Thornberrys are about to leave for South Carolina for some shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette smoke , expensive scent , and servants passing champagne cocktails . In one corner Joshua is telling three or four of his friends of a deal he had in the stock market last week that netted a neat profit . He is relating the story only to illustrate the awful kind of government we live under , with " that man " in Washington . " Why , just think of it , " says Joshua , " I shall have to give sixty per cent of my profit to the government . Just think of that ! That 's the kind of system we live under . " IV I recall my own encounter , last fall , with the owner-manager of a handsome inn in New England . Fie had invested in the property in 1930 and had weathered three very lean years ; 1934 was better , 1935 very good . But this man 's snarling vindictiveness was turned on for the benefit of all his guests . It went , unfortunately , with one 's view of the distant autumnal hills . And what gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its scope to take in not only the Roosevelt family but certain members of his government , the supply of personal slime being sufficient to smear a few members of the cabinet , just in passing . Ordinarily the almost complete concentration of the attack upon the President himself is remarkable . If reference is made to other members of the Administration it usually serves only as another stick with which to beat the dog . He is damned , on the one hand , for the " radicalism " of Messrs . Tugwell , Wallace , and Ickes , in the order named , and , on the other , for the political machinations of Messrs . Farley , Cummings , and Roper . It is taken for granted by those who hate the President that the men about him are mere puppets who do his bidding . It is a disconcerting fact that when one is solemnly told across a well-appointed dinner-table that " everybody in Washington knows that the whole Roosevelt family is drunk most of the time , " or that " of course it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so all over the place is that she 's planning to succeed her husband in the Presidency until it 's time for the sons to take over , " or that Roosevelt is out of his mind , or that other less printable things are matters of " common knowledge , " the fantastic misinformation is as likely as not to come from someone whose educational advantages might be supposed to have included some training in the sifting of evidence and the suspension of judgment , and who professes a scorn for the gullibility of the common herd . The hate-Roosevelt school of thought has no geographical limitations . Its restrictions are , in general , economic . ( There are exceptions , of course , among the two per cent ; there are many men and women whose opposition to the Administration is devoid of any taint of personal vindictiveness , and one may even ? by combing the woods ? find here and there a lonely defender of the President . ) If a statistician were making one of those shaded maps on which geographical distribution is graphically indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored with the deepest dye . ( Black the color would doubtless be . ) Chicago 's wealthy suburbs might be a shade lighter , but the difference would scarcely be perceptible to the untutored eye . New England 's blackness would be broken only by a few gray patches , shading off to a faint oyster color in the neighborhood of regions especially blessed by the New Deal . Prosperous Washington would be a notable exception , among cities on the Eastern seaboard , and not alone because it is the seat of government . A goodly number of the wealthy men in Washington are corporation lawyers who hold that what has happened during the past three years does not differ essentially from what has gone on in Washington under previous Administrations . It makes a different noise but the grist is ground in the same old way in the same old mill . It isfor this reason that those who go out from Washington into other parts of the country now and then are startled by the fearful anathemas breathed upon the name of Roosevelt . To a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the loud cursing of the gentlemen in the upper brackets appears to have little relation to anything the present occupant of the White House has thus far done . Attempting to trace the rise of the current hate one falls into useless conjecture . If one might have a graph such as only an omniscient statistician could produce , showing the development of this animosity year by year , it would be interesting to superimpose upon it a graph representing the rise that has occurred since 1933 in every index of price and production . My guess is that there would be a fairly close correspondence . To be sure the animosity was a little slow in developing . In the spring and summer of 1933 , when prices were rising fast from the panic levels of the banking crisis , there was among the rich a great deal of resentment at the tendency in Washington to blame the bankers for all that had happened , there was uneasiness over the wholesale legislation introduced by the Administration , and over the President 's inflationary tendencies , but there was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter part of 1933 , however , it has increased in volume and in unanimity ? and never faster , apparently , than during the sustained advance of the stock market and the less uniform but , nevertheless , hopeful advance of business during 1935 . This phenomenon might be perplexing to the future historian . The usual evidence of history is that men and women whose fortunes are rising do not turn against the government in power . Yet apparently every ten-point rise in common stocks within the past year or two has but added to the confidence with which its major beneficiaries have conducted their attack , has but added to their anger at having to pay high taxes on their winTHEY HATE nings . Here are some pertinent questions for the psychologist . Is the memory of fear , once we have recovered from that fear , an intolerable thing ? No one can deny that there was panic in February and 4 March of 1933 among those who stood to lose most by a sharp break with the past . And does gratitude toward the hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis is left behind ? It can not be doubted that there was almost universal gratitude for the warm , reassuring voice that came over the radio in March , 1933 . V What one returns to ? the incredible , the amazing fact ? is that most of these people seem to have no realization whatever of the present plight of the world . The events that occurred between the autumn of 1929 and the spring of 1933 have apparently left no mark upon their memories . The fact that there are in the United States still some twelve million unemployed is seemingly without significance to them . The fact that when Mrs. Skeane dismissed her gardeners and chauffeurs in 1933 the dismissal was more disastrous to them than to her does not lodge in her mind . The fact that in a time when millions are destitute through no fault of their own James Hamilton is very fortunate to have a cabana on the warm sands of Florida has not dawned upon him . Nor does it seem to have occurred to Joshua Thornberry that the plight of hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without governmental relief would speedily starve or freeze to death in the zero weather from which he can so readily flee , may have some logical connection with the taxing of the money which he has cleaned up in a quick and easy stock-market deal . If you were so rude as to remind Mr. Thornberry of this connection he simply ' would not believe that it was real . He thinks that most of the present unemployed could find jobs if they tried , and that the rest would quickly find them if he and his like were permitted to do just as they pleased with their takings . He thinks ? while he sips his champagne cocktail and looks forward to his leisure hours in the South ? that the unemployed are wasters living lavishly on funds expropriated from the hard-working and the thrifty . ( As he talks , through one 's mind run the words of the Ghost in A Christmas Carol ? " Oh Godl to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dustl " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers , a good fellow , kindly and generous . He simply is not aware of the gravity of the unemployment problem , has not bothered to look into it closely . His ignorance of what goes on outside his little insulated and padded world is abysmal . Even more disturbing is the fact that this ignorance does not shame him . He does not think of the unemployment problem as his problem as an American citizen . He and others of his class who share his views appear to think that they have discharged their full responsibilities when they have touched off a string of adjectives , peppered by a few sulphurous epithets . If they can not have at Washington an Administration of their own choosing , they in effect resign from the United States . They could hardly regard with greater hostility an alien government set over them by a foreign power . ( One recalls that dinner of New jersey public utility men at which a toast to the President of the United States was greeted by a roar of laughter . ) The only department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court , and the reason , stripped of its idealized protective coloring , is not far to seek ; the Supreme Court has recently appeared to aid their own interests . One listens despairingly at some of their gatherings for any word which will suggest a sense that the government is a continuing instrument for the benefit of all , in the direction and support of which they expect as citizens to share , regardless of the policy or the personality which for the time being is in the ascendant . It is precisely this sense of identification with the government which distinguishes the wealthy British conservatives , whatever may be their shortcomings in other respects , from the American variety . One wonders how many of our two per cent would follow the example of Stanley Baldwin , who shortly after the War wrote to the Times an anonymous letter stating his belief that the national debt was too high and that , therefore , he was presenting one-fifth of his fortune to the government in order to ease the burden to that extent . The early part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears in the conversation of well-to-do Americans . " It is so easy , " he wrote , referring not only to individuals but to governments , " to live on borrowed money ; so difficult to realize that you are doing so . " But he continued his argument with words which one hears less often . " They ( the wealthy classes ) know the danger of the present debt ; they know the weight of it in years to come . They know the practical difficulties of a universal statutory capital levy . Let them impose upon themselves , each as he is able , a voluntary levy . " The debt , be it remembered , was not the creation of Baldwin 's party nor the outgrowth of anything that he had personally advocated , but , quite regardless , he felt a responsibility that he could not deny . Nor was this letter , it should he added for the cynical , a gesture to gain immediate goodwill or political esteem . The identity of the author of the letter to the Times was not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , of course , Mr. Roosevelt 's lot has been that of other Presidents , and particularly Democratic Presidents . Grover Cleveland came in for much sheer abuse . Theodore Roosevelt , Republican though he was , was cordially hated by big business in his trust-busting days . It is ironic that the memory of both Cleveland and Theodore Roosevelt is now invoked to shame the present President Roosevelt . Woodrow Wilson also brought down the wrath of the gods by his program of reforms ; the masters of finance and industry forgave him only under the exigencies of war . Most observers are agreed , however , that those earlier rages can not compare with the present chant of hate . The lines to-day are more sharply drawn and there is no sign of any truce . A major war would serve of course , as it did for Wilson , to dissolve the fury . But nothing less than that would reconcile Mr. Roosevelt 's enemies to his presence in the White House . There is a much earlier historical figure with whom Mr. Roosevelt would appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , is the wise Turgot who tried briefly to restore some order and reason to the France of Louis XVI . As comptroller general , he favored restricting the monopoly privileges enjoyed by certain powerful corporations . He wanted to reform the royal household and restrain the more fantastic and flagrant extravagances of the court . He succeeded in abolishing many of the artificial impediments that had been put in the way of free trade . At the same time he proposed to ameliorate the lot of the petit bourgeois and the Iong-suffering peasants by removing the tax on salt and other burdensome levies . For all his wisdom , M. Turgot lasted only a little more than two years . The rich and the powerful were outraged at what this radical proposed to do . Why , he struck at the very foundation of orderly government . The arguments of the time could almost be taken from current newspaper headlines . At any rate M. Turgot was removed as comptroller general , his reforms swept into the wastebasket . And here , perhaps , is a happy exemplar for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he devoted himself to peaceful study and the pleasant pursuits of leisure . He died in 1781 , quietly in his bed ; which was not the lot , if one recalls correctly , of those who sent him into exile .
