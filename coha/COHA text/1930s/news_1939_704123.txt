txt Realism in the Far East Methods Suggested for Curbing Export Trade With Japan To THE EDITOR OF The NEW YORK TIMES : The President 's firm and realistic treatment of the Far Eastern situation must prove very pleasing to those who have given careful attention to the real interests of these United States . To be sure , there will he those who conceive the need of action but are disturbed by a host of considerations , such as the possibility of war with Japan , further and retaliatory interference by the Japanese with our property and citizens in the Far East , and the like . Such people little realize that when you are reasonably ' sure to lose a couple of eyes by failing to act , and may save these at the possible expense of a crushed finger , the finger should he risked . The analogy is n't exact , for temporary eviction from China by Japan would precipitate such a series of events that Japan would be reduced from a somewhat first-class power to impotence and the necessity for making full reparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she entered Manchukuo , and Secretary Stimson very wisely refrained from recognizing the conquest . Others feel that an embargo would mean loss of trade . Japan can not get along for long without foreign trade , and any embargo by the United States will he followed by others with whom she might trade . The loss is temporary . The . Japanese suggest that they may retaliate and propose to learn what the American point of view may he . Most Americans are either saying " At ta boy ! " or " It is about time . " The American mind is slow to anger , but when it changes it seems to happen all at once . The people of America are almost ripe to approve whole-heartedly any action the government may be obliged to take to liquidate the Far Eastern menace and restore a measure of law and order there . We are getting tired of building armaments to meet the threat of power which now attempts domination with utter disregard of treaties and the welfare of nations . American policy may well he " A pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ample stores in six months . It is stated that we may not place any embargo which does not apply to all countries . However , Japan does not enter the argument with clean hands . She is still liable to the same treatment which might be accorded any other power . We are fully entitled to take any action for our own defense . American trade has suffered from the days Manchukuo was overrun . The loss is subject to estimate . American property has been seized , or subjected to control , or has been destroyed . Americans have been injured or killed . We are fully justified in presenting the total of this bill to Japan for thirty-day settlement as a matter of establishing credit for further purchases under the treaty . We may go farther . As the " war " in China is unrecognized , any closing of Chinese ports , placing of mines or interference with places in which our citizens live , or of British or French customers in China , which may affect our business are illegal . We may notify Japan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans are found , remove her mines and evacuate all islands off the China coast which have been seized , as a prerequisite to the further purchase of goods . This is merely the requirement that Japan give security for further trade under the treaty and is in no sense an embargo . The blockade and evacuations to take place in ten days . If the United States desires , it may require all oil , iron and other mat erials needed by a nation fon war , which would have been exported to any nation having troops fighting on foreign soil , he sold to the United States Government for reserves . As such treatment would apply to several countries , such an " embargo " would not violate the treaty . There are so many ways in which the situation can he controlled . These are merely suggestions . Certainly any interference with Americans during either the ten or thirty day period , or later , would delay the clearance of goods for Japan . Perfect behavior may he used as the criterion of trade . EDWARD ADAMS RICHARDSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locating Episcopal Parishes To THE ElirrnR Or Tile New YORK TIMES : In Tile Ti es of July 24 you quote certain statements by the Rev. Dr. Fleming in the recently published Year Book of Trinity Parish as to the need of careful oversight and planning in regard to the location , or possible relocation , of the parishes of the Episcopal Church in Manhattan . Although Dr. Fleming would not so intend them , these statements may give the impression to those unfamiliar with the work of the diocese that there is at present no such oversight and planning . I therefore call attention to the fact that these very matters are under the constant consideration and oversight of the Bishop of the diocese and the Suffragan Bishop in consultation whenever necessary with the rectors of the parishes and with the standing* committee of the diocese , which includes both clergymen and laymen . In times past , when there was no diocesan regulation of the matter , parishes were sometimes unwisely located , hut under our present canons no parish can be established , or removed to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standing committee of the diocese . When this is advisable and practicable , changes of location should of course he made , and a striking instance of this is now in process in the removal of the old parish of the Epiphany from Thirtyfifth Street and Lexington Avenue to a new site at York Avenue and Seventyfourth Street , where there is a real field for its work . In view of the movements of population in Manhattan the matter requires constant and careful consideration from many points of view . But the worst thing possible would be for the church to discontinue its ministrations where these are so greatly needed in the crowded districts and the poorer parts of the city in order to remove to what from a material standpoint might be regarded as more favorable locations .

Government Competition Tax Money Is Used to " Run Industry Out of Business , " It Is Asserted To THE EDITOR OF T.az NEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks on the alleged " high " rates of the insurance and public utility companies , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 's announcement that it has been losing money through charging too low rates for bank deposit insurance is important and significant . Government-dogmatizing about business rates is one thing . Actually estimating business rates safely and soundly is quite a different thing . A government can charge low rates because it is free to use taxpayers ' money . Private business can not charge unsoundly low rates because this would cause the loss of investors ' money . For a government to allow private industry and private investors to start a business and then use their experience and even their plants to run them out of business with taxpayers ' money is also exceedingly unethical . To argue about a business situation from the ethical side may seem naive . But business ethics still exist and are even , hecause of increasingly widespread dissatisfaction among business men over " tooth - and - claw " business methods , likely to stage a vigorous come-hack . The attitude of big business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the government adopts the policy of doing the finishing on the basis of your experience ? Is It any wonder , under such circumstances , that American business refuses to go ahead ? No experienced business men remains in a conference when he finds a competitor listening in on his staff .

Gar'ner 's knife is searching for the quivering , pulsating heart of labor . And I am against him . " If labor is " quivering , " It is not due to any overt act on the part of Mr. Garner . The damage has been wrought by the arrogant leaders of labor who went so far as to command the seizure of property , intimidate Congress and give orders to the Administration .

Mr. Lewis also Raid : " Gentlemen , there is a crisis in your nation , do you know it ? " The committee is well aware of the crisis and so is Congress . Our uncertain economic future is due , in part , to the unsound economic policies of the Administration and unwise leadership of lcelor leaders . Wealth is produced by a combination of land , labor , capital and brains . in the future , Congress must give morn consideration to the profit motive , which is t he aeason for conducteng business .

Financing Old-Age Pensions To THE EDITOR oF THE New Iollk ' rums : It is now conceded by most thinking men that a national old-age pension is the solution to the unemployment , and business stagnation problem . But the great sticke ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national sales tax of 2 per cent on all sales for use end not for resale is the answer . And I propose that . the government coin a new coin called he " mill . " We already have the mill in our system of money . Ten mills make one cent , Then lax all sales of 3c to 5c one mill ; all . sales 5c to 10c two m ills , etc . Purchasers can then buy the mills from the government and pay their tax as they make the purchases , All purchases that paid a tax of 1 cent and more can be paid with the present . type of coin . This would give the nation a greater purchasing power and it , would also do away with tokens in other States , because it would he only a short while before the States would use the mills to pay their different sales taxes . In addition to the retail sales tax , place a 2 per cent tax on wholesale selling ; 2 per cent on manufactured articles and 2 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Social Security wage tax . In this way we can grant all persons more than 60 years old a $60 a month pension , both man and wife , on the condition that they both cease all gainful pursuit . ELBERT EASTMAN . Portland , Ore. , July 22 , 1939 , Early Financial Journals To Tug EDITOR Or THE NEW YORK TIMES : We were surprised to rend in the editorial regarding the " London Economist " the statement that . the " Commercial &; Financial Chronicle " was mir oldest financial publication on this side of the water . It may he interesting to note that " Bankers Magazine " was founded in 1846 and has been in continuous publication ever since , and " the American Banker " began as a publication in 1836 , changing its name in the week of Jan. 22 , 1887 , from " Thompson 's American Bank Report .
