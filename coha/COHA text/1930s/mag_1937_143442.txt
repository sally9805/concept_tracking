Of China 's 4,480,992 square miles , Japanese forces held : <P> This week 639,272 <P> Week Ago : 635,322 <P> Month Ago : 620,107 <P> Year Ago : 500,000 <P> Satisfaction was discreetly shown at the British Foreign Office in London last week as dispatches from Shanghai urgently warned that its Japanese conquerors were about to stage a blatant " Victory Parade , " with chances 10-to-1 in favor of some aggrieved Chinese patriot hurling a bomb . <P> " That might be the best thing that could happen , ' ' sagely observed an eminent , striped-trousered , black-jacketed British civil servant . " Without some such incident it is difficult for public opinion to grasp the immense significance of the acts of Japan , and unless public opinion is strongly aroused what can one do ? " <P> On the scene in Shanghai 's International Settlement , every effort to dissuade the Japanese from celebrating their victory with a boastful parade was made , meanwhile , by British Brigadier Alexander Telfer-Smollett and the U. S. Marines ' Brigadier General John C. Beaumont . After they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high U. S. official , lacking in Shanghai the detached perspective of London , cried : " If the Chinese fire a single shot , God knows what will happen ! To hold such a procession at such a time is to invite disaster ! " <P> Many Japanese civilians liquored up heavily before the Victory Parade . " They swaggered offensively , shoved Chinese civilians into the gutters and in some cases tripped them into falling , whereupon there was uproarious laughter from the Japanese , " grimly cabled New York Timesman Hallett Abend . Leading the parade came Japanese officers riding in motor cars or on horses so shockingly thin and ill-cared for as to make many a spectator gasp . Well-fed , clean-uniformed Japanese infantry came next , the middle-aged troops of the Son of Heaven who are invading China while his better , hardier and younger soldiers guard Manchukuo against Soviet Russia . After the infantry came machine guns , then mountain guns dismantled and packed on skinny horses , finally rumbling heavy artillery , munitions wagons and field artillery corps-the whole Victory Parade of such length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Just at the corner of Nanking Road , not one block from the Wing On department store , accidentally demolished by Chinese air bombs last August , the inevitable grenade was thrown . " I saw a figure across the street throw something , " John McPhee , Scottish inspector of Shanghai police , related afterward . " I watched a blur coming toward me . The object hit the ground and rolled between my feet . I pushed a Japanese civilian away and turned around just as the object exploded . A piece of shrapnel cut through my coat and hit my police card . I 'm pretty lucky . I thought I was a goner . " <P> " I saw three Japanese soldiers struck by fragments and stumble haltingly , " said Publisher George Bruce of the Shanghai Evening Post &; Mercury . " There was a burst of blue-black smoke . The parade broke for a distance of 100 yards . For a moment everything was quiet . Then the Japanese soldiers began scattering to both sides of the street .
