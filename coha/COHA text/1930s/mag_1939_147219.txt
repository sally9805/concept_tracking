Luren Dudley Dickinson , the Governor of Michigan , balanced himself on a milk stool on the lawn of his capitol at Lansing one afternoon last week , milking Miss Ormsby , a Holstein cow . The occasion : National Milk Week . Suddenly His Excellency shifted his seat , toppled off his perch . Unless Luren Dickinson , aged 80 , abandoned one of his cardinal tenets as he sprawled on the grass , he prayed . <P> Governor Dickinson is a Republican and a Methodist . Each Sunday at the Center Eaton Methodist Church near his home town , Charlotte , he still teaches a Bible Class . Dry and anti-tobacconist , he was elected Michigan 's Lieutenant Governor seven times , presided over the State Senate in decent obscurity . Then last March conservative Republican Governor Frank Fitzgerald died and Luren Dickinson succeeded him . In the past three months he has given Michigan its godliest and goofiest government . <P> Craving guidance , octogenarian Governor Dickinson first imported from Charlotte two cronies : Dr. Henry Allen Moyer , his personal physician ; Emerson R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzgerald as his legal adviser . Dr. Moyer 's duties include protecting frail , doddery Mr. Dickinson 's health , driving with him back &; forth to the Governor 's Charlotte farm ( 20 miles from Lansing ) , where Mr. Dickinson putters in his garden . Dr. Moyer also spends a good deal of time behind a newspaper in the gubernatorial office , occasionally offering his patient nuggets of statesman'y wisdom ( " I have a few ideas about government , too " ) . For these services , he receives $3,000 a year from the State as a medical secretary . <P> At $7,000 , Crony Boyles is more active . The Governor 's official legal aide and unofficial Pooh-Bah , he not only dispenses legal advice , but sometimes signs State papers in the Dickinson name . Himself and Colleague Moyer he modestly characterizes as " just a couple of fellows hanging on to the public tit . " Other Dickinson indispensables include : smooth , young Secretary Leslie Butler-who siphons callers so carefully into his master 's office that the Detroit Citizens ' League once complained : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Margaret Shaw , whom , the Governor says , God sent him . ( " I know there is a girl in my office answering letters in exactly the language I would use . I snooped one time , and there were the letters just as I would have written them . Who has been giving her that language ? There is but one answer . " ) <P> No. 1 counselor to the 54th Governor of Michigan is God . In his office every morning the Governor prays for five minutes ( see cut ) . Prayer , he says , brought him Boyles &; Moyer , helped him choose many another political appointee . ( " We were looking for a man to fill a certain State office . Suddenly the name . . . was made clear to me . I mentioned it . My legal aide , Emerson R. Boyles , said to me : ' You have a pipeline . ' ' Yes , ' I said , ' I have a pipeline to God . ' " ) <P> Other Michiganders , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view with alarm many an example of Luren Dickinson 's recent statecraft . Since March he :
