Test Scores <P> Sirs : All kudos to Eurich and Wilson for the Current Affairs Test in the magazine for June 29 . I hied myself straightway to this town 's first TIME-booster , Author August W. Derleth , candidly hoping to catch him with little better than a college average . Despite the fact that he is revising a major novel on option to Scribner 's Sons , putting together an anthology of poems for another New York publisher , and arranging a book of his own poetry besides reading for review and otherwise an average of 30 books and 40 magazines a month , Author Derleth scored a clean 97-missing three questions in Transport , two in Business &; Finance , one each in Science , National Affairs , Foreign News . I am curious to know how this compares with the average score . HUGO SCHWENKER Sauk City , Wis . Median scores on latest TIME test : college students-53 ; senior high school students-44 ; junior high school students- 38. - ED . <P> Sirs : <P> Would a comparison of Current Affairs Test scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four tests so far ; I should be interested in knowing what others report : <P> Winter 1935 96 <P> Summer 1935 100 <P> Winter 1936 93 <P> Summer 1936 102 <P> Average 97 <P> On none of them did I peek . <P> CHARLES CASSIL REYNARD <P> Greenville , Ohio <P> Sirs : <P> It is indeed a rare occasion when I find time to read more than newspaper headlines . Rarer , however , is the occasion when I miss reading TIME cover to cover . So to concise , complete , all-embracing TIME I give credit for whatever knowledge I possess of current affairs . <P> In the past two Current Affairs Tests my rating climbed from 72 to 79 . In this week 's test I hit 81 . If what you say is true and 60 is above the college average , then keep your college education and give me TIME ! <P> MORRIS LEVY <P> New York City <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Current Affairs Test , Question No. 105 , you state : " A 19th Century French painter who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The answer you give is Van Gogh . <P> Van Gogh was not a Frenchman . He was born in Zundert , Brabant province , The Netherlands , son of a Dutch clergyman and his wife , Anna Cornelia . It is true that his distinctive yellow coloring was developed during his residence at <P> Aries , France , but does that make him a French painter ? <P> NORA SANFORD <P> Belleville , Kans . <P> No . TIME 'S testmakers stand corrected. - ED . Sirs : <P> My thanks to TIME for placing provocative Current Affairs Test on last six pages . It makes it so easy to rip out and consign to the nearest wastebasket without disturbing balance of magazine . <P> LEON S. DEL WORTH Kutztown , Pa . <P> Yogi 's Trick
