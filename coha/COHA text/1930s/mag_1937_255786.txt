The Sanskrit word for fibre is jhat . In the Indian province of Orissa a tall , reedlike plant called jhut has long been cultivated for its fibre , which is used in making sackcloth and twine . But the best place in India for jute growing is the neighboring province of Bengal , whose alluvial plains between the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers produce at least 85% of the world 's crop . Last week while U. S. farmers were harvesting a bumper crop with combines ( see p. 15 ) , Bengali farmers with sickles were beginning to cut more than 2,000,000 acres of jute . When it is processed and packed into about 10,000,000 bales of glossy fibre , probably the biggest output since 1931 , a good half the crop will go . to the burlap mills of Calcutta , the rest to mills in Germany , Czechoslovakia , France , Italy , Great Britain and the U. S. <P> Fabrics made from jute were unheard of in Europe before 1835 , when the first jute yarns were turned out by flax weavers in Dundee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up flax for jute and an Englishman had shipped the first jute spinning machinery to Calcutta . British merchants were not slow to recognize the possibilities in Bengal 's ideal climate and magnificent supply of cheap labor ( Bengal , with about 50,000,000 inhabitants , is the most densely populated province in India ) . Working farms of two or three acres apiece , Bengal natives took more land out of rice , on which they live , and planted it with jute . Like cotton , this crop requires arduous cultivation in the hottest season of the year . Most fun for broiling Bengali is " retting " - soaking the cut stalks in pools to ferment the gum out of the fibres , after which the farmers work waist deep in water at stripping the fibres from the stalks . <P> Dried , rolled up in drums , sold to middlemen who are noted experts in Oriental extortion , all jute is drawn by bullocks or floated down India 's muddy rivers to the colonial city of Calcutta . There it is either bought by British manufacturers or made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balers . Most famed British name in the jute trade is that of Sir David Yule , an extraordinary Scotsman who died in 1928 after making a fortune of $100,000,000 in Calcutta . His dislike of things European relented enough to let him marry an Englishwoman but never to live in England . Since his death , plump , inscrutable Lady Yule and Daughter Gladys ( " the richest girl in England " ) have lived quietly at St. Albans cultivating their private zoo . Their friend , the Duke of Windsor , borrowed the Yule yacht Nahlin for his cruise last summer . When the Yules visited Manhattan last May they avoided socialites and reporters with equal discrimination , went for long walks in Central Park .
