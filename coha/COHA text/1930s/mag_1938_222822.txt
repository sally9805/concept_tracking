Octogenarian Abbott Lawrence Lowell , Harvard 's ex-president ( 1909-1933 ) , has spent a long and active life disproving the axiom that a burned child dreads the fire . The scalding he got when he protested Louis D. Brandeis ' appointment to the U. S. Supreme Court for " lack of judicial temperament " did not deter him from getting himself into hot water again by proposing a quota for Jewish students at Harvard and barring Negroes from freshmen dormitories . He went on to become embroiled in the Sacco-Vanzetti case as the target of libertarians ' scorn . Last year , when he demanded that the Government suppress sitdown strikes , Massachusetts Labor sharply reminded him of Harvard 's underpaid scrubwomen . Latest scorching for white-mustached old Dr. Lowell was the revocation last year of his automobile driving license , after he had once flunked a test , twice crashed into other motorists . <P> Of unusual interest , therefore , was the publication last week of a book by Dr. Lowell called What a University President Has Learned. * Lowell fans who may have expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fire were , however , disappointed . Dr. Lowell at 81 still thinks , for example , despite the contrary findings of modern psychologists , that Latin , Greek and mathematics are the most valuable subjects for training youngsters to think . He believes it is better for a boy to learn French by formal methods in the U. S. than by talking with Frenchmen in Paris , for a boy who learns by the second method " has had no more mental discipline than a little street Arab in a foreign town . " Still stanchly Tory , he sums up his social views : " Truly the future has less to fear from individual than from cooperative selfishness . " <P> Sample platitudes and homely phrases : " To essay too much at once may , by arousing opposition , imperil the plan . " " In stead of applying the principle of self-education there has been too much drag ging of youth over the ground in perambulators and wondering why their running does not improve , " An epigram Dr. Lowell borrows may be borrowed also by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves on being a practical people - which Disraeli somewhere described as men who practice the errors of their ancestors .
