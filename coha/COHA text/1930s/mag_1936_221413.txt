A sniveling naturalized U. S. citizen who sobbed his devotion to Germany in court and boohooed his way to acquittal when accused by Nazis of " treason to the Fatherland " was English Teacher Richard Roiderer of Cleveland , Ohio ( TIME , April 22 ) . In Munich last week opened the second Nazi trial of this kind , the defendant being Karl Nisselbeck , born in 1901 at Munich . He became a U. S. citizen in 1931 , since 1934 has resided in Munich . He was championed by the local U. S. consul who , after journalists had been shooed out and the Nazi court was about to become a star chamber , insisted on remaining present . <P> Star witness called by the Nazi prosecutor was a cowed-looking German in convict garb . Testifying in disjointed fragments , this jailbird swore that he had recognized a picture of Nisselbeck shown him by Nazi police as being that of a man he had seen consorting in Czechoslovakia with anti-Nazi refugees from Germany . <P> Interjected counsel for the defense : " From how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture of the accused ? " <P> " From one or two , " muttered the witness . Even Nazis in the courtroom tittered at this sidelight on Nazi police methods . <P> Although the witness finally became inextricably confused in his own testimony and was not asked to give evidence under oath , the Munich Court ended by sentencing naturalized U. S. Citizen Karl Nisselbeck to a jail term of two years for being " an accessory to attempted high treason " to Germany committed by " plotting " with two Germans . One of these two the court acquitted ; the other was sentenced to nine months .
