txt AN OATH FOR YOUNG MEN . That of Athens Revised to Fit Present-Day Needs . To the Editor of The New York Times : Recently letters have appeared in the press suggesting that the oath of the young men of Athens might be revised and brought more up to date . On several occasions , recently , high school students have publicly used the former oath . Possibly the following suggestion , or some modification of it , might have a more direct bearing upon the civic problems of today : " We will never bring disgrace to our city , by any acts of dishonesty or greed , nor condone such conduct in others . We will fight for the good name of this city , both alone and with other public-spirited citizens ; we will obey the city 's laws and endeavor to incite a like respect in those who would set them at naught , for their private designs ; we will strive unceasingly to quicken the public 's sense of civic duty , and will condemn all appeals for loyalty based upon partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will transmit this city not less but greater and better than it was transmitted to us . " T. F. KANE . New York , March 31 , 1932.
