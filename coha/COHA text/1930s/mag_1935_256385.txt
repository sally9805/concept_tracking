ARMY &; NAVY <P> In 1925 a court martial , sitting in a long , bare room on the second floor of the War Department 's old Emory Building in Washington , found Brigadier General William Mitchell publicly guilty of insubordination , suspended the No. 1 trouble-maker in the Air Force from the Army . Not until last week did another high officer of the Army face a court martial . Then Colonel Alexander Elliot Williams ( a Brigadier until he finished his tour of duty as Assistant Quartermaster General last January ) stood secret trial in Washington on the second floor of the Officers ' Club at the War College . <P> The trouble in which Col. Williams found himself began more than a year ago . At that time a subcommittee of the House Military Affairs Committee made an investigation of Army motor , underwear , and other contracts ( TIME , March 5 , 1934 ) . A by-product of that probe was an inconclusive District of Columbia grand jury inquiry which called in Army people all the way up to Assistant Secretary of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exonerate Harry Woodring . In July it reopened his case . Since then the subcommittee has twice dropped and resumed its investigation with persistent secretiveness . Upshot of 15 months ' probing was another investigation , by the Army 's Inspector General , which ended by accusing Col. Williams of soliciting and accepting a $2,500 " loan " from an inner-tube salesman although , as chief transport purchaser , he knew that the salesman hoped to get an Army contract for his company . <P> Presided over by Major General Malin Craig , commandant of the War College , seven other general officers in mufti tried the case . Col. Williams ' lawyer was a member of A. Mitchell Palmer 's Washington firm . After three days the War Department announced that Col. Williams ' brother officers had found that West Pointer guilty of accepting a bribe , recommended his dismissal from the Army but unanimously suggested " clemency " because of his 37 years of faithful military service from Santiago to Coblenz.                  @ @ @
