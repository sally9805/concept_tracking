In Manhattan last week Supreme Court Justice John Francis Carew put the finishing touches to his decision giving possession of 10-year-old Gloria Vanderbilt to her aunt , Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney ( TIME , Nov. 26 , et ante ) . " Calculated to destroy her health and neglectful of her moral , spiritual and mental education , " Justice Carew ruled , had been Gloria 's life with her glittering young widowed mother , Mrs. Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt . " Fit , suitable and appropriate " to his mind had been the child 's life for the past two years at Mrs. Whitney 's Old Westbury , L. I. estate . <P> Apparently to forestall an appeal , Justice Carew neither sustained nor dismissed the writ of habeas corpus by which Mrs. Vanderbilt sought to get her daughter back from Mrs. Whitney . Instead he made Gloria a ward of the Supreme Court of New York , appointed Mrs. Whitney her custodian as the Court 's representative . He ordered Mrs. Whitney to continue the child 's schooling , maintain her " in a manner suitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic governess who would instruct her in her mother 's faith. * Gloria should never be taken out of New York State . She should visit her mother every week from 10 a. m . Saturday to sundown Sunday , the entire month of July and from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m. on Christmas Day . This arrangement should continue until Gloria was 21 unless any party concerned should meantime show the Court good cause for change . With the decision Justice Carew and Mrs. Whitney were ready to call quits but not young Mrs. Vanderbilt . Pale against the Japanese wallpaper of her Manhattan livingroom , with photographs of herself and Gloria on the piano , on every table and every lampstand , she received the Press . " I shall carry this case , " she announced , " to every court in the United States and to the highest court , whatever that is . " Into Surrogates ' Court last week marched Lawyers George W. Wickersham and Thomas B. Gilchrist , co-guardians of Gloria 's estate , to urge that Mrs. Vanderbilt 's petition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " not a proper party . " Guardian Gilchrist intimated that Mrs. Vanderbilt 's allowance from the estate might be cut . Into Appellate Court marched Mrs. Vanderbilt 's attorney , obtained an order requiring Justice Carew to show cause why he should not be compelled either to sustain or dismiss Mrs. Vanderbilt 's writ of habeas corpus , thus opening the way for an appeal . Growled Justice Carew : " I 'm not interested . The order I signed is all right as it is . But if they want me to amend it , I shall amend it . " Counsel for both sides agreed that Justice Carew would probably dismiss Mrs. Vanderbilt 's writ , thus giving sole possession of the child to Mrs. Whitney . Meantime at Old Westbury small Gloria Vanderbilt , threatened with harm in a letter signed " Catholic Communist , " pursued her daily rounds under guard of twelve Pinkerton detectives . <P> * Commented Episcopalian Mrs. Whitney : " I am used to Catholic nieces . I have six in whose religious upbringing I am interested . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
