txt Senators Fess of Ohio and Borah of Idaho , both Republicans , clashed today in a lively debate over the La FolletteCostigan bill for direct Federal aid for the unemployed . Crowded galleries applauded the speakers . Vote on the measure was delayed until tomorrow , when Republican leaders count on Democratic aid for its defeat . Senator Fess , " as a matter of principle , " opposed the bill , which would provide $375,000,000 for apportionment among charitable organizations . Senator Borah contended that new conditions force the setting of new precedents of government and challenged his Republican colleagues to vote against the measure after they had given almost unanimous approval to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation act , providing $500,000,000 for loans to banks and corporations . Mr. Fess was the first administration spokesman to attack the bill . He said the difference between its proponents and the views of Senators opposing it rested on conclusions as to whether or not " we 've reached the point where local relief has broken down . " " I wo n't believe that point has been reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Government 's entering on this program of relief , because when it does there will be no end . " Senator Borah challenged this statement , citing the 8.000,000 unem- plowed who , he said , were shown in evidence collected by the Senate Manufactures Committee to need relief . " The government that will not protect its people is flying a flag which is a dirty rag that contaminates the air in which it flies , " Senator Borah exclaimed . Baruch Smiles at Debate . The applause for each participant in the clash caused Vice President Curtis to rap his gavel repeatedly before order was restored . Among the listeners to the debate was Bernard M. Baruch , former chairman of the ' War Finance Corporation , which was used as a model for the Reconstrucion Finance Corporation . He did not applaud , but ! he smiled broadly at the sables of the Senators . In the gallery was Mrs. Edward Costigan , whose husband , Senator Costigan , Democrat , of Colorado , became co-author of the measure before he had been in his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mild speech delivered in a low voice and introduced with a compliment to his opponents for the high plane on which they had kept the discussion previously . but before he sat down he had cut his knteitles by pounding his desk to emphasize his argument . He was soon shouting replies to inquiries from Senator Borah. who spoke after Senator Fess gave up the floor . Senator Borah rose to interrupt Senator Fess after the latter dwelt at length on the danger of " undermining the morals of citizens " by giving them Federal gratuities , rather than leaving direct relief work to the communities in which the needy live . " How does it affect the morals of the individual who receives any differently coming from the Federal Government 7 " asked Senator Borah . " The difference is this , " replied Senator Fess. " that if a person in a town comes into an unfortunate situation , good people come to his rescue and give him the necessaries of lif . That does not make him subservient to them , and he does n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the moment the Federal Government starts to make appropriations , coming from the taxes you and I pay . to take care of such people , they demand it as a right , and there is a world of difference in the effect on the character of the man who receives it . " Contrasts State , Federal Aid . senator Fess said the difference between State and Federal relief " is as wide as the Poles . " " I must say that I can not see the Poles , " said Senator Borah . " The Senator from Ohio is not reeponsible for the inability of the SeaOne from Idaho to see , " retorted Senator Fess . Senator Borah charged that Senator Fess was unwilling to discuss diteeny the difference between Federal and State appropriations . " I do not yield any further , " Senator Fess said , thus stopping , under ordinary circumstances , further questioning by Senator Borah . The latter , however , remained on his feet , saying in a loud voice : " I know the Senator does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a place where he can not yield ; he is afraid to yield . " " The Senator will please take his seat until I tell him , " said Senator Fess . " I will do nothing of the kind , " retorted Senator Borah . " Very well , stand then , " said Senator Fess . " I am going to answer the Senator 's question . " But , after further interchanges , he declined to continue unless Senator Borah sat down . " If my presence disturbs the Senator I will sit down , " Senator Borah told him , laughing . Borah Asks of " Moral Effect . " Senator Fess repeated his previous contention , talking until Senator Borah asked " May I rise now ? " He was told by Senator Fess that he might . " Suppose we consider the substitute which has been offered and assume that , instead of operating this eral Treasury , nobody will be influenced . " Here gallery applause for Senator Fess echoed through the chamber . " There is no limit to the demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work will hold that the government is responsible . Men out of work will demand that the government take care of them . " Men out of work will say : ' It is not my business to find work ; it is the government 's business to find work for me . ' " They will say : ' The government owes me a living . It is not a question whether I am seeking work or not , for the government owes it to me . ' " Borah Sees " Question of Humanity . " When Senator Borah gained the floor in his own right , he denounced those willing to vote $500,000,000 of Federal money to lend to corporations in distress , but who opposed either contributions or loans to individuals in distress . " It is a conflict of materialism of one side , and humanity on the other , " said Senator Borah . " I am endeavoring to place the individual human being on the same level as a corporation in the United States . " Senator Borah said that " every one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " agreed that Federal relief should be extended when communities had exhausted their own resources and contended that this point had been reached . " There is n't a semblance of the dole here , " said Senator Borah . " There is no difference , so far as a dole is concerned , between contributions from State Governments and from Federal Governments . " I am convinced that there is widespread and terrible suffering . Thousands and millions of homes have not had a day free from care and have been in actual want for eighteen months or two years . I am not willing out of a superstitious regard for precedent to refuse to do my duty . " This is not a local condition , but , in my opinion , it has pushed the American citizenship to a point where it actually is being depleted physically and mentally . " I denounce as a libel on our American citizenship the statement by the Senator from Ohio that contributions from the government might undermine their character . It does n't become a Republican citizen . to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we need a precedent , we 'll make a precedent . If you ask what evils I may flow from such a precedent , I shall ask what evils will flow from i the practice of giving bankers money from the treasury . " Senator Fess did not rise for rebuttal argument . Expects to Kill Substitutes . With no other opponent of the measure scheduled to speak and the friends of the bill almost all on record , a vote is expected tomorrow . Senator Watson . the Republican floor leader , expects to muster su4 ficient strength to kill this and each of the Democratic substitute bills , which would change appropriations into loans to States and would grant additional road-building funds , in addition to relief contributions . The Republicans count on the support of the Republicans and Democratic insurgents in defeating all substitute measures and on the aid of Democrats to kill the La FolletteCostigan bill , matter from the Federal Govern ! ment , we should loan a State $1,000 , - , 000 or $10,000,000 and the State should administer it , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the moral effect upon the citizen receiving the money in that way and receiving it from Washington ? " " The difference would be just the ' same as I have mentioned , " insisted the Ohio Senator . Senator Borah said he had read that " in a number of cities they are allowing $5 to a family of three or four a week , " and was applauded when he told Senator Fess : " The Senator knows perfectly well that if that father and mother should receive an additional $5 from the Federal Government of the United States it would not demoralize them and degrade them ; it would cause them to appreciate the great government under which they live and for which they are willing to give their lives . " Sees Dole as Political FootbalL " Mr. President , " exclaimed Senator Fess , turning to the rostrum and then pointing to Senator Borah , " the Senator has inadvertently announced the vicious element in this proposal , too vicious for any one to contemplate at length . - " He specifies an amount for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the point , and criticizes , as he will when it comes to doling out the Federal contributions . He refuses to permit the people on the ground who are also administering the money to say what is the amount that is necessary to keep the wolf from the door . " He makes immediately the Federal dole a football of politics , and every community will demand in its own right not what its local organization has allocated , but its own proport ion . " When you open the way for that populace , represented by the people today in the gallery , to say how much the Federal Government must give to an individual out of the Fed-
