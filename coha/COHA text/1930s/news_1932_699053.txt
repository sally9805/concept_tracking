txt C apt J. A. Mollison , youthful British aviator , the first person to fly alone across the Atlantic from east to west , has postponed until tomorrow the continuation of his flight to New York . He left this morning for Penn-field Ridge , N. B. , where he landed yesterday after flying from Portmarnock , Ire . He was too tired to go farther . He had a good sleep last night and decided ? to fly to Montreal today to watch We Canadian air pageant . His crossing of the Atlantic was " the toughest flight " he ever made . Captain Mollison said , and he was " jolly well all in . " He talked by transatlantic telephone with Amy Johnson , his wife of three weeks and herself , a noted distance flier , who promised to sail today for New York to join him , although it has since been reported that she will not come . In any case , however , she would not accompany him on his return flight from New York to London . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a stretch on the way across I could n't see the water below me and I did n't know whether the wind was changing and blowing me off my course . My calculations must have been right because when I came over land it was n't 10 minutes before I sighted Harbor Grace . " " I 'm going to fly the same plane back , " he said , " but I think the return trip will be easy . Flying eastward one has favorable winds and there is nothing to worry about except the possibility of motor trouble , and that is a very faint possibility . " He was credited with four new aviation records through his present flight  --  the first flier to fly westward solo over the Atlantic Ocean ; the shortest time from land to land on a westward crossing ; the first transatlantic flight in a light plane , and the longest duration flight in a small plane . His other record-breaking hops were from England to*Australia in 8 days , 19 hours ; from London to Cape Town in 4 days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and India to England in 3 days , 11 hours .
