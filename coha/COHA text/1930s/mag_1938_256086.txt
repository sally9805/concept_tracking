Sometimes by day , sometimes by night , towns and villages of Pennsylvania last week shuddered as a gigantic Voice suddenly bellowed at them from on high . Its volume was as the volume of a political host heard over a hundred massed loudspeakers . Actually it was the voice of one man , very much alone , the Rev. Reginald B. Naugle , an extroverted middle-aged Lutheran preacher . <P> In 1935 he ran for mayor of Philadelphia . Now he is running for the U. S. Senate , sole candidate of a " Pathfinder Party , " excoriating the Wagner Act and the C. I. O. Without party organization , without campaign funds , he motors 200 miles a day in a sound-truck fashioned like a railroad locomotive . In it he and four friends ( two of them sound engineers ) , carrying their lunches , draw up on hilltops overlooking towns , turn on a magnavox contraption powered by compressed air , and while the populace marvels , Candidate Naugle hurls his thundering political imprecations for miles across the Pennsylvania wilderness . <P> Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the one-party Southern States where elections are mere formalities , the eardrums of the U. S. suffered last week as much as Pennsylvania 's . With election day but a fortnight away the magnavox of Politics blared from every stump and hilltop , filling the air with civic sense and nonsense , but most of all with partisan fury . <P> Democrats . As the party in power , Democrats debouched upon the nation from Washington . To crucial Pennsylvania-for which Harry Hopkins last fortnight authorized 10,000 new WPA jobs-went Postmaster General Farley to warn a $100-a-plate dinner in Philadelphia that nothing could so comfort Republicans as to win back Pennsylvania , which they lost four years ago . Result in funds raised : $334,700 . <P> To New Jersey went Secretary of War Woodring . To Council Bluffs , Iowa , having already visited Kansas , Texas , and Illinois , went Secretary of Agriculture Wallace to make another of a series of heartfelt speeches in defense of AAA . To Kansas went Senate Majority Leader Barkley . To Pennsylvania after Mr. Farley went House Majority Leader Rayburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest was the Secretary of the Interior . <P> ( " Honest " ) Harold LeClair Ickes , after his handsome salute to the Negro vote in Baltimore ( TIME , Oct. 17 ) , crossed the continent upon the first major trial-balloon ascension of the White House Janizariat , which seeks data on 1940 . Ostensibly out to whoop up the New Deal for the Congressional elections and attend a few ceremonies at which his presence was appropriate , Mr. Ickes went armed with eight full-length addresses to deliver in twelve days ( besides informal talks and short speeches ) . <P> In these-carefully prepared and prereleased to the press-the editing of Janizaries Corcoran &; Cohen was unmistakable . They stamped Mr. Ickes as Possibility No. 1 in the Janizariat 's mind for a 1940 Presidential candidate acceptable to Mr. Roosevelt , a candidate to be built up before Democratic National Chairman Jim Farley and his alliance of local bosses can converge on someone else , such as Missouri 's Senator Bennett Clark. * " I think President Roosevelt would carry the United States if he ran again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
