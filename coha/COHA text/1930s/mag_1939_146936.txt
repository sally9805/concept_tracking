NIGHT OF THE POOR - Frederic Prokosch- Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> In his two previous novels , The Asiatics and The Seven Who Fled , Frederic Prokosch has shown a facile imagination and a brilliant hand at silken , vivid prose . Ostensibly a narrative of travel from Syria to China , The Asiatics told of hair-raising adventures , lubriciously glamorous encounters , incredible coincidences and cosmic conversations with the casual air of an article in the National Geographic . More Spenglerian than picaresque , The Seven Who Fled brought together to their mutual doom seven characters symbolic of European races , let them slowly disintegrate with their bewildered sensuality and inter minable talk into the vast oblivion of Asia . <P> Sharp-minded critics had their reservations about the quality of Prokosch 's world picture , still further reservations about his fundamental drive as a prose writer . Like his two books of poetry , the novels suggested a virtuoso 's familiarity with English , French and Oriental literature ; in places this familiarity became obtrusive , as in one chapter ending of The Asiatics which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journals . What would be the result if this young American , born in Wisconsin and educated at Haverford and Yale , turned his imagination to his own country ? <P> Night of the Poor is the answer to that question . Like The Asiatics its only plot is a record of travel , but this time the traveler is a 17-year-old boy bumming his way south from Wisconsin to his home in Texas . Tom starts out with his friend Pete , a mindless blond giant with curly hair on his chest who almost immediately mag netizes a colored farm girl , troubles Tom 's flesh by getting as far as taking down her dress before he remembers to send Tom away . This scene , equal parts Steinbeck and Pierre Louys , is followed by a touch from James Oliver Curwood when Pete kills a farmer in hand-to-hand fight . The story then swings quickly to mild Faulkner ; Tom loses Pete but finds Lucy , a wild little girl who runs away with him because " dad 's got so he 's queer with me . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity from hunger , accident , fatigue . When Tom loses Lucy he knows he 'll see her again simply because Lucy is going to Texas , too . A pursued gangster gives him a ride in a big , black Hudson ; he lives on an occasional hamburger , sleeps happily in thickets , in barns , on lawns . The little towns of the Midwest , the hitchhikers , lunchroom girls , farmers , high school kids , old people , down-and-outers , all pass by in Prokosch 's limpid prose , phantasmagoria hauntingly created but incredible in a landscape sensuously seen , smelt and touched but unrecognizable . It is the same with Author Prokosch 's ponderings : relevant , plausible , portentous and flimsy . Aware of the flimsiness , he attributes it to his material : " No crisis or tragedy in America becomes exact . The great struggles do not lie in the individual , they lie in the land , they are tribal and regional , and ca n't quite be put into words . . . . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
