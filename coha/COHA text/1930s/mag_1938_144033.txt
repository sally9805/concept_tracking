Oklahoma has had many bounties . Between 1889 and 1902 some 420,000 U. S. citizens got free homesteads in Oklahoma . Other lucky Oklahomans have struck oil . Their less lucky neighbors have made Oklahoma a No. 1 centre of easy money crusades , including the Townsend Movement , whose Cherokee-blooded onetime Vice President Gomer Smith Oklahoma last year elected to Congress . Last week it appeared , however , that some dishonest Oklahomans had found another bounty , the Social Security Board 's old age assistance plan . <P> Not to be confused with old age insurance ( toward which U. S. employers and employes pay a premium with every salary check ) , old age assistance payments are outright gifts to needy U. S. citizens 65 or over . Although each State administers its program independently , the Federal Government matches the State 's contribution and adds 5% , for administrative expenses . Some $10,000.000 of Federal money has poured into Oklahoma since the State got its program going in July 1936 . When Oklahoma 's indigent old reached the impressive total of 68,000 the Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rolls in 46 of the State 's 77 counties disclosed that $685,000 of the assistance money had gone to ineligibles , indicated that a complete State check would raise the total to $3,000,000 . At this point the Board 's Director Arthur Altmeyer summoned a number of officials , including Chairman John Eddleman and Director Henry J. Denton of the State Welfare Commission , which had charge of the program , to explain to him in Washington . <P> At the public hearings before the Board last week blame for the State of Oklahoma 's rolls appeared to rest on : 1 ) political subordinates , 2 ) Indians , 3 ) the possibility that Oklahoma 's politicians had encouraged old folks to confuse their program with the Townsend plan . Whatever the cause , Oklahoma 's oldsters had leaped onto the bandwagon with a vengeance . One pensioner , a physician , had just bought a new Ford for cash . A pensioned blacksmith owned his own shop , a car , two lots , owed no debts or back taxes . Of 47 ineligibles on the rolls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the discovered beneficiaries were 157 corpses , twelve inmates of insane asylums . Over 1.400 case files were missing . Other interesting pensioners : an aged Negro who lived on a county line , had changed his name to draw pensions in both counties ; the mother of a $14,000-a-year major league baseballer ; a woman at whose home the investigator had been received by a butler . Snorted Representative Jack Nichols of Eufaula : " I did n't know there was a butler in Oklahoma . " <P> Since the Board temporarily cut off funds for Illinois last year on far less flagrant provocation , that was the prospect which at week 's end disturbed many a worthy old Oklahoman.
