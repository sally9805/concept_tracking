On the grim , tide-gnawed rock called Alcatraz just inside San Francisco 's Golden Gate , the prisoners are counted every 30 minutes . They live in silence , permitted no talk except what is essential to their work , save on Saturdays when ( if they have been good ) they converse under guard for 2 hours . After the prisoners are locked in at night , the guards engage in rifle practice . They leave their targets ( human-shaped dummies ) sprawled along the walkway with bullet holes in vital spots for the prisoners to see in the morning . No convict has escaped alive from Alcatraz . A number have gone " stir crazy . " The penal psychology there is to make big shots into little ones . The country 's " most poisonous malefactors are sent there to prevent their infecting less dangerous inmates of other Federal prisons . Alcatraz , " The Rock , " is one nightmare which the most hardened criminals , outside it as well as in , can not laugh off . Alcatraz is a result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Franklin Roosevelt 's first Attorney General , rapier-nosed Homer Still Cummings . <P> Last week Mr. Roosevelt 's second Attorney General , gentle , pious Frank Murphy , having just returned from visits to Alcatraz and the contrasting U. S. prison farm at La Tuna , Tex. , announced that he is against Alcatraz . " It is necessary to have a place like Alcatraz to break up a crowd that conspires to escape or kill or murder , " he said . But he believed results equally good could be obtained in an escape-proof , walled farm , without quite such grim technique . " It is a great injustice to San Francisco , " he said , " to have that place of horror on the doorstep of the city . . . . " <P> Homer Stille Cummings is still in Washington , practicing law privately . Harvey Bailey , " Machine Gun " Kelly , Harmon Waley and numerous other bottomnotchers are still in Alcatraz , where he put them . " Scarface Al " Capone , whose transfer from Atlanta Mr. Cummings personally supervised from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1934 , got transferred out last winter , crazed as much by paresis as by confinement . Of Frank Murphy 's view of Alcatraz , Homer Cummings did not think much . Said he : " Those babies would n't stay in a prison farm very long . "
