STATES &; CITIES <P> A Governor has to make many a speech . At Ann Arbor , last week . Governor Wilber Marion Brucker of Michigan made a speech . Afterward , a Governor is supposed to shake the hands of as many of his audience as desire it . Stewart H. Redner , University of Michigan law student , was one of those who wished to have Governor Brucker shake his hand . A Governor is supposed to have something pleasant to say to those who want their hands shaken . When Student Redner said : " I killed my grandmother today , " Governor Brucker smiled cordially , replied : " I 'm very glad to make your acquaintance . " Withdrawing , Student Redner said he was not surprised at the Governor 's remark . For a long time it had been his theory that public men do not pay a bit of attention to what rank- &-file; citizenry say to them . Governor Brucker later insisted that he had heard Student Redner perfectly .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
