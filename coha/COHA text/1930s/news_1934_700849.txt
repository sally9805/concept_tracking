txt The first typewriter , that would stand-up and give service , the Remington. was put on the market 60 years ago , in 1874 . Invented in a period of depression , the machine ushered in the era of modern business . Now at the end of 60 years , with the world 's business at the worse impasse in history , the typewriter industry is in the best condition probably of any major world industry . Most machines being turned in on exchanges at present are from 6 to 7 years old , compared with the normal age of 3 years when turned in by most large users . On top of this , the typewriters turned in arc in bad condition ; close to half are in such condition that it will not pay to rebuild them . In fact , from 25 , : . to 60% of the machines traded in are now broken up and sold as scrap metal . Shortage of Second-Hand Machines A real shortage of second-hand typewriters has developed compared with an over-supply following the war , as large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after thou- sale to rebuilders . Most of these rebuilt typewriters at end of the war were shipped abroad to be sold there . Because of this large potential demand , makers of typewriters during the last month or so have operated their plants at about as high capacity as they can under NRA , and the three major makers in this country are at present markedly behind an their deliverer . While most manufacturers during the depression did little to improve their products , the typewriter makers have done much experimenting and have developed many new mode/s . As a result there probably was never four years in the history of the industry when greater advance has been made in typewriter design than from 1930 to 1934 . Because of the worn-out condition of the typewriters in most lines of industry , there will be more business leaders and purchasing agents visiting the National Business Show this week than ever before in the history of the industry . Thus , it is - believed the time Is fast %approaching when office equipment will be brought into hrst-class condition , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-year period of large demand . Price Only Recently Changed For the last SO to 40 years the various leading companies have been increasing steadily the excellence of their product . and yet during the whole life of the industry , 60 years . the price of the standard typewriter has remained practically unchanged until this week . This is a remarkable record for a world industry . and is. no doubt . due entirely to the fact that practically always 85 ' , , to 90i ; of the typewriters manufactured each year have been made by American companies . Today , all major improvements in typewriter design continue to be made by American inventors . In recent years this progress has been made possible mainly by inventors in the employ of the larger typewriter companies American typewriters are about 5 to 10 years ahead of the best foreign-made typewriters in design . and for that reason , there is little probability that American leadership in the world markets will be challenged seriously in the next 10 years , even with the heavy duties levied upon importation of typewriters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many typewriters as all other foreign countries combined . But unlike 1930 and prior years , the German typewriter at present being made is almost solely for home consumption . Due to the high import duty on typewriters into Germany . the two leading German companies are controlled , or virtually controlled , through stock interest by two of the leading American makers of typewriters , Underwood Elliott Fisher and Remington Rand . England , France and Italy are trying to build up a home typewriter industry , but the machines , while far better than the best foreign-made typewriters of 10 years ago , are not on a par with latest American models . NRA Caused Price Rise The reason why American manufacturers of typewriters have increased the price of their products is NRA . Under NRA not only has the price of the materials going into the typewriters advanced appreciably , but also the wages of the men , which are now above the 1929 level Shortage of skilled labor created ' by the reduction of hours to 40 a week has reduced the capacity . of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an attempt to speed the development of skilled men- Present output is attained only by worklag anal inspectors , adjusters and aliners , more than 40 hourd a week and paying them 155 : for all time over 40 hours a week . The typewriter industry , unlike many of the other industries of the United States , is not supplied with excess capacity . The peak years for the industry were - 1929 and 1930 . It was the persistence of typewriter demand in 1930 , that made many believe the depression was not to be as serious or last as long as it has . In 1929 and 1930 American manufacturers of typewriters turned out approximately 750 , - 000 machines , standard and portables , while foreign makers manufactured approximately 125,000 . Of the American machines , roughly 450,000 were standard and 300.000 portable ; of the standard models about one-third were exported for sale abroad , while of the portables about 40% went abroad . About 550,000 to Be Made in U. S. This Year Judging from figures covering the first eight months of 1934 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States this year . The division between large and small typewriters will be about the same as in 1929 and 1930 . Assuming 750,000 machines as the capacity of America 's typewriter plants , then the reduction of 20% in capacity due to NRA . cut in hours . brings 1931 capacity down to 600,000 machines . It is therefore seen that the estimate of 550,000 typewriters as 1934 production for the United States agrees fairly closely with the statement that the plants here have been operating during the last few weeks at close to capacity . For the whole year the factories will have operated at about 90% of NRA capacity . A factor in the situation has been the large government buying of typewriters for use in all the new bureaus and boards created to carry out the New Deal . Even greater has been the increase in general business buying of typewriters . The major part of the general business buying of standard machines , however , has not been due to any private stimulus but , so far as can be seen , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about 525,000,000 a day : A. ' government funds . To cap this has been the revaluation of the United States dollar that has undoubtedly stimulated foreign sales of typewriters . NRA Also Aided Indirectly Consequently , while NRA has decreased typewriter capacity 20%. and increased costs of manufacture more than 10% , it in turn has brought the increased use that forced , during the last six months , hurried replacement of typewriter equipment by many large users , and is causing many others to realize the necessity of re-equipping their offices at an early date . The sale of noiseless typewriters has increased fully 25% in 1934 compared with 1929 , despite the decline in general sales ofpnachines during this period . In addition Junior typewriters for children have , been put on the market . These are in most instances , in their essentials , simplified replicas of the best portable models . Even in this stripped condition these typewriters , selling at $20 to $30 are better machines than the world had 30 years ago . These junior models have constituted only about 10% to 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , unless there is soon an increased demand for Junior typewriters , It is probable the leading companies will discontinue their manufacture for domestic sale . While the sale of portable typewriters - remains confined practically entirely to individual users , by far the bulk of the sales of standard typewriters is to users of from 20 to 500 typewriters or more , with commercial schools and governments especially large buyers .
