At his first press conference after returning to Washington as President-elect , President Roosevelt last week read to newshawks the several electoral vote predictions he had written down and put away in his safe : <P> " Jan. 30 : Democrats 325 , Republicans 206 <P> " June 5 : Democrats 315 , Republicans 216 <P> " Aug. 2 : F. D. R. 340 , A. M. L. 191 <P> " Nov. 1 : F. D. R. 360 , A. M. L. 171 " <P> " Why did you guess so low ? " asked a newshawk . <P> " Just my well-known conservative tendencies , " beamed the President and President-elect. * <P> Two things made Franklin Roosevelt 's guesses look much more conservative than they were . One was that the ratio of the electoral vote to the popular vote was more lopsided than usual . Governor Landon polled only 1% of the electoral vote but he polled about 37% of the popular vote , scarcely 5% less than the number with which Woodrow Wilson was elected in 1912 , nearly 9% more than John W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Cox &; Franklin D. Roosevelt polled when they got 127 electoral votes in 1920 . <P> Second reason for Franklin Roosevelt 's bad guessing , and the bad guessing of almost every straw poll , was that a big block of citizens who do not ordinarily vote turned out at this election . Instead of 31% or 32% of the population voting , as in the last two elections , some 36% voted last week . Most of these , millions of normally silent votes apparently went to the New Deal , with the result that Franklin Roosevelt piled up 60.4% of the popular vote . The extent of this upset was not evident even after the greater part of the ballots were counted . Several Republican victories and a majority of the close contests turned out , three or four days later , when every last ballot was counted , to be Democratic successes . Result was that the statisticians , having reported that Democrats had elected 26 out of 33 Governors , had two days later to boost their figure to 27 Democrats ; having reported that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representatives , had to up this figure to 334 Democrats ( against 89 Republicans , 7 Progressives , 5 Farmer-Laborites ) ; having reported 73 Democrats in the Senate , had to revise up to 75 Democrats ( against 17 Republicans , 2 Farmer-Laborites , 1 Progressive and Nebraska 's unlabeled Norris ) . <P> Incidents of the Democratic Drift : <P> In South Dakota , which Franklin Roosevelt carried by a modest margin , other Democratic candidates had a bad time . Governor Tom Berry fell behind Republican Leslie Jensen in his bid for a third term . The State 's two Representatives , both Democrats , had neck &; neck races , scored one victory , one defeat . Democratic Senator William J. Bulow trailed his opponent . Chandler Gurney , until , two days after election , he found himself safe by a nose .
