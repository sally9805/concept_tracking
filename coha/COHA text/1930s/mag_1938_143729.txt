Interviewed by Paris ' Le Journal this week , new Rumanian Premier Octavian Goga announced : " We expect some Jewish citizens to remain in our country , but we wish to send out more than 500,000 of them who are without citizenship rights . " <P> Meanwhile in a truculent interview with London 's Laborite Daily Herald King Carol had declared : " The new Govern-ment in Rumania is my Government and it must have my approval . The day I am not satisfied with its conduct I will require a change . " <P> His Majesty asserted that 250,000 Galician and Russian Jews who fled into Rumania after the War came " illegally " and are " not a good element . " These " invaders " are not protected by the minorities treaties , continued King Carol . " About them we will consider what we must do . . . . We shall not be rabid . ... If we take certain measures against these 250,000 Jews which seem illogical to the British mind and are not in accordance with Civilization it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder . " <P> There are about 1,000,000 Jews in Rumania today , and last week the forehanded British Minister in Bucharest , Sir Reginald Hoare , suspecting what the Goga Cabinet was about to do , had called the attention of His Rumanian Majesty 's Government , " in the friendliest manner , " to the rights guaranteed to Jews and minorities under the Treaty of St. Germain . The French Minister followed with another limp protest , for both London and Paris knew that Bucharest was just on the verge of teaming up with Berlin , chucking Rumania 's traditional alliance with France . The official German news service bellowed meanwhile : " In Rumania the Goga Government wishes only to expel Jews from State offices and call a halt to Jewish thievery . In Czechoslovakia , however , millions of Germans have been fully deprived of all rights . Did Britain ever find it necessary to remind the Czechoslovak Government of minority agreements ? . . . The ruins of Arab houses in Palestine with the death sentences passed on Arab leaders merely fighting for their rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples that contradict sharply the British Government 's present interest in the fate of the Rumanian Jews . " <P> Most famed of all Jews who emigrated last week from Rumania was none other than King Carol 's red-headed Magda Lupescu , who reached Vienna on her way to Nice . To her old friend and personal banker , Dragul Popescu , according to the London Daily Sketch , she confided : <P> " Many people consider M. Goga my enemy . Actually he is my friend , my very firm friend . Immediately when M. Goga came into power he talked to me earnestly , pleading that it would be better for everyone if for the moment I left Rumania . ... I found it difficult to make up my mind . Before I left Bucharest I had a long conversation with the King . In my house at Sinaia we talked the problem over again trying to make up our minds what was truly the best course . ... I have not forgotten that above all I am a great Rumanian patriot , and the interests of Rumania weigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle down for a little while in Paris . "
