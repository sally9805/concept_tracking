Edward F. ( " Ned " ) Hutton , rich stockbroker and board chairman of General Foods Corp. , likes to speak his mind on business and politics . Sometimes Mr. Hutton 's phraseology lets him in for public trouble . Last summer , in sounding off against soak-the-rich taxes , he declared that today he considered himself " 70% slave and 30% free . " Thereupon Columnist Westbrook Pegler mused : " This undoubtedly is true on the basis of his tax returns , but there is no denying that such slavery has its little compensations . Mr. Hutton 's slave quarters in Palm Beach might be called a model cabin . His 16,000-acre patch in South Carolina is sufficient to supply potatoes and greens for a slave family of normal appetite , besides an occasional ' possum , and the Hutton slave ship , the Hussar , the largest sailing yacht in the world , offers a pleasant escape from the driving lash of his masters , who pay no taxes and are therefor 100% free . " <P> Last week Ned Hutton laid himself open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of Public Utilities Fortnightly , he proposed that U. S. business unite to form a super-lobby " which will be heard . . . in the Halls of Congress , in the executive departments , and even in the White House itself . " Wrote Mr. Hutton : <P> " Benjamin Franklin , when signing the Declaration of Independence , said that if they did not all hang together they would all hang separately . If the major industries of this country do not hang together , if they do not openly call their stockholders and employes to the colors in a 1935 declaration of independence , the radicals that now infest the executive and legislative departments of our Government will joyously hang them all separately . " <P> Mr. Hutton deplored " minority pressure groups " but saw no alternative except the formation of another . What was more , " business and industry can have a lobby which will overshadow them all . Why do n't we organize it and come to the help of any part of business &; industry when that help is needed ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally his forces Mr. Hutton cried : " So I say : ' Let 's gang up ! ' " <P> Ill abed in his South Carolina home last week , Mr. Hutton must have sat bolt upright when he heard the reaction to his suggestion . Angry editorials burgeoned . Chairman O'Connor of the House Lobby Committee thought Mr. Hutton should be investigated . Mr. Hutton 's trim , dapper figure appeared in a Rollin Kirby cartoon , soliciting Big Business support to " gang " Franklin D. Roosevelt . President Colby Chester of General Foods hastily disclaimed his chairman 's ideas as representing corporate policy . A market letter of Weingarten &; Co. offered Stockbroker Hutton some sage advice : " Interests and forces opposed to the Administration can accomplish much more . . . in fighting out the issues on their merits rather than talking about . . . super-lobbies and ' ganging up . ' "
