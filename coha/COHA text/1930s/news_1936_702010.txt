txt Mamie Kelly , sweetheart of the American navy , came back to town today after nineteen years in Panama City to see if Broadway had any innovations in entertainment worth taking back to her tropical port of call . Breezy , broad of gesture and mother confessor of every gob who has passed the portals of her cabaret , Mamie stepped off the Santa Lucia and headed straight for Broadway to " catch up " with fun . " I 've got forty or so girls in my floor show , " said Mamie , " but I thought there might be one or two new ideas I 've missed . I do n't want the Ritz to get stale . " She 's One of the Boston Kellys . Miss Kelly , who was born Mary Lee Kelly on Boston 's south side , said she probably is the world 's outstanding authority on the life and habits of the sailor .

" Not any more , no sirree ! " When the fleet comes in now , they have cameras over their shoulders 1 and if they buy Panama hats , they get hats made in Panama . " Girls Behave They Have To . " Why , I 'd rather see one battleship drop anchor than a dozen tourist ships , " said Mamie . " The boys rush for the postofiice and send money orders home , then they swoop into the Ritz for a little relaxation . They used to overdo their consumption , but not any more . They are as neat and trim in their drinking as Yale and Harvard boys  --  gentlemenlike , you know . " Her girls behave , said Mamie , because they have to . 1 " They stay on one floor of the club i and ca n't go out at night , " said the proprietress . " It 's in their contract . " i Says Even the Cops Are Honest . Mamie boasts about conditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place , " I she said . " The cops are honest . We pay a big license fee , but ? that 's all . 1 It 's not , like Broadway . . Why , the 1 worst Menace we have is the bootblacks . They 're always under foot . " Something gets the sailors when 1 they land in Panama , said Mamie . I Right away they go on their good beI havior.
