In human affairs it sometimes happens in efforts to save lives that more lives are lost than those originally at stake . That is what happened last fortnight to Soviet Russia . In the jumbled waste of pack ice east of Greenland four scientists were dangerously drifting on their " ' station , " a floe which was in constant danger of breaking up ( TIME , Feb. 14 ) . For nine months , as they were carried by sea currents southward from the Pole , they had made observations in Arctic meteorology , oceanography , magnetology and marine biology . To help with the rescue , the semirigid dirigible V6 started out from Moscow . To Leningrad and beyond , the flight was uneventful . In the mountainous Kandalaksha region near the White Sea , a heavy snowstorm enveloped the airship . Radio communication stopped . Searching parties found the wreckage after a 24-hour hunt . Thirteen of the crew , including the commander , were dead . Three of six survivors were injured . <P> On his floe , meanwhile , in the gloom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an icebreaker 40 miles away . That was the Taimyr , laboring toward them through the pack ice . At 20 miles , the going was so difficult that the Taimyr 's commander thought of trying to blast a channel through the pack , but this plan was discarded as impractical . The men on the " station " marked out with flags a safe landing place on the ice near their floe , and the first contact was made by airplane . <P> Last week the Taimyr struggled within a mile of the Papanin floe . It was joined by another icebreaker , the Murman , which had come up fast while the Taimyr was beating its channel through the pack . Eighty men swarmed out of the two ships , started for the floe on sleds . They were met by the joyful scientists , who carried a portrait of Joseph Stalin . All their equipment was transferred to the Taimyr . After drawing lots to decide which ship should have the honor of carrying which heroes home to glory . Leader Papanin and Radio Operator Krenkel boarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taimyr . Which ship got the dog Jolly , mentioned in dispatches three weeks ago as a companion of the four men on their floe , last week 's dispatches did not disclose . <P> Radioed Leader Papanin to Professor Otto Yulievich Schmidt , hardy , hairy chairman of the Great Northern Sea Route Administration , who was on a third icebreaker not yet insight : " . . . Wewerenot anxious for a moment about our fate because we knew that our mighty fatherland which sent forth its sons would never desert them . The warm care and attention of the party and government of dear Comrade Stalin , of the whole Soviet people , uninterruptedly maintained in us the conviction to accomplish successfully all our work .
