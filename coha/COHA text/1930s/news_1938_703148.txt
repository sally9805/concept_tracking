txt Reassurance that the Canadian Government will not sacrifice the " interests of the agriculturists or manufacturers " in the negotiation of its new trade relations with the United States and Britain was officially voiced in the House of Commons yesterday . The declaration , made by W. D. Euler , Minister of Trade and Commerce , is regarded as a significant statement of policy in view of the dual trade problem facing Canada For not only is a new agreement with the United States to be negotiated , but Canada will bear a heavy share of concessions by the Dominions to enable Britain to make a more favorable arrangement with the States in the forthcoming Anglo-American trade negotiations . Mr. Euler vigorously criticized the spOkesmen of the Conservative Party who charged that Canadian producers would be sacrificed in negotiating the treaty with the United States . " We had the same expressions of alarm when we proposed to make the first agreement with the United States but the result has shown there was no cause for it and the consequences have been mutually satisfactory , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were led to fear the consequences of the 1936 treaty with the United Kingdom and the treaty with Germany . In both instances their fears were groundless and both treaties'worked advantageously . The Background ay a Stall Correspondent of 7 lie Christian Science Monitor When Canada 's two best customers start revising their own trade relationships , the Dominion will be facing readjustment of the arrangements which pave brought Canadian trade to the highest point in the past seven years . No study of the Canadian trade position can proceed without the simple premise that DO per cent of Canada 's exports are shipped to the United Kingdom and the United States . Thus revision of the preference arrangements of 1932 ? under which Canada has enjoyed special advantages in the British markets ? is a matter which Ottawa officials are giving most careful study . It is recognised that some of these preferences will necessarily be revised In the course of negotiating the new Anglo-American treaty . But the approximately parallel revision of the Canada-United States trade treaty , which has been In force with important mutual benefits during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep its balance . Direct concessions from the United States may to a degree offset preferential sacrifices which Canada may make to permit ; success of the Anglo-American nego nations . Gains on Both Fronts Careful studies of the relative position of the United States and Britain as factors in Canada 's trade position disclose that the Dominion has been gaining on both fronts . Canada has been one of the thief gainers by the so-called Ottawa agreements of 1932 , through the preferential treatment she has gained in the British market . Meanwhile , in the past two years . exports covered by the Canadian-United States trade have grown from approximately $169.000,000 in 1935 to 8257,000,000 in 1937 . But the most significant fact of all is that much of the gain in Canada 's exports to Britain have been made at the expense of the United States . In other words , commodities which the United States has been shipping to Britain in smaller proportion since 1932 have been the very ones in which Canadian shipments to Britain have gained . Comparison The general situation is shown by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bout one-quarter as much goods from Canada as she did from the United States . The Canadian exports to Britain were about ** while those from the United States wire approximately ? 196,000,000 . In 1932 , the year of the Ottawa agreements , trade had fallen sharply , but the proportion is interesting . Canada sold to Britain slightly more than half as much as the United States . The figures were ? 43,000,00Q for Canada and ? 84,000,000 for the United States . Then , in 1936 , with continued operation of the preferential system , Canadian sales to Britain grew to nearly 80 per cent of the American sales . The totals were ? 75,000,000 for Canadian exports to Britain and ? 93,000,000 for United States exports . It is this balance which is at issue in the two sets of negotiations that will so - vitally affect the Canadian position . In the Case-of Bacon low it has worked is indicated even more clearly by specific commodities . Bacon provides one of the more dramatic examples . Between 1929 and 1936 , exports of bacon from Canada to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the same period . exports of bacon from the United States to Britain dropped from 643,600 to 38,800 hundredweight . The figures indicate that the Canadian gains absorbed their market from wider sources than that of the United States , but the balance between the two countries , in the British market , is being carefully scanned by Ottawa trade experts on commodities running from apples to salmon . But throughout the preliminary discussions run two reassuring notes . The first is the recognition ? that the lowering of tariff barriers forms a major focus of the foaeign policy of the United States Secretary of State . Cordell Hull . The second is the primary importance to Canada of the increasingly firm relations with the United States . Difficulties may arise over individual concessions , but the long-range objective of continuing the improvement of Canadian-American trade is expected to open the way both for the necessary- concessions to permit Anglo-America negotiations to go forward and for the extension of the Canadian-American agreement .                 @ @ @ @
