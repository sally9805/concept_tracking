txt " The United States Government is engaged in one of the most indefensible bits of folly that has ever aeon tried in its attempt to aid the wheat grower by buying wheat 20 cents above the market . " Hugh Bancroft , president of The Wall Street Journal , who is stopping at the Roney Plaza with his family , said to the Miami Daily News . " The British government tried the same experiment with rubber . The price became worse instead of better . Brazil tried it with coffee . As a result they now have a two-year supply for the world in storage and are raising enough annually to take care of all needs . " Cuba tried it with sugar . The price of sugar now is lower than ever . Individuals tried it with copper . Copper prices are touching new lows . " Yet the government , " Mr. Bancroft pointed out , " goes right ahead in the face of these proofs that it is trying the impossible and attempts to hold up the price of wheat artificially , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was talk that wheat would be fed to cattle instead of corn . The corn belt suffered through drought . Yet the cattle feeder must buy wheat at a higher price to fill his needs because of government intervention and thereby pays the penalty of the so-called farm relief . " He pays , " continued Mr. Bancroft. " and so does every one else in the country that buys bread . The United States surplus of wheat beyond domestic needs can not be sold in competition with other grain-exporting countries because the artificial price can not be maintained in a foreign market . " The government can never stop speculation in the stock market in Mr. Bancroft 's opinion . " Rather , " he said , " the government is carrying on one of the greatest speculations now that has been tried in recent years . Bull and bear markets are an expression of the optimism and pessimism of human nature , " Mr. Bancroft said , " and you ca n't change human nature . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
