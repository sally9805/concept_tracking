txt An increase of $7.50 a ton for newsprint has been announced by the International Paper Co. , effective for the first six months of 1938 . This advance , the third since early in 1936 , raises the cost of newsprint to $50 a ton . Prior to last year 's rise newsprint had been maintained at its low point of $40 , set in 1933 . The first boost since that date occurred in January , 1936 , an increase of $1 a ton on January 1 . this year . a further advance of $1.50 a ton became effective . Already some foreign markets are bidding higher for newsprint , R. J. Cullen , president of International Paper Co. says , but the company hopes the domestic market will be stabilized at this level .
