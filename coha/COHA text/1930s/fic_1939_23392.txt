BRIGHAM AND AMELIA A STORY BASED ON HISTORICAL FACT BY VARDIS FISHER st E moment he saw her he was artled  --  for he had always admired tall and queenly women , and this girl was tall and fair , with an excellent figure and a proud lift to her head and throat . For a moment he hesitated . Then he quickened his stride and came abreast of her , lifted his tall hat , and spoke . " I think I have n't met you before . Are you one of the sisters ? " " Yes , " she said , glancing at him a little fearfully . " I am Brigham Young , " he said . " I know that , " said the tall fair girl . Her gaze noted that he was portly , that his soft brown hair was getting thin . Quietly she added , " I am Harriet Amelia Folsom . " " You have not been here long ? " " Not very . " " Are your people recent converts ? " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of him . Brigham was not to be outdistanced ; but he did become aware that his heart was beating rapidly . He had never been in love , not really , though he would have said nonsense to that . He would have said he had loved all twenty-four of his wives and still loved those who were living ; but he had never loved in a way to make him giddy , to make his fancy turn  --  as it was turning now  --  to the soft and alluring and unpredictable qualities in a woman . " Sister Harriet , " he said , " are you trying to run away from me ? " " I have to go . " Her clear gray eyes looked at him and again she quickened her pace . " I wo n't hurt you . Am I somebody to be afraid of ? " " No , " she said , still walking briskly , " but I am late . " " Then I 'll escort you , " he said ; and he added dryly , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I need no protection . " He kept at her side , though he was panting a little , for she walked with the case of youth  --  and he was sixty-one . At the door of the adobe house where her parents lived he asked with dry amusement for himself , " Will you ask me in ? " " I  --  I do n't know . " She was looking at him as no woman , so far as he could remember , had ever looked before . Most of the sisters were flattered by his attentions but this tall girl acted as if she wanted to see the last of him . That was something new for Brigham Young , Lion of the Lord , empire builder , and the shrewdest statesman in the nation in this autumn of 1862 . " I 'd like to meet your parents . I have n't , have I ? " " No . " " Then I 'll go in with you . " He liked her parents . They were devout , he perceived , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand ; for that Brigham , president and prophet , should call at her she observed that he had gone home and groomed himself . He looked like a statesman , all right -- but not like a lover . He looked as if a tender word or a clinging kiss would be as alien to him as to granite . After a few moments the parents excused themselves , saying they must call on a neighbor ; and Brigham gave them a statesmanlike smile for their courtesy and tact . When he was alone with Harriet he looked at her a little sheepishly and asked , " Do you like me better now ? " She admitted to herself that she did not . He was too boyishly gawky and eager to please . With soft malice she said , " You look like President Young . " " This is a fine suit , " he said . " I suppose it 's still true that feathers make the bird . " " At least they look better with their feathers on . " He chuckled at that . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister Harriet , why do n't you like me ? " " I have n't said I do n't . " He rose and sat by her . " Do I scare you ? " " No . " " I scare a lot of people . " His voice sounded as if the matter worried him . After a long moment of consideration he went straight to the point . " I want you to marry me . " She caught her breath with sudden , swift resentment ; and he said , " Will you ? " " No . " " Why not ? " " President Young , have n't you wives enough ? " That question angered him a little . " Not until I have you . " She looked at him curiously . " How many wives do you have ? " " I have had twenty-four . They arc not all living . " " I 'd think that many would be enough even for a prophet . " He was not used to such rebukes . He was silent , hardly knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he spoke as president and prophet she would findhim in bad taste ; and if he spoke as man and lover she would find him foolish . " Will you play or sing for me ? " " I 'd rather not . " " I love music , Harriet . I 'd like to hear you sing . " " Please , not now . " " Would you rather have me go ? " " Do n't you usually do what you want to do ? " Again he was nonplussed . Observing that she looked at him with eyes a little frightened , he wished he could be more gentle . " Sister Harriet , I 've fallen in love . " " Is that anything new ? You 've fallen in love twenty-four times . " " No , I 've been too busy . I 'm beginning to think this is the first time . " Harriet shrugged . " It has n't taken you very long , " " I always do things in a hurry , " he said , smiling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If you marry me you will share my glory in the next world . " She moved quickly as if to leave him but he caught her hand . Angrily , she drew her hand away . Still baffled and not knowing what to say or do , Brigham rose and took his hat . " Sister Harriet , you think it over . You pray to God and see if He does not tell you to marry me . " Her lips curled . " In such matters I consult my heart and not God . " Within a few days Salt Lake City knew that Brigham was wooing the tall and disdainful Harriet Folsom . Tongues wagged . Wagers were laid . Would she marry him ? Would she dare say no ? And if she did , what would Brigham do ? The other Mormon leaders were annoyed and troubled : only five years ago Brigham had stopped a Federal army sent to exterminate him , and now the Congress was passing anti-polygamy laws and getting ready to put the Mormons in jail . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovesick lad ! They frowned and watched him and wished Harriet Folsom were six thousand miles away . said he had a new favorite , and he would not like that . " You insist ? " " I do . " " Is that all ? " " No . This might not seem important to you . You already have wives named Harriet , so I must be known as Amelia . " " That 's easy to grant . I wish the other requests were as reasonable . " " They are all reasonable . You are not a woman . " " Well , is that all ? " " I must have some nice clothes . Some of your wives look outlandish . I wo n't wear old homespun things that look as if they came across in a handcart . And out in public I wo n't act as if I love all your other wives , as some of them do , making little smiles and saying sweet things they do n't mean . I wo n't be a hypocrite because you say God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . He looked at her full brow , her intelligent eyes , her firm chin  --  and realized that he was offering marriage to an uncommon woman . Just the same her demands were most unreasonable . " And is that all ? " " You 'll have to spend a Tot of time with me . You ca n't come to my house once in six months and kiss my hair and say ' hello ' and then disappear for another six months . I will sit at the head of the table with you . If that makes the others jealous , then you 'll have to settle it with them . I 'm going to be more than just wife number twenty-five . " " It looks like it , " he said . " Well , if I make all those promises , will you marry me ? " 5 , yes. , , " Will you marry me if I do n't make them ? " ? No. , , " Then I guess I 'll have to promise them . Have you thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have your hands full . " She turned to look at him , her gaze coldly steady . " Do you promise ? " " Sister Harriet , I think you 're un-reasonable . " " You 're not a woman . In plural marriage , it seems to me God did n't pay much attention to the woman 's side of it . " Brigham looked at the fire and considered . " I promise , " he said . Brigham set men to work at once to build a magnificent palace for Amelia . It was to be a huge and ornate mansion of many rooms ; and meanwhile , after the marriage , she took a little cottage by herself . Often she ate with Brigham in the large dining room of the Lion House , and he kept his promise to sit with her alone . They shared a small table at the head of the room ; and the other wives and many of the daughters were flanked on either side of a long table . Amelia had lovely clothes , jewels , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat with her husband in his box , and the other wives sat in a special row of chairs in the parquet . She was , as she knew she would be , both envied and feared . She stepped into the great household as queen , and she held her position as queen , no matter how bitter the gossip behind her back . Her first dinner in the dining room was an adventure that would have paralyzed a girl with less spirit and courage . She entered on Brigham 's arm and went to the small table reserved for them , allowing him to assist her to her chair . The other wives were already seated . Amelia appraised them with swift glances , but swift glances were enough . They were a most unusual group . In age they varied so widely that among them there seemed to be daughters , mothers , and grandmothers ; and they ranged through every conceivable size . Some were tall and some were very short ; some were as gaunt as a starved ox , and some were great mounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread in their chairs as if boneless . Some looked as if dressed for the nursery , some for parties , some for the kitchen . All of them watched ? and that was more than Amelia could say of the other lips there . Gazing at her husband now , Amelia wondered why he had chosen so many wives who were unwomanly . Perhaps it was true , as he had said , that he had been too busy to fall in love , and had been interested only in intelligent mothers and healthy children . Nevertheless , it made Amelia shiver to think of the courage a husband must have to embrace so many wives with such stubborn chins , such cold eyes . He was a brave man , she decided , and smiled within  --  or a most obtuse one . Amelia fell to thinking next of the countless rumors about these women . Of Harriet Cook , a tall woman with light hair and blue eyes , it was said that she caused Brigham more trouble than the Federal army ; for she often denounced Mormonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the house . Susan Shively , gossip said , spun and dyed and passed unnoticed from year to year ; Ellen Rockwood , in poor health , was visited once in every six months ; Twiss , childless , waited on Brigham with faithfulness that neglect only whetted ; and Clara Chase , ignored during her fourth confinement , had gone insane . It was now being said that Emmeline , long Brigham 's favorite , was dying of a broken heart since he married Amelia . How much truth there was in the many rumors , Amelia did not know ; nor did she know whether she would ever learn the names of all these wives and children . Among the wives there had been , she remembered , a Mary Ann and a Lucy Ann , several Harriets , an Augusta , an Emily , a Clara , Margaret and Louisa , Susan and Ellen and Maria , Miriam and Eliza . It was all very confusing ; for among the daughters were Elizabeths and Marys and Emmelines , Zinas and Miriams and Louisas . She sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . Brigham himself hardly knew the names of all his children , especially now that grandchildren weremultiplying round him ; and sometimes he mixed the names of his wives . She knew by sight the tall , graceful Emmeline , the round , sandy-haired , blue-eyed Twiss , the tall , sharp-nosed Harriet Cook . But most of them were only unfriendly faces , and she thought it would be best if they remained so . " Are you through ? " asked Brigham . " Yes , " she said , and rose from the table . Every gaze was upon them as they passed out ; and she knew that as soon as the door closed behind them , there would be a deluge of gossip . " I want to go home now , " she said . They went to the cottage where she stayed , and she found it cosy and warm , with a great log burning in the fireplace . " Are you happy ? " Brigham asked . She smiled , wondering if he had ever asked that question of a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Most of your wives do not like me . " " You imagine it . " " No . A woman senses these things . " " Well , " he said , removing his coat , " do women ever like one another anyhow ? I sometimes doubt it . " " Some of them will like me and I 'll like some of them . But I say again , do n't expect me to be with them . " " That was a promise , " he said , and warmed his hands . She thought he looked old and tired to-night ; he was a little stooped , and his face was pale and drawn . It was hard to think of him as husband and lover . It was hard to imagine herself in his embrace . Drawing a chair close , she sat by him and laid a soft hand on his knee . She felt compassion and tenderness . He had never known love  --  not really , not deeply ; for all his life he had been too busy plotting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she realize how lonely he was and how alone he had always been . It had not mattered much perhaps when he was young ; but now that he was growing old , now
