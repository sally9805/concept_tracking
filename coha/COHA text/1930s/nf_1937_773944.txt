txt // doorway is blind-folded , her right hand holds the Tables of the Law reversed , and her left a broken reed . The four seated figures within the jamb above have not been identified , but it has been suggested that the contrast between Judaism and Christianity is continued here , and that the two lower figures , both of which have veiled heads , are Jewish doctors , and the two upper , with bare heads , Christian doctors . In 1343 , Bishop Hamo de Hythe ? a great patron of architecture ? raised the central tower , erecting upon the Early English storey , which has been alluded to as not rising higher than the ridge of the roofs , another one , relieved on either side , as far as can be judged from engravings made before 1749 , by a pair of windows , and surmounted by a low spire of oak , covered with lead . After the completion of the tower , the outer wall of the north choir-aisle was raised to form a clerestory , and a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diagonal and wall ribs meeting in carved bosses executed . To the same Late Decorated period we may assign the windows with tracery in the style transitional between Decorated and Perpendicular , still existing in the side walls of the presbytery . The fifteenth-century builders , with their usual disregard for work of an earlier epoch , substituted a broad Perpendicular window for the three lancets in the upper tier above the altar , imbedding portions of the Early English work in the wall , where it is needless to say the eagle eye of Sir Gilbert Scott detected them and he restored the fenestration of this end of the church to its pristine form . // The clerestory and plain wooden roof of the nave , and the great west window belong to the Perpendicular period , and also the large chapel on the south side of the nave . At Rochester , devotion to St William of Perth eclipsed that to the Blessed Virgin , so the Chapel of Our Lady was relegated to a less exalted position than the head of the cross . Her altar stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south transept , but increased devotion calling for an enlargement of the chapel somewhere , the present Late Perpendicular building opening out of the south aisle of the nave , and the western side of the transept was formed . Of late years this chapel has been fitted up , and an enamelled cross and candlesticks of handsome workmanship placed upon the altar . After this there is little to record in the architectural history of Rochester Cathedral but a series of mutilations and disfigurements . The wretched work in the south aisle of the nave dates from 1664 , that in the opposite one from 1670 . Various works of restoration were carried out at Rochester between 1871 and 1875 under Scott . Between 1888 and 1890 the west front was restored and the debased northern pinnacled turret replaced by the Norman one we now see , and those flanking the aisles carried up to their present dimensions . On either side of the great west doorway , which , it is needless to say , has not been touched , two of the arches were found to be blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with statues of Gundulf and John I. // In 1904 an old citizen of Rochester , Mr Thomas Hellyar Foord , of Botley Grange , placed the sum of ? 5000 at the disposal of the Dean and Chapter , to be applied to any use they might think fit , and it was decided to rebuild the steeple . The lower portion of the reconstructed tower is Early English . The new belfry stage , which has been made as far as possible to resemble that of Hamo de Hythe , is Late Decorated , and rises well above the roofs of the transepts . Niches above the windows are filled with figures of St Andrew ( west ) , St Paulinus ( south ) , the Blessed Virgin ( east ) , and Hamo de Hythe ( north ) , and on the shields are sculptured the arms of various distinguished persons connected with the cathedral . Bishop Hamo 's metal spire had become much debased when it was removed in 1825 , but the fine one with its lead covering , laid herring-bone fashion , in all probability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great dignity and repose to what was heretofore a not particularly prepossessing exterior . The steeple , which contains eight new bells , was inaugurated on St Andrew 's Day  --  the Patronal Festival of the cathedral ? 3rd November , 1905 , on which occasion the thirteenth centenary of the foundation of the See and cathedral was also commemorated . ST PAUL 'S THERE is no exaggeration in saying that no building in the world is more intensely associated with the city , town , or place in which it stands , than St Paul 's is with London . The first church is supposed to have been founded on the site , about 597 , by King Ethelbert . The first bishop was Mellitus , the companion of Augustine . It shows the marvellous permanence of English institutions , that the manor of Tillingham in Essex , with which the cathedral was then endowed , continues to this day to form part of the fund for the sustentation of the fabric of St Paul 's . This churca was destroyed by fire in or about 1087 . A new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably not finished in 1136 , when it suffered the same fate as its predecessor . The rebuilding occupied until 1283 , but when it at length stood completed , with its length of nearly 600 feet , it must have been a magnificent building . The peculiar feature of old St Paul 's was the position of the Chapter-house , an octagon occupying the centre of a small but beautiful cloister , placed in 103 // the angle formed by the south transept with the nave . The Chapter-house , by its tapering proportions and the great length of its windows , far surpassed in exterior beauty the other polygons of English architecture , and had much that was foreign in its character . Some remains of these appendages were discovered in 1879 , during the formation of the garden on the southwest side of the cathedral . Under the Commonwealth , Old St Paul 's fell on dark and evil days . If it would have paid to destroy it , destroyed it would have been . With the Restoration came renewed care for the cathedral , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurity . In 1666 the memorable fire of London placed the venerable pile evidently beyond repair . In 1668 Deata Sancroft asked Wren to prepare a plan , " handsome and noble for a new church . " Fortunately , he was empowered to make alterations during the progress of the work , and it is to this provision we owe the present St Paul 's ? a building which in spite of certain technical defects , must be considered the noblest in the style of the later Renaissance that the world can show . The first stone was laid , some say by Wren , others by Edward Strong , the master mason , on 21st June , 1675 , without any display , neither king , bishop , dean , nor even the Lord Mayor being present . Sir Christopher took great pains to secure a good foundation , saying , " I build for eternity . " The choir was opened for service on 2nd December , 1697 , the thanksgiving day for the peace on the Treaty of Ryswick. // The north-west chapel was opened on 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise date has not been recorded , the top stone of the lantern was laid by the son of the great architect . St Paul 's was begun and finished within forty years , under one Bishop of London , Dr Henry Compton , one architect ; and one master mason , Mr Thomas Strong . The total cost appears to have been ? 747,661 , 10s . Wren 's salary was only ? 200 a year , yet he was not suffered to receive this in peace . It was supposed that , in order to continue in the enjoyment of this munificent sum , he delayed the works , and in an Act passed in 1696 there was a clause authorising the suspension of a moiety of the surveyor 's salary until the church should be finished , " thereby the better to encourage him to finish the same with the utmost diligence and expedition , " and it was not until Christmas 1711 that the moiety was paid him . Some time after , a pamphlet was published , asserting that there were frauds and abuses which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was considered by his friends successfully , yet there can be little doubt that the charges were still believed in , and may have led to his ignominious dismissal from his office after forty-nine years of service , and when he was an old man of eighty-six . P. 1 The mortal remains of the great architect repose near the eastern end of the south aisle of the crypt , beneath a black marble slab . A glance at the ground plan of St Paul 's will show that it resembles an Anglo-Gothic church of the largest // class , except only in the breadth and fewness of its bays , of which there are four to the nave , and , if we are to include the square-headed one behind the reredos , the same number to the choir . The usual four piers at the crossing are omitted so as to throw the whole weight of the dome on eight surrounding piers ( as at Ely ) , and the re-entering angles , i.e. , those formed by the junction of the nave , choir , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the height of the clerestory walls , or about 100 feet from the ground . Of these towers , the south-western one contains the stairs leading to the " whispering " and other galleries , while the three others are apportioned as vestries to the Dean and Canons Residentiary , the Minor Canons , and the Lord Mayor . To the west front , with its portico of coupled Corinthian columns in two tiers , with their breadth and depth of shadow beneath and between , are added laterally , beyond the breadth of the church ? as at Wells and Rouen ? two bell-towers of symmetrical outline and elegant detail . They rise to double the height of the roofs , and behind , or east of them , are two oblong chapels , co-extensive in height with the aisles , but having rooms over them corresponding to the clerestory . The northern of these is the Trophy Room , now used for rehearsals of music , etc. ; the southern is the Library . On the eight central arches , at the junction of the four arms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer supporting a complete colonnade , 140 feet in diameter , admirably contrived to abut on the // inner , which carries the domes . These with their lantern , crowned by a gilt copper ball and cross , rise altogether to thrice the height of the roof , or 365 from the ground , 356 from the floor of the church , and 375 from that of the crypt , which , extending beneath the whole length of the cathedral , is of great dignity and impressiveness , beautifully kept , well lighted and warmed , and in some respects the most interesting part of the building . The great peculiarity of the dome of St Paul 's is the invisible conical structure of brick interposed between the inner and the outer domes , resting on the lower circumference of the former , and serving to support the stone lantern . The supporting cone is most ingeniously modified at its upper part , to leave eight windows , and support the concentrated weight of the eight masses of the lantern . Simple ratios prevail between all the leading dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 to 2 , between the breadth and height of openings , avenues and spaces . The semi-circular porticoes at the transepts are highly beautiful , and the detail within them is the purest and most classical in the building . Viewed , let us say , from the north or south-east corner of the churchyard , no classic building in all the world presents so harmoniously and so perfectly proportioned or so elegant a sky-line as does St Paul 's . The finest parts of the interior of St Paul 's are its four extremities . The great unbenched space at the west end of the nave , opening on either hand into the Morning Prayer Chapel , and that now furnished for // the Order of St Michael and St George , is uncommonly grand . Here the arches opening from the central space into the aisles , and thence into the chapels , spring from isolated columns . Another fine feature of this hay is the manner in which Wren has set it back a little way beyond the line of the other three in the nave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gibbons ' choicest carving may be looked for in the screens separating the chapels from the aisles . In the other three bays of the nave , as indeed throughout the rest of the cathedral , the piers are huge square masses , relieved on each face by two Corinthian pilasters . The low screen between the dome area and the choir is a magnificent piece of iron work of the same date as the cathedral , and , until the altar was brought forward to its present position , enclosed the sanctuary . For more than twenty years it lay by disused . The lectern at St Paul 's is the largest , and in many respects the finest , eagle lectern in England . It was executed between 1718 and 1720 by Jacob Sutton , an eminent brass founder of that day , and measures nearly 8 feet 6 inches from the black and white marble pavement of the church to the crest of the bird , which is 2 feet 9 inches in height , the breadth across the wings being 3 feet 3 inches . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest merit . While seemingly stooping to sustain its sacred burden , " ad astra tendens , " it is most spirited and life-like , the plumage and the details being admirably executed . The pulpit , opposite , was erected in 1861 as a military // memorial , and deserves attention for the variety and beauty of the marbles used in its construction . The yellow is mostly Sienna , but there is a little of the ancient Gallio Antico brought from Rome . The green is Greek , from the Island of Tenos . The red columns are of Cork marble , the dark purplish ones of Anglesea , and the grey of Plymouth . Until the alterations of 1860 , the screen supporting the organ did not stand immediately under the arch opening from the dome into the choir , but just within the first bay on either side . The intervening space , flanked by the monuments of Nelson and Cornwallis , formed a kind of ante-choir separated from the dome space by those heavy iron grilles and gates which now separate the crypt chapel from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choir screen was put out of sight , but after the lapse of twenty years was rescued and placed in halves , one just inside each of the great transept doors , where they may still be seen . The white marble portion in the north transept , with the famous cenotaph to Wren concluding , " Lector , si monumentum requiris , circumspice , " faced the dome . The wooden half in the opposite transept faced the choir , where it matched the stalls . It should have been remarked that previous to 1858 the service was exclusively confined to the choir . The space beneath the dome was perfectly unencumbered . The first Sunday Evening Service in St Paul 's was held on Advent Sunday , 28th November , 1858 , when the enormous congregation and the cordon of gas round the dome ( used for the first time at the Duke of // Wellington 's funeral in 1852 ) , served to bring out more than ever the glorious proportions of Wren 's masterpiece . The Bishop of London preached . Early in 1872 , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince 4 ) f Wales from his almost fatal illness of the December previous . Accordingly , nothing was thought of but how to get the choir ready with the greatest expedition for this important occasion . Sixteen years , however , elapsed before the white marble pavement of the choir was relaid , the staircase added to the pulpit , and the reredos erected , but matters at St Paul 's remained by no means stationary during that period , every year witnessing some improvement in the religious and artistic improvement of the cathedral under the wise administration of Dean Church and his " Great Chapter . " It is impossible within such limits to dwell upon all these works in detail , but it would be unpardonable to omit mention of the following : the improvement and strengthening of the choir ; the erection of a spacious choir school in Carter Lane , the suspension , in 1878 , of a grand peal of bells in the north-western campanile , and that of " Great Paul , " four years later , in the opposite one ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it for early and late services , and the formation in its northern aisle of commodious vestries for the Vicars Choral ; and the throwing open of the cathedral for great gatherings of choirs , guilds , and associations in connection with the church , thus rendering it in every sense the mother church of a great diocese . // As a sequel to the throwing open of the choir to the dome in 1860 , came the desire of Dean Milman and his committee to introduce mural and vitreous decoration , and a beginning , though a timid one , was made of the former in the roof at the east end of the choir . Then in 1864 one of the great spandrels of the dome received its complement of colour ? a mosaic picture ( by Salviati 's process ) of Isaiah , from the pencil of Alfred Stevens . This was followed two years later by a similar picture , that of St Matthew , by G. F. Watts . Meanwhile the first stained glass was inserted in the window over the great west door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing St Peter and St Paul . Between 1872 and 1875 , the coating of drab paint with which the stonework had been covered , was removed ; the choir aisles were denuded of their paint , and sundry small but necessary improvements were made in the sanctuary ; but , owing to divided counsels , the decoration scheme still languished , though much money was wasted on tentative designs . However , in or about 1885 a beginning was made , and the first fruits appeared in the reredos and its truly dignified and sumptuous surroundings . Meantime the further adornment of the sanctuary was quietly proceeded with , not only by the erection of massive screens within the last bay of the choir on either side , but of sedilia and credence table , in every way worthy of their locale . Also the remaining six great pendentives in the dome were filled with mosaic . The figures of the prophets are entirely by Alfred Stevens . Those of St Matthew and St John are // due to Mr G. F. Watts , and those of St Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues of Greek and Latin Fathers of the Church were being placed in the niches between each group of windows in the drum of the dome about the same time . Then about 1890 , the zeal for the mosaic decoration of the entire cathedral which had lain dormant for so long a period , burst out , and , upon the recommendation of Mr G. F. Bodley , the committee placed the work in the hands of Sir William Richmond . The first section of the scheme , comprising the apse and the two bays adjacent , was disclosed to public view on Easter Eve 1894 ; and on the same day , two years later , the completion of the work , as regarded the choir , was celebrated by the singing of the Te Deum before the High Altar at the conclusion of Evensong , Sir William Richmond and the entire staff of workmen engaged upon the decorations being present . Next , the four quarter domes ? i.e. , at the meeting of the choir and transept aisles ? were taken in hand , and now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mosaic work is full of power and effectiveness , the colours employed the loveliest , the whole scheme a learned one , and the effect taken en masse most gorgeous , it would be idle to deny ; it is surely a matter of gratulation and contentment to those who recall with a shudder the former bareness of the walls and roof of the choir , to have seen a work like this inaugurated . But beyond and above all this there is a satisfaction // in knowing that the work has not only been conceived on its present grand scale by an English artist , but carried out by English workmen , and thus a decided step has been taken towards the formation of an English school of mosaic founded on the best ancient models . OXFORD ) xFORD Cathedral was a twelfth-century priory church turned five hundred years later into a cathedral . What once existed is now no longer seen in perfection , for the west front and nearly half the nave were destroyed by Wolsey when he built the great quadrangle of his Cardinal ? now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criterion of excellence , and if Oxford is inferior in dimensions and magnificence to most of its sister cathedrals , it is valuable in the main as a singularly rich and beautiful specimen of late Anglo-Norman work , while in the additions that subsequent eras have made to it , we have examples for study as numerous as they are refined . It presents , moreover , an architectural problem , to be alluded to hereafter , which our most expert antiquaries have not succeeded in solving satisfactorily . History tells us that buildings devoted to God 's service were erected here between 720 and 740 , by Didan , one of the kings under the Heptarchy , for his daughter Frideswyde , and that that lady herself founded a nunnery on the spot , dying as abbess after a life of monastic piety in or about the latter year . 115 // The history of the religious house following the death of St Frideswyde is involved in obscurity , but one fact stands out from the long impenetrable mist , that the convent was for some time under the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Edgar ( 958-975 ) , who , with St Dunstan as his chief adviser , favoured the restoration of religious houses , that the nucleus of the present cathedral was begun just to the south of the Saxon church , and dedicated to St Frideswyde . Then the house seems to have fallen into the hands of secular canons . Early in the eleventh century Etheldred the Unready , the king " without counsel , " determined to get rid of the Danes throughout his dominions by one stroke , because it was made known to the king that they would " treacherously bereave him of his life , and afterwards all his witans , and after that have his kingdom without any gainsaying . " This atrocious and impolitic act took place on St Brice 's day , 13th November , 1002 . At Oxford , some of the townspeople ? Danes ? took refuge in St Frideswyde 's , but it was fired by the canons ; it lay for some time roofless , and exposed to the fury of the elements , but was subsequently restored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ruled the house until their suppression in 1524 or 1525 . It was about forty years after their establishment that the Saxon church was greatly enlarged , assuming that form which , in the main ? rich Late Norman ? it wears at the present time . Until the middle of the thirteenth century the church retained its simple plan . It had a square-ended choir of five // bays with a short aisleless sanctuary ; transepts both with eastern and western aisles ; a central tower and spire ; and a nave of eight bays , while to the south lay the monastic buildings . During the Early English period the church received a Lady Chapel , which , owing to the proximity of the east end of the choir to the city wall , could not be built in the usual place , so a spacious one with a separately gabled roof was built on to the north aisle of the choir . In the following century a further addition was made to the building by the Chapel commonly styled the Latin Chapel . A graceful specimen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the Lady Chapel , and has its roof also separately gabled , though it is slightly wider , extending beyond the line of the northern transept , whose eastern aisle was much disturbed by the erection of these parallel chapels . Somewhat earlier in the Decorated period the original Norman fenestration of the east end was removed , and a tall window of five lights with intersecting mullions foliated , substituted . Of the same date as the Latin Chapel ( c. 1350 ) is a window in one of the chapels attached to the south transept . In Perpendicular times the most important alterations effected were in the choir , which received its present groined roof with pendant bosses ; and in the nave , where Perpendicular windows were inserted in the aisles , and a flat roof of simple character given to it in lieu of the original Norman one . Wolsey 's idea for his Cardinal College would have been a magnificent idea had he been permitted to carry // it into execution . He contemplated a body composed of sixty canons regular , and forty others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large choir . Wolsey demolished the west front and , half the nave of St Frideswyde 's priory church , intending to build a new chapel on the north side of his vast quadrangle , but the Cardinal 's disgrace in 1529 put an end to his magnificent , though it must be said , in some respects mischievous scheme . The funds appropriated for it were seized by the king , who subsequently continued its founder 's designs ; but , instead of a hundred canons , royal bounty could only find a maintenance for twelve , and the style of the house was changed from Cardinal 's , first to King 's College , and afterwards into Christ Church . In the interim the monasteries had fallen , and several new bishoprics had been created , partly out of their suppressed revenues . Among them a bishop , a dean , and six canons were established in the great abbey of Oseney , close to Oxford . The house was , however , soon dissolved , and Henry transferred the bishop 's seat from Oseney to Oxford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedication to Our Lord , at once the cathedral church of the Bishop and his Chapter , and the college chapel of the students , in which dual character it has continued to the present day . The first thing that strikes one on entering Oxford Cathedral is that arrangement of arches which has given rise to such antiquarian controversy . Each bay of the nave and choir is in appearance double , and the capitals of the columns supporting the arches are , as it were , cut in two , one half towards // the aisles standing at a much lower elevation than the other half towards the nave or choir . Conflicting statements would assign it , some to the days of Etheldred II. , others to those of Henry I. Advocates of the later twelfth-century theory account for the presence of the arcade between the two arches from the fact that the same feature occurs at Romsey and St Cross , Winchester , both Late Norman buildings . On the other hand , those who hold the Saxon view maintain that the said arcade which now forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the half of the short , stout pillars , with their low boldly chiselled capitals which faces the nave or choir , was cut away by the Norman architect when he introduced his much loftier half columns . If the lower range of arches and its superimposed arcading is of pre-Conquest date , it is as valuable as it is wonderful . On the other hand , if the purely late twelfth-century theory be accepted , the arrangement can only ' be considered an almost unique and highly beautiful one . The original twelfth-century clerestory , lighted by a single window to each bay , seen through a detached triple arcade , appears in the transepts and nave . In the former the windows are round-headed , but in the latter pointed , since that was the last part of the church to feel the influence of the alterations . In the choir , although the original twelfth-century walls remain , the clerestory windows are obtuse-headed insertions of three lights , cut through the Romanesque walls and forming part of that scheme for perpendicularising the // choir commenced just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that expiring effort of Gothic art , the vaulted roof , which , with its multiplicity of ribs , bosses and pendants , is not only one of the most gorgeous , but probably one of the most complicated examples of groining without fan-tracery . From a most graceful boss in the vault above the sanctuary a sweet face of Our Lord gazes benignly down . The present design of the east end of the choir , with a large wheel window surmounting two small roundheaded ones , was ably reproduced from Sir Gilbert Scott 's discoveries , so that we are able to form some idea of how this end looked in the latter days of the thirteenth century . In designing the reredos , completed in 1881 , Mr G. F. Bodley wisely selected that period when English church furniture was at its best , viz. , about the beginning of the fifteenth century . Executed in Dumfries sandstone , it takes the form of a triptych , consisting of a tall square-headed central compartment containing a sculpture of the Crucifixion in rosso antico beneath a rich canopy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of it , each with two ogee-headed niches holding figures carved in the same material . To the left are St Michael and St Stephen ; to the right St Gabriel and St Augustine . Beneath the central group runs the legend in old English characters , " Per crucem tuam , libera nos Domine . " The candlesticks and the books , the gifts of two Dr Kings , relatives of King , Bishop of London ( 1611-21 ) , date as far back as the days of Charles I. , and , together with the side // hangings of rich material , impart an appearance of warmth to the east end of the cathedral . The throne was erected in 1876 as a memorial to Samuel Wilberforce , Bishop of Oxford from 1845 till his promotion in 1869 to Winchester , and there is a truthfulness in that likeness of him at the back which is remarkable . It was on 14th February , 1556 , that near this spot , the sentence of degradation was pronounced upon Archbishop Cranmer , but the actual ceremony took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now formed beneath the tower , whose graceful clustered shafts supporting the arches ? round towards nave and choir , and pointed towards the transepts  --  form , together with the lantern above them , one of the finest features of the church . It will be observed that the sides of the great piers facing the centre of the church are left free from shafts , doubtless with the view of affording room for the stall backs . During the Laudian epoch , and under the rule of Dean Duppa , the original stalls placed in the choir by Cardinal Wolsey were removed into the Latin Chapel , where they may still be seen , and new woodwork , not a very favourable specimen of its age , substituted . A heavy screen , but of better character than the other fittings , was erected within the eastern arch of the tower to support the organ . Of Duppa 's work all that remains is the really splendid pulpit and the screen supporting the organ , whose noble case has been preserved through all the changes the church has undergone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bay of the // nave at the west end , the space beneath it forming an ante-church . Having completed the vaulting of the choir , which hitherto had only one of those flat wooden roofs so generally thrown over their wide central spaces by Anglo-Norman architects , the canons commenced the same process upon the north transept . Two Perpendicular windows were inserted in the clerestory at the north end , and the space over them marked out for vaulting ; but these two windows and their surroundings were the last of the changes ; the doom of the Chapter had been fixed , and the Papal Bull had come . In the nave , preparations had been made for vaulting , as may be seen from the slender shafts with delicately foliaged capitals supporting the circular tie beams of the present roof , an elaborate , low-pitched timber one with richly decorated panelling . Throughout the church the aisles are groined in stone , that in the nave being distinctly Early English . Passing into the lateral chapels adjoining the north aisle of the choir , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more correctly St Catherine 's , Chapel ? three out of the four graceful windows with curvilinear tracery containing fourteenth-century glass of singular beauty . One female figure under a spiral canopy occupies the centre of each light , with grisaille above and below , and the scheme has been admirably carried on in the fourth window , so that throughout the range we have one continuous central band of rich colour . The east window of the adjoining Lady Chapel was in its original form a triplet of lancets grouped beneath a // stinted arch , but it was replaced during the middle of the fourteenth century , in all likelihood when the adjoining chapel was being built , by a Flowing Decorated one of four lights . The stained glass in this window , by the late Sir Edward Burne Jones , was the gift of Dr Corfe , organist of the cathedral from 1846 to 1882 . The fenestration of Oxford Cathedral presents much variety . With munificent intention , Dean Duppa presented the church with a large quantity of stained glass . Of this seventeenth-century glass Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the west end of the north aisle representing Jonah sitting under the gourd contemplating Nineveh . It is more curious than beautiful , making the loss of the rest of this glass hardly a matter for regret . The other window , ascribed , though on insufficient evidence , to Van Linge , is that above the monument of Bishop King ? last abbot of Oseney and first bishop of Oxford ( d. 1557 ) ? in the south aisle of the choir . Inserted by two Canon Kings of Christ Church in the reign of Charles I. ? Henry , afterwards Bishop of Chichester , and his brother John ? it escaped destruction during the Puritan usurpation , by being taken out and secreted till the days of the Restoration , when decency and order having once more resumed their sway , the verger 's rod , still used , was made anew , and on it engraved that verse of the Psalms , " When the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion , then were we like unto them that dream . " Between 1871 and 1874 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeenth century had en12 ( CATHEDRALS : ENGLAND AND WALES dowed the church had their Perpendicular tracery restored , and a fifth bay and short aisleless vestibule were added to the nave , thus joining the church to the eastern side of the great quadrangle , from which a new entrance was made into it , besides other improvements . In the aisles of the nave and northern transept the windows , which were mostly Perpendicular insertions , had been gutted of their tracery to make room for Van Linge 's " landscape " stained glass , and transmuted into meagre " carpenter 's Gothic " affairs of two sharply pointed and uncusped lights . With the exception of one at the west end of the north aisle , these have all had their Perpendicular tracery restored to them by Sir Gilbert Scott , and been equipped with stained glass . The large five-light Perpendicular window in the north transept , which appears to have escaped the general seventeenth century impoverishment , was filled with stained glass some years ago . The three-light window at the east end of the baptistery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second bay of the south transept on its eastern side , is of great beauty , its reticulated tracery starting from considerably below the spring of the arch . It is filled with stained glass , some ancient fragments being worked up with the modern . Among the former we find the legend of St Martin sharing his cloak with a poor half-clothed beggar , to discover afterwards that it was Our Lord Himself whom he had clothed . In another medallion is St Augustine , the learned Doctor of the Church , while a third represents the Martyrdom of St Thomas a Becket , whose effigy was deprived of its head when Henry VIII . stupidly , for it // caused the loss of thousands of mediaeval art treasures , gave orders for the destruction of superstitious images or pictures . A fourth panel shows St Cuthbert holding in his hand the head of Oswald , king and saint , the greatest royal statesman before the Conquest . The length of the south transept is curtailed , its southern wall being divided into two stages . The lower forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemetery ; the upper , now a sacristy , was , until the last restoration , the verger 's residence . The Early English work here is of singular beauty . From this transept the view across the choir is a most picturesque one , embracing three avenues of columns , monumental effigies with gabled canopies , stained glass , and that tall structure rich in tabernacle work which stands beneath the easternmost bay , between the Lady and Latin Chapels . It had a double purpose , the upper part being intended as a watch chamber to see that no one approached the adjacent shrine of St Frideswyde for unholy purposes ; the lower serving as an altar tomb , the matrices of two brasses , a lady and gentleman of Henry VII . ' s time , pointing out its original use . At the Reformation , the shrine erected above the relics of the sainted Abbess went the way of such things ; but the remains were discovered not many years ago by mere chance , four of the largest pieces having formed the casing of a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered in the chtirchyard by the verger . The workmanship of these pieces is among the most lovely of the thirteenth century , and an eminent // botanist has recognised each of the plants , cleverly intermingled with birds in the design , as having its habitat near the Cherwell and Isis . Supplemented by modern work the shrine of St Frideswyde has been restored to what was no doubt its original place , immediately in front of the Mary Altar , the painted decorations on the groining and on the arches of the bay opposite the rich altar tomb of Elizabeth , Lady Montecute , indicating that this was the locality destined for it . In the Latin Chapel is some fine Late Perpendicular stall work , in all probability a portion of that with which Wolsey furnished the choir , and removed hence when Dean Duppa refitted it in the seventeenth century . The Chapter-house , entered from the eastern walk by a doorway of the richest Late Norman architecture , is a fine parallelogram in the Lancet phase of Early English , and in many respects resembles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tripled lancets , and the ribs of the simply groined vault spring from clustered shafts resting on corbelled heads . The great quintuplet of lancets at the east end is of singular beauty , the manner in which the three central ones , which are glazed , are divided at half their height into lesser lancets is very remarkable . Since the careful restoration to which it was subjected in 1880-81 , the Chapter-house at Oxford Cathedral is quite one of its gems . Until then it was divided into two equal parts by a solid wall , and fifty years ago one of these portions served as a refectory for the cathedral choristers . GLOUCESTER THE cathedral of Gloucester is more than ordinarily interesting , as being one of the very few conventual churches of the highest class which escaped the havoc of the Dissolution . In the different styles which it exhibits , singularities are to be found at Gloucester , not met with in any other church in this country , and their interest is enhanced by the knowledge that few English cathedrals have more authentic records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more satisfactorily investigated . It is , moreover , remarkable as having preserved its Norman ground plan almost entirely unchanged . The religious establishment at Gloucester connected with the Abbey Church of St Peter , is supposed to have been founded by Wulphere , King of Mercia , about the middle of the seventh century . The buildings of that period commenced by him were completed by Osric ( a Viceroy of King Etheldred ) for the use of nuns , and three abbesses are mentioned , under whose successive rule it continued until 767 . From that time until 821 , owing to civil wars and disturbances in 129 // the kingdom , the house seems to have been almost deserted . In 821 Bernulph , King of Mercia , repaired the buildings , and placed secular priests there in the room of its former occupants the nuns , which priests were afterwards expelled by Canute , and Benedictine monks introduced in 1022 when Edric was appointed Abbot . In 1058 Edric was succeeded by Wulfstan , who was consecrated by Aldred , Bishop of Worcester ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present buildings may be said to commence . A church was built by Aldred , Bishop of Worcester , and was consecrated by him and dedicated to St Peter . This structure is said to have been entirely burnt down , and to have been rebuilt by Abbot Serio , who completed his work in 1100 . Serlo 's church , of which a great portion remains to this day , must , in its original state , have been a remarkably grand and impressive , but severe piece of early post-Conquest work . It consisted of a spacious nave for the lay-folk , with arches supported on cylindrical pillars 30 feet high and 6 feet in diameter , low triforium , clerestory , and flat roof of wood ; of short transepts , with a polygonal chapel on the eastern side of each ; of a choir , formed as now under the central tower ; and of a polygonally terminated presbytery raised upon a crypt , and differing from the nave in having low bays opening into its aisles surmounted by a spacious triforium of the same depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisles and triforia were continued round the east end as at // Norwich , and from the ambulatory both above and below three chapels opened out . The Chapter-house , of which three compartments remain , was also of this period . During the twelfth century this Norman church was repeatedly damaged by fire , traces of which are still discernible on the huge cylindrical columns of the nave , which are all more or less calcined . In 1122 the town of Gloucester was burnt while the monks were singing their mass ; then came the fire in the upper part of the steeple and burnt the monastery , and all the treasures that were in it , except a few books and three Eucharistic vestments . It was not until the abbacy of Henry Foliet ( 1228-43 ) that the first great architectural change took place , the substitution of the present groined roof of the nave for the flat Norman one . Of simple , yet good Early English character , it was completed in 1242 . Its material is a light porous kind of stone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a view to polychromatic decoration . The groining ribs spring from two tiers of Early English shafts in graceful clusters of three . The upper series is on a level with the triforium , while the lower , corbelled off upon heads , serious and grotesque , extends downwards into the spandrils of the arches . From the traces of colour and gilding that have been discovered upon these shafts , as well as upon the bosses and ribs of the vault , it would appear that these features were once profusely decorated . // Early in the fifteenth century , Abbot Morwent lengthened the nave by about 20 feet . The former Lady Chapel was erected between 1224 and 1227 by Ralph de Wilintone and his wife , the only portions of which now remaining are the Early English windows in the crypt , inserted in the Norman work . During the abbacy of John Thokey ( 1306-29 ) the whole exterior of the south aisle of the nave was erected with the exception of the lower part of the wall , which , with the half-piers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The roof was also revaulted . Edward II . was brought here by Abbot Thokey for interment , when , from fear of Queen Isabella and her party , Bristol , Kingswood , and Malmesbury refused to receive his body . As it turned out , this was a politic stroke on the part of Thokey , but of all strange forms of devotion , surely one of the strangest was that which saw a saint and martyr in King Edward II. , yet to that abnormal worship the greater part of the transepts and choir of the church owe their present form . Works of a novel character commenced in the south transept soon after the king 's burial . There was a simple massive Norman church to be dealt with which , it was determined , should not be pulled down , but transformed by the removal of windows ; and by replacing the old Norman clerestory of the choir by one which should give greater dignity and grandeur to the most sacred part of the church . When it is remembered that that mighty wall of // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1350 , the choir of Gloucester Cathedral must be regarded as the very incunabula of Perpendicular . The north transept assumed its present form between 1368 and 1373 . The cloisters were in progress from 1350 to 1412 . The west front , the two western bays of the nave and the south porch , the work of'Abbot Morwent , were completed at the time of his death in 1437 . The tower was first under the care of Abbot Seabroke ( 1450-57 ) , who removed the Norman one , and afterwards under that of a monk named Tully , by whom in 1457 it was completed . The latest work is the Lady Chapel , which is so skilfully attached to the choir that it hardly obstructs the light from the great east window , the west end of the chapel being contracted in breadth and height so as to form a vestibule . The curious passage or thoroughfare under the east end of the chapel is easily explained . When the present Lady Chapel was built , towards the end of the fifteenth century , it was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as may be seen by tracing the lines of the old walls . The passage was then constructed so that it was possible to pass from the north to the south of the grounds without going round the end of the cathedral . On 2nd January , 1540 , the abbey was surrendered to Henry VIII . by the Prior , Gabriel Morton . Fortunately , however , Gloucester was one of the places named as seats for the six new bishoprics . In 1541 a Bishop ( John Wakeman , the last Abbot of Tewkesbury ) , a Dean , and Prebendaries were appointed , and the church rededicated to the Holy and // Undivided Trinity . Gloucester Cathedral had another narrow escape during the Commonwealth . Its total destruction was intended , and the persons who designed it had agreed among themselves for their several proportions . The work of destroying the Little Cloister and of the Lady Chapel had begun , and instruments and tackle had been provided for taking down the tower , but , owing to the exertions of Mr Dorney , and the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was presented to the Mayor and Burgesses in 1657 . At Gloucester , where the style seems to have sprung into existence on the spot , and is worked in a spirit totally different from that at Canterbury , Winchester , and York , the ogee arch is triumphant everywhere in the fourteenth and fifteenth century work . Inside , there are the flying arches across the main arches of the tower . Outside , we have the bold ogee , which forms the label over the vast east window ; the ogee label over the west window ; and the ogee arch which overrides the parapet of the south porch ? both Morwent 's work ; the ogee heads on Seabroke 's central tower , and the Singers ' Galleries , and ogee cusping in the windows throughout . At Gloucester , as at Worcester and Salisbury , the flying arches which pass through the windows of the transepts are conspicuous in the view . There is abundant evidence of the fact that in bygone days Gloucester Cathedral was celebrated for its bells . There was a bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign , and documents , now in the possession of the Dean and Chapter of Ely , tell // us that Master John of Gloucester cast four bells for the octagonal lantern of that cathedral in 1345 . It would appear that at the dissolution of the abbey , the bells were allowed to remain , for an indenture ( A.D. 1553 ) between the King 's Commissioners and the Bishop of Worcester and Gloucester ( John Hooper ) , shows that " the seid Commission have redelyvered unto the Deane and Chapter one great bell whereon the clock strykithe , and eight other bells whereuppon the chyme goeth . " We may presume that the two hymns , Christe Redemptor ' and Chorus novae Hierusalem , ' were played up to 1680 , to which date the present chimes can be traced . The four tunes now played by the Gloucester bells are set in the key of C minor . One of these melodies was composed by Stephen Jeffries , organist of the cathedral from 1680 to 1712 . He is buried in the eastern walk of the cloisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawkins tells us that " there is a Gloucester tradition that Mrs Jeffries ( to cure her husband of the habit of staying late at the tavern ) drest up a fellow in a winding sheet , with directions to meet him with a candle in the cloisters , through which he had to pass on the way home ; but that on attempting to terrify him , Jeffries only expressed his wonder by saying , I thought all you ghosts had been in bed afore this time ! ' " With one of these " solemn tunes " lingering in the ears , let us enter the awe-inspiring Norman nave with its " antique columns massy proof , " and its stained glass , which , if not altogether of the highest order , // confers that " dim religious light " so essential to the enjoyment of a Gothic interior . Seven arcades of the nave are Serlo 's work , while the two most westernly form part of that great scheme of re-edification contemplated by Abbot Morwent . In the aisle on the north side of the nave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , except that the Norman framework of these windows has been filled with Perpendicular tracery , this aisle has retained its original character very completely , the roof being a particularly fine specimen of late eleventh-century vaulting . In the south aisle the Norman vaulting shafts remain , but the groining was altered to Decorated work ? part of it rich in the ball-flower ornament , when Abbot Thokey added his exterior wall with its series of niched buttresses and range of windows , which is perhaps unequalled as such by any other in England . The best windows of the series are the two historical ones representing the Coronation of Henry III . in the Abbey of Gloucester , and the interment there of Edward II . The glass in the two Perpendicular windows at the west end of this aisle is excellent , as is most of that in the north aisle , despite a certain want of uniformity . In the third and fifth windows the student of mediaeval glass will find some pieces admirably restored . In the clerestory there still lurk some fragments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west front above the doorway is a fine specimen of early fifteenth-century Perpendicular , and the work of Abbot Morwent . The window over the western arch of the tower ? an unusual position for one , but 138 ( ' AT11E1 ) RALS : ENGLAND AND WALES rendered necessary in this case by the choir being 20 feet higher than the nave , is filled with old glass collected from various parts of the cathedral . The last bay of the nave is occupied by the organscreen , a very favourable specimen of the Perpendicular of 1823 . The present reredos , consisting of three sculptured groups beneath spiral canopies , was completed in 1873 . The splendid sedilia ? four on the south side , with rich but mutilated canopies ? were restored in 1873 , and statues placed in niches above the canopies . At Gloucester the eastern bay of the choir on either side inclines outwards to allow of the great east window being erected on part of the outer wall of the original Norman apse which was removed in 1337 . The bases and lower parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norman . apse were discovered during the restorations of 1870-73 . ' They still remain beneath the floor . In making these investigations some fragments of the old reredos were discovered , together with the curious sunk area ? a feretrum for relics , probably ? behind it ( with the steps leading to the same ) , from which was an entrance to the space beneath the high altar . In the vault above it are two circular apertures through which , according to some authorities , the monks drew up with wire or ropes on Holy Thursday , the representation of Our Lord 's Ascension into heaven , whilst a chant was sung . Brereton , in his " Travels " ( temp . Charles I. ) , however , says that " over the higher end of the quire in the false roof , there is still remaining a round hole so contrived as that the Holy Ghost in the shape of a dove // seemed to descend even over the high altar ; upon whose lighting flames of fire ascended from a close concave place about four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed beyond the high altar , and furnished with pitch , resin , and other combustible matter , and you may behold the walls smoked over as a chimney . " The largest in the country is the east window of Gloucester Cathedral , which is 72 feet high by 38 wide . But the great wall is partially unglazed , owing to the peculiar construction of the retrochoir and the Lady Chapel beyond . How admirably these enormous lights lend themselves to the arrangement and effect of stained glass is nowhere more evident than here . It was completed not later than 1350 . The general design of the figure work , whose brilliant tinctures flash forth like jewels from the surrounding white glass , is the Enthronement of the Blessed Virgin , and the shields of arms are those of various warriors who had served in the campaign of Cressy . It was conscientiously and conservatively restored in 1862 . The stained glass in the lofty four-light windows of the clerestory on either side is chiefly modern . The effect is excellent . The vaulting in the choir of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute network , in which the figures of the ribs is everything and the forms of the intervening spaces nothing . A narrow passage behind and below the glazing of the great east window , and forming a corridor between the northern and southern triforia , is called the Whispering Gallery , mentioned , as a curiosity , by Lord Bacon . The present reredos formed part of Sir Gilbert 1 10 c ; ' I'III.:I ) ItAI.S : h:N ( , LANI ) AND WAl , FS Scott 's designs for the . partial rearrangement of the choir , whose superinduced Perpendicular work hangs visibly like a robe upon the original Norman body . The stalls and canopies retain their ancient place beneath the central tower , and the organ in its handsome Caroline case has been suffered to remain upon the screen where its woodwork harmonises admirably with that of the stalls below . These with their canopies were carefully restored , and as the old desk fronts and subsella ; had disappeared , new ones were designed , use being made of some remains which had found their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also as a part of the work . Of course many condemn the organ because it hinders the vista . But without this break the view looking east at Gloucester would be nothing indeed . Originally built in 1670 by Harris in conjunction with his son Renatus , it was repaired by Bernard Smith before 1683 , considerably enlarged in 1847 , and since then has undergone improvement at various times . Gloucester was the last organistship held by Samuel Sebastian Wesley . He died on the 19th April , 1896 , at his residence in Old Palace Yard , and his last words were " Let me see the sky , " a fitting request from a man of such high ideals and noble inspirations . The lightness and strength of the flying arches between the tower and the transepts should be noticed as wonderful examples of constructive skill . They are not merely ornamental adjuncts , for by them a great portion of the weight of the groining is borne . It is in the Norman crypt of about 1080 , which is entered from the south transept and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can best realise what the original plan of the east end of the cathedral was : viz. , an apse with three small apsidal chapels radiating from the ambulatory , and two chapels east of either transept . Above each of these chapels were two others ; that immediately over the eastern chapel was removed during the Perpendicular alterations . IIere we find segmental or elliptical Norman arches with others also Norman , built beneath them for support , and the groining of the vault ribbed . In the south-eastern chapel is a rich Norman arcade . The aisles and ambulatories of the eastern limb , in which , from the Perpendicular screen work thrown across the low Norman arcades opening from them into the choir , there is a peculiar feeling of isolation , show , together with the triforia , the original plain Norman work . All the windows have , however , been enlarged , and filled with Decorated or Perpendicular tracery , chiefly with an internal cusping only , as is the case with the great east window . St Andrew 's Chapel , which opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ancient reredos , in which the sculpture has been restored and the whole clothed with colour . St Paul 's Chapel , correspondingly placed on the north side , and like that of St Andrew approached by picturesque flights of steps , has also a reredos which was one of the most perfect as regards repair in the cathedral . The figures of Saints Peter , Paul , and Luke now fill the niches . St Philip 's Chapel in the south ambulatory has been coloured , and stained glass inserted in the windows . // The subjects are figures of- saints , with small illustrations below from their lives , or miracles . Except St Peter , St Philip , and St George , all the figures are those of English saints , the black Benedictine habits of St Augustine and the Venerable Bede being admirably treated . A truly graceful piece of work carried out during the abbacies of Hanley and his successor Farley ( 1457-98 ) , the Lady Chapel at Gloucester forms a fit comble to that series of architectural triumphs which had been in almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vestibule , which is lower and narrower than the rest of the building , is vaulted with pendents in the form of a cross . In the Chapel itself , the fine Perpendicular roof , with its net-like ribs meeting in bosses of foliage ; the tabernacle work of the reredos ; the ancient stained glass in the nine-light window which completely fills the east end ; the transept-like side chapels with elegant fan traceried vaulting , partly supported by flying arches like those in the choir ; all these excite our veneration and wonder , as does the whole of this extraordinary cathedral , at every step . It is almost a relief to turn from this rich feast of Perpendicular work , with its wealth of wall and window decoration , to a simple yet exquisitely graceful piece of Early Thirteenth Century work in the north transept , whose real use has afforded opportunities for disputation between antiquaries and ecclesiologists , some being of opinion that it was intended for a reliquary , while others incline to the belief that it was a lavatory , a not unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the north side of the nave ? a not very usual position in England , and of their style are the finest and most perfect in the country . Commenced in 1351 , and finished in 1412 , the to the arrangement of the buttresses and the projecting shelf of stone connected with the transoms of the windows , which appears to have been devised as a protection from the weather ; for the lower half of the windows was not glazed . In the southern walk are twenty cells or recesses for study called the Carols , and on . the north side is the Lavatory , with screens for towels ? conveniences placed near the refectory , which stood on the north side of the cloister . The chief glory of these cloisters at Gloucester is , of course , that fan vaulting which was nowhere carried to greater perfection during the Third Age of Pointed architecture than in England . The Chapter-house , a noble parallelogram , partly Norman , with a barrel-vaulted roof , and partly Perpendicular , also richly groined , opens out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Gloucester , as at Canterbury , we may study with more advantage than elsewhere in the country the domestic arrangements and ground-plan of a great Benedictine house . HEREFORD 1 TF.REFORD Cathedral is dedicated to St Ethelbert , King of East Anglia , who was murdered about the year 793 by his intended father-in-law , Offa , the great King of Mercia . At that time Hereford was known as Fernleigh , and hither the body of the murdered king was conveyed for interment in a wooden church by a pious noble , one Brithfrid . About 830 the church was rebuilt in stone by Milfrid , ruler of Mercia , in honour of the now sainted martyr , and some two hundred years later was rebuilt by Bishop Athelstan , in the time of Edward the Confessor . This structure , however , had but a brief existence , being burnt in 1056 by Griffin , the Welsh king , who slew Leofgan , the bishop , and many of his clergy . Two Lothringians succeeded Leofgan in the episcopal stool at Hereford ? Walter de Lorraine ( 1061-79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1076-95 ) appointed by the Conqueror . The latter undertook the reconstruction of the cathedral- which which had lain in ruins since Griffin 's invasion . Robert of T , orraine 's work , whatever shape it took , was utterly ? l , litcrated by Reynelm , who held the See from 1107 145 // to 1115 . This prelate commenced a new cathedral on the plan as now existing , but being left during the t r ? ublous reign of Stephen in a very unfinished state , it was not taken up again until the time of his third successor in the See , Robert de Bethune , who gave it its present Norman form . This church at Hereford differed from the type usually employed , both in plan and detail . The eight bays of its Norman nave are quite unlike anything produced contemporaneously , while the choir ends in a rectangle , a nobly moulded Norman arch rising as high as the string-course below the clerestory , beyond which was a separate and narrow apse . Each aisle terminated in a semicircle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this early twelfth-century cathedral , all that remains to us is the nave arcade , the south transept , the arch opening from the north transept into the choir aisle , and the choir itself as far as the spring of the clerestory . All this work is carried out in a style of richness that seems to have made itself generally felt in this part of the country . On the removal of the flooring in 1847 , with the view of restoring the pavement of the nave to its original level , it was found that the Norman columns , instead of resting on circular bases of small projections , were placed on bold square ones , which had been concealed under the modern paving . These , when opened to the original level , gave an unusually fine proportion to the massive Norman pier range of the nave , though the piers when buried had presented a depressed and stumpy appearance . // Nor was this the only discovery . The small plinths which served as bases to the double semi-cylindrical face-shafts , formerly running up the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original ones having been removed to make way for an incongruous triple vaulting shaft . During the episcopate of William de Vere , who ruled from 1186 to 1199 , the three apses were entirely removed , and an eastern aisle or procession path , built to communicate with a Lady Chapel . This work was carried out in the style transitional between Norman and Early English , as shown by the two circular pillars supporting the groined roof of the procession path , and a lancet window in the north and south walls at the west end of the Lady Chapel . Conceived in a spirit of refinement , it was to be excelled only thirty years later , when the present Lady Chapel , of the richest and most graceful Early English character , and raised upon a crypt , the last instance of one in England , was carried out ( c. 1220 ) as an extension of De Vere 's Lady Chapel , whose eastern wall , apsidal or otherwise , was , of course , removed . In so felicitous a manner was this done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the Transitional grew out of the Norman , and the Early English in its turn from the Transitional , be more easily studied than . in this fascinating eastern part of Hereford Cathedral . The unsettling and sinking of the tower having damaged the original clerestory and vaulting of the choir ? for , to judge from the great pilasters between the arcades , it must have been vaulted ? it was found // necessary to rebuild those portions . Accordingly this was carried out , in all probability , between 1250 and 1260 , and in a more advanced style of Early English than the Lady Chapel . The windows in the north and south clerestory are composed of two lights , under a pointed head , the space above them being pierced " plate-tracery " - wise , with a quatrefoil . Additional grace is lent to them , viewed from within , by a light open arcade , forming what is termed an " inner plane of tracery , " and introduced to take off some of the sombre effect that the deep splay , necessitated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall space above the eastern arch , above which runs a row of blind arcades , three lancets were employed , but those we see now are modern works , having been substituted for a debased Perpendicular window . Some work of re-edification must have been in progress at Hereford almost without intermission from the end of the twelfth to the middle of the fourteenth century , for hardly had the choir received its present clerestory , when the Norman north transept was removed , and replaced towards the close of Bishop d'Acquablanca 's episcopate ( 1230-68 ) with that unique piece of geometrical Decorated work , which , in its windows and pier arches , exhibits the peculiarity of a curvature so slight as to give the appearance of two straight lines meeting at an angle . The eastern side of this transept is furnished with an aisle of two bays , wherein stands that gem of sepulchral architecture , the pedestal or throne , which in pre-Reformation times supported the shrine of Thomas de Cantilupe , Bishop of Hereford from 1275 to 1282 , and the last Englishman // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows of three lights each , of almost preternatural elongation . The six-light northern window is a noble conception , but the tracery is quite sui generis , and , like that in the side windows , must be considered curious rather than actually beautiful . Truly exquisite is the diapering of the spandrels in the triforium arcade , whose triangular arches ? the dominant form here ? although graceful , would hardly bear repetition in a long array . A chamber stands above the eastern aisle of this transept , intended in all probability for the custodian of the Cantilupe Shrine , the Purbeck marble pedestal of which ? a good specimen of Early Decorated art ? is enriched with military statuettes explanatory of Cantilupe 's position as Grand Master of the English Templars , and carefully chosen foliaged ornament in the spandrels of its trefoiled arcades . Twice during the sixteenth century was this shrine translated : first , to its former place in the Lady Chapel , and again , back to its present or e in the eastern aisle of the north transept . The south transept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been the happy hunting ground of successive series of builders . The east wall is entirely Norman , and in the clerestory windows may be seen the stained glass which was formerly in the central lancet at the east end of the choir . A large Perpendicular window has been inserted in the south wall of this transept , and another with panelling round it in the western one . The late groining which springs from corbelled shafts is very fine // and bold , and , combined with the four Norman stages into which the eastern side of the transept is divided , gives this part of the church much dignity and interest . The Decorated period greatly enriched Hereford Cathedral owing , in an eminent degree , to the offerings made at the shrine of St Thomas de Cantilupe , whose canonisation took place thirty-eight years after his death , viz. , in 1320 . It is to a date somewhat subsequent to that period , that we must assign the graceful cinquefoil headed doorway leading from the north porch into the nave , likewise the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eastern transepts . Like those at Wells the eastern transepts at Hereford are only commensurate in height with the aisles , but they certainly assist with the central tower , north transept , and deeply projecting Lady Chapel , in composing a delightful assemblage of objects . With the construction of the fourteenthcentury eastern transepts and their aisles , Bishop de Vere 's original termination to the choir aisles vanished , but his portion of walling in the western bay of the Lady Chapel , which now appears inside the building , was suffered to remain . Unaware of the fact , the visitor is at first puzzled at , and then delighted with , that unglazed lancet which , with its rich mouldings and graceful shafts , forms so valuable a specimen of that age of our architecture when the Norman had not fully given way to the perfected English Pointed . The choir with its aisles and transepts , the great transept and the Lady Chapel have been completely and genuinely restored . // The introduction of the gorgeous metal choir screen enriched with enamel work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is , like that at Lichfield , endowed with much gracefulness and originality of conception . This screen , which is raised upon a plinth of polished Devonshire marble , formed an interesting item in the Great Exhibition of 1862 . The reredos , a solid screen of stone and marble , of five gabled compartments , containing small sculptured groups , stands within the rich Norman arch which divides the choir and procession path . In Transitional days this arch was partially filled up by a cylindrical pillar with a boldly foliaged capital , one of two serving to carry the vaulting of the procession path . This pillar bore a spandrel which had the effect of converting the Norman arch that I have alluded to , into two pointed ones , though their supporting pillar stands just to the rear of and not within it . Until the dismantling of the choir this graceful feature was hidden behind the ponderous Grecian altar-piece , and when discovered the spandrel was plain . Its enrichment being thought desirable , it was completely covered with sculpture representing the Saviour in Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niche , Ethelbert , while the remaining space was covered with angels in adoration of the Majesty , and small quatrefoils containing the Evangelistic Symbols . The general effect of this piece of sculpture , combined with the charming view into the exquisite Early English Lady Chapel , is extremely rich . // The organ , by Renatus Harris ( a gift of King Charles II. ) was rebuilt under the superintendence of Sir Frederick Ouseley . The old seventeenth-century pulpit still happily remains , being located against the north-western pier of the tower . The massive and dignified central tower , to which the angle buttresses and pinnacles lend such character , may be assigned to the early part of the fourteenthcentury , as testified by that abundant use of the ball flower ornament which imparts so curiously stippled a texture , yet which is. vastly agreeable . In some respects of detail , this tower at Hereford may be compared with its slenderer contemporary at Salisbury . Of Perpendicular work , late but good , Hereford Cathedral presents examples in Bishop Audley 's chantry which projects from the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parvise porch , which so well prepares the mind for the solemnities of the interior ; the entrance to the College of Vicars Choral ; and the Cloisters , of which the eastern and southern ambulatories alone remain . The ancient west front , which appears to have resembled that of Rochester Cathedral , was surmounted by a tower 130 feet high , and , as far as one can judge by the plate in Browne Willis ' Survey ( 1718 ) , featured the central one . Both towers are represented in that work crowned with leaden spires . On Easter Monday , 1786 , the western tower of Hereford fell . It was the old story : the piling up of later work on a foundation not designed to receive it : the substitution , during the reign of Henry VI. , of a Perpendicular window in lieu of the three original // Norman ones ; and subsequent neglect of necessary repairs . In its fall the tower greatly injured the first bay of the nave , and to repair the damage the Dean and Chapter requisitioned the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content with removing all traces of the west front , shortened the nave by one bay , and destroyed the Norman triforium and clerestory of that part which had escaped injury , replacing it by the feeble work we now see . Shorn of its proper length , with its miserable " Gothic " west front , clerestory , and lowered roofs , Hereford Cathedral remained until 1841 , when the work of restoring it was commenced , under Dean Merewether , who was assiduous in bringing back something of its pristine splendour . At this period the beautiful north transept was used as the parish church of St John the Baptist . The central tower was in such a state of ruin as to make an absolute repair necessary for its preservation . This work . accomplished between 1842 and 1846 , ranked among the most stupendous engineering feats of the age . The cathedral was reopened on the 30th June , 1863 , after more than twenty years ' disuse of one part or another . Since that most interesting and auspicious June day , various works of reparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite recently in the substitution of a new west front ? minus the tower ? from the designs of Mr John Oldrid Scott , for Wyatt 's feeble perpetration . It has been carried out in the Decorated style , and , together with the stained glass in its seven-light window ? a splendid // piece of work in which small canopied figures of British saints play a conspicuous part ? commemorates the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria , whose effigy , crowned and vested in the cope as worn at her coronation , occupies the bottom of the central light . WORCESTER THIS cathedral is one of the New Foundation ; that is to say , it had been served by monks until its reconstitution with secular canons by Henry VIII . upon the dissolution of the Benedictine house , of which it formed the imposing church . It is built in the form of a patriarchal cross , without aisles to its principal transept , but with a secondary or eastern transept . The best view obtainable is from the south-west , on the opposite side of the Severn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monastic buildings and the prebendal houses , group very pleasingly . Worcester Cathedral is mainly the work of three periods of architecture ? Early English , Decorated and Perpendicular , though fragments of preceding churches are considerably in evidence here and there ; e.g. , that of St Wulfstan . On the day that Wulfstan began the work of rebuilding the tenth-century church of St Oswald , he was observed by one of his monks standing in silent sadness in the corner of the cemetery . The monk expostulated with him : " Surely , " he said , " you ought rather to rejoice that such things can be 157 , . // done for your church in your time ; that buildings are now erected in a style of beauty and splendour unknown to our fathers . " " I judge differently , " said Wulfstan ; " we are pulling down the labours of holy men , that we may gain honour and reputation to ourselves . The good old time was , when men knew not how to build magnificent piles , but thought any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves a willing sacrifice to God . It is a miserable change if we neglect the souls of men , and pile together stones . " Wulfstan 's building , begun in 1084 , had , as was customary at that epoch , a choir , which terminated a little to the east of King John 's tomb in an apse , with an aisle carried round it . From the south transept we enter the crypt , a relic of St Wulfstan 's church , and wonderfully perfect in its design and preservation , the unique and beautiful arrangement of the Norman arcades and vaulting of its apsidal east end presenting some curious analogies with , and probably giving the idea for , the vaulting of Chapter-houses with central columns which became so beautiful and distinctive a feature of English cathedral buildings . One peculiarity in the vaulting of this crypt at Worcester is that the ribs visible beneath are formed in plaster over rough cores left purposely on the masonry to receive the arch . The division of this crypt into four aisles is productive of some most delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaults . A succession of accidents in the shape of storms and fires befell this Norman cathedral at Worcester , the last occurring in 1202 , after which it was almost lht ) CATII IE:DRALS : ENGLAND AND WALES entirely rebuilt . King John , who visited the city in 1208 , contributed three hundred marks for the repair of the new building , nearly all traces of which disappeared in successive rebuildings in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries . Nine years later , in accordance with his own wish , King John was buried in front of the high altar , on either side of which , but a little in advance , stood the shrines of St Oswald and St Wulfstan , whose relics the church of Worcester had the good fortune to possess . As years rolled on , these hallowed treasures increased in attractiveness . The tombs of the two departed saints became the accredited centres of miraculous agencies , and drew to themselves ever-increasing crowds of votaries , desiring not only an interest in the holy men 's intercessions , but still more , a share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the divinely appointed channels to suffering humanity . To accommodate these vast throngs , as well as to give due honour to the Blessed Virgin , whose cult may be said to have received a great impetus early in the thirteenth century under the pontificate of Innocent III. , a greatly extended eastern limb was necessary and the then bishop , William of Blois , determined to rebuild the old Norman choir on a greatly extended plan , commencing with the three bays beyond the present eastern transept , part of which forms the Lady Chapel . Contemporaneous as it is with the highest developments of mediaeval architecture , in which among many other forms " the fresh exuberant life , the daring and devotion of the age , found one means of // expression , " this grandly expanded choir of Worcester will never cease to command our admiration and delight , much of its beauty and richness being due to the profits derived from the offerings of the faithful at the two shrines . The Norman crypt is co-extensive with the choir only as far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having ceased before Bishop William of Blois began his new work at the east end in 1224 , no further extension was made to it . The result is that the pavement of the eastern transept and Lady Chapel being on the same level as that part of the church westward of the central tower , the groups of clustered shafts forming the columns that support the arches of the three easternmost bays are several feet taller than those in the choir itself . The triforium and clerestory throughout this part of the cathedral are , however , uniform in height , the string-courses dividing them being all kept at the same level . There is one feature here which imparts an air of unusual richness allied with stability to the whole , and that is the triforium . In most English Gothic buildings this story is open , showing the rough lean-to roofs of the aisles . At Worcester , on the contrary , this is not the case , the arcades having a wall behind them enriched with lancets on slender shafts , just sufficient room being left between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that the whole of the east end , with its two tiers of lancet windows , is modern . After the extension of the choir the next great work undertaken at Worcester was the reconstruction of the // Norman nave , which , from such portions still extant as shafts and capitals , and a series of arched recesses in the south aisle , would appear to have belonged to the first three-quarters of the twelfth century . Towards the close of the same century the two present western bays were built . These two bays are most curious and valuable specimens of Transitional work , their arcades opening to the aisles having slender shafts with capitals just indicating the approach of foliage , and pointed arches very simply moulded . The triforium stage , which is very lofty , comprises three narrow compartments with arches composed entirely of zigzag ornament united beneath one pointed arch , and very closely walled up behind ; while in the clerestory is one wider round-arched opening having a lesser pointed one on either side of it . Of the remaining seven bays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . They are Decorated , and date from the episcopate of Bishop Cobham ( 1317-27 ) , the columns being composed of a number of slender shafts with capitals of deeply undercut leafage , running wreath-like round the pier , and recalling in ensemble those in the contemporary nave of the cathedral of Troyes in Champagne . The southern arcade was not begun until about 1360 , and a deterioration in the work here is perceptible , the shafts being taller , fewer and more slender , and the foliaging being confined to their capitals . For grace and richness , the northern arcade of the nave at Worcester is , I think , unsurpassed by any contemporary work of the kind , and a particularly fine view is obtainable of it from the south-western pier of the tower . Both these Decorated sides of the nave are , as regards // their arcades , a little loftier than the Transitional ones to the west of them , but the triforium and clerestory of the two portions are kept parallel by the stringcourse separating them . The interior of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process which revealed not only the pink sandstone of its arcades and upper stages , but the white oolite from Bredon , and the green stone from Higley composing the material of its roof . Indeed , few English cathedrals present so charming an example of natural polychromy as the nave of Worcester . At the same time , the sculpture in the triforium arcades which had been sadly mutilated was restored to something of its pristine beauty . The stately porch which opens out of the north aisle exactly in its centre , is due to Bishop Wakefield . The restored statuary is a work of our own day . From the next bay but one projects a small Late Decorated chapel . It is styled the Jesus Chapel , and until 1899 formed the baptistery ; the font is of a Late Decorated character , and equipped with a spiral canopy after the model of the celebrated one at Ufford , near Wood  - -  bridge . It is stationed at the west end of the south aisle , where it looks remarkably well . The Jesus Chapel is separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rood and attendant figures , and is furnished with an altar , above which is a wooden retabulum of five openings , almost life-size figures of the Blessed Virgin and Child occupying the centre , and small scenes from the Life of Christ , the sides . Of ancient stained glass , there are a few remains in // the second , fourth , fifth , and sixth windows of the south aisle . The cores of the piers supporting the tower are Norman , veiled in Late Decorated work , the slender shafts from which the four great arches rise being similar in character to those on the south side of the nave . Standing exactly in the centre of the church the tower of Worcester Cathedral , completed in 1374 , is a noble object , despite the flaying process it has undergone at various times within the last two centuries . Of the statues with which it was originally enriched , but six remain , the rest being works of the period comprised between 1860 and 1870 , as are the parapet and pinnacles , which replace others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but dating only from the beginning of the eighteenth century . In 1873 a magnificent peal of twelve bells , each bearing upon the waist the name of an apostle , and cast by Taylor of Loughborough , was placed in the tower mainly through the exertions of Canon Cattley . The largest bell , Peter ( in the key of D flat ) , weighs 50 cwt. ; the smallest , Matthias ( in the key of A flat ) , 6 cwt. 3 qrs. 19 lbs . In addition to these , a new great hour bell , whose key is D flat , and which weighs 90 cwt. , was provided also a set of chimes , which play every third hour , thereby adding greatly to the cheerfulness of the city . The transepts , which project but one bay beyond the line of the aisles , still retain a good deal of Norman work in the lower stages of their walls , but they have // undergone changes both as regards their fenestration and vaulting at different periods , the latter dating most probably from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern apse still remains embedded in the wall , while the southern one was reopened in 1862 into the Early English chapel of St John , coincident with the first two bays of the choir aisle on that side . In the staircase turret which projects with singular prominence into the northern transept at its north-west angle , the North-Italian effect produced by the employment of cream-coloured and green stones is very noticeable . While dignified , the nave-triforium at Worcester is remarkably simple . Indeed , as regards enrichment , it is far more reticent than the Early English triforium in the choir . Richness appears to have been sought by the introduction into the tympana of the main arches , of small sculptured figures , once much mutilated , but now restored . In the clerestory , the Late Decorated arrangement of the arcades follows that of the transitional bays very closely , the tall central one through which the window appears having a somewhat depressed head . The nave was groined in 1377 by Bishop Wakefield throughout . Students of the precincts of a New Foundation cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Worcester : as , for instance , in the refectory , now the King 's School : the Guesten Hall , and the imposing Late Gothic gateway through which the Close ? " the boundaries " of Mrs Henry Wood 's " Helstonleigh " ? is entered from the eastern part of the city . Connecting these interesting relics of the // monastery with the church , are large Perpendicular cloisters , whose lierne vaulting , enriched with bosses of figures and foliage , is excellent . The framework of the windows giving on to the garth is modern , replacing some inferior work of the eighteenth century . In the richly quatre-foiled splay of each window may be seen a squinch , introduced as a means of communication for the monks , as they wrote or studied , without their being obliged to leave their places ; all were isolated , and yet in a moment any monk had the power of gaining any information he might require from any of his companions as he sat at work . The monks ' and the prior 's doors may still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern walk , respectively . Here is the lavatory of the monks . The slype , a narrow passage running alongside the first two bays of the nave , affords a means of communication between the cloisters and the ground at the west end of the cathedral . The entrance to the cloisters from College Green is by a Late Norman door , richly moulded , and springing from four receding shafts . No one should overlook this entrance , it is quite one of the gems of the cathedral , and forms a specimen of that refinement to which the AngloNorman style had been brought towards the middle of the twelfth century , in this part of the country . There is another and narrower slype between the south transept and the Chapter-house , which is entered from the eastern walk of the cloisters . This was originally a circular Norman structure , which , becoming ruinous from the thrust of the vaulting , was altered , and given an octagonal plan externally by an // architect of the Perpendicular period . He went to work in a particularly scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building projecting buttresses at the angles , adding windows and vaulting in the style of his period , but preserving the internal Norman wall , central column , and part of the original vault . The walls behind the interlacing arcades under the windows are constructed in an elaborate polychromatic treatment of masonry in green and white freestone , which is almost unique in this country , and certainly unequalled by any extant examples of such class of so early a date . No records exist relating to the arrangement of the cathedral during the Commonwealth , but we are told in the Townsend MS. that at six o'clock in the morning of 31st August , 1660 , the first service in the body of the church , according to ancient custom , was performed by Mr Rd . Brown ; and on 2nd September ? " There was a very great assembly at morning prayer , by six in the morning , and at nine o'clock there appeared again at prayers all the gentry , many citizens and others numerous , and after prayers Dr Doddeswell , a new prebendary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prebend begin to resettle the church in its service and also to repair the same by degrees , which hardly ? 10,000 will put the whole fabrick in that order it was before the barbarous civil wars . " The work of restoring Worcester Cathedral was begun in 1867 , when the choir between the tower and the eastern transept was restored , re-decorated and adapted to a more stately ritual , and thrown open to the // nave and aisles for congregational purposes . The work was carried on almost without intermission until the spring of 1874 , and the restored cathedral was reopened with a series of imposing services on Wednesday in Easter week , 8th April , 1874 . ELY EVERY English cathedral has some one feature by which we distinguish it from the rest . At Ely it is the central octagon , which with its curiously suspended lantern was devised by one whose powers have seldom been surpassed . He was a monk of the convent , but nevertheless an engineer of conspicuous ability , as any one who has examined this cathedral will allow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his engineering power ; and so it came about , that when the ancient central tower fell down in the fourteenth century , there was an architect on the spot who was competent to turn the loss into a gain , and to make the fall of the Norman tower an occasion of rejoicing , adding , as it did , its principal glory to the building . It was thus that the octagon had its birth , and that Ely Cathedral became what it is . Ely Cathedral occupies the site of a monastery , founded in the year 673 by Etheldreda , the daughter of Anna , King of East Anglia , who died in 679 of a sore throat , and when she was lying on her death-bed , she thought this infliction had been sent upon her as a punishment for the pride and pleasure which she had taken in former days in wearing a beautiful necklace . 170 // There does not appear to be any record extant relating to the structure of St Etheldreda 's Church , but in all probability it was of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have existed about two hundred years , being destroyed about the middle of the ninth century during a dreadful invasion of the Danes . It was replaced a century later by another church , of which we know nothing whatever . The foundation was then changed from a nunnery to a monastery of Benedictine monks . Soon after the Conquest , a Norman abbot was appointed ? Simeon by name ? a quiet , studious person , with whose rule the architectural history of the present church may be said to commence . The only portions now existing of Simeon 's work is the lowest stage of either transept , where the . stout circular piers and the incipient volute are sufficient indications of its early character . Simeon died in 1093 at the age of one hundred years , after which the abbey was vacant for seven years . During that interval , or under his immediate successor Richard , the choir was begun . It terminated in an aisleless apse , but of this Norman choir the only remains are the two great shafts which communicated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Early English and Decorated portions of the present long eastern limb . The work of building the Norman presbytery must have made rapid progress , for on St Etheldreda 's Day , 17th October , 1106 , the remains of that saint and her sisters were translated into the new building and placed in the eastern arm , the choir proper being located , as in // all Norman Benedictine churches , under the central tower , and even extending into the nave . The next epoch in the history of Ely is after it became a bishopric . Hervey-le-Breton and his successor , Nigel , Treasurer of Henry I. , and nephew to the powerful Bishop Roger of Salisbury , together held the See nearly sixty years . During their tenure of it ( 1109-69 ) the whole of the nave must have been built , and the western transept commenced , both in that more advanced style of Norman , whose greater lightness and gracefulness bespeaks the friendly admixture of the two races . Bishop Ridel , who came next , held the See from 1174 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round arched to the pointed style was making itself felt all over the kingdom . This prelate completed the upper portion of the western transept , and commenced the western tower , which is , for the most part , of Early English character , though French influence lurks here and there , particularly in the use of the crochet capital . Thus , by the end of the twelfth century , Ely had become a perfected Norman structure of the first class , resembling in many features , both of plan and form , its noble sister of the Fens at Peterborough . It consisted of an apsidal presbytery of four bays ; transepts , likewise of four bays ; and a nave of thirteen , the last , measuring from the central tower to the great arch opening into the western transept , nearly 220 feet . All had triforia and clerestories of unusually noble // dimensions , but their main roofs were simply ceiled , for English architects at that time had not sufficient temerity to vault over such wide spaces . Then , at the west end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such favourite features with the Rhenish architects of the first half of the thirteenth century . Two munificent bishops , Eustachius and Hugh de Northwold , presided over Ely during that new and glorious era in church architecture , the thirteenth century . To the former is due that Galilee porch which is so admirably calculated to solemnise the mind , and to prepare it for the overwhelming grandeur of the interior . Like the Galilee at Durham , this of Ely had a very narrow escape at the beginning of the reign of George III. , when James Essex advised not only its removal , but that of the noble south-west transept , as being " neither useful nor ornamental , " and " not worth preserving " ( ! ) To Bishop Hugh de Northwold we are indebted for the unsurpassable six-bayed presbytery , built to hold shrines , one of which was erected in honour of St Alban . Nowhere , perhaps , is the marvellous grace and versatility of the Early English style better displayed or more sumptuously developed than in this presbytery of Bishop Northwold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pillars ? eight slender ringed shafts gathered round a cylindrical core ? being entirely of this material , including not only the richly // flowered capitals , but the elongated corbels of leafage from which the vaulting shafts spring . Intended by Northwold to form the crown and glory of his cathedral church , this ne plus ultra of Early English refinement was commenced in 1235 and consecrated in 1252 , Henry III . and his son Edward , then about thirteen years old , being present at the head of an august assemblage . Beyond the alteration of the Norman windows in the eastern aisle of the south transept into Early Geometrical ones , no architectural works of importance were undertaken at Ely after the consecration until 1321 , when the Lady , or , as it is now styled , the Trinity Chapel , was commenced from the designs of Alan of Walsingham , at that time sub-prior . In plan it is a parallelogram , 100 feet long , 46 feet wide , and 60 feet high , vaulted , but unsupported by pillars . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resplendent with stained glass , of which but some scanty fragments remain . The east and west ends have each a noble window in which the tracery has a slightly Perpendicular tendency , and the walls on the north , south and west sides are surrounded by a series of stone stalls , which are worthy of the closest study . Scarcely had the foundations of the Lady Chapel been laid , when , immediately after Matins on the Eve of the Festival of St Ermenhilda , 12th February , 1322 o.s. , the central tower collapsed , ruining in its fall the short Norman choir . Alan of Walsingham was ordered to desist from building the chapel and to devote all his energies to // reinstating the tower . Instead , however , of rebuilding it on its former lines , he wholly removed not only the four great piers , but one bay of nave , choir and transepts , and adopting the eight next pillars as the points of support for his new tower , reconstructed them , to such size and shape as would afford sufficient strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that marvellously constructed quasidomical timber roof and graceful lantern ? a feature quite unique among English cathedrals . Twenty-two years were occupied in the construction of this octagon , the stone portion taking but six years , and the woodwork sixteen . It appears that the lantern was a belfry and contained a set of bells , one of which was discovered by Dr Harvey Goodwin ( Dean of Ely from 1858 to 1869 , and afterwards Bishop of Carlisle ) to have weighed 7000 lbs . Alan of Walsingham 's work was not confined to the octagon and the Lady Chapel ? completed , by the way , in 1349 ? the Norman portion of the choir that had been ruined by the fall of the tower being rebuilt under his direction , if not actually from his design , by the munificence of Bishop I- otham . He so contrived his elevation in the choir that its three stages , while differing in toto from the Norman of the nave and transepts on one hand , and the Early English on the other , should coincide in proportions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading lines is one of its most remarkable features . In the clerestory a very graceful fringe gives additional richness to the inner arches of the windows . // After the death of Alan de Walsingham this Lady Chapel at Ely was entrusted to the care of a monk named John of Wisbeach , who is recorded to have " continued the work aforesaid with the greatest solicitude through twenty-eight years and thirteen weeks , and to have finished the stone structure with images , both within and without the chapel , in number 147 , besides the small images in the tabula or reredos over the altar , and exclusive of the images to the doorway of the entrance to the chapel ; also the timberwork , covered with lead , and the eastern gable , with two windows on either side of the chapel , most beautifully furnished with iron and glass . " The same epoch of our architectural history brought about changes in the Early English part of the choir . These consisted chiefly in transmuting Bishop Northwold 's coupled lancets in the aisles and triforia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately , however , the east end , with its double tier of graceful lancets , escaped , and we are also lucky in the possession of two of the Early English lancets in the southern triforium . The nave was provided with an open timbered cradle roof , having every rafter trussed , and of pleasing form . In the transepts the timber roofs take a simple gabled form , with large figures of angels on their hammer beams , and have received coloured enrichment . The chief alteration necessitated by the rebuilding of the transept roofs was the addition of a window or windows above the coupled Romanesque ones already existing . A seven-light window , rather low and wide and with // Late Decorated tracery , was given to the southern arm , while the opposite one was endowed with two tall Perpendicular windows of three compartments each . The absence of groining and the several tiers of stained glass windows in the principal faces of the transepts confer an extraordinary effect of height on this part of the cathedral . On the completion of Walsingham 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had existed before the Norman tower fell . The rood-screen escaped , but the choir stalls were so completely wrecked that Walsingham was commissioned to design an entirely new set . During the Perpendicular period the most sweeping alteration was the raising of the triforium walls throughout the nave and transepts , except on the eastern side of the northern one , where , fortunately , we are enabled to gain an idea of the old Norman arrangement . The original Norman fenestration of the nave aisles was changed to Perpendicular , but that on the south side has been restored to its original form . What the original termination of the western tower of Ely Cathedral was , it is hardly possible to say with certainty . But it is probable that it was surmounted by a spire of timber and lead . The true proportions of this tower were spoiled during the episcopate of Bishop Arundel ( 1374-88 ) by the substitution of an octagonal stone lantern , which , although it imparts great elevation to the mass viewed from a distance , is of inferior workmanship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superincumbent mass of new Perpen // dicular masonry was found to be pressing so heavily upon work intended only to support an addition of light material , that it became necessary to remove the original piers and the greater portion of the arches opening from this tower into the nave , the south-west transept and the ruined , or perhaps never completed one opposite , and to replace them with others in the style of their age . Viewed in connection with the south-west transept the interior of the lantern , with tier upon tier of arcading , constitutes a truly magnificent spectacle ; while , should the great doors opening into the Galilee porch be open , the vista from the outer gates to the double tier of lancets at the east end ? a distance of 517 feet ? presents one of the noblest architectural spectacles the world can show . Ely Cathedral , so unique in many respects , is no less remarkable as possessing two of the last efforts of the expiring Gothic style ? the mortuary chapels of Bishops Alcock and West . Situated as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choir aisles , respectively , where they can be but inadequately viewed , these chantries , perhaps the most sumptuous erections of their class in the kingdom , afford singular evidence of how much elaborate work may be crowded together with but little effect . With these two chapels the architectural history of the cathedral in its mediaeval aspect may be said to terminate , for in the next three centuries there is little to chronicle but iconoclasm , apathy , neglect , and clumsy , though well-meant attempts at restoration and repair .
