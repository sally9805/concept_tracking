txt If the refusal of Governor ROLPH of California to pardon MooNEY leaves a certain feeling of disquiet among fair-minded men , this is not because they doubt the Governor 's sincerity . Nor can it be supposed that his predecessors in office who successively came to the decision that MOONEY was properly found guilty of an atrocious crime were actuated by anything except what they conceived to be a sense of public duty . The same , must , of course , be said of the judges of the various courts who have from time to time passed upon the Mooney case . All these men may have been mistaken , but it is impossible that all of them could have been dishonest or cringing before the alleged dictation of politicians or capitalists . On this subject wild charges have been and still are put about . But reasonable men will decide that they ought to be thrown out of court . The real question is one not of bias or prejudice but of fact and of justice . One must wait for the full text of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his legal advisers before coming to a positive conclusion on certain points in dispute . But as regards others , there appears to be little room for disagreement . The fact that MOONEY had a very bad record is beside the point . He may have been capable of committing the crime for which he was convicted ; but the real question is whether there was satisfactory proof that he did commit it . It has been established that at least a part of the testimony against him on his original trial was perjured . It is known that the judge who presided at that trial afterward declared that he could not have expected the jury to convict MOONEY had the untrustworthiness of one or two of the witnesses for the prosecution been brought out at the time . Yet it has been asserted by several who have reviewed the whole case that enough evidence , after rejecting that which was tainted , remained to show that MOONEY was guilty . If that is true , it ought to be put beyond peradventure in the report upon which Governor ROLPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave at large ; his previous reputation as a remorseless dynamiter may have been justified ; his views about anarchy and his apparent readiness to act upon them may have been abhorrent ; but he was entitled to the usual presumption of innocence at ' his trial until satisfactorily proved to be guilty . The fear , not that he was " framed , " but that he was improperly convicted , has troubled many . It has led to repeated inquiries into his case . The Wickersham Commission felt bound to look into it , but did not go much beyond deploring the " shocking " technicalities of the law in California which seemed to prevent judges and Governors from going directly and deeply into the merits of the plea made in lefooNEY 'S behalf . Governor ROLPH still protests that his mind is open , provided new evidence of the prisoner 's innocence is laid before him . For that it is now apparently too late . But it is not too late to express the hope that the California authorities may yet find a way go appease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that the outside world will believe that they desire to act so as to be humane as well as just .
