Last week frightened steelmen could not help recalling the story of a week last autumn . When steelmen returned jauntily from 1938 Labor Day weekends , they were confident that no more dreary months of 25% and 30% operations lay ahead-October would start the 1939 auto model year off with a bang . Soon all steel-peddling haunts buzzed with reports that auto production schedules called for 1,000.000 1939 cars by year 's end . At a ton of steel per car , Detroit would have to buy 1,000,000 tons . Buick had just bought 35,000 tons . Ford was shopping for 50,000 tons . For the steel industry the days of on &; up were coming back . <P> Ford , whose philosophy is based on low prices and big volume , took his time shopping for his 50,000 tons . For weeks he dangled the bait until big time steelmen forgot that the price of 1,000,000 tons was at stake , enough to keep U. S. continuous rolling mills busy for more than a month , while 50,000 tons add up to a couple of days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive lather . <P> Then Ford bought his 50,000 tons , at $4 a ton below what steelmen quickly realized had been the price , but was the price no more . There started a week 's orgy of price cutting . Steel price quotations fell as rapidly as stock quotations on a Hitler-speech day . The independents ( staying in the black ) offered to lay steel down in Detroit for $8 a ton less than the U. S. Steel Corporation , and the U. S. Steel Corporation ( going into the red ) met the cut . Little Steel 's Girdler and Big Steel 's Stettinius traded punches till both were sorry . <P> A week later , when it was all over , Big &; Little Steel were yoked to a new price structure at $50.51 instead of $56.27 a ton and they had enough orders for five months of operations at 50% of capacity . Their week of war had sold not just 1,000,000 tons to feed Detroit from October through Christmas , but something like 2,000,000 tons-enough to tide auto production over until the 1939 model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were about $25 cheaper than the 1938 , and $10 of that cut was put up by the steelmen . <P> Last week , this bit of history was memorable for Ford was again dangling an order before the trade , an order for only 5.000 tons , only an hour 's run for the industry 's continuous mills . But such was the state of the steel industry that the offer was demoralizing . Youngstown Sheet &; Tube allegedly nibbled first , offering Ford a $2 a ton cut . He held out , won a reduction twice as big , added insult to injury by splitting the bone he was throwing seven different ways , so that no plant got more than a sniff of business .
