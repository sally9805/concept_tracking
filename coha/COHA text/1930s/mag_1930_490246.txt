ClEATED on a cold bench in Madi-son Square , looking upon the per-pendicular and vasty halls of life insurance , we meditated upon the life and times of Darwin P. Kingsley . No seat is so apt to turn one 's thoughts to the uncertainty , the hazards , the unre-liability of life , as a bench in a park ? the stream of people passing by , each groping his diagonal course along ; the companions of the bench , one asleep , one reading the want ads fearfully , one reading the editorials darkly ; the chimes spilling the incomprehensible hours , each hell with its tongue in its cheek . As we sat there , cold and afraid , hunched into our coat , we recalled a little newspaper item saying that the New York Life Insurance Company had recently had the greatest day in its history  --  five thousand new applications for policies . That was it ? everybody was scared ; people were timid birds running to cover under Mr. Kingsley 's wing . After a hit , we got up from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying the momentary security of their nearness . Then , hearing another hitter hour strike , we walked away , still cold and uninsured . SOMETIMES we marvel that the Times is able to publish at all , considering the odds it faces , In even a simple situation , such as reviewing a play , the Times often finds itself hopelessly inarticulate because of its own standards of decency . Take the play " Waterloo Bridge , " which is about prostitutes ; most newspapers , faced with the task of reviewing a play about prostitutes without using the word " prostitute , " would fold up and go home . Not the Times . Its reviewer went bravely ahead for half a column , referring successively to " lee belles im. - Dzires , " " the erring sisters , " " the antiquity of Myra 's profession , " and " sister in sin , " and never once using the word . That kind of circumlocution is not simple , and further , it takes up much space  --  whisk costs money to a newspaper publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit . It has a kind of heroism all its own . IT was with a devilish gay twinkle I- in our eye that we read the accounts of rioting in the Museum of Natural History , at the overcrowded Einstein lecture . Space , it occurred to us in our devilish gay mood , was n't a theory there , Einstein or no Einstein . There just was n't room enough for all the people . WE feel it our duty to set at rest II the fears of any of our readers who may be worried about Death Ave-nue . Everything is all right over there , apparently . It 's true that Mayor Walk-er drew a spike out of the railroad , but only one spike is gone , and it 's hardly missed . We phoned the New York Central ourself , being worried Test anything happen to our favorite thoroughfare , and they assured us that we need n't be frightened  --  nothing much will happen for a while . " It was just kind of a ceremony , " they said . Mr. Walker has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trains are running slowly down the middle of the street as usual . The first agitation shout Death Avenue started when Eustace Tilley was in his teens . THEpalm this week goes to Dr. Frazer , of Johns Hopkins , who has discovered a way to eliminate carbon monoxide from the exhaust of motor cars . We had given ourself two more years to live in New York before being killed by poison gas ( probably in the taxi arcade in Vanderbilt Avenue ) ; but now it looks as though we might reach a ripe old age . The buses in Fifth Avenue alone exude enough monoxide every afternoon at five o'clock to injure the health of anybody but a New Yorker . Monoxide does something to blood corpuscles , and without corpuscles we are lost . Poison gas from motor cars is just one of the ridiculous symptoms of an age when people create machines to blow death in their own faces . We happen to he rabid on the subject , and insist that the city immediately enact a law requiring all vehicles to he equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is manufactured commercially . That is what we demand . What we expect is something else again . We expect the usual indifference , delay , and ineffectualness . We expect to be breathing monoxide for quite a while yet , even though it is known to be injurious to health and , in larger quantities , deadly . Big Glass THE Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company called on us on Tuesday to point out an error in our mention of the Lucky Strike window in Broadway . We said the tricky job of bent glass in that storefront was rejected by all the glasstnakers in America and that a French concern was called in to do the delicate work . The cold fact is that the Pittsburgh company put that window in and thought nothing of it . Tossed it off . Nor did it cost twenty-eight hundred dollars ; only about five hundred . What we related was just a romantic legend which had grown up . We fell into friendly chat with the Pittsburgh people and learned further facts about important glass around town . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest in the world  --  is in Aeolian Hall . It is about twenty feet by thirteen . Gimbel Brothers ' windows are only slightly smaller . Abercrombie &; Fitch 's are third . The Pittsburgh Company keeps replacements for all of these windows in a warehouse in Long Island City , ready on spurt notice to put in a new pane in an emergency . The company has n't had a serious breakage during installation in the past four years , incidentally . None of the glass is manufactured nearer to New York than the outskirts of Pittsburgh . It is shipped here in special freight cars , especially low-slung to allow enough head-room . Special trucks , also low-slung , cart the glass tenderly around town . The drivers of these trucks have special permits from the city which allow them to proceed through the streets as slowly as they see fit . They just show it to a cop and he has to shut up . The taller glass trucks can not be driven under the " L " structures anywhere but in the neighborhood of 110th Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the island to get to their destination . Glass-handlers are not only expert glaziers , but sort of Volga boatmen with poetry in their souls . Getting a plate of glass from truck to window-frame is ticklish . When all is ready the crate is swung on canvas strips that go underneath the lower edge ; there is a handle for each end of the strip and a man for each handle . When the carriers are all in place with their slings the foreman cries " Up ! " and the men lift in unison . Then the squad starts off , on its right foot  --  not left , as in the waltz . The leader breaks into a slow chanty or Irish folk song , the men join in , and all move , funereally and in careful step , toward the window-frame . It takes from fourteen to twenty men to handle a big glass . In addition to the carriers two men walk alongside steadying the crate with long poles , keeping it upright . It 's quite a spectacle , something like a Riviera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jobs were n't done after midnight to avoid the crowds . Red-Handed T HE man who got the toughest break reported in Wall Street so far this year is the proprietor of a newsstand in one of the big buildings there . He was selling a Saturday Evening Post to a customer a day ahead of the official publication date , Thursday , and Mr. Cyrus H. K. Curtis , the publisher , in town from Philadelphia , caught him at it . Mr. Curtis revealed his identity and was pretty stern . The newsdealer got a good lecture and the customer had to give his Post back . Philosopher 's Friends DR . WILL DURANT , who wrote " The Story of Philosophy , " sailed for the Orient Last week with his wife and daughter . Before sailing he was given a dinner by his friends , numbering about five hundred . This dinner , surprisingly , was open to the public , so we attended . Among the guests were Mr. and Mrs. Simon , Miss Janet Simon , Miss Jerry Simon , Mr. and Mrs. Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Professor John Dewey , of Columbia . The dinner started at 6:30 and ended exactly at midnight , after a period of embarrassment , confusion , and disorder . Professor Dewey left at 11 : 45 and Ann Elizabeth Harding , ten-year-old daughter of the Nan Britton Guild , at 10:22 . Dinner consisted of grapefruit , vegetable soup , filet of sole , capon , salad , and Nesselrode pudding ? a flashlight photograph being taken during the Nesselrode course and proofs distributed noisily through the audience fifty minutes later during the rendition of a Mozart sonata by Maximilian Rose . The waiters were in Confederate gray . After dinner the speakers were introduced by Dr. Henry Goddard Leach , the first speaker being Dr. Alexander Cairns , who praised Dr. Durant highly and said of him : " God ca n't make Durant books without Durant . " During the next speech , which also praised Dr. Durant , turban hats were passed through the banquet hall to be autographed by the guests . Among those signing the hats were Miss Ethel Durant , Mr. Frank Durant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durant , Mrs. Joseph Durant , Jr. , Mr. Sunny Moss , Miss Dolly Pepis , Raymond Duncan the goat-herd , Nan Britton , several children , a trained nurse , an albino , and Professor Dewey . It was then 10:22 and Mr. Alden Freeman , a white-haired man of sixty-eight whom Dr Durant later referred to as the man who " without words taught me the meaning of culture , " rose from his seat and said in a very loud voice : " Paging Miss Ann Harding , come along Ann Elizabeth , come along  --  your mother wants to put you to bed . " Miss Harding was led from the room , while telegrams of congratulations and good wishes to Dr. Durant were read , one from Stefansson , the explorer , and one from John Cowper Powys , the writer . Professor Dewey spoke briefly , praising Dr. Durant 's work in popularizing philosophy . Four other speeches were given on the subject of Dr. Durant , praising his character , his general habits , his standard of living , his relations with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , and his treatment of his daughter Ethel . One speech was given praising Mrs. Durant ( " Puck " ) . By this time the waiters had passed the plates and received the tips , the cigar smoke had become dense , and the situation had become definitely embarrassing to any guest who , like ourself , had been drawn from the general public . Dr. Durant next spoke , praising . Dr. Cairns , Alden Freeman ( who had returned to the room from getting Ann Harding a taxi ) , Professor Dewey , the Chinese poet Li-Po , Dr. Hannah Stone , John Cowper Powys , Will Perlman , Stefansson , Mr. R. Simon , Art Young , Mr. M. L. Schuster , Mrs. Durant ( Ariel , " Puck " ) , Ethel Durant , Gandhi , and New York 's skyline . Professor Dewey sat fairly still during this period . The banquet would have been concluded at this point but for the arrival , in the hallway , of a troupe of actors in costume , brought there by Alden Freeman . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were passed in the hall by Professor Dewey , going out . At 11:51 Mr. Freeman took the speaker 's platform , requested the departing guests to remain , instructed the troupe of actors to wait outside , and then spoke rapidly and fantastically on a variety of subjects covering , in a general way , the trouble in Haiti , the real-estate situation in Florida , Nan Britton , the dean of the law school of N.Y.U. , the books of Will Durant , and the vice-president of the National City Bank . At 11:57 the troupe of players swept into the room , Raymond Duncan , the goatherd , took the laurel wreath from Moliere , and at 11:58 the wreath was placed forcibly on the head of Dr. Durant , from whose red neck and red wrists slowly trickled little persistent streams of philosophical perspiration . Crutches for Two ACOUPLE of women must he going around town with one crutch  --  we hear so much about them . If not , then this is a story to end all stories about two women with a crutch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , the one with the crutch being apparently helped by the other . Someone instantly gives up his seat , whereupon the lady with the crutch sits down and hands the support to her pal , who thereupon crutches along to the next car and gets a seat too . Do n't go pulling crutches from under every woman you see , though . Ship to Shore IFyou are planning to go abroad en the Leviathan and do some telephoning , it is as well to remember that your conversation may not he private . An amateur radio experimenter reports that with a low-wave receiving set he is able to listen in on the Leviathan most any time . He has been doing so frequently for several weeks . He has found that there is a pretty constant flow of language back and forth over the air , none of it , to his mind , worth seven dollars a minute , however . A number of businessmen arc always calling their offices from the ship . If they talk plainly , it 's dull . If they use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred filibuster , equal agony , four strain , sell design " ? boresome . Wives calling their husbands are only mildly interesting . Half the conversations begin , " Guess who this is ! " The next remark is frequently , " Probably you 'll be angry because this costs so much . " Sometimes the husbands swear a little . When paying customers are n't talking , the operators themselves converse with each other , frequently as a matter of experiment . They read difficult words in varying intonations to see how they go through the ether . So far the only exciting thing happened during the holidays . A day or two after Christmas our man was astonished to hear songs coming in , bells ringing , and voices proclaiming the glad new year . Listening to the end he found it was London rehearsing the program which was broadcast New Year 's Day , Big Ben and all . Repairing Grandfather AN elderly lady , long a resident of this city but of Irish lineage , has always taken a modest pride in the fact that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squares in Dublin . When some years ago it was badly damaged during rioting , she made a special trip to Ireland , and arranged with the city authorities for the necessary repairs , f no ti n g the bill herself . A period of calm followed , but recently the Irish got enthusiastic again , and once more grandfather suffered . This time the city went ahead on the repairs without prompting  --  remembering , however , to send her a statement which was a little confusing to her , on the whole , until she had had time to think things over : " To one left leg , and new tail for horse , ? 104 . " Messiah THE close of what is for most musicians a strenuous enough winter season in New York will only mean for Albert Stoessel the beginning of a still livelier season out around the country . This time of year he conducts the New York Oratorio Society and the Bach Cantata Club ; in summer he has the Chautauqua Institute and the annual festivals at Wnrcester and in Westchester on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he conducted a series of forty-one symphonies and eight operas . This spring , he will he principally busy with the preparations fur the Westchester Festival , which will be especially gala this year , lasting three days in May and celebrating the opening of the new Westchester Community Centre . Motorists may recall the building , a large concrete structure , just beyond White Plains on the Bronx River Parkway . Choral societies from twenty-two towns will appear at the Festival ; meantime Stoessel will visit each one .. All this might make some conductors dizzy , but he is used to excitement . When he was barely sixteen he had his data in Berlin , as a violinist , and played three violin concerti in the one evening . Later , he accompanied Caruso on tour and played with the St. Louis Symphony . When the war broke out , he was back in Berlin again , teaching the violin . One of his pupils was an American girl , and Stoessel , though of German-Swiss descent , has always considered himself an American too . The war feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany together , subsequently being married . After his marriage , Stoessel came to New York , dropped a nickel in a coin-box telephone and called up Walter Damrosch . He wanted an engagement as concert violinist , Damrosch had another suggestion . " Why do n't you enlist ? " he said . The next time he saw Stoessel , it was in France , and the violinist was leader of the 301st Infantry Regiment Band , which he had organized . So impressed was Darnrosch with this organization that he subsequently persuaded General Pershing to authorize a handmasters ' school at General Headquarters . Stoessel , after a competition in which fifty other musicians performed , was chosen director of the school . He says it was because a bombardment so loud that no other sound could be heard above it continued all through the tests until the very moment when his turn came to take up the baton . He has been waving the baton pretty constantly ever since . After the war , Damrosch brought him back to he assistant conductor of the New York Oratorio Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he took his place . Since then he has conducted most of its New York recitals , including ten of the Society 's traditional Christmas performances of the " Messiah , " at Carnegie Hall . With all this , he is not yet thirty-five years old , and looks even younger . He is handsome and broad-shouldered . He gets a good deal of fan mail , and once , finding a lost locket on the sidewalk , was embarrassed when , opening it to find some trace of its owner , he discovered his own picture tenderly enshrined within . One of his idiosyncrasies is that on Sundays , no matter what the inducement , he sees nobody outside his family , which consists of his wife and two sons , Teddy and F'ritzie . Mute , Inglorious MR . WILLIAM SLAVENS MCNUTT , the author , who is in Hollywood writing for the talkies , abruptly came face to face with a dizzying opportunity for glory outside his chosen field . Mr. McNutt had adapted Conrad 's " Victory . " Incidentally , and not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Flesh of Eve , " but this has been changed to the more discreet " A Hidden Paradise . " The story called for a parrot that should , at the right moment , laugh bitterly , sardonically . When it came to taking this scene the appalling discovery was made that in all Hollywood there was no parrot that would laugh bitterly , sardonically . The entire resources of the industry were put behind the search for one but , although parrots were brought in that would swear , sing , yodel , and recite the Lord 's Prayer , not one was found that would laugh right . Everybody was dejected , especially the director , who told McNutt about his predicament while at lunch in a restaurant . " Why , that 's nothing to lose sleep over , " said McNutt . " Get a double for the talkie part . Anyone can laugh like a parrot . I can . " " Let 's hear you , " said the director eagerly . The author took a deep breath and made noises . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . McNutt was hustled to the studio and that very afternoon the scene was shot , and successfully , McNutt delivering his laugh confidently when the time came . When the film was run off for officials of the company , they were profoundly affected by the eerie sound . McNutt was naturally elated about his success in the talkies as a sardonic laugher . It happened , however , that something was wrong somewhere else in the film and it had to be retaken . The author was told of this and advised to hold himself in readiness . For days he waited for the call , gargling occasionally , carefully keeping his throat in condition . But the call came not . At the dismal end of three weeks McNutt sought out the director . " What about the retake on the parrot scene ? " he asked , affecting nonchalance . " Ah , yes , " replied the director , " yes  --  well , you see , Bill , we have retaken them . We found a property man who could laugh like a parrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on you  --  that 's all . " McNutt affected to laugh the matter off , but his friends say that he sat around his room in a bathrobe for days , moping . Wounds like that leave a scar . Forearmed A t explorer out dining told our cousin of a happening in the frozen North . He was just about to jump off from the last reaches of civilization . The temperature was away below zero and he stood shivering in his sealskin suit , hood , and mittens when the last mail he would receive for months was delivered to him . It was a package which , when unwrapped , proved to contain a home-knitted muffler and a written admonition from his mother . " Now , do n't take cold , son . " Sesame SPEAKEASY proprietors are frequently ingenious devils . Two of them in the Amsterdam Avenue region have solved the problem of admitting the right persons , and keeping others out , without resorting to the bothersome system of cards of identity or a long scrutiny at the gate . The entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door on the right has the usual knob , keyhole , and latch . The door on the left is blank and sullen . Strangers naturally knock at the door on the right . No amount of racket ever arouses the proprietor . If they try the handle , they find the door locked . Presently they move on . The knowing merely push the blank left door . The other place has one front door on which a large sign is tacked reading : " Closed for Repairs  --  Use Side Door . " The man who heeds the notice finds the side door locked . He gets no response to his hammering . People who have been there before , however , simply open the closed-for-repairs door , and walk in.
