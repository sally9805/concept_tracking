In Europe 's propaganda* war the Germans have , as might have been expected , come out second best . They often handle the art of communication clumsily . In War II , when they have not been caught stupidly lying-as when they insisted the Ark Royal had been sunk , even though a U. S. naval attache lunched aboard her and found differently-they have artlessly suppressed information which would on the whole have done their cause good rather than harm . Last week Germany had yet to admit the loss of even one submarine in seven weeks ' warfare at sea . <P> The British do it differently . Masters of fact-presenting as well as of fiction , they have managed to convince the world , by promptly reporting disasters ( and , not so promptly , victories ) that whatever comes from their official spokesmen is accepted as dead on the level . <P> But straight truth is not the only instrument of propaganda that the British use .

Instead , it described them as understandable dupes and Hitler as a powerful but pitiable man . Sir Nevile had further broken precedent by writing the best of his memoirs 30 days , instead of 30 years , after the events happened . Excerpts : <P> " My Lord : <P> " Events moved with such rapidity during the last fortnight of my mission to Berlin that it proved impossible at the time to give any consecutive account of them .

National Socialism itself is a revolution and a conception of national philosophy . Contrary to democracy , which implies the subordination of the State to the service of its citizens , Naziism prescribes the subordination of its citizens to the service of the State , an all embracing moloch , and to the individual who rules that State . . . .
