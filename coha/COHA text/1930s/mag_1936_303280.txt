Twelve years ago a sandy-haired German with vast feet and an enormous nose shuffled into the Manhattan gallery of Erhard Weyhe . He was , he said , a baker by trade . His name was Emil Ganso and he had a portfolio of drawings to show . Dealer Weyhe did not think the pictures were good enough for an immediate exhibition . Nevertheless he signed Baker Ganso to a long contract , gave him a small weekly allowance on which to live while he went on painting . It was a shrewd investment . Proudly last week Dealer Weyhe gave his protg an exhibition , and there was not a critic to deny that Baker Ganso is now an important U. S. painter . <P> Woefully lacking in class consciousness , Artist Ganso would rather paint a pair of buttocks than all the breadlines on the Bowery . For years his artistic idol and best friend was Jules Pascin . Artist Pascin specialized in painting naughty little girls in pale misty colors with a spidery delicate line . <P> Ganso 's nudes are more frankly sensuous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line less subtle . Jealous rivals have called him the " Rembrandt of barroom decorators . " * As a matter of fact , no barroom yet boasts a Ganso nude , and Artist Ganso is quite as interested in painting the rolling hills , farms and orchards of Woodstock , N. Y. , where he spends his summers , as he is in the lush ladies who pose for him in the winter time in Manhattan . <P> Best of the Ganso nudes exhibited last week was the figure of a young model seated by a tea table , a black lace scarf thrown over her shoulders ( see cut ) . Shrewdly Artist Ganso has repeated the tawny color of her skin in the tan walls , the rich brown of the floor . Other pictures that stopped gallerygoers : two young women lying side by side on a lake shore , one nude , the other dressed only in silk stockings &; pumps ; and the back view of a plump female sprawled on a divan . A Guggenheim Fellowship and many exhibition prizes have come to Artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overprice his work . Ganso 's most seductive nudes sell for $150 to $500 apiece . <P> <P> * In Paterson last week New Jersey 's Alcohol Beverage Control Commissioner D. Frederick Burnett was asked to pass on the propriety of a barroom Venus that had outraged the sensibilities of a passing minister 's wife . After personal inspection , Commissioner Burnett wrote to the complainant : " The painting is mediocre , the color flat , the style eclectic and the subject trite . I am not concerned , however , with artistry or the lack of it . ... There is no reason why places for the consumption of liquor should not be made comfortable and decorative . . . . Pictures , as well as flowers , may brighten a corner . " Obscene ' should not be an execration lightly to be hurled at a painting because it does not conform to one 's own viewpoint . . . . The picture is not obscene , therefore I shall not order its removal . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
