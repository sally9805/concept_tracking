In the whole uncertain business of radio , broadcasters of house programs lead the most uncertain careers . And of all such radio ephemera , none is more ephemeral than the studio book critic . Efforts to put book talk on the air have generally been short-lived . <P> Unique exception is San Francisco 's Joseph Henry Jackson , whose weekly Reader 's Guide series concluded last week its 14th year of continuous broadcasting . His program rates , despite its cultural stigma , as radio 's outstanding hardy perennial . Originated by Book Critic Jackson over KGO ( then in Oakland ) in 1924 , Reader 's Guide was extended to cover all of the Pacific Coast when NBC added KGO to its Blue network . Guide Jackson now splits the network Sunday evenings at 9:30 EDST with Gossiper Walter Winchell , making his literary advice available to all of the West and the South . <P> In a recent Macmillan survey , western book sellers picked Reader 's Guide broadcasts as most influential swayer of readers ' habits . Book sales react automatically to Jackson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Action at Aquila , Charles Morgan 's Sparkenbroke and Lloyd Douglas ' Home for Christmas out of West Coast best-seller lists while they were doing well throughout the rest of the country . His one conspicuous failure was Dale Carnegie 's How to Win Friends and Influence People . A full broadcast of dispraise was unavailing against Californian determination to win and influence .
