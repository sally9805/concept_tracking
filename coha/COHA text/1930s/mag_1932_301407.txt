Up until last week no U. S. Protestant denomination had given full , official approval to Re-Thinking Missions , the report made public last month by the Laymen 's Foreign Missions Inquiry ( TIME , Nov. 28 ) . Of the seven denominations whose laymen were concerned in the Inquiry , only three mission boards-Methodist , Baptist . Congregational - have guardedly agreed to cooperate . <P> Last week two more churches made known their position . The General Council of the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A. revealed that , meeting in Chicago three weeks ago , it had unanimously pronounced the report " virtually a denial of evangelical Christianity . " The Presbyterian Church would , of course , sympathetically consider every " forward-looking policy " but never would it " abandon the New Testament position and surrender the only hope the world has of overcoming the insidious atheism and agnosticism of our generation . " Another Presbyterian objection : " We confidently expected that an increase in missionary enthusiasm would result from the Commission 's Report , but fear that at least in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Added the Spiritual Emphasis Committee of the General Council : " It is not alone the enemies of Christianity that challenge the Gospel , but Christ is wounded in the house of His friends . " <P> The evangelical content of Re-Thinking Missions was also too meagre for the United Presbyterian Church of North America , whose Board of Foreign Missions repudiated its " deflection from the fact that Jesus Christ is the only and eternal Son of God .
