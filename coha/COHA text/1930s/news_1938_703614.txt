txt A controversy has developed within the Farm Administration over the proposal by Secretary of Agriculture Wallace to boost the income of cotton producers by means of a processing tax and a domestic consumption subsidy . Some of the Administration 's economists , it was revealed yesterday , have taken the position that the two proposals conflict , and that any gain in cotton usage which might result from the consumption subsidy , or two-price system , might well be offset to a substantial extent , if not completely . by a drop in consumption which they believe would follow imposition of a processing tax on cotton . This twin proposal for aiding the cotton producers was advanced by Mr. Wallace in his recent address at Fort Worth . Texas . The consumption subsidy was put forward as a possibility for cutting down the huge cotton surplus , while the processing tax was advocated as a source of revenue to finance increased price adjustment payments to producers . BAE Study The contention that enactment of processing taxes on cotton would conflict with the consumption subsidy is based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economics and entitled " An Analysis of the Effects 01 the Processing Taxes Levied Under the Agricultural Adjustment Act -- the statute invalidated - by the Supreme Court in 1936 . The conclusion reached in this analysis is that the old four cents per pound . gross weight . processing tax reduced domestic consumption and lowered the price to the producer as well . The study contended that the tax , if passed on to the consumer in its entirety , would mean a reduction in consumption of as much as a half million bales a year . However , it found that about % cent per pbund of the tax was borne by the producer , which lowered the amount of the drop in consumption . It was apparent . the study said , that the manufacturers and wholesalers absorbed but little if any of the tax . In view of this fact , some Farm . Administration economists are taking the position that the proposed consumption subsidy would not be of much benefit if it is to be followed by a processing tax . Additional Cotton Consumption BarrY.I ... Brown . Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on the plan to stimulate the use of cotton , has said that the program will be a success if it results in consuming 1,000,000 bales a year of government loan cotton . Others associated with the plan feel that the amount of cotton which can be added to consumption will be leas than that figure . Thus , if the conclusions reached in the analysis of the former processing tax are correct , the Farm Administration might be obliged to subsidize the consumption of 1,000,000 bales of cotton in order to make a net gain in usage of 500.000 bales since a processing tax might cut normal consumption by 500.000 bales . Such a program , obviously , would be expensive . However , there are those who take the position that any increase in consumption would justify the cost , regardless . One of the proposals being considered as a means of increasing the use of cotton goods is for the Administration to give to manufacturers . who operate in the program , cotton to be made into goods used by the low income groups , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said , would amount to a subsidy of about 20% to the cost of the finished goods .
