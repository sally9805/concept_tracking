Greece An ancient tradition cites that at Christ 's baptism in the Jordan , which is commemorated on January 6 or Epiphany , lights appeared on the water .

Ireland In some parts of Ireland no one was permitted to snuff the candle on Christmas Eve , except those who bore the name Mary . The significance of hunting the wren on St. Stephen 's day is accounted for by the story that St. Stephen , hiding in a furze bush , was betrayed to his enemies by a wren . In Ireland the Yule log is given little regard .

She was personified 45 by a huge puppet so contrived as to appear taller or shorter at the pleasure of the bearer who was concealed by the draperies . This figure often frightened the children by looking into the open windows of the houses . She was borne through the streets preceded by a burning broom as a reminder of the work of sweeping which she refused to abandon for the sake of the Christ Child , and followed by a torchlight procession , beating of drums , and blowing of trumpets . Finally she was thrown from a bridge into the Arno with great rejoicing by the multitude . MILAN In Milan the feast of the Wise Men is observed with a great parade .

NAPLES One of the most cherished traditions of the Neapolitans is that of the sixteenth-century lullaby sung in San Domenico 's Church on Christmas Eve and during the Christmas novena . A chapel on the left aisle of the church leads to a 461 crib , the grotto which is made from stones brought by the Neapolitan Crusaders from Bethlehem . All the figures are in their places excepting the Infant Jesus . He alone is missing . On Christmas Eve a crowd gathers on the piazza outside the church awaiting the return of the Holy Infant . From within the church appear a cross-bearer and acolytes and one of the Dominican Fathers . Presently a woman comes forward and reverently places the missing Bambino in the hands of the priest .

Christmas over , it is confided to the care of one of the pious members of the congregation , and , during the year is passed from family to family , bringing blessings with it . ROME The church of Ara Coeli in Rome houses a celebrated fifteenth-century " Bambino " which was carved in Jeru-471 salem from the wood of the olive trees of Gethsemane by a member of the Franciscan Order .

On the shelves are placed small presents while the lowest shelf is reserved for the crib or cradle with the Infant Jesus surrounded by the shepherds and angels , etc . The ceppo , however , is being replaced by the more modern Christmas tree .

The growing popularity of Christmas is further fostered by the great love of the Japanese for their children . This is the feast of " The Child " and lights and decorations , feasting and gifts , and programs in which children take part , have a strong appeal to them . Little Christmas trees and decorations in many nonChristian homes take their pattern from the mission schools and churches . Jemez Indian Pueblo , New Mexico The Faith of the old Spanish Missions is still deep rooted in the Jemez Indian tribe in New Mexico .

The worthy couple having been honored with the granting of their request , return to their adobe home where preparations are begun to receive the In-fant statue . By Christmas time everything has been renovated and cleaned . On Christmas Eve , at eleven thirty , the Padrinos , dressed in their best and beaded and shawled , lead a procession to the church rectory to ask the Padre for the statue of the Christmas Infant . The Governor of the pueblo and two Fiscales ( sacristans ) walk directly behind the Madrina and the Padrino ; then come the villagers , all bedecked in their best . At the rectory the Padrinos knock at the door and the Padre appears with the Infant statue which he hands to the Madrina who receives it tenderly . The procession accompanied by the Padre and the servers fully vested , now wends its way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired in salute and bon-fires blaze along the street . At the home of the Padrinos , the procession stops . The first to enter is the Madrina with the Bethlehem Child , then the Padrino followed by the Padre and 50 servers , the Governor and Fiscales and as many of the villagers as can crowd into the humble dwelling . The statue is reverently placed on a small altar previously prepared and candles are lighted . The Padre leads in a few prayers after which the Madrina again takes the statue and the procession returns to the church . Enroute the Indians recite the " Hail Mary " in the Spanish language as shotguns boom and war drums roar while the blazing bonfires illuminate the way . The procession enters the church at midnight and Mass is begun . The Padrinos kneel in the sanctuary , the Madrina still holding the precious statue . After the Mass the Padre takes the statue from the Madrina , places it on the altar , and venerates it , as does the Madrina . She then goes to her chair in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap . Now , one by one in a childlike manner , the people approach to kiss the statue of the Bethlehem Babe while Christmas hymns are sung . At the close of the ceremony the statue is placed in the crib in the church and remains there until the Feast of the Three Kings when it is put away for another year . 5 ' Mexico The following description of a Posada in Mexico appeared in a Mexican newspaper . It is such a good one that it is herewith quoted in its entirety . " The Posadas are called jornadas in some parts of Mexico and both words have a peculiar significance , posada referring to lodging and jornada to the day 's journey . The legend goes that Joseph and Mary traveled from Nazareth to Bethlehem in nine days and that each night they had to beg their lodging or posada . " The journey of these two humble subjects of the Roman empire to the town of their legal residence Bethlehem or Belen , as it is called in Spanish , for the taking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightly in all good Mexican homes from December i6 to 24 , the feasts terminating on Christmas Eve with all ceremony and pomp . " Several families usually arrange to hold a posada together , and each family entertains the others on one of the nights of the novena . The people assemble at a little after eight o'clock in the appointed house , and each member of the party is provided with a candle , the servants and retainers of the household being included in the party on these occasions . A procession is formed headed by two pilgrims represented by little statuettes . Joseph on foot and Mary mounted on an ass or burro which Joseph leads . Above the figures hovers 5a another , that of an angel . The figures are usually rude , like those sold in the puestos , but the details of the Virgin 's face ? Joseph 's beard and the patient gray burro are carried out faithfully , although the personal equation of the sculptor enters largely into the makeup . The pair are represented as Mexicans of the lower class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holy couple . Mary is gaudily dressed in blue satin or some equally rich robe , though often her handsome garments are not given her until the Noche Buena . " The procession which is headed by those who carry the figures of Joseph and Mary , marches down the corridors of the house , with a choir of ladies and girls singing the Virgin 's litany of Loretto . This finished , a portion of the party enters the drawing room of the house and acts as its owner in the dialogue with the pilgrims outside . The knock at the door , and the appeal for a night 's lodging is met with a gruff reply and an order to be gone . But the pilgrims persist in a fascinating old chant like the litany of a medieval church , and finally the obdurate householder relents , and the pair enter . They are given quarters in a corner of the room where a quaint service is held , in which all present kneel before the figures which rest on an improvised altar amid candles and tinsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers by a priest , if one is present . 53 " The following is a sample of the medieval chant , with its translation , 0 gracious pilgrim , 0 purest Mary , 1 offer thee my soul To be thy refuge . " The religious part of the evening ends with this little service before the shrine . Its close is a signal for the youngsters , and with an assurance born of tradition they demand dulcies , and a collation is passed with French candies in little pottery toys seen in such num-bers in the puestos . These toys are afterwards kept as souvenirs . " The pinata follows at once , and is , indeed , come to be one of the chief features of the evening . This pinata is nothing more than one of the big earthenware water jars or ollas ( if it is cracked it will break the more easily ) decorated with tissue paper , tinsel and in the handsomer ones , enveloped in the great papier-mache figures of angels , men and women of all types and races . The pinata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar cane , clay figures and dolls , and in many cases with presents of silver and mechanical toys of value . " The pinata is hung up , either in the middle of the room or in a doorway , and each member of the party , large and small , given a chance to break it with three blows . At first , however , the person who is given the short club with which the blows are struck , is blindfolded and turned around three times , leaving him in a condition which adds to the jollity of the occasion , as those in the room have sometimes to exercise some agility in avoiding strong blows meant to shatter the pinata , and which may cause damage to sundry craniums . " Once the pinata is broken , the whole company , great and small , joins in the scramble for the presents which tumble to the floor , gathering all possible together , the most agile securing the best and most prizes . " In the later posadas , when the fun needs added zest , dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guests , by which their partners are found after the fashion of a cotillion . " On Christmas Eve , or the Noche Buena , the service and the fun both exceed those of all the other nights . The service of asking for lodging is much the same except that this time , which marks the anniversary of the arrival of Joseph and Mary in Bethlehem , they are lodged in a stable , represented in one corner of the drawing room . The special ceremony of the evening waits until midnight , while the time is passed in dancing . " Fifteen minutes before the midnight hour strikes , the exercise of the Noche Buena begin , with the singing of the litany of Nino Dios . This lasts ten minutes , 551 and the other five minutes are given to the singing of the Rorro for the soothing of the Infant Jesus . This Rorro is a beautiful typical epitome of the songs of Mexican mothers to their children . " At twelve o'clock the ceremony of the laying of the Nino Dios in His manger takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scene described in the New Testament , disclosing the stable with Mary and Joseph , and with a brilliant star mark-ing the spot where the young Christ is to lie . In the background are asses , horses , and cattle . " Two persons , a man and a woman , are chosen to place the Child in His manger cradle , and by this act , stand sponsors for Him and become compadres with the host , whose property the figure is . With this laying of the Child in His cradle the ceremony of the nativity is completed . " Mohammedan Traditions Regarding the Nativity It is the tradition of the Mohammedans that Jesus was born ' under a withered palm tree which suddenly revived and was covered with green leaves , while lus-cious clusters of ripe fruit grew on it and fell down , and from the root of the palm tree a spring of water burst forth , and Mary partook of the fruit and drank X56 and was refreshed . Ever since it has been the Moslem custom to give dates to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the date which resembles the letter " 0 " as follows : " 0 could I only have a palm , " said Mary , and immediately the words impressed themselves upon the date which since then bears a round sign resembling the letter O. After the birth of Jesus , Mary and Joseph removed into a cave where they remained with the Infant for forty days , after which time they retraced their steps and returned to their people . Moravians Trumpets and trombones provide the Christmas music of the Moravians . At Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , where many Moravians reside , the streets resound with the blast and blare of these instruments throughout the night of Christmas Eve . It is said that this city was spared from an Indian attack in 1755 on Christmas Eve , because of this music . Unaware of their danger , the villagers joyfully played their tunes , while the Indians , not accustomed to any music other than that of the tom-tom , fled in fright as the trumpet sounds re-echoed through the forest . New Zealand When children in New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are taught that 571 they are specially favored by the Christ Child . They have a legend that He , when He was old enough to rua about , wished His birthday came in summertime so that He and all other children might spend it happily out of doors . Thus in these southern lands we know , He sends us flowers , instead of snow , And bright , warm , summer skies that glow , When Christmas Day is dawning . Midnight Mass is the rule and the services are broadcast by radio , both in New Zealand and Australia . Cribs of the usual pattern decorated with native flowers are set up in churches and homes . Besides the loved old carols , they have some carols of their own that are suited to the celebration of a festival on which all nature joins in making holiday . Here is one by an Australian , Mrs. Marion Miller Knowles : No snow lies heavy on the ground , The sunshine fills the morn , As we go forth a-caroling , Of One in manger born ; As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread Of Infant mild Who lies asleep . A halo round His head . Sing loud , sing low ! The Babe shall grow , And all the world its Saviour know . 581 No shepherd 's mantle warm need we , Soft is the summer air ! And every flower our Southland knows Kneels round the Mother fair : Kneels round the Mother-Maid who bends Above the Holy Child , While fragrance unto Fragrance breathes In rapture undefiled . Sing loud , sing low , Like music flow The praises of all blooms that blow ! Last night the Southern Cross was lit So goldenly on high , The Christmas Star of Bethlehem Seemed shining in the sky ! White pinions flash and soar , And heard the Gloria of the spheres That rings for evermore ! Sing soft and slow , The Crib 's aglow ; And seraph forms pass to and fro ! We need no shepherd 's pipes to peal In some far-sounding lay ; The deep notes of our waterfalls Give hymnal grand as they ! The music of our fern-hid streams , Where jarring rancors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To men of Good-will , peace ! " X59 Sing sweeter yet , Old wrongs forget ! A Child cloth plead ; Love 's eyes are wet ! The billows ride up to the shore , Like kings from far-oft lands ; Sun-jewelled are the mantles wide They fling upon the sands ! Now with our Christmas carol blent , Like some Cathedral Bell , Chime on their notes , from world to world , In one great , glad " Noel ! " Noel , Noel ! The tidings tell : Christ comes to earth with man to dwell ! Christmas in New Zealand is a statutory public holiday and after the church services , the time is spent mostly out of doors with picnics and boating . Christmas with the Orientals Christmas among the Orientals is the climax of forty days strict Lenten preparation .

At early dawn on Christmas their Liturgy is celebrated in the church . In the court of the church they make a very small fire called the fire of the Shepherds , and this is then carried through the church . It represents the fire by which the shepherds were watching their flock . The priest gives to each of the faithful a walnut or some fruit . These are called Bizqi d ' Maran , i.e. , " Our Lord 's Pebbles . " The origin of this custom is as follows . When a baby is born , they call the neighbors in and eat sweetmeats or fruit , for joy of the little one . So they do the same for the joy at the Lord 's Birth .

They bring in forks , an ax , chains , and even set up a manger . The table for the Christmas Eve meal is covered with straw and a cloth spread over it . Soup , dumplings made with poppy seed , stewed 6r prunes , nuts , garlic , and honey are served . After the meal candles are lit and carols are sung . In Slavonic churches at the end of the " Liturgy " a rite called the " Peace of God " is performed . The people kiss one another on both cheeks saying " Christ is born .

Gifts are not exchanged between adults . All Christmas shopping must be done before December 24 , for on that day stores , shops , and business houses close ? not to open again until December 27 . Russia Carol singing once had a prominent place in Russian Christmas festivities . A table was covered with a cloth and upon it was set a bowl containing water . In the water the young people dropped rings or other trinkets and covered the bowl with a cloth , then sang their 62 songs . At the end of each song one of the trinkets was drawn at random and its owner deduced an omen from the nature of the words which had just been sung . Roumania In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom known as " little plough . " Boys and men go about after dark from house to house with greetings , ringing of bells , and cracking of whips . On New Year 's morning Roumanians throw handfuls of corn at one another with some appropriate greeting as , May you live , May you flourish , Like apple trees , Like pear trees , In springtime , Like wealthy autumn Of all things plentiful . Generally this greeting is from the young to the old or from the poor to the rich and a present in return is expected . Roumanian mothers anxious about their children 's luck break small sprays from fruit trees , bind them together in bunches , one for each child , and put them in a glass of water . The branch of the lucky one will blossom . 63 Scotland Before the Reformation Christmas was a matter of religious obligation in Scotland .

On Christmas Eve a girl knocked loudly on the door of the pigsty and if a great hog first grunted in reply , her predestined husband would be an old man ; if it were a little pig , it gave promise of a young man . A slice cut from the Christmas cheese at the feast was supposed to have magical virtues .

Serbia Well-to-do families in Serbia keep open house for three days at Christmas and all corners , friends or enemies , strangers or beggars , are welcome to a place at the table . A Serbian saying on Christmas Eve is , " Tonight Earth is blended with Paradise . " Scandinavia The Christmas customs and traditions of their forefathers are religiously adhered to by the Scandinavians . On the day before Christmas the children 's services are held in the churches in the afternoon . By four o'clock candles are burning in all the churches and happy children troop down the streets of cities and towns or country roads to attend the services which are especially for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scandinavian children have sung the same carols , listened to the Christmas story , and received 65 their portion of Christmas candies ' and fruit at these candlelight services .

In every window glows the light of a candle and throughout the whole land every bell is pealing . The music of their chimes echoes over hill and dale for one full hour . Bells and light proclaim the birth of the Christ Child and usher in the festive season . Now comes the Christmas Eve supper at which rice pudding , lutefisk , roast pork with cranberries are special dishes , with flat bread , lefse and gorro and dessert . ( Lefse is a combination of potatoes , milk , and flour baked on the top of the stove while gorro is a small rich cake . ) Supper over , the family gathers for the ceremony of lighting the Christmas tree . The lighting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of the household and as she proceeds with the ceremony the children encircle her and the tree and sing an old carol of the lighting of the tree .

Gifts are piled beneath the branches of the tree and the mother is again the privileged member . Selecting the gifts one by one , she hands each to the smallest child , who becomes the Christmas messenger taking each package to , the one for whom it is intended . Much mirth and jollity prevail . Christmas day is set apart for the religious services in the churches .

The ends are preserved and burnt during storms to protect the house from lightning . JULEBUR Accompanying the Christmas festivities in Scandinavia a " Julebuk " dressed in hide affords merriment by butting the children whom he meets . Sometimes this name is applied to a straw puppet . Similar to the Julebuk is the German " Klapperbuck " whose head is made of wood with jaws that clatter .

When the Christ Child 's birthday arrives , she emerges from her 68 place of retirement and passes through the streets of the island followed by mules laden with gifts . She bestows a blessing and leaves some gifts in the homes of all good children . Every Sicilian household adorns its altar with oranges and candles .

As a commemoration , processions are formed on Christmas Eve by people carrying torches and tambourines which they strike loudly . The midnight Mass on Christmas Eve is called by the Spanish " Mica-del-Gallo " or " Cock-crow Mass . " There is an old Spanish tradition that the Magi go every year to Bethlehem to adore the Infant Jesus and on their way visit children , leaving sweets and toys for them , if they have behaved well .

Tyrol It is a custom for the housewife to present her maidservant with a pie , called " Zelten " which she takes home to share with her kinsfolk . If her lover offers to 71 carry her pie , that is understood to be a proposal which is accepted or not , according to circumstances . In some parts of the Tyrol it is the general custom after the Christmas Eve supper and before going to midnight Mass , to leave a bowl of milk with spoons set around it , on the table . On returning from church one or two spoons will be secretly removed from their places and it is believed some good fortune is in store for their owners , for the parents declare the Holy Mother and Child must have supped milk with those very spoons .

On Epiphany Eve the star singers go from house to house , and sing carols and are given money , cake , and drinks . Before anything is given the star singers , however , they are told to stamp on the snowy field outside the house in order to promote the growth of the crops in the summer . A curious carol is sung telling how Herod tried to tempt the wise men : Oh , Good Wise Men , come in and dine , I will give you both beer and wine , And hay and straw to make your bed , And nought of payment shall be said . 72 But they answer : Oh , no , Oh , no , we must away , We seek a little Child today , A little Child a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyrol it is often said that the wife of Pontius Pilate goes about on the Eve of the Epiphany doing mischief and is sometimes a bogey to frighten children . Ukrania The Ukranians begin their preparations for Christmas during the harvest , when a bundle of the finest hay and a sheaf of the most perfect wheat are carefully selected and stored for the approaching season . On the day before Christmas these are brought out and a thin layer of the hay is laid under the tablecloth and a small bunch is placed on the floor beneath the table , in token of humility for the Babe who was laid in a manger with hay and straw . The sheaf of grain is placed in a corner of the room . Just after dusk , the children are sent out with baskets filled with delicacies which have been prepared for the Christmas Eve meal . They bear these remembrances to their godparents and relatives , especially the elderly ones , who remain at home . Thus all share in the family unity which the Christmas Eve feast honors . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73 Eve feast is served . This meal invariably is composed of twelve dishes in memory of the twelve Apostles of Christ . In the center of the table is set a bowl of " kutya " the traditional dish of the Ukranians , served only twice in the year , on Christmas Eve and on the eve of the day of St. John the Baptist , when Christ 's baptism is commemorated . Kutya is a combination of wheat , the coating of which has been removed , of honey , ground poppy seed , and pecans or other nuts . The meal begins with the serving of the kutya which is eaten with almost ceremonial rite , as those partaking wish each other bountiful health and plenty . Jellied fish follows and then comes a type of " borsch , " " holubzee , " " varenzkee " made with various fillings , other fish dishes , strudel or stewed fruits , honey cake , and tea . Borsch is a beet soup . At another time of the year it may be made with meat stock , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ukranians , so fish stock supplants the meat . Several vegetables are combined in the soup , but the beets give it color and when lastly , sour cream is added , the dish comes to the table a beautiful creamy red . Holubzee is a cabbage roll . This , too , often is made with meat filling but at Christmas time , rice and tomatoes or rice and buckwheat grits are used . The cabbage head is dropped in boiling water and the leaves slightly parboiled . Then the head is pulled apart and within the larger leaves is tucked a portion of the 74 filling . Rolled and skewered with a toothpick the cabbage is baked . Varenzkee is a noodle dough . The dough is cut in rounds and mashed potatoes and cottage cheese , or cheese only , or mixed with prunes , or sauerkraut are placed upon it . Atop this , another layer of dough is laid and the whole is then pinched together about the edges much as pie edges are treated here . These rolls are dropped in boiling water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skimmed out and served with sour cream . The dish of kutya is left in the center of the table throughout the meal and the night . When the table otherwise is cleared after the meal , several spoons and dishes are placed by the dish of kutya so that any departed spirits who may return that night may partake of the special Christmas feast . After the meal , groups of carolers go from house to house carrying a lighted five-pointed star and sing their traditional carols . Often after the song they are invited inside and offered Christmas dainties . Christmas morning brings the church service . At home the tree is enjoyed and gifts are distributed in the afternoon . There is much singing of carols , playing of games , and visiting . It is customary for employees to call on employers . On the Eve of Epiphany , kutya is again served , but before the meal is served to the family , the head of the 751 house takes to the cattle their feast ? portions of kutya and the hay which has been kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fallen grains of wheat from the sheaf in the corner are fed to the barnyard fowl . Wales At many places in Wales a service called " Plygain " was held at four or five o'clock on Christmas morning . Carols were sung and refreshment in the shape of hot broth was provided , but of late these services are more usual on the morning of the New Year . After the morning service the whole population , male and female , of two adjacent parishes would turn out for a game of football . These games were originally contests between two clans and there was great rivalry . The men were accustomed to play these games not only on the feast day but throughout the whole twelve days of the " The Yules " while the evenings were devoted to dancing . It is an old Welsh custom to leave all the outer doors unbolted on Christmas Eve in case the Holy Family should wish to enter . It was an old custom of the children in Wales to carry about a jug of water early on New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those they met , wishing them the compliments of the season . To pay their respects to those not abroad at so early an hour , they would serenade them with the following carol : 76 Here we bring new water From the well so clear , For to worship God with , This happy New Year . Sing levy dew , sing levy dew , The water and the wine ; The seven bright gold wires And the bugles they do shine . Sing reign of Fair Maid , With gold upon her toe , Open you the West Door And turn the Old Year go ; Sing reign of Fair Maid , With gold upon her chin , Open you the East Door , And let the New Year in. 77 The Giving of Gifts A tradition carries back to Tatius , one of the first kings of Rome , the custom of gifts made about this time of the year . Branches of vervain gathered in the woods sacred to Strenia , the Goddess of Health , were offered to the king with the intention of calling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became general and each year the people went into the woods of Strenia to gather the branches , considered by the ancients as a symbol of health , happiness , and affec-tion and it was offered to those whom they loved . Other gifts were soon added and meal , figs , a piece of money or a date covered with a light layer of gold leaf , ' accompanied the branch of vervain with wishes for sweetness and abundance in the things necessary to life . In time , these primitive presents were replaced by pro-visions of all sorts , by clothing , furniture , and pieces of gold or silver . It Ai n't the Gift It ai n't the gift a feller gits , it ai n't the shape ner size , that sets the heart to beatin ' and puts sunshine in yer eyes .

Christmas Bells And all the bells on earth shall ring On Christmas Day , on Christmas Day , And all the bells on earth shall ring On Christmas Day in the morning . And all the angels in heaven shall sing On Christmas Day , on Christmas Day , And all the angels in heaven shall sing On Christmas Day in the morning . ? Old Carol For centuries the voice of the bell has been listened to with reverence on all occasions and Christmas was no exception . The joyous peals of bells and melodious strains of chimes , welcoming the birth of the Saviour , are happy features of the Christmas festival . In many places the clang of bells is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carry-82 ing aloft the message of the angels : " Glory to God in the highest . " But in the rural communities , of necessity , the bell is more a symbol than a reality and paper ones are resorted to as decorations , while glass ones tinkle on the Christmas tree . A widespread medieval custorn was the tolling of bells for one hour before midnight on Christmas Eve and as soon as the hour was passed the ringers struck up a merry peal . The purpose of the tolling it was said , was to give the powers of darkness notice of the approaching birth of the Saviour . In England it was called , " Tolling the Devil 's Knell , " for it was said " The Devil died when Christ was born . " A peculiar legend of bells is told of a town named Been , now engulfed in the ocean , in the Netherlands . It was a lovely city but foul with sin when our Lord descended to the earth upon a Christmas night to visit it . All the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as our Lord in the guise of a beggar passed from door to door , not a single person offered Him the slightest relief . Then in His wrath He spoke one word and the waves of the sea rushed over the wicked city and it was seen never more , but the place where it was immersed is known by the sound of the church bells coming up through the waters on Christmas Eve . 83 A German legend tells that on Christmas Eve all the bells of churches , chapels , monasteries , and cities destroyed by war , will ring and whoever listens properly can hear their chime . Christmas Ship The association of a ship with Christmas is somewhat obscure . It may relate to the Greek custom of carrying models of ships about the streets on New Year 's day in honor of St. Basil whose feast is January i , and who is said to have set out on a journey on that day . The pretty fancy of a ship as the bearer of precious things from afar coming in on Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship far sailing then , St. Michael was the steersman , St. John sat in the horn . Our Lord harped ? our Lady sang , And all the bells of heaven rang On Christmas in the morn . Lord of Misrule Associated with the Christmas season in medieval times was the election of a " Lord of Misrule " to impersonate the spirit of disorder , fun , and merriment . This personage was allowed much license and authority in popular jollifications and presided at all banquets and games where all sorts of pranks ( the wilder the 84 better ) were indulged in . The practice was carried to the point of extreme irreverence and mockery until it was abolished . Masking A relic of pure pagan custom is occasionally met with in some localities , an evening or two before Christmas . Maskers , usually children of a neighborhood with blackened faces and tattered clothes , make calls carrying baskets and tin pails which they beat and rattle . Those visited , knowing the children , pretend to be frightened and good naturedly give them apples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magnus A curious story of Christmas Eve revelries is told as follows : On Christmas Eve in the year I012 a party of about thirty-three young men and women were merrily dancing in the churchyard of a certain church dedicated to St. Magnus . A priest who was at his devotions inside the church was so much disturbed by their merriment that he sent to them asking to desist for a while . The dancers paid no heed although the message was repeated a number of times . Thereupon the holy man becoming indignant prayed his patron saint , St. Magnus , to in some way punish the offenders . His prayer was heard ? with the result that the festive crew could not leave off dancing and for twelve 85 whole months , night and day , winter and summer , through sunshine or storm , they had to prance . They neither wearied nor needed rest , nor did their clothes or boots wear out , but they wore away the surface of the earth so much that at the end of the twelve months , they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to say that on the expiration of their punishment they slept continuously for three days and nights . Bayberry Candles Bayberry candles or " dips " made from bayberry wax are very fragrant when burning and are extensively used at Christmas time . There is an old belief that a bayberry candle brings good fortune to any home in which it sheds its light . According to an old rhyme : " A bayberry candle burnt to the socket , brings luck to the house , food to the larder , and gold to the pocket . " Another old legend says if two lovers who are separated burn bayberry candles on Christmas Eve , the sweetness of the burning wax will be wafted from each to the other across the world , if their love be true . Origin of the Hymn , " Silent Night " On December 24 , in the year 1818 , Father Josef Mohr , a priest in a little German village brought some simple verses he had composed to his friend and organist Franz Gruber and asked him to set them to 86 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The organ being out of order , they agreed to set the verses for two voices with guitar accompaniment . In a few hours a beautiful music gem was produced and the two men sang the Christmas hymn , Stille Nacht ( Silent Night ) , for the first time that Christmas night . Silent Night Silent night , Holy night , All is dark , save the light , Yonder , where they sweet vigils keep , O'er the Babe , who in silent sleep , Rests in heavenly peace , Rests in heavenly peace . 2 Silent night , Peaceful night , Darkness flies , all is light ; Shepherds hear the angels sing , Alleluia !

Origin of the " Adeste Fidelis " The seraphic Doctor of the Franciscans , St. Bonaventure , gave us this sweet Christmas hymn , writing it in the Latin tongue . That was in the thirteenth century . Sixty years ago an English convert to the Catholic faith wrote the familiar translation , " 0 come all ye faithful , joyful and triumphant . " 88 Toward the close of the eighteenth century the " Adeste Fidelis " had become very popular in France and England ; some writers ascribe the original to either a French or a German composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the troublesome times of the Reformation , that the " Adeste Fidelis " was introduced one Christmas morning , about 1797 in the chapel of the Portuguese embassy at London . John Reading , organist of Winchester Cathedral , wrote the music .

" It was adopted by Godfrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his standard when he was chosen ruler of Jerusalem and was a familiar symbol to the Crusaders for two centuries . It is appropriately adopted as the symbol of the modern crusade against tuberculosis . The Christmas seal has developed into a valuable stamp collector 's item . Collecting them has grown to such an extent , that collectors have formed a society known as the Christmas Seal and Charity Stamp Society . The value of Christmas seals has increased in the passing of years until today all are worth many times their original costs of one cent each . Curiously , the most valuable seal is not the original one put out in 1907 , but the 1911 issue which was made up in coils , for use in automatic vending machines . More than forty countries of the world have used the Christmas seal to carry on antituberculosis work since 1904 when the idea originated , but no country has had greater success than the United States . Christmas Postage Stamps In 1898 Canada issued a postage stamp on which is represented a map of the world with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a charity postage stamp bearing the scene of the Nativity . Likewise in 1930 Switzerland issued a postage stamp commemorating St. Nicholas . Recently an enterprising person wrote postal officials in Washington , D. C. , suggesting that a stamp be made to do honor to Santa Claus . This brings to mind a recent ruling in Ohio . The State Board of Liquor Control has ruled against likenesses of the Christmas saint on liquor packages . Historical Columbus touched on the northern coast of the island of San Domingo on Christmas Day , 1492 . He established a settlement there and named the place " La Navidad " in honor of the Feast of the Nativity . On the night of Christmas , 1776 , Washington made his famous crossing of the Delaware River . St. Thomas Day Customs Various pre-Christmas customs are associated with St. Thomas Day , December 21 . This day formerly marked the breaking up of school for the Christmas vacation and the children were allowed many liberties . Larks went on without reproof . Often the teacher was locked out until he promised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allowed to escape and had to be caught by the boys and girls respectively , the 91 girl who caught the hen was called " queen " and the boy who got the cock , " king . " At home , children locked out their parents , and servants , their masters , or bound them in chairs and the victims had to buy back their liberty by promising to treat the offenders . The practices were observed in many European localities . Hot-Cockle A typical Christmas game of bygone days is known as Hot-Cockle . To play the game one person kneels in the center of the room and is blindfolded . The others then tap him on the shoulder , while he tries to guess the name of the offender . If correct , that person is blindfolded and kneels in his place as the game proceeds .

This is one of the greatest of the twelve days and of more jovial observation for the visiting of friends , and for Christmas gambols . The customs of the day vary in different countries but agree to do honor to the Eastern Kings . In different parts of Eng-92 land it was customary for the men to carry cider to the orchard , encircle a tree , and after drinking a toast to it , throw the cider on the tree . This done they returned to the house , which had been bolted by the women . The door was not opened until one of the men guessed what was on the spit . Twelfth Night ?

IN THOSE TWELVE DAYS A choral of great antiquity , the style of which was taken originally from an old Hebrew hymn , begins " In those twelve days .

St. Nicholas or Santa Claus The personality of St. Nicholas and his personifica-tion of the gracious time are our American gift to the folklore of Christmastide . Jolly Santa Claus Jolly , jolly Santa Claus , lean your ear this way ! Do n't tell a single soul what I 'm going to say ; Christmas Eve is coming soon ; Now you dear old man , Whisper what you 'll bring to me , Softly as you can .

St. Nicholas In the Eastern Church there were two celebrations in honor of St. Nicholas , one on December 6 , and another on May 9 . The May celebration , which is still kept by the Italians , even in America , is said to be in honor of the removal of the relics of St. Nicholas to Bari . In Switzerland and Germany children before going to bed say the prayer : 98 " A Visit from St. Nicholas " Near the city of New York there once lived a prosperous farmer who was Professor of Divinity in a New York Theological Seminary as well , and who loved to write poetry when he found the time . One winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chatter of his children around him . It was very excited chatter that he heard , for this was Christmas Eve ? and what child is not excited on Christmas Eve ! Tonight St. Nicholas would come ! Tomorrow wonderful things would await them ! Listening , their father became very thoughtful . At last the children were persuaded by their mother to go to bed . But their father sat for a long time by the fire , thinking . Presently he rose and walked to his desk . Taking up a quill pen , he began to write : ' T was the night before Christmas , when all through the house Not a creature was stirring ? not even a mouse . It was more than a hundred years ago that Clement Clarke Moore wrote the poem . He wrote it for his own children . They ' loved it , and for generations other children , too , have loved it . Today it continues to be one of the most popular Christmas poems . Clement Moore , the author of that immortal poem , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 9911 graveyard near Trinity Church , at 15th Street , New York , and each year on Christmas Eve a pilgrimage is made to his grave . The story of the Nativity and tableaux of the scenes are given in the church service in the late afternoon , after which the pilgrims , with lighted flares and lanterns , enter the graveyard and wend their way to the grave where a brief prayer is offered for Clement Moore . A Visit from St. Nicholas ' T was the night before Christmas , when all through the house Not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse ; The stockings were hung by the chimney with care , In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there ; The children were nestled all snug in their beds , While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads ; And mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap , Had just settled our brains for a long winter 's nap ? When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter , I sprang from my bed to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a flash , Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash . The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow , Gave a luster of mid-day to objects below ; When , what to my wondering eyes should appear , But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer , With a little old driver , so lively and quick , I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick . More rapid than eagles his coursers they came , roof And he whistled , and shouted , and called them by name ; " Now , Dasher ; now , Dancer ; now , Prancer and Vixen : On Comet , on Cupid , on Donder and Blitzen ; To the top of the porch , to the top of the wall Now , dash away , dash away , dash away all . " As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly , When they meet with an obstacle , mount to the sky , So , to the housetop the coursers they flew With the sleigh full of toys ? and St. Nicholas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof . As I drew ' in my head , and was turning around , Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound . He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot , And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot ; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back , And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack . His eyes how they twinkled ! his dimples how merry ; His cheeks were like roses , his nose like a cherry ; His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow , And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow . The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth , And the smoke , it encircled his head like a wreath . He had a broad face and a little round belly That shook , when he laughed , like a bowl full of jelly . He was chubby and plump ? a right jolly old elf ; And I laughed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink of his eye , and twist of his head Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread . He spoke not a word , but went straight to his work , And filled all the stockings ; then turned with a jerk , And laying his finger aside of his nose , ' or And giving a nod , up the chimney he rose . He sprang to his sleigh , to his team gave a whistle , And away they all flew like the down of a thistle ; But I heard him exclaim , ere he drove out of sight : " Happy Christmas to all , and to all a good-night . " Santa Claus Bottles During the first half of the nineteenth century many people journeyed to Poland Springs , Maine , to drink of its healing waters which had become quite famous . It was the custom frequently to carry away a bottle of the water for the home folks to sample . Being the era of curious and fanciful bottles and flasks , a bottle supposed to represent " Santa Claus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them have been made and used ever since . These bottles known as " Santa Claus Bottles " are much sought after and treasured by collectors of bottles and Early American Glass . The Old Nick It is interesting to note , but not easy to associate the name of St. Nicholas with that of the " Old Nick " as the protector of evil . St. Nicholas was venerated as the patron and protector of seamen which included pirates , and his bcnef ? icence had a wide scope . The story grew from belief rather than belief from story , that he afforded protection to robbers and thieves . 102 A more plausible explanation accounts for his name associated with thieves . It refers to the thieves who had stolen goods left under the guardianship of St. Nicholas ' image , and who were compelled by the Saint to restore the goods . Whatever the cause , the association became well established and robbers and thieves were called St. Nicholas ' clerks . In this connection it might be observed that from the earliest times among the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a water spirit or monster . Among Teutonic peoples this spirit is known by various names such as Nix , Nickel , Nickelman , Nick , Nokke , etc . Millers are said to be particularly afraid of this monster and to throw different things into the water on December 6 ( St. Nicholas ' day ) to propitiate it . In Scandinavia in the character of Nikur , he is supposed to inhabit lakes and rivers where he raises sudden storms and leads mankind to destruction . In earlier times Danish peasantry conceived of the Nokke as a monster with human head , dwelling both in fresh and salt water . When anyone was drowned , they said : " Nokken tag ham bort " ( " the Nokke took him away ) . The Icelandic Neck appears in the form of a horse on the seashore . If anyone mounts him , he gallops off and plunges into the water . 103 In France a similar water monster is known that seizes fishermen who walk without permission by the waterside at nightfall . It has claws and tears the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach . In England as early as the eighth century , water monsters , malevolent in character , were known . These are called " niceras . " The name " Old Nick " familiar since the early seventeenth century seems to have originated in the conception of this water monster . The malevolent character of this water spirit caused the name to be used as that of an evil spirit or devil . St. Nicholas with his attributes as controller of the waters , when in the eleventh century he became known in the West , became confused with the vaguely conceived pagan water spirit of similar name , thereby influencing the form of his name .

As for me , dear old Santa , I leave it to you , Some skates or a drum and kite . 104 ) Hertha the Goddess of the Home In Pre-Christian days the Norse goddess Hertha ( or Bertha ) was considered the goddess of the home . When families gathered , great altars of flat stone were erected and here a fire was kindled with fir boughs . It was believed that Hertha descended through the smoke and brought good fortune and guidance to all those present . Hertha 's altar stones became the hearthstones of the home and the connection of Santa Claus coming down the chimney can easily be imagined as a variation . Christmas Stockings The popular custom of using stockings to hold gifts and goodies on Christmas originated , it is said , when St. Nicholas dropped a purse of money down the chimney as a gift to a poor family one Christmas Eve . Instead of falling on the hearth , the purse rolled into a stocking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . The Boy Bishop A curious medieval custom in schools and ecclesiastical centers of the Continent was the election of a " Boy Bishop , " on St. Nicholas Day in memory of the good bishop St. Nicholas or Santa Claus . The boy so elected was recognized and allowed great 105 privileges over his school fellows during the Christmas season and often special vestments used for the occasion were part of the church property and were of considerable value . The young bishop for the time being was expected to nominate his officials , to hold services in the choir , and to actually preach and parade in procession . This ancient ceremony , fallen into disuse since the days of Queen Elizabeth , was revived at New Romney , Kent , England , recently when Nicholas Smith , 12 years old , was elected " Boy Bishop . " The Christmas Tree A legendary story mentions that the Christmas tree was introduced into Germany from Sweden . During the Thirty Years ' War , a wounded Swedish officer who was cared for by the people near Leipzig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas as an offering of gratitude . A French legend of the thirteenth century tells of a knight who found a tree , the branches of which were covered with burning candles , some standing erect , others upside down and on the top a vision of a child with a halo around its head . Asking for an explanation , it was declared that the tree represented mankind , the child , the Saviour , and the candles good and bad human beings . As early as 1604 an authentic manuscript by a Strass zo6 burg burgher refers to fir trees set up at Christmas in the homes there , and decorated with roses cut of manycolored paper , gold foil , apples , etc. , but no mention of lights is made . Reminiscent of a form of Christmas tree was an old English custom of fastening torches on the branches of a young ash tree . These were lighted and the tree carried round the streets of the village accompanied with music . When the torches had burned out , the tree was scrambled for by the partisans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite inn where the night was spent in merrymaking . This custom , however , was observed on Twelfth Night . Long before the Christmas tree was thought of , an ancient custom of adding a floral praise to the Christmas festival was observed in different parts of Europe . Three or four weeks before the feast , boughs of hawthorn , cherry , and other trees were cut and placed in water in a warm place and they came to bloom for Christmas . Even now , some people show with pride apple- or plum-tree branches having flowers at Christmastime . Some old prints show the Christmas tree hanging from rafters in the ceiling instead of standing on the floor or table . 107 Christmas Tree Don'ts The Christmas season always brings joy , but it also may bring tragedy into the home . With this thought in mind , warnings are sounded . They follow : Do n't use lighted candles for decorating the tree , use carefully wired electric lights . Do n't put the tree near a stove , fireplace , or radiator . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mica or flake asbestos for artificial snow . Do n't let Santa wear cotton trimmings or cotton whiskers . Do n't place the tree where it will obstruct any exit of a room . Do n't put lighted candles near window curtains , paper wreaths , and decorations . Electric candles are safer . Do n't keep the tree until it dries out . Do n't fail to anchor the tree firmly . Christmas Tree Quilt Pattern An old-time quilt pattern fashioned in the form of a tree was called " Christmas Tree Quilt Pattern . " It is one of the many lovely quilt patterns treasured and handed down by our grandmothers . Various Kinds of Christmas Trees There are pines and hemlocks , cedars and junipers , spruces and firs or balsam . The fir is the ideal Christmas tree to use . The needles are not sharp pointed and the tree becomes a golden brown before it sheds . It is often found with cones . The foliage of the spruce is sharp pointed and pricks the hand when grasped tightly and it quickly sheds its needles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its narrow needlelike leaves and sheds its foliage rapidly when kept in a warm room . Pines lack symmetry and are not popular as Christmas trees . Their needlelike leaves are found in clusters of three and five . They are more frequently used in making wreaths for which purpose they are excellent . Red cedars and junipers are seldom used as Christmas trees and are seldom shipped . The foliage is dark , lacks color , and the trees produce bluish berries instead of cones . Christmas Greens The holly was originally the Holy Tree and tradition says that unknown before , it sprang up in perfection and beauty beneath the footsteps of Christ when He first trod the earth and that though man has for 109 gotten its attributes , the beasts all reverence it and are never known to injure it . In France the red berries of the holly are called " Little Apples of St. John . " Some whimsical beliefs regarding the holly have arisen . If the holly is smooth , the wife will get the upper hand , but if it be prickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . Holly decorations made at home and intended for the church should be made on the ground floor as it is considered unlucky if done in an upper room . Church holly , that is , holly actually used as a decoration in church , is supposed to insure good luck to the possessor and to ward off lightning . Holly was thought to be peculiarly hateful to witches , and sprigs of the berried plant hung on the bed on Christmas Eve were sure to induce pleasant dreams . Hollywood , California Hollywood , or Hollywood farm which it covered , was so called because of the large number of holly trees growing on it . Mistletoe Mistletoe when used at Christmas time is considered for its romantic sentiment . All other features seem against it . rro It is scarce and therefore expensive , and is rather difficult to find except in florist 's shops in the larger cities . It is entirely pagan in symbolism . When used , a spray is cunningly hung over a doorway or place of vantage beneath which the romantic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured by its berries , one of which is plucked off after every kiss and handed to the maiden . When there are no berries left , the privilege of kissing ceases . A curious myth relates that the mistletoe bore the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden , and that from its wood the holy cross was hewn . The Rosemary Plant In bygone times rosemary was classed with holly , mistletoe , and ivy as Christmas greens but has long since lost this favor . It was used rather for its fragrance than its color . Legend cites that this odor was acquired when the Virgin hung the swaddling clothes of her Infant upon the bush to dry . According to Spanish tradition the bloom of the rosemary plant was originally white , but during the flight into Egypt as the Holy Family rested for a short time , Mary laid her purple mantle over a rosemary bush and in her honor the flowers changed from white to a deep lavender . III Other Christmas Greens Ivy , laurel , yew , and cypress possessed romance and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badge of the wine god Bacchus , was , however , unable to break away from its pagan level . When used , it was chiefly delegated to the decorations outside the house . The ivy was peculiarly considered the woman 's plant , while the holly was the man 's plant and many jests found their way in song and poetry regarding their rivalry . Fifteenth-Century Carol Holly and Ivy made a great party Who should have the mastery , In landes where they go . Then spoke Holly " 1 am free and jolly I will have the mastery , In landes where we go . " Then spake Ivy , " I am lov 'd and prov 'd And I will have the mastery , In landes where we go . " Then spake Holly , and set him down on his knees , " I pray thee , gentle Ivy , Say me no villainy , In landes where we go . " Ivy has never been considered a Christmas plant in 1121 our country , but in England where it so often clothes old buildings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that ivy is a part of life and an inspirer of sentiment . The laurel as an emblem of triumph and victory found favor as a Christmas decoration . By the ancient Greeks the laurel tree was called Daphne , because it was supposed to contain the spirit of that wood nymph . The American laurel is not really a laurel , but because of its evergreen qualities and similarity in shape and size to Europe 's laurel , it received the name and with the name , the traditions . Its use as a Christmas green is of rather recent date . Cypress and yew have been sometimes used , but their funereal associations render them out of place at the joyous feast of Christmas . The fir afforded a kind of natural incense to the incarnate Deity . Perhaps this is why it is considered as especially suited for church adornment ; it may also be its fragrance that makes it the favorite of the Christmas trees . Singularly , the olive , at all times regarded as the emblem of peace , has found no association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and various other plants often used as Christmas decorations have no Christmas associations , and are substitutes used solely for decorative purposes . This is also true of the poinsettia . 1131 Christmas Plants Lovely flowering plants are always acceptable gifts and especially at Christmas time . A few hints may help to prolong their beauty . Did you receive a poinsettia ? The leaves so frequently fall off long before the flower is dead . The reason is , they do not get all the water they need , although the soil may be wet . The leaves should be sprayed each day with tepid water , without wetting the flowers . A rubber bulb such as is used in sprinkling clothes before ironing , is ideal for spraying . Get the leaves really wet , then leave the plant to drip . Your poinsettia will then keep its foliage as long as its flowers . The plant should also be kept in an even temperature , and away from draughts . The soil should be kept moist . It is a milkweed and needs plenty of water . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cut to within four inches of the soil , and stored in the basement . It should be given only enough water to keep it alive while it is resting . In the spring the plant should be repotted in rich earth , and the container sunk to the rim in the garden . Water during the summer . In the fall you will have a beautiful plant which should have plenty of blossoms . The Jerusalem cherry , sweet pepper plant , and almost any plant which has thin papery leaves , like constant spraying . Set these plants in a sunny window " 4 is r while flowering , turn around each day , and do not let them get chilled . The cyclamen with its beautiful heavy leaves needs plenty of water , but it must be given it from underneath . Never pour the water on the top of the soil or the bulb will rot and the leaves turn yellow and mushy . This is the secret of keeping the cyclamen healthy ? plenty of water each day from underneath . Never wet the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largeleaved begonias must not have their leaves sprayed . The Christmas cactus ( crab cactus ) must only be watered when the soil is dry , or the buds will fall . Do not spray the cactus . Set it in your most sunny window and all the buds will open . The Glastonbury Thorn Legend asserts that after Christ 's death , St. Joseph of Arimathea journeyed to England and settled at Glastonbury . He stuck his staff into the ground and it immediately took root and put forth leaves , and on the following day , which happened to be Christmas , was covered with snow-white blossoms . On every recurring Christmas Eve it continued to bloom . During the times of war this tree was destroyed , but others which are descended from it by cuttings , still survive and are believed to retain its characteristic . In former years it was the custom for the youth of 1151 both sexes to assemble under the tree on Christmas Evc in order to hear the bursting of the buds into flowers , for it was believed you could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king and queen with a flowering branch of the Glastonbury Thorn on Christmas day . The Cross at Christmas Time Occasionally a lighted cross is seen as part of Christmas decorations . The symbol , however , is not in keeping with the gay spirit of Christmastide . The cross reflects the sorrows of Good Friday and it is inappropriate to throw the shadow of the Cross over the world 's rejoicing at the Babe of Bethlehem . Christmas Star The star emblematic of Christmas is always a five pointed star . Christmas Beliefs and Sayings A family Christmas tradition holds that the Blessed Mother and her Babe , or some stranger instead , are likely to rap at the door on Christmas Eve and ask for food and shelter . With this thought in mind , some folks eagerly listen for a knock at the door during the meal on Christmas Eve and whoever hears the knock has good luck and great fortune in store for them . All who helped bring in the Yule log were supposed to be insured against witchcraft for the coming year . rz6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log , the fire will burn dull . If a squinting or barefooted person came in while the Yule log was burning , he would bring ill luck . If by any chance the Christmas fire goes out , it is an unlucky sign . The ashes of the Christmas log were supposed to give fertility to the ground , to rid the cattle of vermin , to cure toothache , and to protect the house from fire . Placing a half-burned splinter from the Christmas log under the bed was a charm against lightning . Embers of the Yule log laid between the branches of young fruit trees were supposed to promote their growth . It was believed that the ashes , if put in a well , would keep the water pure . In Italy the ashes are preserved as a protection against hail . An old Christmas superstition which is not yet quite extinct , is that regarding " First footings . " It relates to the person who first enters the house on Christmas morning . A woman or girl is thought to bring ill luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must always bring something into the house before anything is taken out . It is further held that a dark-haired man insures better luck than one who is fair . Somewhat similar is the belief that the luckiest person in the house during the next year would be the one who first opened the door " to let Christmas in. " " 7 In as many houses as you eat a mince pie in the twelve days of Christmas , so many happy months will you have in the year . An Italian proverb says " He has more to do than the ovens in England at Christmas . " When Christmas falls on a Friday , you may sow in ashes , i.e. , the harvest of the ensuing year will be so bountiful that seed sown anywhere will grow . When the cock crows in the stillness of the December night the saying is " The cock is crowing for Christmas . " It is said meowing of the household cat on Christmas Eve , and especially during the evening meal , portends some ill luck . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially dear and are supposed to possess the gift of seeing beyond external objects and hearing music not of this earth . It is thought that the Guardian Angel of every household becomes visible to one of its members between midnight and dawn on Christmas , but is seldom seen as the exact time of his appearance is unknown . If the baby smiles in his sleep the angel has whispered to it of heaven . There is an Irish belief that the gates of Paradise are open on Christmas Eve and anyone dying that night enters heaven at once without going to Purgatory . It used to be believed that angels left heaven on Christmas Eve commissioned to awaken infants from their sleep and carry them to Paradise to sing a carol for the Christ Child , after which they were safely restored to their beds . A divination by means of " St. Thomas ' onion " was often practiced at Christmas time . Girls would peel an onion , wrap it in a handkerchief and put it under their pillows at night . This was supposed to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly supposed that the wind which prevails on the twelve days of Christmastide will blow during each of the twelve months ? the first corresponding to January , the second to February , etc . It is said " If wheat be kept in one 's pocket during Christmas services and then given to the fowls , they will grow fat and lay many eggs . " ' German peasants have a belief that bread moistened by Christmas dew has magical powers . Such bread thrown into a dangerous fire is supposed to extinguish the flames , and if put into the fodder of the cattle it makes them prolific and healthy throughout the year . A quaint belief in mining districts was that on Christmas Eve , High Mass was sung by invisible choristers in the mine which contains the richest lode of ore . Whom Christmas doen not make cheerful , Easter will leave sad and tearful . End now the White Loafe and the Pye And let all sports with Christmas dye . 119 11 Joy to the World joy to the world ! the Lord is come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare Him room , And heav'n and nature sing , And heav'n and nature sing , And heav'n , and heav'n and nature sing . 2 joy to the world !

Her father , Joachim , hailed from Nazareth in Galilee , while Anna , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their substance and possessions into three equal parts . One portion they gave to the temple , another they distributed among the poor , while the third part they reserved for themselves . They had made a vow that if the Lord blessed them with offspring , they would yield the child to the service of the Lord and thus Mary was brought up in the temple . When she was fourteen years old , an angel appeared to Zacharias , the high priest , and informed him of the destiny of Mary . Among the suitors aspiring to marry the " Virgin of the Lord " was Joseph , the carpenter , a righteous man , and a widower . Through a sign made known by the Lord , Joseph was chosen as the man to take the Virgin of the Lord and keep her for Him . So Joseph took Mary to his house in Nazareth . It was here the Annunciation took place . According to legend it was in the early springtime , at eventide , soon after sunset , as Mary went to draw water from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " Hail Mary , full of grace . " Looking to the right and left she saw no one . Returning to her house she sat down to work when the Archangel Gabriel bearing a lily in his hand ap 123 peared and announced that she was to be the mother of God . According to another version , it happened at dawn , as Mary was spinning the purple for the curtain in the temple of the Lord . She was seated at her wheel when an angel stood before her and greeted her with his salutation . This happened two months after the Holy Virgin had been betrothed to Joseph . Midnight at Bethlehem At last Thou art come , little Saviour ; And Thine angels fill midnight with song ; Thou art come to us , gentle Creator , Whom Thy creatures have sighed for so long . Thou art come to Thy Beautiful Mother ; She has looked on Thy marvelous face ; Thou art come to us , Maker of Mary ; And she was Thy channel of Grace . Thou halt brought with Thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our hearts are half-broken , dear Jesus ! With the joy of this wonderful night . We have waited so long for Thee , Saviour ! Art Thou come to us , dearest , at last ? Oh , bless Thee , dear Joy of Thy Mother ! This is worth all the wearisome past ! Z24 Thou art come , Thou art come , Child of Mary ! Yet we hardly believe Thou art come ; It seems such a wonder to have Thee , New Brother with us in our home . Thou wilt stay with us , Master and Maker ! Thou wilt stay with us now evermore ; We will play with Thee , Beautiful Brother ! On Eternity 's jubilant shore . ? Father Faber The Crib The making of cribs at Christmas time is a worthwhile project for schools . In some places crib displays are held and awards are given for the most original and artistic productions . With but few suggestions and instructions to begin with , the ingenuity of the worker will sometimes produce surprising results . It should be remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in evidence until January 6 , as that is the day they are supposed to have arrived , they may , however , be seen approaching in the background . Impulse to use miniature automobiles in the landscape is not in keeping with the time represented ; namely , Christ 's birth . Legend declares that at this time an annual fair was held at Bethlehem , and that there were present people 125J of many tribes and many lands . Naturally these persons plied all trades and brought with them paraphernalia and animals of all kinds . Thus fancy and imagination have great scope in planning the ensemble and extent of a crib . According to authorities the stable where Jesus was born was 32 ft. g% in. in length and 13 ft. 11/2 in. in width . The manger that He was placed into was 2 ft. 6 in. in length and i ft. 6% in. in width . Cradle Rocking In past centuries a curious custom of " Cradle Rocking " ( Kindel wiegen ) arose and was long popular in many countries , especially in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while carols were sung . This was done as a real act of devotion . Originally , a religious service , it became domestic . The custom , however , is now practically abolished . The Star of Bethlehem The " Star of Bethlehem , " a Christmas pageant , is offered as an example of a Christmas program that is filled with suggestions . It is very elastic and may be enlarged upon or any part used singly as desired and according to the number of characters and size of stage available . The tableaux used alone with the accompanying readings and singing of the Christmas carols make a 126 very popular and splendid program and if followed by a Christmas tree with Santa Claus himself distributing candy and nuts to the children , it would make an ideal Christmas program .

His thoughts were now of the home and family he had left two years ago , and it was yet a two days ' ride before he could reach them .

" A moment later he was in the courtyard , but no servants came to the gate . He pushed the gate open and entered ; all seemed deserted . The sound of wailing greeted his ears . With fear in his heart , Caspar hurried down the corridor which led to the living rooms of his family . The wailing continued and he saw it came from the servants huddled together at the entrance to one of the rooms . From them he learned that his son lay dying within the room . Caspar pushed aside the heavy silken hangings and stepped into the room .
