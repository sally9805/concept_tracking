THE GONCOURT JOURNALS-Edmond &; Jules de Goncourt ; edited and translated by Lewis Galantiere-Doubleday , Doran ( $3.50 ) . <P> In the winter of 1849 two young brothers arrived in Paris to make their literary fortune . Polished , aristocratic , neurasthenic , comfortably off , Edmond ( 27 ) and Jules ( 19 ) were an extraordinarily close corporation . They not only lived together in nearly continuous amity until death dissolved their partnership , they collaborated in all their writing , thought alike on nearly every subject and kept a joint diary . Little of their 30-odd collaborations-plays , novels , history , criticism-has survived into the 20th Century , but their Journals may be counted on to keep their memories green . Much of that racy record is still withheld . From the material now available Lewis Galantiere last week offered U. S. readers a scintillating selection . <P> The Goncourts began their journal in 1851 , on the day their first novel was scheduled to appear . Unfortunately it was also the day Louis Napoleon Bonaparte had chosen for the coup d'etat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the political shuffle . In their fight for fame the brothers encountered even graver difficulties . Rabid anti-romantics , they wrote such painstakingly realistic novels that old-line critics whooped " sculptured slime . . . literature of putrescence . " To younger men , such as Emile Zola , the Goncourts were prophetic pioneers . Gradually they built up a literary circle- Gautier , Sainte-Beuve , Flaubert , Renan , Taine-who used to meet fortnightly to dine well , talk how they liked . On one of these occasions , Gautier rebuked a silent guest : " As for you , I hope that the next time you come , you will compromise yourself . We all compromise ourselves here , and it is not fair that you sit by dispassionately observing us . " The members ' talk was not always as enamelled as their published words . On another occasion Gautier pierced a hubbub of argument by remarking : " I am very strong . I can hit 357 on the Turk 's head at the Fair , and what is more , my metaphors make sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Criticism consists in saying whatever comes into one 's head . That is all there is to it . " Dispassionate observers , in spite of friendship , was just what the Goncourts were . Of their great friend Flaubert they report : " He works ten hours a day but is a great waster of time , forgetting himself in things he picks up to read , and constantly running away from the book he is writing . He hardly ever warms to his work before five in the evening , although he sits down invariably at noon . . . a very honest nature . . . but still never perfectly sincere . " <P> The Goncourt brothers never married , prided themselves on sharing a Rubens-esque blonde mistress . ( Editor Galantiere raises eyebrows at this , suggests that in this case , too , Edmond was a dispassionate observer . ) But that they were men of the world , not mere bourgeois scriveners , their journal amply witnesses . They were as much at home in a princess ' salon as in an actress ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
