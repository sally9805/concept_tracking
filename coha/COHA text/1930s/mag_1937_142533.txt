In 1935 hollow-eyed Pola Negri , oldtime cinemactress whose professional peak was reached in 1920 in Passion , found herself in serious difficulties with peppery little German Minister for Propaganda Dr. Paul Joseph Goebbels . In the belief that Cinemactress Negri ( real name : Appollonia Chalupec ) was a Polish Jewess , Minister Goebbels refused her permission to act in Germany . Suddenly this order was overruled by the Fhrer himself . " Investigation , " read the official communiqu , " instituted by the Reichsfhrer has established that Pola Negri is Polish and therefore Aryan " ( TIME , Feb. 11 , 1935 ) . Pink with pleasure , Actress Negri cried : " The whole world knows that I am a Catholic . . . . Der Fhrer must be a brilliant man . I have n't met him , but I would like to . You know , I have a lot of big men in my memories . " <P> This episode brought Miss Negri much valuable publicity , several jobs , before she slipped into comparative obscurity again . Last week resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Bovary , Pola Negri had cause to be grateful to the name of Hitler once more . Acting on a tip from Paris , the wildly sensational London Sunday Referee printed a startling story : recently Actress Negri had admitted to her mother that she was having an affair with someone in Germany , and added , " I can say no more than that he is a very very famous person . " In Berlin she had been seen several times at informal parties squired by the Fhrer . <P> Spreading of these stories , plus the revival of the old one about Miss Negri 's Jewish blood , caused Handsome Adolf to burst into tears . Sobbed he : " The slanderers ! The slanderers ! " Later he was reported to have sent secret agents to Poland to prove once and for all Pola Negri 's Aryan ancestry . <P> When the story reached Poland , vanloads of police descended upon the offices of the Warsaw Kurjer Codzienny and of the Katowice Polonia , seized every copy of their editions rehashing the Referee 's story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week was Count Charles de Chambrun , retired French Ambassador to Rome recovering from a pistol shot in the groin , fired by sultry Madeleine de Fontanges who accused him of breaking up her romance with Benito Mussolini ( TIME , March 29 et seq . ) . Cried the Count : " I swear I never in my life occupied myself with Mme de Fontanges ' personal affairs . " <P> Changing her own story last week , Mme de Fontanges claimed that it was the burning jealousy of white-thatched Joseph Paul-Boncour , former Premier of France , that really ended her glorious idyll with Il Duce.
