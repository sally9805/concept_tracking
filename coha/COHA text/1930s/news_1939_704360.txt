txt The United States Government has taken its first material step to aid Finland , which is the only nation to pay its debt installments in full , by opening credits of $10,000,000 through the Export-Import Bank and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation with which Finland can buy " agricultural surpluses and other civilian supplies " here . Announcement of the credits today gave concrete expression to the sympathy previously expressed in official circles for Finland in her effort to preserve her independence in the . face of Soviet Russia 's attacks . The credits are expected to aid Finland in meeting the economic pressure that Russia is exerting , together with the use of armed force , to beat her small opponent into submission . Shipment via Scandinavia Shipments of vitally needed foodstuffs and cotton can reach Finland through the Scandinavian countries , despite the Stalin government 's naval blockade , since the Gulf of Bothnia , between Sweden and Finland , is protected by mines and still open to transit . Finland has been attempting , also , to find means of purchasing in this country airplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 4,000,000 citizens behind it , has informed a number of governments , including that of the United States , that it can withstand the army of Russia 's 180,000,000 people almost indefinitely , but that it needs concrete aid in the way of war supplies , particularly planes , if it is to do so . Thus far , this government , in part it is understood because of the fear of being accused of unneutral action , has not advanced credits for such supplies . A Finnish military purchasing commission is at present in this country . The announcement of the opening of government credits to the Finns , which was made by Jesse H. Jones , Federal Loan Administrator , was held certain to have a decided effect in showing both Finland and other powers that the United States is willing to stand behind Finland with more than words . Some Finnish circles expressed optimism that more effective aid would be forthcoming later , even though the Finnish Minister , Hjalmar J. Procope , refused to discuss this aspect of the situation . Mr. Jones said that President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up The $10,000,000 worth of credits have been opened for the FinnishAmerican Trading Corporation , a New York corporation , " organized by the Finnish Minister with a paid-in capital stock of $1,000,000 and guaranteed by the Bank of Finland or the Finnish Government , " Mr. Jones said . Mr. Jones also announced that " similar credits to Norway " were being considered by the ExportImport Bank and the RFC . This was regarded as significant , since Norway also is considered as threatened by a possible Soviet advance toward ports on the Atlantic in Northern Norway . The establishment of the Finnish credits is the result of negotiations that have been under way for some days and grows out of an expressed desire on the part of the American Government to extend aid to Finland . President Roosevelt made clear last week the desire of this ' government to aid Finland in every possible way and indicated that he would favor Congressional action to refund to Finland at least part of the installments that country has paid on her debt to the United States . Methods of extending immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past week . Finland 's credit is so good that under ordinary circumstances she would have had little trouble in getting loans to obtain food and other supplies through normal banking channels or from this government . With the country 's very life threatened , however , normal financing conditions do not prevail ; and the credits now opened therefore showed clearly this government 's confidence in Finland as ' well as its readiness to aid . Finland has regularly paid the United States $469,386 a year in semi-annual installments to meet interest and amortization charges on war debts . As the only nation to make prompt and full payments on war debts , it is the only one of the nations to which the United States advanced funds during , or immediately after , the World War to which this government can now give credit . The Johnson Act prohibits lending to those nations that have not met payments on the socalled war debts . The Neutrality Act prohibits loans to countries declared by the President to be at war . Russia has not formally declared war on Finland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war " as an interior measure , the Finnish Governmeht has not formally declared war on the Soviet Union . Under the present application of the Neutrality Act American ships can travel to Norway so long as they do not go south of Bergen and goods can be transported from Norway to Sweden and then across the Gulf of Bothnia to Finland . Foreign ships presumably could also transport goods for Finland across the Atlantic . In diplomatic circles it is known that , much as Finland wants and need food supplies , the Finnish Government has been hopeful that the United States , which Finns have long felt their closest friend among world powers , would speed the shipment of privately purchased planes to Finland , giving them preference over those for the major powers at war and that some means , of financing such transactions might be arranged . Officials here have been studying the extent to which this nation might go in giving Finland such help without itself becoming involved directly in the struggle against the Soviet . Thus far , as far as can be learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed circles it was thought possible that the assistance given Finland for buying cotton and wheat and other foodstuffs to feed a nation that has practically its whole male population at the front , might be only the prelude to even more aid .

President Roosevelt said on Dec. 5 that he had asked secretary of the Treasury Henry MoVgenthau Jr . to place in a suspense account in the Treasury the $234,693 installment on Finland 's debt to be paid Dec. 15 , and that Congress might consider legislation enabling the money to be used for the benefit of the Finns .
