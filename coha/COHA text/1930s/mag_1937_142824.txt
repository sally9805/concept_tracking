St. Bernard dogs have a record of ten centuries of heroic achievement behind them . But Dr. Jean Bremond was not thinking about records when he demanded last fortnight that all the dogs at the Great St. Bernard Hospice in Switzerland be destroyed , that the monks stop breeding them . If this were done , Dr. Bremond said he would not sue the monastery over the horrible death of his ten-year-old daughter , Marie-Anne , fatally mangled by a pack of St. Bernards as she and her father skied up to the hospice last month ( TIME , May 31 ) . <P> Dr. Bremond argued that the dogs of St. Bernard no longer serve a useful purpose since traveling conditions in the mountains have improved . The monks breed them only to sell and as objects of curiosity , he claimed . He found a few sympathizers in the district who said the St. Bernard breed has degenerated , that Swiss gendarmes have been forced to kill several dogs grown vicious because the monks keep them tied up for long periods , allowing them off leashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on two continents came to the defense of this noble breed 's original strain . Newspapers as far removed in editorial policy as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and New York Sun published editorials urging mercy . The St. Bernard , said the Sun , " ought in fairness to be judged by his long and respectable history , not by the crimes of an occasional rogue . " <P> Meanwhile the Swiss gendarmerie completed its investigation of the dogs who killed Marie-Anne Bremond , announced last week that they were " of general good nature and not a public danger . " No dogs were ordered destroyed , but three who might prove dangerous were to be sent over the border to an Italian dog farm . Later in the week , one of the monks at the St. Bernard Hospice told United Press that the monks had voluntarily destroyed these three dogs , that eight others will be kept under observation all summer in an enclosed park . Next winter the monks plan to let their dogs " continue working normally . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
