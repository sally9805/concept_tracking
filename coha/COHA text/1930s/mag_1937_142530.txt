British police who have spent the past year vainly trying to keep Palestine 's Jews and Arabs from each other 's throats were faced with a new poser last week . In a shallow grave in an orange grove near Tel Aviv was discovered the moldering body of Jacob Zwanger , onetime Soviet Vice-Commissar of Harbors for the Black Sea region . The police discovered that he had been stabbed 17 times and strangled in the basement of a nearby house owned by Reuben Schenzvit , gunrunner and onetime salesman for the late munitions tycoon , Sir Basil Zaharoff . In the house was a radio transmitting set powerful enough to reach Europe , a dozen microphones and dictographs . Leading from the basement to the orange grove was a 400-yd. tunnel . <P> Schenzvit , ostensibly a land agent , was charged with murder . Arrested with him was a crony , Joseph Miller , a Nazi agent employed by the Third Reich to prevent Jews in Palestine from getting proscribed money out of Germany . Schenzvit had made a fat living during the Chaco War between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also shipped girls to South America , was still doing so until his arrest . Schenzvit and Miller met in Palestine , went into the arms-racket together , had a neat arrangement whereby Schenzvit sold guns to the Jews , Miller to the Arabs . The murdered Zwanger , employed by Schenzvit , sealed his own doom by knowing too much . <P> To this thick plot another ingredient was added when the electrician who had installed Schenzvit 's radio committed suicide . In his house the police found charred papers showing Italian writing . For months there have been rumors of Italian agents subsidizing riotous Arab leaders to embarrass Britain . The police , looking next for a " beautiful blonde spy " said to have been in Schenzvit 's confidence , declared : " We have crossed the trail of one of the most important and alarming espionage rings in the history of the Near East . " Among other things , Schenzvit was " plotting to free Palestine from Britain 's rule . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
