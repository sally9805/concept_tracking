CIVILIZATION A STORY BY R. HERNEKIN BAPTIST M UNDASI lived in such fair wide country . It was a country of high yellow grass , but from one point not far from his father 's kraal you could see a blue line which he had been told was water . As a young boy in the kraal how happy he had been , as happy as any young boy should be that has never known the corroding influence of civilization those strange stealthy changes which spread in a night or two like the blighting fungus under the leaves of a lusty plant . A night or two . . . a decade . .. a century or so . . . . What is time ? How did it begin , this great trouble which tore Mundasi 's heart in two as he stumbled away from the dark stairway of a London office into a terrifying fog ? It was fog , that dreadful manifestation of the white man 's world , which had all but driven Mundasi back to the docks and to the sea which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog wept dolorously around him , chilled his shivering heart , blinded his staring incredulous eyes . What did they stare at , those suffering eyes ? Nothing but the fading of a dream . Only a dream , but it was the same dream which had beckoned Mundasi to cross the sea . To cross the sea ! Why , even that is adventure enough for a man bred in a kraal , a boy to whom the word sea means one bright strip of blue in thelandscape . Mundasi remembered the day  --  he was only fifteen at the time  --  when the news came that the youngest of his uncles , a fine man of twenty-five , had gone down with eight hundred other young warriors while on their way over the water to protect the white king from enemy tribes . Gone down into the deep water as if the watchful monarch of all crocodiles had pulled them under . They at least had kept their dreams , for they certainly believed they were to be allowed to fight for the king , although not , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young men defending their chief . Yet some of his father 's friends who had been on other ships had safely returned , although always drunk and at the beer-pot : these had told the kraal that honorable fighting was allowed only to white men , and that proud young black warriors had been made , in view of all the world , to work like women at fetching and carrying and digging . Yes , they had been herded defiliugly together , not even allowed to go afar into the bush to perform those daily acts which even the animals do in secret . Oh , yes , yes , his uncle who had gone down in the sea with his companions had at least saved his pride . And these young men had not spent two hundred golden sovereigns collected by the tribe for their great journey . Yes , his uncle the headman had insisted on showing the assembled council the wonderful sight of two hundred gold sovereigns . All had crowded forward with deep cries to see the dazzling sight . If only the Reverend Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exchanged them for paper money , surely then it could not have wasted away so quickly . But who can watch over paper money ? The Reverend Mr. Macdonald had given him a few sheets of it , and all the rest , he said , was sent to London to be kept safe there for his use . All he would have to do would be to sign his name whenever he wanted money . If only they had let him keep the gold in his old monkey-skin bag hanging on his belt , it would not now be nearly gone . Even a stupid person understands gold . All but gone , they told him at the bank , and his long delayed mission .. . At the thought of his failure shame hit him a sudden sickening blow in the pit of his stomach . The fog was getting thicker . At that moment Mundasi stumbled badly against a black and greasy curbstone . For a moment he knelt helplessly there on the London pavement , one arm thrown over his eyes with that child 's gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My heart is so sore ! " he cried once in his beautiful tongue . " My heart is so sore ! " he crooned softly over and over . But no one heard Mundasi except two thin little London boys . Having observed this exciting phenomenon they hastened to the corner where the " Red Bull " sent its brave lights out into the fog to tell the policeman on duty there that there was a drunken nigger on the pavement . Constable Jenkins ' bulky form walked leisurely to the scene and he had a good look . His experienced eyes saw something in that forlorn figure which hadnot been visible to the room full of clever politicians who had assembled in preoccupied haste for half an hour in order to listen to the lifelong grievance of an important tribe like the Xemandas . " Come , sir , do n't take it so hard . We all has our ups and downs . There 's a place round the corner here . Go and have a cup o ' coffee or a drop of something warm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the great red hand on his shoulder . " I ca n't help it  --  my heart is so sore ! " " To be sure . To be sure , " rumbled Constable Jenkins . " We all get like that sometimes . Come , sir , up you get ! " He raised the shivering form of Mundasi . The figure that had looked so beautiful and imposing only a few years back , before he had begun copying the dismal European fashion of other mission natives , now looked like some New York negro-revue artist . He had spent eight guineas on the suit , thirty shillings for the hat , the same for the shoes . The tie and gloves alone had cost ten shillings . But how could he help it ? Can a chief from one tribe visit the chief of another tribe and not do him the honor of full ceremonial dress ? What would these members of the King 's parliament have thought of his tribe had he appeared before them in Reverend Mr. Macdonald 's old gray suit and the magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dowered him  --  fussing over his appearance like any mother on that important day when he departed for the port of Bombasa . " Like this , Mundasi . This is the angle you must wear it . " Without a smile Mr. Hilary had instructed him by putting the hat on his own head as white men do . Mr. Hilary never smiled except at something called punch which he read every Monday morning . He was not one of those white men who regard the black man as a joke . On the boat Mundasi had been proud of his clothes . But a few months in London had made him conscious that even Reverend Mr. Macdonald 's suit and Mr. Ililary 's gray hat failed to reach the prevailing standard . Subtly and gradually his faith in those two beloved mentors was undermined . They had not told him about these wonderful pale young men with their scornful eyes and sleek clothes , their hats so foolish yet so desirable . Mundasi , son of a headman , grandson of the Chief , was made to feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last the day approached for the reading of his " Petition to ameliorate Present Conditions of Living of the Xemanda peoples , with Special Reference to their Need of Recovering certain of the old Tribal Lands for Agricultural Purposes ; with a view to easing the heavy burden of Taxes now suffered by them : together with some notes on the enforced labor of their women in certain parts of the Territory , " Mundasi had visited an outfitter 's establishment . With beating heart and shining eyes he had let them array him for the great indaba . " You see , " he prattled to the shop assistant , " I have to meet some gentlemen of the Parliament for important discussion . " " Have you indeed , sir ? " said the sprightly automatic voice of the salesman . How wonderful that had sounded at first  --  to be called " sir , " as if he had been a magistrate or a clergyman . As if he had been a white . . . No wonder it lured money from the pocket . The assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , while Mundasi watched his face trustfully , like an earnest child scrutinizing its helpful mother . " Something dark is what I recommend . No , sir , not that plum color . All right for a touch of it in the tie and the socks . These Parliamentary gentlemen are all for dark effects . But a little self-expression in the tie is allowable on most occasions . " Yes , that gentleman in the shop knew exactly what he was feeling . So did this policeman . How was it that Those Others had so utterly ? . . . Mundasi looked drearily down at his mud-stained knees . Eight guineas . " You 've got a good deal of mud on those good clothes of yours , sir . What I advise , if you 'll allow me , is to come with me to the wife . Only five minutes away , and she 'll sponge those trousers and brush you down in no time . I 'm just going off duty , so I 'll take you round with me . " Half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eating a good solid British tea , featuring toast and butter and jam and shrimps and cake . The shrimps he had not touched as his was not a fish-eating tribe . But all else . . And there was such a fine big fire at his back , a good solid coal fire that felt like hot sun . Repressions poured out of his mouth in a swelling stream only interrupted by the influx of jam and cake . It was the first time in England he had felt the melting warmth of intimate kindness . It was true he had gone to lunch with the kindly and bluff clergy . Bluffness , however , is a British quality not always understood by foreigners . He had been to lunch again with various good people of the social-worker type . He had also been taken to the theater by others not quite so good although more social . Kindly young men .. . But here , round Constable Jenkins ' table , was the atmosphere which , for the first time in England , released the festering sores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African sun into something he could talk about eagerly , endlessly . Constable Jenkins , his wife Mabel , and their little boy of four , Leslie , listened like three Desdemonas to this chance Othello at their humble board . Beautiful it was to Mundasi to be spoken to as a human being who for months had been treated as a Social Problem . The Native Question in the flesh . Yes , they spoke to him as a. simple human being ; but yet , with the wise recognition of the peasant class of one born to a higher estate , they called him " sir . " Mabel had been a gamekeeper 's daughter in Lancashire . Her husband too was a village man . Leslie , their son , was not yet at school : so he was still a fragment of unspoilt childhood as natural , as smiling , or as solemn as any naked kraal baby . Long before tea was over the little boy abandoned his shrimp debris and came to stand with unconscious admiration at the black man 's knee . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to your place at once . " But Leslie had solemnly uttered one word . Gazing up with his blue eyes of innocence into the sensitive lively dark face he said firmly , " Knee . " " He means ' e wants you to hold him on your knee , sir . You must excuse his bad manners . " Mundasi stopped his torrent of speech for the minute to meet the calm blue eyes of the being who offered this balm to his spirit . Uttering a deep and tender word in his own tongue , he gathered up the heavy little figure against his breast , as if it were a shield against all such icy beings as Parliamentary gentlemen . The little boy 's ear was pressed close to the black gentleman 's chest . The clock inside it , he thought , beat far quicker than Daddy 's . Sometimes very quick and then slower again . " You understand , Cunsbel , you understand , Missis , that for many months I prepare to be deputation for my people to great white Queen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reposed in my integrity . Reverend Macdonald , Mr. Hilary , they help me write it out in Queen 's English . Every day I go to their houses to be closeted there with important matters of state . Every day I take messages from my grandfather the Chief to Mr. Hilary and Reverend Macdonald . Mr. Hilary and Reverend Macdonald they send diplomatic messages to my grandfather the Chief . I deliver those messages . My father and the other headmen confer very often with the Chief concerning something called a policy . ( Your good husband , Missis , will explain these matters to you . In my country the women know not the meanings of such words . ) " Constable Jenkins cleared his throat appreciatively , authoritatively , while Mabel , his wife , said : " Well , that 's nature , as you may say , " and cosily poured out a third cup for her overlord . " You understand , council meeting held very often in the Chief 's kraal . I am in attendance with my notes of reference . Sometimes Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in notebooks what the Chief , my grandfather , say . They write what my father and the other headmen say . They even listen to my father 's chief wife as spokesman for the women of the tribe . Mr. Hilary most impressed by representation of all sections . All is cheerful . My people decide to evoke destiny by removing a deputation to English Parliament . Every day Mr. Hilary 's clerk writes out all the notes we have made on the big typewriter . Twelve pages only it made , the grievances and hardships of my people from memorial times to present day . The day comes for my de-parture . In my new clothes , presented by esteem of Mr. Hilary and Reverend Macdonald , I pay solemn farewell to the Chief and the headmen . I show them the manuscript tied up with official tape , very pink and pretty . There is beer . An ox is killed to honor the occasion . The young men dance . The young girls also dance . The Chief gives me wise words concerning deportment of deputation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation of bag of solid gold . Two hundred sovereigns collected in four years for important undertaking . Diplomatic importance . . . Mundasi 's voice thinned off shakily into silence . Mabel said , " It ! It ! " Constable Jenkins said , " My word , that 's a tidy sum ! " " All crowd round to see it , " proceeded Mundasi , recovering himself and giving Leslie a pat . " They want feel weight , etc. , etc . Many young children and women have never seen coin of gold . There is considerable astonishment at the power of our Chief . We drink beer . We laugh , we leap and shout . We think our troubles at a timely end ? " At the picture he had again conjured up Mundasi hid his sad , London face in the curly hair of Leslie while he felt for his expensive London handkerchief of purple silk  --  one of those aids to self-expression which the salesman had thought allowable in Parliamentary circles . " There , sir , do n't you take on so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cut that seed-cake . " Constable Jenkins ' heavy voice was rich with the kindness of generations of English village folk , blended with the soothing quality of the London policeman . " What ' ave these Parliamentary gents been doing to you , sir ? Better tell us all about it and you 'll feel better . Wo n't he , Mabel ? " After wiping his eyes in the unconscious open way of savages who have not yet learned to be ashamed of tears , Mundasi was able to take up the tale . " Naturally , Cunsbel , I think to myself I come to London , see Parliament very rapidly and return to report successful issues to the Chief and anxious European friends . I am not ignorant ; I have seen pictures of Parliament . Very grand house . Gentlemen sitting in large chairs like the late white Queen . Some with long white hair like witch-doctor ? " " Long white hair ? Do n't you mean the Speaker 's wig , sir ? " " Yes , yes ! Speaker 's wig ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I enter Parliament where indabas are held . Have I not on several occasions seen my grandfather visit the aged Chief of the Sheganas ? No ceremony is spared to conduct proceedings to successful issue . For three days important matters of the country are discussed . Or it may be a week . The Chiefs and their headmen sit in serious conclave . The young men sit in outer circles , learning precept upon precept but uttering no opinion . A sheep is killed , even an ox . At night much merriment . . . " Mundasi finds it hard to tear himself away from those pictures of home . " To return with the subject . I arrive in London with letters . A gentleman meets me . He says he will convey letters to proper destination . I go to lodgings recommend by him . I expect reply to my letters very quickly . On advice of a Zulu gentleman staying in the same house I do much shopping . I buy umbrella , notebooks , pencils , etc . Every day I study my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I read it aloud many times that the words do not seem strange to me . Then I wait one , two , three , four weeks at two pounds ten shillings per week with bath sixpence extra . Then , one letter appears . It informs me ? " Mundasi felt in his pockets and produced a handsome leather notebook . " It informs me : " Dear Sir , 1 am in receipt of the letters of introduction from the Governor of B and from Mr. Robert Hilary . 1 am sorry to say , however , that this is a most unfortunate time in which to gain a hearing for your petition . Had you arrived a fortnight earlier it would have been comparatively easy to arrange meetings with the various members of the group that will be most useful to you . will , however , do my best to get you a hearing even if it should have to be after the election . Have you met Mr. Gordon-Hillsworthy ? I think he is likely to be sympathetic with the grievances of an important people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , dear Sir , Cordially yours , Richard She ! drake . " " Nicely put , sir , if I may say so , " said Constable Jenkins . " Seems kindly meant . " " Ah , Cunsbel , so I too think until I reach the end . He is so insulting as to forget the name of my tribe . Forget the Xemandas whose Chief is paramount in a very large area ? And for those bastards the Fingoes ? " " I beg pardon , sir ? " His kind host 's voice gave him the impression of an approaching turkey-cock . Mundasi stared at him anxiously . " I was just saying , sir , excuse me , I ca n't allow Language in front of Mrs. Jenkins and the boy . " " Language ? What have I ? " " Well , sir , that there word beginning with a b . Ca n't allow it , sir , excuse me . " " B ? B ? Oh ! You mean bastard ? Well , but the Fingoes are bastards as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . But pardon me if I offend . I had no idea . . " He looked anxiously into the scarlet laughter-suppressing face of Mabel , into the shocked masculine stronghold that was Constable Jenkins ' face . He must not offend these kind people . He felt such a piteous need to talk himself out . " Bassard , " murmured Leslie drowsily against his new friend 's chest . It was the one word he had uttered since he had established himself on the black gentleman 's knee . " There ! " said Mabel triumphantly . Did n't 1 always say he was a clever one ? Do n't go repeating that , dear . That is n't a pretty word for little boys , is it , dad ? " Order and confidence once more established , Mundasi felt again for the beautiful pocketbook and produced another letter . " To proceed . I then wait another fortnight before I am delivered with this letter of Mr. Gordon-Hillsworthy . I will read it to you : " S. Mundasi , Esq , Dear Sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Sheldrake of your important mission in England at the present moment . I have been extremely interested in your people ever since I paid a visit some years ago to Uganda . I sincerely hope I may be able to meet you . Unfortunately , as you may have heard , I am very busy with electioneering matters , and I fear my many engagements may prevent me from naming a day and hour for some weeks . Possibly not until the Election is over . If you will kindly keep me in touch with your movements I shall be grateful . Believe me , Very truly yours , G. Gordon-Hillsworthy . " " Well , that 's a bit of allright , should say , sir , " said Constable Jenkins lighting his pipe with a spill . " A most charitable letter indeed . But I again fear that this gentleman speaks in ignorance of my people . We are nine hundred miles from Uganda . Howbeit I felt that it was a friend if I only could wait to see him . In meantime I had letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also wrote to other gentlemen as they were too busy themselves to lend an ear , as Shakespeare says , at the moment . " As the mention of Shakespeare indicated , Mundasi was getting into his stride . " So , I wait till after the Election when all should be nice and quiet again . Nobody to hurry . All calm . But instead of going honorably with petition into the House of Parliament I get short angry letters from the gentlemen saying there is great stress of work immediately following an election but they could give me half an hour 3.30 P.M. to 4 P.M. at an office where those interested could meet and hear my petition . They urge upon me to be punctual as time is short . " I am disappointed . All seems different from my anticipation of many months , even years . But at last I go . The alleged rendez-vous was in a dull and dirty street . That office was up some dark and steep stairs which smelt of the toilet . " " Toilet ? " said Mabel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The English language has many choices , perhaps I should ? " " Go on , sir , " said Constable Jenkins hastily . " Did they treat you kindly when you got there ? " " Ah ! " said Mundasi dramatically . " At first I am kept waiting for half an hour by my new watch . A young lady tells me there is a committee meeting . She say my petition come next . I wait . I pull myself together . All is not lost I say to myself , even if I am not in the House of Parliament , yet some of these gentlemen are head-men  --  how do you say it ? Members . Yes , members of Parliament . " I support myself by thoughts of my people . I think of Mr. Hilary and the Reverend Macdonald , those good men and true . I think of the Chief , of my father , and the other headmen . I think of the young men like me . I think they are safe in the bright sun . Perhaps they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be carpenters . At night the bright fire for all . . ? " " Is the gentleman going to cry again , Mummy ? " piped Leslie . " Be quiet , Leslie . Ca n't you let the gentleman speak ? " With a sigh registering a slight sense of injustice , the little boy snuggled closer to that interesting chest . " At last the door opens . One of the gentlemen say , ' Ready ? There 's not much time . That other business before you took a wretched long time . You 've got a quarter of an hour if you can be quick . ' " Quick ! We know not the word ! What is this quick ? Is the sun quick which keeps the time for us ? Does the moon hasten through the sky ? Assuredly not . All goes with propriety in my country . Very nice , no quickness . Time for everything when no clocks . Yes . .. . " I follow the gentleman very hastily with my gorge in my throat . There are several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how small ! Not so big as Mr. Hilary 's office . All is crowded . I can not see their faces ; all have their backs to the light . I am told to sit down . Two gentlemen look at their watch and say they hope it wo n't be long . I begin .. . " I begin to read the petition of my people , the Xemandas , to the Parliament of England . To King George 's Parliament . I tremble . . . . They are only men ! Should I have trembled in the Great House before the Chief with the white hair ? No , I should have deported myself as the grandson of a Chief , the son of a headman . My voice would have been strong and clear . Standing there in the big Parliament . . . But those very little men . . " I begin to read . My voice shakes , it sounds so very quiet , I can not see very well . When  --  when I have read only two pages one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly with angry looks , wetting his fingers . He say he had no idea there would be such a lot of it . He says to compress it to save time . " My hand shakes . I do not know what to do , I forget what compress is . And just as I am going to ask what compress is another gentleman swiftly takes my petition away and says that he will get at the jiss of it . To save time , he said . What is jiss , I say to myself . Then they all say thank-you to that gentleman , but not to me . They look at their watches and listen again . Two go out very quickly . I do not see them again . The gentleman turns my pages very quick , crumpling the paper . He says very quick words I can not understand . He make my petition to sound of no matter . .. of no importance . . . " Of no importance that our women are made to work on the roads when they are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . " In five minutes that gentleman fold it up and return it to me . I begin again to read . They stop me , saying they know all that is in it . I am bewildered with agitation , knowing not what to do to save the importance of my petition . My money nearly gone . . I return a disgraceful failure . Two hundred sovereigns in gold . . " " That 's a bloody shame , sir , if you 'll excuse me using the word whenoff duty . Did n't they say they would help you or anything ? " " Oh , indeed yes . They talk quickly together , not looking at me . I feel forgotten . Then one of them offers remark , ' Well , Mr. Mundasi , we are very much interest in your petition and we can assure you it will receive most serious attention at early opportunity . ' That 's what they said . But they did not stand to speak , not like the Parliament ! I feel deepest insult to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Smith , please show Mr. Mundasi out . ' . . . Miss Smith ! I , a grandson of the Chief , to be said farewell after important mission by a woman ! The gentlemen are all talking about some new election matters . I feel forgotten . Only one little gentleman comes and hold me tight by the hand . He say , in my own tongue , They mean no insult , Mundasi , they know no better , poor fellows . I 'll do the best I can for you over here . I love your country ! I wish I was there again out of this damn chicken-coop ! ' " It  --  it was that little gentleman made me cry . His voice . . He love my country ! He know it ! How could I see the steps for my weeping . . . Lead stairs , very dark , and most unpleasant perfume . " To-day Mundasi is a headman as his father , now Chief , had been before him To-day Mundasi finds sartorial self-expression in the clay-dyed blanket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monkey 's tails . Mundasi sits round the fire , he smokes in the sun , he hunts . He drinks beer , he speaks in the Council , gravely and at great length . Mr. Hilary 's successor says of Mundasi , " I ca n't understand why an unprogressive heathen like Mundasi should call his eldest picannins Mabel PERSIAN and Jenkins . That fellow always gives me the impression of being completely anti-white . I ca n't get at him , somehow or other . And you say he does n't go to your church either ? " And Reverend Mr. Macdonald says sadly , " I can tell you . He was one of my best boys . And now .. . " The tale is told . In the meantime , Mabel , in one bead bracelet , plays in the sunny kraal in her father 's hut . And Jenkins , with not even a bracelet towards self-expression , struts about with other fat young bloods of three playing at hunting , with sticks for assegais .
