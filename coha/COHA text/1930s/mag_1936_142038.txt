Long have prophets of evil gloomed over the troubles that will come when the U. S. first tries to reduce Relief expenditures . Last week Relief Administrator Harry Hopkins returned to his office in Washington and ran head first into a docket of such troubles . For while he was conferring with his regional administrators in New Orleans , his Assistant Aubrey Williams had announced the first Relief cut . <P> Of the $1,425,000,000 Relief fund appropriated by Congress , $1,150,000,000 was already spent in the first five months of the fiscal year and not enough remains to last through January , much less to July . This is due to politics , which kept the Relief appropriation low so as to make a good showing before election ; to an Act of God , Drought , which put 325,000 extras on the Relief rolls ; and to a miscalculation of Man . As industry increased its payrolls the WPA payrolls did not decrease proportionately . The cut as Mr. Williams announced it called for a reduction of WPA 's expenditures from $165,000,090 in November to $152,000,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) Transferring 250,000 drought relief cases to the Resettlement Administration . This is a half-saving since WPA paid them about $40 and RA can pay them only about $20 a month . However RA has only $14,000,000 of its $85,000,000 appropriation left , will also need a new appropriation by Feb. 1 . <P> 2 ) Cutting some 5,000 administrative and non-Relief persons off the payrolls . <P> 3 ) Weeding out about 150,000 reliefers who had private resources , some members of whose families had got private jobs , etc. , etc . <P> When Mr. Hopkins got back to Washington he found the kickbacks had been swift and vigorous . In big centres of unemployment , notably Manhattan and Los Angeles , reliefers had instituted sit-down strikes . Some of the New Deal 's strongest supporters were having fits . One of them , Publisher J. David Stern , editorialized in his New York Post : <P> ' ' Suppose you had been knocked unconscious in an auto accident on the day before election . <P> " And suppose you regained consciousness only yesterday . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <P> " Roosevelt ? Or Landon ? <P> " The answer 's obvious . You 'd think it was Landon . " <P> The strongest Relief lobby in the U. S. - the Conference of Mayors-had gone into action . Headed by Mayor LaGuardia of New York , who has among his constituents nearly 10% of the 2,500,000 people on the WPA payrolls and who forbade his police to obey the local WPAdministrator 's request to oust sit-down strikers from WPA offices , a delegation of mayors had invaded Washington , demanded continuation of Relief at November levels , offered to lobby a new Relief appropriation through Congress as soon as it meets in January , sent an indignant wireless to Franklin Roosevelt at sea .
