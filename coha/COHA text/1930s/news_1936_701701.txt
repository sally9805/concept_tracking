txt Those $3.50 Oil Cans . In a hardware store , a poor and elderly woman bemoaned the prohibition of the sale of kerosene unless it was carried in a specially designed container that had been approved by the Fire Commissioner and who is meting dire punishment for any offender of his edict . The woman said . " I can barely pay for the kerosene and I can not pay $3.50 for this can . " Thousands of people supplement their heating facilities in cold weather with portable kerosene heaters and one of the oil companies has been filling this need for forty-nine years , using an excellent can , perfectly safe and unspillable . A refundable deposit was made on each can and it is a considerable jump to $3.50 for the new container . My casual appraisal of this pretty can , from department store experience , is about 79 cents and its manufacture manifestly highly lucrative . CHARLES DICKENS .
