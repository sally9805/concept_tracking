txt  | moners . One man might own fifty acres and another fifty thousand , but there was no sharp line anywhere between them , and ( what has been a holding anchor in American life even when radicalism has been in the saddle ) the man with fifty hoped that some day by a lucky stroke he might own a thousand . With every man a property owner and hoping to be a greater , there might be a revolutionary demand for political power , but there was little immediate danger of any overturn of property rights . With this condition and the safety valve of the empty West , the young American nation could ride out the storm with impunity . There had , however , been a thoroughgoing revolution , though the general economic and social structure suffered a minimum of alteration . The civil war of 1775 to 1783 did not end merely with the secession of three million and more citizens from the British Empire , to set up an independent State of the then accepted model for themselves . Had that been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal house to rule over them , some William of Wied to fill a void in their Constitution . The exigencies of government in a wilderness had seen to that . The long line of simple covenants drawn up by simple men to meet practical situations , from the Mayflower Compact , the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut , through innumerable " church covenants " and frontier agreements , clarified by the years of dispute with England , had ended in the preamble to the Declaration of Independence . All men are created equal ; all men have the same political rights ; government derives its powers solely from the consent of the governed . America hoped to become a great nation . Every great nation then in the world was monarchical and aristocratical . America began as a republic and had made a long step toward a democracy . That was something radically new , though the political philosophy was not . American thinkers had nourished their minds on the great Englishmen , Sidney , Locke , Hobbes , and others . There was nothing novel in their theory . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , and that they owed to the American wilderness . They  | did not need to chop off the head of their king . In the process of a steady chopping down of the interminable forest the need of a king had gone . At the end of the war , Washington was only the most illustrious of all those who had been engaged who now returned to resume their peace-time life on plantation , farm , or in countinghouse . One great doubt assailed them all ? would the experiment succeed ? In the years immediately following , this began to look doubtful . England was treating us with contempt and not carrying out the terms of the treaty of peace . Neither were we , and the Confederacy was too weak to force either England or our own people to do so . After its post-war burst of enthusiasm , business had a collapse . The common people were , restive , and the rebellion in Massachusetts , which assumed the proportions of a civil war , gave even Washington a severe shock . As he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederation had was influence , and precious little of that . If within five years of gaining her independence America were to drift into anarchy , as she seemed to be doing , it would simply prove that as yet the world needed monarchy to secure order . The men in country taverns on a Saturday night might declaim about liberty till they were hoarse or asleep , but if the States were to leave their debts unpaid , become a mere pack of small republics quarreling among themselves until gobbled up singly by some European power , there would be little liberty worth declaiming about . Yet the jealousies and the dislike of any strong central governing body seemed insuperable . As Washington sat on the verandah at Mount Vernon , sipping his toddy and looking up the beautiful reach of the Potomac , he had ample time to reflect on whether after all he had for nothing risked a noose for his neck and the confiscation of the estate that he loved above all else next to his country . Many others also throughout the new States were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last courage was found to grasp the nettle firmly , and in February 1787 the almost moribund Congress sent an invita-  | tion to the several States to elect delegates to a convention to meet at Philadelphia in May for the sole purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation . The group of fifty-five men who met at the appointed time to consider the momentous problem of devising a Constitution for the nation was the most distinguished which has ever been gathered on this continent . The character , ability , and broad mental attainments which they possessed provide an amazing commentary upon the quality of American civilization in the eighteenth century . We must recall that the entire free white population of the States at that time was scarcely double that of the mere city of Los Angeles to-day . Yet out of a colonial population equivalent to twice that of Los Angeles came a George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , Roger Sherman , Robert Morris , James Madison , Alexander Hamilton , C. C. Pinckney , John Dickinson , William Paterson , Rufus King , James Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population and many thousand times the wealth of 1787 , could we have forty groups of similar capacity sitting simultaneously now ? Constitution making had been a favorite sport in all the colonies for the preceding fifteen years . Hardly anyone felt inadequate to the task . One New England farmer had produced a democratically simple one . We do not need , he wrote , " any Goviner but the Guviner of the univarse and under him a States Gineral to Consult with the wrest of the united states for the good of the whole . " Grotesque as this seems , it contained some of the chief kernels of public opinion ? the fear of a strong executive and central government , and the belief that any government must be for " the good of the whole . " Although complete political democracy was not to be achieved , even in form , for several generations yet , the framers of the Constitution found themselves of necessity influenced by the steps already taken toward it , whatever their individual opinions might be . They realized , although American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a revolution was in progress as well as a secession accomplished . As a contemporary South Carolinian wrote , " There is nothing more common  | than to confound the terms of the American Revolution with those of the late American war . The American war is over , but this is far from being the case with the American Revolution . On the contrary , nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed . " This first act had been marked for democracy by many forward steps no less genuine because not sealed by the blood of an uprising . Between 1776 and 1784 the situation had forced most of the colonies to adopt constitutions for themselves to replace the old imperial governments . All but one of these , that of New Hampshire , had been drafted and adopted during the war , when radical sentiment was rampant . It had been the radicals who had cast the die for war in the first place , and , with the rise in war psychology , even good patriots came to be looked at askance if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with their more radical neighbors . It was extremely easy for a patriot jury to brand a man as a Tory , after which confiscation of his desirable estate might follow as quickly as thunder on flash of lightning . We have recently had enough experience of the queer forms that excessive zeal may take in war times to understand the dangerous situation of conservative thought among our patriot ancestors of 1776 to 1783 . We can not deal with all the fourteen colonial constitutions ( counting Vermont , which had set up for itself ) separately , but we may note what happened in the two colonies where the internal grievances had been most acute against the rich Easterners before war with England had been decided upon , for these bring out clearly the continuity of grievance which we tried to point out earlier . In Pennsylvania the disgruntled frontiersmen and Philadelphia mechanics dealt a resounding thwack on the heads of the old moneyed class . All qualifications for office holding or voting were swept away except payment of a State tax . This gave the suffrage to practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representation was apportioned on the basis of the number of taxables in each county , and this at once transferred the political control  | from the old governing group along the Delaware River to the Scotch and Germans in the western counties . In North Carolina a bitter fight took place between the radical and conservative elements for the drafting of the constitution , in which the radicals scored a complete victory . Practically every adult freeman was given the franchise , and the governor was so stripped of power that it was said he had none left except to " sign a receipt for his salary . " The legislature was made allpowerful , and the small farmers were given control of it . These two States adopted the most radical of the new constitutions , but throughout practically all of them we find advances in democratic doctrine . The famous Virginia Bill of Rights , which was used as the basis for most of the others , began much as did the Declaration , with the words " all men are by nature equally free and independent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from State , and the slave trade was prohibited by all except Georgia . In the Northern States , where fifty thousand slaves were owned , chiefly as house servants , emancipation had become complete by about the end of the century even when not immediately provided for , as in many cases , by the new constitutions . In Virginia and Maryland such men as Jefferson , Madison , Mason , Pinckney , and Martin struggled for emancipation , but without success , and throughout the South at this time most men looked upon slavery as an evil , although a temporary one . In all the States the revolution brought about a distinct increase in the electorate , although the qualifications for voting differed . The poorer elements both in the town and in the frontier sections increased their influence . The basis of American political democracy has been economic democracy , and at this time , as for long after , economic democracy meant the opportunity to own land . In this respect , the revolution witnessed a notable advance in two directions , the one relieving ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be acquired by the poorer people . All the royal prohibitions with regard to cutting timber were abolished , as were all quitrents everywhere , and whatever relics of feu-  | dalism had remained here and there . Entail and primogeniture , without which the perpetuation of great landed estates is impossible , were likewise abolished . In most States it was also provided that the lands of an intestate should be divided equally among his sons , if not all his children . Everywhere the Crown lands and great forfeited estates had come into possession of the State governments , and attempts were usually made to sell these as small holdings . Even in that stronghold of a moneyed aristocracy , New York , a new law discouraged the sale of these lands in parcels of over five hundred acres , and James De Lancey 's were settled by 275 persons . In Pennsylvania the Penn family estimated their confiscated estates as worth one million pounds sterling . Yet more important in providing land for settlement and the building up of the economic democracy of the next fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been embodied in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 . After much negotiation , the claims of certain States , based upon the vague geographical terms in their old charters , were surrendered to the Confederation , which came into possession of almost all the land west of the mountains and up to the Mississippi . The one great act of statesmanship of the now expiring Congress of the old government had been the Northwest Ordinance , passed in 1787 , for the purpose of providing for the governing of this vast tract , which formed a possible colonial empire as large as the Union itself . Heretofore , in European thought , colonies had always occupied a position inferior to the mother country , and were supposed to be ruled and exploited for her own benefit . The Americans , however , had had their fill of that doctrine . They had smarted under it when they had been English colonials on the east side of the mountains , and those who hoped to settle on the west side of them had no stomach to resume that status again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers . There was , however , no precedent whatever for the solution of the problem . There was , on the other hand , the very serious problem of the size and future population of this  | American empire . There was room in it to carve out more States than the original thirteen . " There has already been trouble enough , Heaven knows , " thought the conservative Easterners , " with all these radicals who go out on the frontiers and who are already upsetting everything in the old States . If we fill up this western country , as big as our own , with them and give them a voice in our affairs , anything may happen . " The final solution was evidence at once of the remarkable political wisdom of the day and of the strong influence that the democratic elements possessed . The Ordinance , together with that of 1785 , provided that the Territory should be divided into townships six miles square , made up of sections of 64o acres each . These sections were to be sold at not less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be governed as a unit by Congress , but when it had five thousand inhabitants they could elect a legislature , and , when population increased , three to five States might be created , of not less than sixty thousand inhabitants each , which would be admitted to the Union on an absolute equality with the original Eastern ones " in all respects whatever . " One section in every township was reserved for public education , and slavery was forever prohibited . Simple as the solution may seem , it is one of the greatest and most original of the contributions of America to the modern world of political thought , and it provided the only possible way in which the United States of to-day could have come into being . The original Union could never have held the continent under imperial control , but the way was now open for indefinite increase in population and territory with equally indefinite increase in national solidarity and strength . If the Ordinance was a great achievement of statesmanship , so was it a great achievement for the American democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , with the opening of a new frontier of staggering size to settlement and eventual citizenship , it could be conceived that some day the conservative East might have to bow to a young , powerful , and aggressive West . The young Revolutionary poet , Philip Freneau , wrote of it in 1785 that  | Forsaking kings and regal state , ( A debt that reason deems amiss ) The traveller owns , convinc 'd though late , No realm so free , so blest as this ? The east is half to slaves consign 'd , And half to slavery more refined . It was in this atmosphere of radical success ? or perhaps we should say of evidence of radical thought and increasing power ? that the members of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia began their labors . However opposed some of them , like Hamilton , might be to trusting the people with power , the whole trend of events for the past fifteen years or more showed clearly that the common people would demand to a very considerable extent an embodying in the Constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for independence , and that they would not be denied . Madison at first started from the premise that government was to be devised by the leading minds of the Union more or less as a problem in vacuo without paying the slightest attention to the wishes of the " unreflecting multitude . " Hamilton openly admitted that he had no use for a republic , but that in the atmosphere of America nothing else could be hoped for , whereupon he worked for a form of government of extreme centralization and power . Broader and more practically minded members perceived , however , that the Constitution was bound to be framed according to the dogmas of the Declaration , and the problem settled down to how to reconcile the rights of man with the safety of property . The franchise provided a severe test . Many , perhaps wisely , feared that to bestow it upon the classes without property would be to invite venality and spoliation . On the other hand , it was pointed out to them that many States had already provided for voting by citizens who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rejected by them if it took away rights they had already secured . A precisely similar problem was that of apportionment of representation . Here the old conflict between tidewater and frontier came out clearly . Gouverneur Morris voiced the  | strong feeling of many of the delegates when he demanded that property as well as population should be taken into consideration , as otherwise , if " the Western people get the power into their own hands , they will ruin the Atlantic interests . The back members are always adverse to the best measures . " Elbridge Gerry , who feared the foreign elements , urged that the seaboard should not be placed " at the mercy of the emigrants . " This party , however , was confronted by the fact that the new States to be made in the West had already been pledged absolute equality with the old , and the more liberal opinion won . Both these contests show the immense importance of what the radicals had already gained . On every hand the delegates were confronted not by theoretical problems but by accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might bring when possibly agriculture had yielded place to manufactures , and the cities might be filled with a floating and propertyless population of mechanics . Nevertheless , the people had already gained power , and , as Colonel Mason pointed out , " those who have power in their hands will not give it up while they can retain it . " Hamilton found that while " he had been praised by everybody , he had been supported by none . " In the Constitution no qualification was mentioned for the suffrage , and representation was based solely on population , with the exception that in the Senate it should be limited to two Senators from each State regardless of numbers , a compromise essential to win the adherence of the smaller of the older commonwealths , and one destined to perpetuate and emphasize the question of States ' rights . In some respects the new government was a federal republic made up of sovereign States , but in others it rested directly upon the people themselves . Just as the State governments derived their powers directly from the electorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from the individual voter and not indirectly through the State governments . In this respect it was an entirely new departure in the theory of government . After more than three months ' deliberation the document was complete , the first written Constitution offered to any nation ,  | following in this the precedents set by the several States . It gave no special privileges to any one class or interest , nor did it lodge power in any of them . Unrestricted suffrage , representation based on numbers , and the parity promised to the new States to arise on the frontier , assured as far as any constitution could the growth of economic and political equality . In the course of a century and a half , the Constitution has been greatly developed by interpretation through judicial decisions , but as it stood in 1787 it was considered extremely democratic . There was , however , much in it that ran counter to the wishes of many . The prohibition against the issue of paper money and of laws impairing the obligations of contracts could be counted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , national sentiment was still weak as contrasted with State loyalty , and many powers had been taken from the States and given to the central government . The forbidding of the States to levy any import or export duties was to make the United States within itself the greatest free-trade area in the world eventually , and greatly to increase the possibilities of national prosperity , the scale of American business , and to intensify national solidarity , but it seemed a menacing encroachment in 1787 . The decision was reached , in accordance with the theory of the Declaration of Independence , to submit the instrument directly to the people for ratification , and in every State conventions were elected to consider it . Never before or since , perhaps , has an entire people been so well prepared to discuss so momentous an issue . The years of controversy with England preceding the war , and the erection of all the State governments during it , had for twenty-five years kept the public mind centred on constitutional problems . Extremely adroit management , not to say in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was secured from the first nine States , which had been the number required to put the Constitution into force , but on the other hand the public discussion was maintained on a very high level . The innumerable pamphlets and newspaper articles , of which those gathered  | in The Federalist were merely the most notable , called for a concentration of thought that could hardly be counted upon to-day in a decision by the people at large . At last nine States ratified ; the new Constitution was declared in force ; and subsequently the other States adhered to it . The old Congress notified the people that their new government would enter upon its duties on March 4 , 1789 , and then ended its own existence . We Americans may well take a legitimate pride in the extraordinary accomplishment of those dozen years , for no other nation has ever given in a similar period such an impetus to political thought through practical statesmanship . Many of the ideas were not new , but they had hitherto been for the most part held by closet philosophers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a working political programme for a nation . In the Declaration of Independence , made good by war , the gospel of equality , of natural rights , and of government by consent of the governed , had attained an influence and an authenticity that no mere philosopher could secure for it . In the Northwest Ordinance we had shown how colonial status could be transformed into national citizenship for an expanding empire . In the Constitution we had shown how a Federal government could respect the sovereignty of its States and yet derive its sanction and power directly from the body of the people . In the device of a Constitutional Convention we had pointed out a peaceful way for any nation to alter its fundamental law and institutions . We had also showed that a revolution could be held within bounds if the people at large enjoyed a reasonable degree of economic opportunity . The new government , however , was weak and untried . The Constitution had been ratified in many States by the narrowest of margins , and even if a majority of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . Fortunately the party system in politics had not yet come into being , the only " parties " having been those who were in favor of or opposed to ratification , called Federalists and Anti-Federalists . The young government was thus saved a party contest and a partisan president . It was fortunate that there was one man in the  | country to whom all eyes instinctively turned . Washington was not elected President by the glamour of a successful career as general , as has happened since , disastrously . Just as in the war it had not been his military genius but his character that won for him the adoration of his men and of the nation , so now it was his character to which they clung again in the crisis of steering the new Ship of State through the shoals and out on the high seas . There was as yet no government organization or policy . There were no officeholders , no clearly outlined duties , no departments , no precedents , no money on hand . There were the mere piece of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divided people , huge debts , a worthless currency , and George Washington to give stability to it all , if possible . For his two chief advisers he chose Thomas Jefferson , as Secretary of State , and Alexander Hamilton , as Secretary of the Treasury . The two men were utterly different from each other in almost every respect , yet oddly enough no other pair opposed to one another have ever in our history influenced so permanently , both of them , our thought and practice as a nation . Hamilton , a West Indian boy , probably of illegitimate descent , had landed in New York with his fortune to make . A lawyer , with an extraordinarily brilliant mind and attractive personality , he won his way , married into a wealthy family , and became a leading figure in the State . Jefferson had been born on the Virginia frontier . Hamilton , living his life among the moneyed class in New York , with its intensely corrupt politics , had no belief whatever in the capacity of the common man to govern himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent , and living among the yeomanry of one of the best frontier sections of the country , had complete faith in the ordinary citizen , so long , at least , as the nation might remain agricultural . Hamilton was a realist in politics , Jefferson an idealist , although he proved a better party leader and organizer than his opponent . Hamilton believed in a strongly centralized government , deriving its main support  | from the moneyed class . Jefferson believed in government performing the minimum of functions , in decentralization , and in reliance upon the farmers . Hamilton was the acknowledged leader of the Federalist Party . Jefferson , who had been in France for some years as our representative in Paris , returned to assume office without party . At first the two men succeeded in working together in the cabinet in moderate harmony , but their philosophies were too antagonistic , and it was not long before the inevitable dislike and mutual lack of confidence began to show itself . Hamilton stood for strength , wealth , and power ; Jefferson for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There had long been a certain amount of friction between the growing lill mercantilism of the North and the planter class in the South . Hamilton 's first task was to establish the credit of the new nation , and for this purpose he deemed it essential to pay off the federal foreign and greatly depreciated domestic debts at par , and also to assume the State debts . He likewise wished to build up as rapidly as possible a moneyed class from banking , shipping , manufacturing , and other industries as a support to the government . He advocated a national bank and a protective tariff , and saw no reason why the South as well as the North should not develop an industrial and financial life . In fact , however , it had not done so , and although the future of both agriculture and slavery was doubtful , an event happened the very year after Hamilton offered his Report on Manufactures to Congress which determined the course of the South for a century . Agriculture in that section had been rather going from bad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave labor was wasteful , though the only labor available , and the future was distinctly uncertain . The old crops of rice , indigo , and tobacco were no longer as profitable as they had been , and it did not seem possible to raise cotton , as it took a slave a month to get the seeds out of one bale . A few experiments had been made , but so impractical was American cotton culture considered that in I784 the Custom House in England seized eight  | bales on the ground that they " could not have been produced in America . " The demand had become enormous , and the world production in 1791 was 490,000,000 pounds , of which only 138,000 were produced in the United States . The next year Eli Whitney , a young Massachusetts lad on a visit to Georgia , invented the cotton gin , which would clean a thousand pounds in the time it took a slave to clean only five . In 1793 the South raised 487,000 pounds , 1,600,000 the next year , 6,276,000 the next , and 35,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave doomed to his slavery . The type of Southern culture was thus fixed until almost our own day . Simultaneously with the sudden rise of the Cotton Kingdom in the South , Samuel Slater , a cotton-mill operative from England , was in Rhode Island trying to remember how the textile machinery which he had tended in the old country had been built , for England prohibited the export of any of the machines lest the industry might be set up elsewhere . Slater was successful , machines were built here , and the foundations laid for the growth of the New England textile mills . Great as the differences between the sections had already been , they were to be increasingly emphasized during the next half century . If America was to be happiest as a great industrial nation , Hamilton 's policies were wise and essential . The forces which have made the industrial United States of to-day stem directly from the Hamiltonian principles . On the other hand , in creating special privileges for certain classes , as in the tariff , in building up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not inimical to , those of the agricultural and laboring ones , Hamilton 's economic and political doctrines assuredly did not derive from the Declaration of Independence . Jefferson , who had penned that document ; the farmers , who wanted to buy manufactured goods as cheap as possible ; the debtors of all classes ; the men of the frontier , who wanted as little interference from government as might be ? all who believed in the American dream were antagonized by this wizard in the Treasury who , it seemed to them , was threatening to raise up an engine of despotism and to sink them in the scale as con-  | trasted with his privileged moneyed men and speculators in securities . Meanwhile , a new section , to be of vast importance within a few years , was arising over the mountains ? a new frontier to be followed successively by others for a century . In all of these the ideas of Jefferson and the Declaration were to find their strongest refuge and supporters . It was , in truth , the size of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or worse , the United States of to-day was cradled in the Mississippi Valley . As I have pointed out before , had the Pacific Ocean washed the western slopes of the Alleghanies , the type of civilization would probably have continued along the lines of eighteenth-century European culture which had so successfully sprung up in the colonies by the period of the war . How fine the fruit of that culture was to prove we have seen in this present chapter , but it was not to be the American type . What was new in the American of that period was chiefly owing to the wilderness , but had the wilderness ended at the mountains , the frontier would have ceased to be an influence , for the land was fast filling up . If the frontier had been closed in 1790 instead of 1890 , an entire century of an irresistibly powerful moulding force would have been lost . By ' Soo , the North Atlantic seaboard was getting started on its way toward an industrial future . The South had been definitively started on its career as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither of these would have produced what we think of as the typical American mind and character of to-day . If we , as Americans , boast too much of our size , it is nevertheless true that that size has shaped us to what we are . As we have seen , the population had already begun to spill over the mountains before the Revolution , but after independence was won , the trickling streams became a flood . In 1788 nearly a thousand boats , containing over ' 8,000 men , women , and children , carried settlers down the Ohio . Emigrants were largely from New England , and indeed the section known as the " Western Reserve " became a sort of second New England , with its town meetings and general type of New England life .  | Other settlers , however , were also pouring through passes over the mountains from the South , and by 1790 there were at least 170,000 inhabitants in the Western country . Kentucky was admitted as a State in 1791 and Tennessee five years later , both with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later qualified this by " white . " If ever men were free , these were . The seaboard colonists had not only had their charters , royal governors , and other symbols of imperial rule , but had also had a certain sentimental tie with the mother country . These new colonists who were now so rapidly building towns across the mountains were at perfect liberty to devise their own governments , and that of the United States was too young and too weak to afford much basis as yet for either loyalty or fear . In fact , when many of the immigrants had gone West and built their stockaded village or made their solitary clearing , there was no United States government worthy of the name . Here in the West was a colossal land of surpassing richness which they intended to make their own by their blood and sweat , and in which they planned to do as they chose . Perhaps they would join the United States back East , and perhaps they would not . They had their own problems , and they would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them to what they wanted , well and good . Meanwhile , the world was wide and there was an empire to be won . By 1800 the Ohio country was raising crops for export to the value of $700,000 , and building ships for the European trade , by way of the Mississippi and her tributary rivers . In 1803 the Duane of Pittsburgh surprised the authorities of Liverpool by arriving there from a place never heard of , and a couple of years later the Louisiana of Marietta was trading between Italy and England from the small Ohio town as her home port ! But there were difficulties , South and North . The fastincreasing produce of the West could not profitably be transported eastward across the mountains to the seaboard United States . Its natural outlet and market was down the Mississippi to the Gulf settlements of the Spaniard or overseas to  | Europe . But the Gulf coast and the whole of America west of the great river belonged to Spain . Not only that , but she owned both sides of the river at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowed to do so by courtesy and not by right . The Americans , with new vast ideas of continental expansion , were also beginning to look not merely for an outlet for their commerce but to the great plains of the Southwest , and even the rich civilization and mines of Mexico . Spain had a full realization of this , and felt that the only way to prevent the expansion , with its threat to her American empire , was to push up against the descending flood and try to crowd it back . She refused to surrender Natchez , which belonged to us by the treaty with England , claiming that England 's title had been defective , and New Orleans and Natchez became double corks in the bottle neck which was the only outlet for our West . Not satisfied with that , Spain built more posts on American soil , and entered into intrigues with prominent Western Americans . General James Wilkinson , for example , was simultaneously in the pay of the United States army and of the Spanish secret service . The Westerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving them sufficient help and that they would have to look after themselves . They had little respect for Spanish power , and thought that , with some judicious fishing in troubled waters , the time might come when they could conquer a southwestern empire for themselves , made up of the Mississippi Valley , Texas , and Mexico . With the most magnificent and richest part of the whole continent in their possession , they might need to bother no more with the " United States " across the almost impassable mountains . There were also plenty of men in the East who would have had no regrets if the problem of possible invasion of Western radicalism might thus be got rid of . As the Westerners looked south to the Gulf or west across the river to the farther West , they were thus confronted with a hostile and intriguing Spain . As they looked north to the great region of forests and fur trade , they were confronted with a no less hostile and intriguing England . Both nations worked on  | the Indians to attack the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only refused to surrender her army posts within our territory , but also built new ones . The United States , as we have said , had not carried out all the terms of the Treaty of Peace , notably the one which had pledged the national faith to offer every facility in the American courts for the collection of bona-fide pre-war debts owing to English merchants by Americans . Taking advantage of this dereliction of duty on our side , the English government continued to hold the Northwestern country , collecting furs , influencing the Indian tribes against us , and holding back American settlement . The territory clearly belonged to us , yet was held by the British army . This was all that the Western settlers could see , as they knew little and cared less about unpaid debts to English creditors by seaboard debtors . The frontier spirit in any case would have been on the side of any debtor , especially when the debts were owed to our late enemies . The Westerners hated the Spaniard for his strangle hold on their Mississippi outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despoil , him later . It seemed more hopeless to dislodge the English , and their hatred of the latter became intense . Over the mountains to the east , the new government was not oblivious of what was going on in the West , nor even as to what was in the minds and dreams of the Westerners ; but the government was weak , and Washington felt that everything possible had to be done to gain time for domestic loyalty to develop , and to keep out of foreign war . There was a party in England which would have adopted a conciliatory policy toward our new country , but the opposition had won , and our ships had been debarred from the lucrative West India commerce , which had formerly been one of the chief bases of our shipping trade . Moreover , war had broken out in Europe after the French Revolution , and as neutrals we were suffering depredations upon our commerce , none of the belligerents having , because of our weakness , any respect for our rights , which were in any case rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but out in the West " Mad  | Anthony " Wayne had taught the Miamis and Shawnees and other Western tribes in the battle of Fallen Timbers that perhaps it might not be well for them to rely too much upon their friends the British . Meanwhile John Jay had been negotiating with England , and in November 1794 signed a treaty by which the English agreed at last to hand over the Western posts and evacuate the country , but at the expense of commercial conditions that enraged the Atlantic seaboard . No other treaty ever made by us has been so unpopular , and it was an act of great courage on Washington 's part to sign it . The West , however , had been ransomed , and a breathing space gained from the threat of European war . " If this country is preserved in tranquillity twenty years longer , it may bid defiance in a just cause to any power whatever , " wrote the President , " such in that time will be its population , wealth , and resources . " Political parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and during the next two years Washington was bitterly attacked by a portion of the press . Wisely refusing to run for a third time , and thus establishing a precedent , he made his Farewell Address to his countrymen on September 17 , 1796 . He warned them against cherishing " inveterate antipathies " or " passionate attachments " for any other nations , and urged that we might keep ourselves , in the then condition of the world , from all entangling alliances with Europe , which had a set of interests unshared by us . When Jay 's Treaty was signed , peace had come temporarily to the nations of Europe ; and as England had withdrawn from the North , and the times were not propitious for further intrigue , Spain , who had decided that perhaps a definite boundary was preferable to expeditions of Americans into her territory , agreed on the 31st parallel as the southern line of the United States east of the Mississippi , and granted the muchlonged-for right of navigation of that river and shipping of goods through New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , and the Westerners at last came into possession of their territory . Now that the intrigues of both  | English and Spanish no longer set the Southern and Northern tribes on the war path , the savages could be more easily dealt with , and the increase in American population became rapid all the way from Georgia to the Great Lakes . The heart of the new Americanism began to find its home in the heart of the continent , in the new empire of the Mississippi Valley . America would not have become what it did in mind and spirit had we clung to the shores of the Atlantic . For better and worse both , the new America was the child of " 01 ' Man River , " nurtured in the vast domain which had been his through all the ages . It was on frontier after frontier of his vast domain that the American dream could be prolonged until it became part of the very structure of the American mind .  | AMERICA SECEDES FROM THE OLD WORLD ABOUT i 800 there were three racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think only of the one steadily advancing from the fringe of the United States . Within the limits of our own territory as marked out in the Treaty of Peace , there was still a scattered line of settlements which were French in culture and long remained so . Detroit , which is now the fourth largest city in our country , remained French in character until well into the nineteenth century , and even after the Civil War its French ancestry was clearly noticeable . From there down the Mississippi Valley , through Vincennes , St. Louis , and smaller posts to New Orleans , the French influence and character were strongly marked , all of this string of settlements lying as yet beyond the advancing phalanxes of the Americans , with a broad swathe of undeveloped wilderness between . At New Orleans , the French met and mingled with the other Latin stream of the Spanish , who extended from Florida to the Pacific . The main body of the Spanish Empire was , of course ,  | in Mexico and South America , but this had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Floridas , through New Orleans , San Antonio , and other settlements in Texas , Santa Fe in New Mexico , and straggling settlements up the coast of California . Santa Barbara , Santa Cruz , Monterey , San Jose , San Francisco , had all been founded in the eighteenth century , as well as Los Angeles , now the fifth largest city in the United States . There were many military posts , called presidios , and Jesuit missions along the coast , at which twenty thousand nominally Christianized Indians had been gathered , but the Spanish population within the limits of the present United States was small ? not over twelve hundred in California , and probably less than that number in the other northern provinces . The expansive powers of Spain had long since failed , and in any case it would have been impossible to settle thickly a frontier line of such endless length edging an entire continent . Texas , New Mexico , California , were each at the end of a long overland trail from Mexico City , and were mere outposts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians , the last threatening southward expansion from Alaska . The culture of the Spaniards , however , ? notably in architecture and historical romance , ? has been far out of proportion to their numbers , and in these and other ways the Spanish influence still persists throughout the South , and in the Far West . We have had much , and shall have more , to say of the influence of the frontier on our national life . However , we must not forget that , as has been already pointed out in regard to the form of colonial governments , the influences of institutions and environments are always dependent upon what , for lack of clearer knowledge , we call race . The French voyageurs who paddled their canoes along the streams , or the French farmers who tilled their fields around Detroit and remained almost unchanged Norman peasants generation after generation , did not react to the frontier as did the English . No more did the Spaniards in California , who spent their time hunting on horseback , or with music and games , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls and gay festivals . The frontier was , perhaps , the most important moulding influence in American life . But that was because the people who came under its influence were for some reason peculiarly receptive to it . Professor Turner performed a great service when he caused the whole of American history to be rewritten in terms of the frontier , but it is well to remember that , just because frontier influence has not been universal , there must also be racial factors in our case to account for our receptivity toward it . That the Americans and , to a lesser extent , the English race everywhere were receptive is all that need concern us now . The new American frontier that was forming around i 800 was different from preceding ones , and more typically " American , " as we have come to consider it . The first frontier of settlement had not really been an " American " frontier at all . All the settlers had England for a background . Poor and wellto-do , learned and unlearned , gentlemen and laborers , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed at the back of the old settlements , there was , it is true , no European background , but the pioneers were nowhere far from our oldest settled country . To a considerable extent , however , in passing the population through this second sieve , the learned and gentle were left behind , and rawness and lack of culture were increased along the border . The American population has been squeezed through such a sieve over and over again , and , when the first migrations over the mountains occurred , there was another elimination of education and refinement . Moreover , with each successive swarming out from the older settlements the background of culture and beauty became more and more meagre . The first settlers had come from the rich background of old England , its churches and hedgerows and old , old villages , its handicrafts and household arts even in the homes of the small farmers . In the colonies , by the latter third of the eighteenth century , a civilization of no mean order had arisen , as we have seen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly to the modest dwellings of the upper class . There were no great buildings  | of any sort . The churches ? with a few exceptions ? were everywhere , for the most part barnlike , bare , and ugly . The homes of the poor had begun to take on that unpainted packing-box effect of bare utility with no pretense to beauty that has ever since been one of the depressing aspects of our countryside . In their interiors , all interest in the carving or painting of furniture had disappeared , and a crude utility had obliterated any striving for the aesthetic . Life had been growing freer and more independent for the poor , but also less cultured in the broadest sense . American advance has always involved a selection . If that selection has meant that the more democratic , the more independent , courageous , and ambitious , ? as well , it must not be forgotten , as the more shiftless , ? have passed on to the frontiers as pioneers , so has it also meant that those for whom education , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sort and another have counted as more important than a material getting ahead , have for the most part usually stayed behind . They have been deposited in successive " older settlements " like the sediment in a stream in flood . Although the hunter and Indian trader had always made a blurred fringe ahead of actual settlement in the wilderness , the earlier frontiers had been made up of permanent home builders . Gradually , however , the more characteristic triple advance of civilization began . First went the adventurers , a motley crew of hunters , traders , ne'er-do-wells , restless and discontented spirits , men , also , fired with the spirit of adventure in the untried and unknown . As others of a somewhat more substantial sort followed , the first would feel cramped , sell out their scantily cleared fields , and move on . Behind the second line of advance was a third , whose members , came in greater numbers , brought social organization of schools and newspapers and churches , built towns and pushed ahead of them the second line of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in turn , had pushed ahead of them the first liners who felt cramped with neighbors a dozen miles away . But the torch of frontier influence was handed back rapidly from one line of advance  | to another , and when we speak of the frontier we mean , in general , all three of the lines up to such period as the third began to be " old , " " settled , " or " conservative . " To a considerable extent , this might happen fairly quickly , and by 1793 there were already three newspapers established to the west of the Alleghanies ; but this did not prevent the overpowering influence of frontier life and thought . We have already spoken of the effects of such life on the ideals of democracy , work , and the all-important increase in mere physical comfort . There was another effect as the Americans began to understand better both the hardships and the technique of frontiering . The older and more substantial men became more and more hesitant about venturing , and the frontier rapidly became young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope and inexperience combine to emphasize the freedom and democracy of the wilderness and of economic equality . Failures there were in plenty . The whole front of the American advance was strewn with them , men and women who dropped down to the moral , economic , and intellectual level of a hopeless and shiftless poverty . But in the buoyant air of freedom , of youth and of opportunity , it was those who succeeded who gave the tone to the temperament of the frontier everywhere . Success on the frontier ? on the innumerable frontiers that have followed one another across the continent ? meant material success , tinged with politics . Almost all those who went to the frontier were poor , and even to buy land at a dollar an acre , work and stock it , meant going into debt . The fundamental problem , which united the whole frontier in a bond of sympathetic understanding , was to make money , or at least to build up the material structure of a home . The mark of that struggle remained on everyone . Material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned . The only other success which the life offered was that of local leadership , becoming a known and followed man in one 's community . For that it was essential that one should be able , so to say , to swing an axe , to get one 's self on in the rough and hard life , to mix  | with one 's neighbors on a plane of equality , or , if a bit above them , to be that bit only in the abilities they admired , the abilities that enabled one to be a good frontiersman . On the one hand , the man who was merely virile , strong , ambitious in a material sense , was much more apt to make a success in that hard life than the man who by training or environment possessed the manners of good society , who was learned or cultivated and who cared more about such things than about spending his life making a clearing and adding acre to acre . On the other hand , the frontiersmen , possessing none of these things , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and came to look down upon those different from themselves , as the Puritan had looked down upon those with whom he differed as being morally inferior . Just as American Puritanism had become intolerantly narrow , so was the life of the frontier ; and thus two of the strongest influences in our life , religion and the frontier , made in our formative periods for a limited and intolerant spiritual life . The development of that vast optimism which is one of our characteristics belongs to the next period , but already there was growing up on the frontier that self-confidence which breathes a belief that we know our own business better than anyone else . Life on the frontier was extremely narrow , and success in it called for the combination of a few primal qualities , not of a very high order , save perhaps those of physical courage and dogged perseverance , which , after all , can be found also elsewhere . The fact , however , that a man who was more than this simple type was less likely to be a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities and greatly enhanced its complete trust in its own . Because the frontiersmen had developed the right combination of qualities to conquer the wilderness , they began to believe quite naturally that they knew best , so to say , how to conquer the world , to solve its problems , and that their own qualities were the only ones worth a man 's having . Among these came to be aggressiveness , self-assertion , and a certain unteachableness . Self-confidence was greatly increased by the simplicity of  | the frontiersman 's problems and of his life . There were none of the complications of an old and settled community . Under the new Land Law of i800 , a settler could buy smaller tracts of land , paying down only fifty cents an acre , the balance of a dollar and a half an acre being nominally spread over four years . Boys usually married at eighteen or twenty , when they had saved a hundred dollars or so , and girls at fourteen to sixteen . The bridegroom might receive as gifts a horse , seed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cow , a few chairs and kitchen utensils . The neighbors joined together to build a rough house in a few days , and the couple were well started . Children , ten to a dozen , and sometimes twenty or more , were welcomed as affording , almost from the time they were able to walk , additional labor for the pair , and almost no expense , though some additional toil . Food came from the farm , clothes were homemade , there were no bills for doctors or schooling , and , when old enough to marry , the children would start out as their parents had . For those settlers who enlarged their economic operations , the problems of money owed to Eastern creditors and of markets for outlet of surplus products might become of bitter importance , but for countless individual settlers life was reduced to its simplest terms . But , if life was simple , it was almost unbearably narrow . If there was almost no privacy , sometimes a dozen persons living in one room , and every neighbor knowing his neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or nothing for minds to feed on . In the life of the colonial Americans , and later of our frontiers in each wave of advance , we can trace the lack of desire for privacy , and the craving for news and gossip of any sort to break the monotony of empty minds , in lives of little variety and in communities where everyone is doing precisely what his neighbor is doing . The simple economic conditions of marriage in America had done away with the European idea of dowries , and American boys and girls " married for love , " but the hard , grinding work of daily toil and the incessant childbearing left little time for romance , and both minds and emotions became starved .  | Just as William Bradford , in trying to account for the prevalence of unnatural vice at Plymouth , with its religious repression , had suggested that human nature , dammed in one direction , would find outlets in another , so the emptiness of life on the frontier , and to some extent among the poor of the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgies . At first the religion of the frontier had been to a great extent the Presbyterian , but about i 800 the less intellectual and more emotional appeal of the Baptist and especially the Methodist faith swept the frontiersmen into those folds . These denominations did not believe in a learned ministry , and their appeals were all to the emotions . The almost incredible camp meetings catered both to the settler 's desire for company and to his need for expression in emotional life . The inhibitions of his starved social and emotional life were suddenly removed by the mass psychology of these vast gatherings , at which thou , sands would exhibit pathological symptoms in unison . One of the greatest of these , held in Bourbon County , Kentucky , in i 8oi , was attended by twenty-five to thirty thousand persons , coming from a circuit of a hundred miles . Seventeen preachers , as well as many volunteers , preached continuously from a Friday to the following Thursday , and at one time , it is said , three thousand followers lay unconscious on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " barked " in unison . One prayer felled three hundred of them . In the innumerable meetings of the sort during the next half century , in the poorer parts of the East and throughout the South and West , the religious frenzy often passed into a sexual orgy , and as dusk came on , and the preacher played on the emotional natures of his hearers , he would be surrounded by a mass of humanity in which all intellectual control had been released , some falling insensible , some writhing in fits , some crawling and barking like dogs , some having the " jerks , " and others throwing themselves in couples on the ground among the trees in frenzies of sensual passion . Although such meetings were greatly objected to by the more substantial men , they were a natural outcome of the abnormal conditions in  | many sections of American life . Man craves an outlet for his emotions , and these had been completely starved in the monotonous , hard-working , lonely , drab existence of the outer settlements and frontier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely throw a lurid light on a more general factor which was beginning to have influence in America . All the way down the stream of European life , from savagery through paganism to the Middle Ages , there had been in most periods various outlets for man 's emotional nature . There were the household arts and crafts , in which man 's aesthetic emotions , however crude , found some self-expression . There were the religious pageants , services , and festivals , full of color and emotional content , many of them derived unconsciously from those of pagan days . There was much in the communal life of one sort and another that brought people together and gave interest and color to their lives . Almost all of this had disappeared in America . Self-expression in art had , as we have noted , been abandoned under the stress of the struggle for mere material comfort . Owing largely to Puritanism , the religious festivals had been abandoned and all aesthetic emotion had been banished from church services . The early Church in Europe , frowning on many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mental health of the people and to bless them in the name of Christianity . There was nothing in the hard-working , drab life of the American poor and pioneers to take the place of all these things . Mind and emotion became ingrowing , and nature took its revenge in the form of occasional outbursts of violent excitement . The camp meeting is a key to much that we shall find even in present-day life , in a nation even yet emotionally starving . The West was growing rapidly . In i800 the territory of " Indiana " was set off from the Northwest Territory because of the radicals ' objections to the governor , St. Clair . Three years later the State of Ohio was formed and admitted to the Union , with the most democratic constitution of any State yet ? judges , for example , being appointed by the legislature ,  | and for periods of seven years instead of for life or good behavior . Population was increasing so fast that there seemed no limit to possible development . There was comparatively little intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave to the whole of the States now being built up a unity of life and direction of which they were very self-conscious . There was a free West and a slave-owning West , but these sections were bound together by the subtle tie of both being " West " and by the more material one of " 01 ' Man River , " who brought them all together and promised to be the great common outlet for all their produce . There was no market in the East , owing to the cost of transporting produce over the mountains . There were only creditors there , for most of the Westerners owed money either to land companies or the government , from whom they had bought their lands on partial payment , or to individuals for the expenses of development . Already the East was beginning to be regarded as grasping , aristocratic , snobbish , dangerous , effete , and undemocratic by those who breathed the free air of mortgage-encumbered acres . Then , suddenly , a rumor came that Spain had ceded the territory of Louisiana , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that France might bottle up all Western energy and prosperity by closing the mouth of the river ! Back in the East , which was beginning to look small as compared with the boundless stretch from the Appalachians to the Rockies , North and South were developing fast , and , in some respects , far apart from each other and from the West . In the South , the cotton gin had done its work and created a new economic order . Agriculture and slavery had ceased to be unprofitable . In South Carolina , Georgia , and Alabama the cotton kingdom had arisen , with its great estates and its insatiable demands for more land and more slaves . The tobacco planters of Virginia , who a generation before had been willing to talk of emancipation , now found the breeding of slaves for the ever-yawning market more to the south a profitable adjunct to their fields , although prosperity did not return  | to the great houses . Throughout all the country south of the Potomac , however , the social structure of the ante-bellum period , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Life was utterly different from that in the West , but , because both sections were agricultural and in debt , the political philosophy of each was agrarian . Both feared the growing money power in the North ; and the small democratic farmer of the West and the great landed magnate of the South both disliked the Northern merchant and banker socially ? one because he had no manners , and the other because he had too much ! Jefferson , as we have seen , trusted the common man , but only ? a fact which is now often forgotten ? when that man was a farmer , large or small , and had the self-reliant , individualistic , conservative traits that the ownership and working of the soil develop . He had no faith whatever in a city proletarian class . Nor had he faith in a purely moneyed class of the towns . This had been one of his chief reasons for opposing Hamilton 's attempt to create such classes , which are always found together . In the South , John Taylor of Caroline gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalistic class based on manufacturing , stockjobbing , banking , and speculation was bound , in his opinion , to bring about class hatreds . It would exploit the people at large as ruthlessly as ever royal , noble , or church classes had done , and at the same time be far more difficult to reach or control because it had no distinct legal status or privileges as a class . It would have no legal obligations going with its position and would work subtly underground for its own selfish interest in public opinion or any political party . In the course of time it would ruin the country . Hamilton , however , had been successful ? at least partially so . His policies of refunding , assumption , and of a bank , as well as the tariff to be later adopted , had given an enormous impetus to the building up of a moneyed interest ; but that interest , instead of extending throughout the country as he had expected , had become localized in the North , where it was to remain entrenched until the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest both labor and capital were necessary . We have already noted the difficulty of getting the former in the North , in the absence of free laborers or slaves . The New Englanders , however , now busy starting their new textile mills , solved the problem for the generation of 1800 onward . For various reasons there was much distress among the small farmers , which accounted for the great emigration to the West . Many , however , could not emigrate , because of abject poverty or other causes . To operate their new machines , the mill owners exploited these conditions by seizing on the wives and children of impoverished farmers . " In collecting our help , " wrote one , " we are obliged to employ poor families , and generally those having the greater number of children . " Tending machines , wrote another , did not require men , but was better done by girls of from six to twelve years of age . Of these , great numbers were set to work to create the capital required by their employers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred of them at work , for from twelve to twenty-five cents a day , there being a " dull dejection in the countenances of all of them . " Possibly three quarters of the operatives were young women , but sometimes an entire family let themselves out . In one case , for example , a man signed a contract for $5.0o a week for himself , $2.0o for his sixteen-year-old son , $1.5o for his thirteenyear-old son , $1.25 for his daughter of twelve , $.83 for his boy of ten , $2.33 for his sister , $1.50 for her son of thirteen , and $.75 for her daughter of eight . With a labor supply thus arranged for , the outlook was bright for the rapid production of capital from manufacturing . Shipping , however , was producing it more rapidly . It had been discovered that by buying furs for very little on the coast of Alaska and selling them for a great deal to the Chinese , and by repeating the operation with goods bought in China and sold here , large profits could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up fortunes for men who came from nothing to affluence in a short time . A mercantile " aristocracy , " as its descendants like to call it , was being built up in Salem , Bos-  | ton , Newport , New York , and other ports . Although we usually hear much more of the Massachusetts ships than others , the greatest fortunes were built by men like Astor of New York and Girard of Philadelphia , who in the first decade of the century became America 's first millionaires . Money was coming to count for more in American life and to spell power . Success loomed much larger , and Astor and Girard , whose predatory methods were notorious , became two of the most powerful men in the country , men whose words were respectfully listened to in the Congress now located in the new city of Washington . Astor was a czar in the Far Northwest fur trade , where his power was greater than that of the Federal government ; and a man who , like Girard , could order his London bankers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his idle balance was beginning to exert a new sort of influence . The country was getting rich fast , but there were multitudes of men beside John Taylor of Caroline who looked anxiously at the portents in the North . " We have , " wrote John Adams in 1808 , " one material which actually constitutes an aristocracy that governs the nation . That material is wealth . Talents , birth , virtues , services , sacrifices , are of little consideration with us . " He added that the object of both political parties was " chiefly wealth . " Connecticut was and always had been , he said , governed by a half-dozen or a dozen families at most . Looking back later , Emerson wrote , perhaps somewhat too sweepingly , that between 1790 and 1820 there was " not a book , a speech , a conversation , or a thought " produced in the State of Massachusetts . Emerson may have exaggerated , but our intellectual life was at a low ebb . In the North , new men , with no background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were building up new fortunes to incredible figures for that day , and setting a new pace for all to follow . In the South much more of the Old World lingered , but there also King Cotton was scattering riches so lavishly and in such unexpected and untraditional directions that the pursuit became absorbing .. In the West , life was hard and the pioneer qualities had to be exalted lest the weary people faint . The civili-  | zation of the eighteenth century had died , and a new America was emerging , whatever it might prove to be . Meanwhile , in spite of the Declaration of Independence , America was not yet free , but was still swirling around in the wake of European States . In 1797 , Washington had been succeeded as President by John Adams , of the Federalist Party , if Adams could be said ever to have belonged to a party . England and France were again at war , and both were preying on our commerce , France being the worst aggressor in this period . In spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political parties strongly espoused sides in the European quarrel , the Republicans ( then so-called ) under Jefferson being insanely pro-French and the Federalists pro-English . John Adams , like Washington , was merely pro-American . The provocations of France , especially in her adding insult to injury in refusing to accept our representatives unless bribed to do so , as was made clear in the X.Y.Z . correspondence , were very great . Pugnacious as Adams could be on occasion , he was as anxious as Washington to keep the country clear of European war , at least for those twenty years which Washington had deemed necessary for us to grow in . Hamilton , however , who considered himself the real head of the Federalist Party , but in reality was beginning to lose his own , had grandiose schemes for declaring war on France and then , in concert with England , for attacking Spain , leading a great army of invasion ? with himself in the role of conquering hero ? into Mexico , seizing the whole Southwest , and allowing England to compensate herself further south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams chafed and fretted , but Hamilton and his Massachusetts followers , the little powerful group of Federalist leaders known as the " Essex Junto , " felt that they had the game quite in hand , and were speechifying in the Senate on the armed forces to be raised when , without having taken them into his counsel at all , Adams sent in the appointment of a Minister to France and blew their schemes to atoms . He had learned at last that  | no trust could be placed in the party leaders ; France had given him an opening that might lead to peace ; and , though it involved his own political ruin , the President had seized it and saved the country . Hamilton and the Junto were mad with rage , and determined to ruin Adams even though the party should commit suicide . History has upheld both the courage and the wisdom of Adams , whom Hamilton professed to regard as unfit for his office , and Adams himself never wavered in the belief that what he had done was right . Years afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life , and would have inscribed on his tombstone : " Here lies John Adams , who took upon himself the responsibility of peace with France in the year 1800 . " During the excitement , in 1798 , Congress had passed the Alien and Sedition Acts , the first authorizing the President to deport without trial any alien whom he should judge dangerous to the peace and safety of the country , and the second providing fine and imprisonment for anyone who should publish false , malicious , or scandalous statements about members of the national government with intent to bring them into disrepute . These Acts brought forth responses in the form of resolutions passed by the Southern State of Virginia and the Western State of Kentucky , claiming that the Acts were in contravention of the Federal Constitution and calling upon other States to consider them void , thus voicing the doctrine of States ' rights and nullification . The Alien and Sedition Acts , together with the Naturalization Act , by which a residence of fourteen instead of five years was made necessary before an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamiltonian-Federalist distrust of the common man . Even the excesses of the French Revolution had not destroyed Jefferson 's implicit faith in him , so long as he remained dependent upon the soil and not upon some capitalist for his living . Whether Jefferson was right or wrong yet remains an open question , for though in political life America 's dream and ideal rest on the Jeffersonian faith in the common man , in her economic life she has developed along the lines  | of Hamiltonian special privilege and moneyed classes . As America grew she tried to serve , so to say , God and Mammon ? that is , she insisted upon clinging to the ideal of Jeffersonianism while gathering in the money profits from Hamiltonianism . By building up a great industrial and financial , instead of an agrarian , State , we have cut the major premise from out the logical structure of Jefferson 's faith , and applied that faith to conditions under which he distinctly renounced it . On the other hand , we have erected an economic order according to Hamilton , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe would work . That is the modern American paradox . In 1800 , however , America was still at the parting of the ways , and it yet seemed possible that the nation might choose to follow in the pure doctrine of either one or the other leader . There is no doubt that Jeffersonianism was the American doctrine , stemming straight from the Declaration of Independence , which he had drawn up , and from the whole theory upon which the War of Secession from England had been fought . If the common man were to be submerged beneath a hierarchy of the moneyed class , it was not easy for him to see wherein he had gained by substituting for a political king three thousand miles overseas a creditor king at his cottage door . If America has stood for anything unique in the history of the world , it has been for the American dream , the belief in the common man and the insistence upon his having , as far as possible , equal opportunity in every way with the rich one .

The great debtors of the Southern plantations and small debtors of the Western clearings were equally distrustful of the rising financial powers of the North .

Of the national debt , the one State of Massachusetts held more than all the Southern States combined . They had watched the rise under government favoritism of a  | **41;1165;TOOLONG group whose interests they believed , not without reason , to be directly opposed to those of the farmers and planters . From 1796 to 1800 they had seen the expenses of the Federal government mount from $5,800,000 to $10,800,000 , while in 1798 the party which had built up the moneyed class by special privilege laid a direct tax on houses , lands , and slaves , the weight of which fell to a far greater extent upon the planter in the South , and the poor everywhere , than upon the new rich of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general discontent in ' Soo , combined with the split in the Federalist Party , gave him his opportunity . The presidential campaign of ' Soo was fought with great bitterness , the clergy of Connecticut in particular contributing a most ungodly amount of unchristian lying about Mr. Jefferson . With the almost solid backing of the South and West , and the addition of large numbers from the poor farmer and city laboring class in the North , the Republican ( later the Democratic ) Party won easily , although , owing to the system then in force , there was a tie vote between Jefferson and Burr for highest place . This was settled in the House of Representatives as provided for by the Constitution , and Jefferson was elected . On the last evening before he retired from office , John Adams appointed a number of Federal judges , as he had shortly before appointed John Marshall as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , with profound and lasting effect upon the development of both the Constitution and the nation . The judiciary was the only branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept clean from office . In the past dozen years they had rendered great services to the country , but their political philosophy of governing by an oligarchy of wealth , talent , and birth was wholly un-American as interpreted by the great mass of the American people . The American philosophy was based on the economics of agrarianism , and agrarianism had won . Farmers , Jefferson had said , " are the true representatives of the great American interest , and are alone to be relied upon for expressing the proper American  | sentiments . " They had responded by expressing those sentiments at the polls with exceptional clarity . Jefferson 's election was a triumph for the American dream . We have seen how , in spite of the vast changes due to following Hamilton in our business life , America even yet clings to the Jeffersonian belief in the common man . This is still an axiom with millions of Americans who have forgotten or never heard of Jefferson 's distinction between " common men " of varying industrial pursuits . But subconsciously that distinction seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American farmer has been considered to be the special repository of the American virtues , in spite of the enormous increase in other classes of toilers . Up to the Great War , it was an asset of no small value to a public man to have been raised on a farm , to have been a " barefoot boy , with cheek of tan " ? in spite of the fact that nearly half the boys in the nation were by that time being brought up to dodge automobiles in crossing city streets . The fears of Jefferson 's opponents that his entry upon office would usher in a reign of anarchy were wholly without foundation . The disgraceful predictions of the Reverend Timothy Dwight , Congregational " Pope " of Connecticut and President of Yale College , that if Jefferson were elected " we may see our wives and daughters the victims of legal prostitution ; soberly dishonored ; speciously polluted ; the outcasts of delicacy and virtue , the loathing of God and man , " simply did not come to pass . As a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more genuinely religious men than Jefferson ever entered the White House , although the New England clergy , like all others , subtly influenced by the economic interests of the richer members of their congregations , could not appreciate that fact . Jefferson insisted upon maintaining the national credit , and upon the payment of all debts , public and private . His first four years were a period of excellent , economical government , illuminated by one of the most brilliant coups in international politics that have ever been seen .  | By 1800 there were a million Americans settled in the territory which the British government had tried to close to pioneers by the Proclamation of 1763 . Every little village and scrub town along the Western rivers ? Pittsburgh , Wheeling , Cincinnati , and hosts of others ? was dreaming of a future in which it would be a great centre of wealth and population . There is never any past on the frontier , only a future , and one of the most radical changes which frontier mentality undergoes is precisely this complete shift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the past is bound to act as a powerful solvent on one 's entire stock of ideas and mental processes . The rumor , therefore , that Spain had ceded Louisiana to France and that France was to close " the river " came as a profound shock , not merely to business plans of the moment , but to the whole dream the West had been dreaming . For two years France repeatedly lied , denying that any transfer had taken place , but at last she was ready to act openly , and in October 18o2 the agent at New Orleans closed the river to American commerce . Spain had ceased to be a power in the Mississippi Valley . The future of the West depended again on France , and Napoleon had turned the key on the only door which opened on the world . From flatboat to flatboat , river town to river town , the news leaped frantically up " the river " and along its tributaries . It was carried overland by swift courier from Natchez to Washington , and reached Jefferson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew how slight the bond of economic interest was that held it to the East . He knew the dream it dreamed , and that if no help came promptly from the Federal government , the pioneers would take matters into their own hands , rush France out of its slender hold on the Gulf , plunge the nation into war , and perhaps set up for themselves a huge trans-Appalachian State , a United States of the Mississippi . The Federalists hoped a chance had come to break Jefferson 's popularity in the West , and howled for war . Jefferson , however , had long foreseen the crisis . Six months before , he had written to the American Minister in Paris that  | the day France took possession of New Orleans , " we must marry ourselves to the British fleet and nation . " First , however , he would try pacific means , and without divulging his purpose he obtained an authorization from Congress of a million dollars for expenses incidental to our intercourse with foreign nations . He then instructed the Minister in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island of New Orleans alone , or , at worst , the right of navigation . There were ample reasons , some known and others not ( including the imminence of war with England ) , why at that moment Napoleon was anxious to turn an uncertain liability in the New World into cash in the Old . On April 11 , 1803 , he defied the British Ambassador and simultaneously offered the American Minister , Robert Livingston , and our special envoy , James Monroe , the whole of Louisiana . Terms were quickly arranged , and in less than three weeks the United States had secured the entire continent from the east bank of the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains , and from northern Texas to the Canadian border , for a total sum of fifteen million dollars . " 01 ' Man River " had become American for his whole four thousand miles of imperial extent . A million square miles had doubled the size of the country , three fourths of which was now " the West . " By a stroke of the pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convulsion of nature . Meanwhile an event had occurred in Washington which was also to alter materially the development of the nation , although it had none of the spectacular quality of Jefferson 's statesmanship . In delivering an opinion in the case of Marbury v. Madison , Chief Justice Marshall had quietly laid down the principle that " a legislative act contrary to the Constitution is not law ... that a law repugnant to the Constitution is void . " The Supreme Court thus placed the corner stone of its power of legislative review . Congress was not , like Parliament , to express the legislative will of the people . The veto of the elected President could be overridden if desired , but not the judicial veto of a majority of our nine judges appointed for life if their verdict should be , " Unconstitutional . "  | Jefferson 's first term had been amazingly successful . The Federalists were demoralized , and in July 1804 , when Aaron Burr killed their leader , Hamilton , in a duel , their power crumbled completely . In the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 . Whether or not the territory ceded by France included the Floridas and Texas was a moot point . Jefferson wanted Florida , to give us control of the Gulf coast , and the Westerners wanted Texas . In 18o6 , Burr , now thoroughly discredited , went West and played his hand at some sort of conspiracy which is even yet unexplained . In any case it was a complete fiasco , but other troubles crowded quickly on the President . The war between England and France was bringing in its train the usual insults to ourselves . Among these was the impressment of seamen on our vessels by the British . There was no question but that large numbers of British subjects preferred to serve on American merchant vessels rather than on British ships of war , but the mere claim of a right to stop and search our vessels would have been annoying enough in itself had the British not gone further and frequently taken bona-fide Americans from them . There was much fraud connected with naturalization papers , and the claim to American citizenship did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar procedure , owing to the difference in race and language , so this particular source of irritation was wholly of British origin . In June 1807 , England went even further , and a roar of indignation went up in America when the British frigate Leopard overhauled our frigate Chesapeake off the Norfolk Capes , fired on her , and took off four men . Had Jefferson chosen to declare war , he would have had a united country behind him , but he preferred to try the coercion of economic measures , and the rest of his term is mainly the story of the failure of his embargo policy , and the rising bitterness of the commercial Northerners against the closing of their ports and the ruin of their shipping by their own government . Meanwhile both England and France were issuing their Orders in Council and decrees , aiming  | at establishing paper blockades and preventing neutrals from trading with either country . In this respect there was nothing whatever to choose between the two countries in respect to their interference with our rights . Our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once out on the high seas we were still kicked about by both the European belligerents , and it was not easy to tell which was kicking us harder . Jefferson 's policy of standing on the side lines while the Europeans kicked each other , and perhaps forcing their attention to our claims by refusing to trade with them , had been a complete failure , much more likely to disrupt the Union by the Secession of New England than to gain international respect for our rights . There might be little choice between England and France in respect of wrongs done us , but we could hardly enter the fight against both at once when they were fighting each other . We were not at all in the position of the man who can take two squabbling boys and knock their heads together . It might be , as William Pinkney said in 181o , that " war with France is about as practicable as war with the moon , " but if we were to choose sides , the side chosen would depend on something more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we have said , the centre of gravity of America had shifted , and the real demand for war was to come from the West . The character of our new acquisition to the west of " the river " was not yet well known , but the exploring expeditions of Lewis and Clark in the Northwest and of Zebulon M. Pike in the Southwest had indicated that the prairies and plains were not of much use to settlers , and thus the western half of the country was to retain its reputation as the great American desert until after the Civil War . Our pioneers were still woodsmen , used to clearing forests , and the treeless wastes beyond puzzled and discouraged them . So the frontier , with its three advances of hunters and traders , of short-stop settlers , and of real settlement , kept on pushing northward into Indiana and the Northwest Territory , shoving the Indians steadily backward . Between 1795 and 1809 , by " treaties , " the savages  | had been forced to part with forty-eight million acres of their hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two of the few great leaders who have arisen among the red men , Tecumseh and his brother , the latter called the Prophet , who were sons of a Shawnee . The old trader 's method of getting furs cheaply by debauching the Indians with whiskey had been followed on a larger scale , and if possible in a more scandalous way , by the great Astor , and what with this practice , wars , and the change in the habits of their life , the natives had shrunk to perhaps only four thousand in the great rectangle between Pennsylvania , the Mississippi , the Ohio River , and the Canadian border . The two Shawnees determined to save their race without attacking the whites within their own boundaries . They urged that no further cessions of land be made , and preached against the use of strong drink . The land-hungry whites were alarmed . They saw their hopes dashed if the Indians should become moral , law-abiding , and insistent upon remaining upon their lands . William Henry Harrison was governor of the Indiana Territory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few scattered and irresponsible savages who ceded Tecumseh 's hunting grounds , and then Harrison , advancing on Tecumseh 's camp , provoked a fight , the famous " battle " of Tippecanoe . Tecumseh 's " conspiracy " was broken , but the affair was raw enough and had to be glorified . Rumor was spread and gladly believed that the English in Canada had been behind the savage in egging him on to keep the Americans off his lands , and the streams from the vials of moral indignation were diverted from Harrison and the Westerners to the British , who , having been the enemy for forty years , could easily be made the scapegoats for anything . As a matter of fact we know now that they had nothing whatever to do with Tecumseh . Over the mountains in Washington the new President , James Madison , who was struggling with the international situation and was trying to preserve peace by getting both the belligerents in Europe to rescind their obnoxious Orders and De-  | crees , seemed to be making some headway . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be led by the West . Fiery young men came from Kentucky and settlements up to the Canadian border , with Henry Clay at their head , to be joined by John C. Calhoun from the South Carolina frontier . Little by little these " war-hawks , " as they were called , fanned the flame of the war spirit in Congress , shouting how Canada could be conquered in six weeks , but mainly giving the war cry of " sailors ' rights . " They were strongly opposed by the New England States , which were the only ones that had any sailors , but which much preferred a profitable , if speculative , trade to war , and had no wish to sacrifice that trade for the sake of pulling the Canadian chestnut out of the fire for the benefit of a West which they already dreaded . In fact , they feared the westward shift of power so greatly that Josiah Quincy , of Massachusetts , had solemnly proclaimed in Congress in January 1811 , that if Louisiana were admitted as a State ? as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dissolved , and that " as it will be the right of all , so it will be the duty of some , to prepare , definitely , for a separation ; amicably , if they can ; violently , if they must . " New England had nullified the Embargo . It now threatened secession . On June 23 , 1812 , Parliament repealed the Orders in Council . It was too late . There was no cable to bear the news to America , and five days earlier the war-hawks had succeeded . Congress , in compliance with the President 's message , had declared war with England on the eighteenth . The war proved inglorious and indecisive . We were unprepared , and England had her hands so full elsewhere that one more small enemy was not worth bothering about . Land operations against Canada were disastrous for us . On the water we had some good fights and gained some brilliant victories , mostly in duels between single ships on either side , which did much to kindle patriotic enthusiasm here and to breed respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution over the Guerriere , of the Wasp over the Frolic , and of Perry over the English on Lake Erie , were welcome indeed to the  | young nation . The West threw up a new hero to the surface of American political life in Andrew Jackson , who marched into Florida , and also , after peace was signed but the fact was still unknown to him , inflicted a severe defeat on the British in the battle of New Orleans . Meanwhile the British had captured the city of Washington , and in dastardly fashion and sheer wantonness had burned some of the public buildings and many of our national records . New England , rapidly being altered by force of circumstances from a maritime to a manufacturing section , was disloyal almost to the point of treason . She discouraged enlistment , refused the services of militia , declined to subscribe to government loans , and threatened secession . So strong , indeed , was the odor of secession and disloyalty around the meeting of Federalist delegates at the so-called Hartford Convention in 1814 that the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a war which was bringing neither glory nor gain to either of them . Peace was made at Ghent the day before Christmas , 1814 , with nothing said about any of the grievances which we had complained of when we began hostilities . The war , however , was far from having no results , quite aside from our having slipped West Florida into our pocket during the general excitement . We had managed to keep out of European wars for the twenty years that Washington had said were necessary for our growth , thanks to himself , Adams , and Jefferson . At last , pushed into it by the West , we had shown the world that we would go to war if provoked too far . Moreover the English , who appreciate a good fighter , had measured us with themselves at sea , and had infinitely more respect for our abilities than they had had before . Less happily , the war left bitterness on both sides . England , who had felt that she was fighting the battle of freedom against the all-grasping tyrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world safe for democracy by fighting Germany recently , could not forgive us for stabbing her in the back when she was so engaged and throwing our weight on the side of Napoleon , who had injured our commerce quite as much as she had . In America ,  | the belief in England 's inveterate enmity , a tradition fostered among us since the Revolution , was given an enormously increased strength by our having chosen her as our enemy a second time in our short national life . It required several generations of research to disprove utterly General Harrison 's lies about the English having set Tecumseh on us , and Harrison 's later political career as " Tippecanoe " tended to make a legend of British perfidy . Had the Westerners not longed for Canada and Tecumseh 's hunting grounds , and had France been a little more accessible as an enemy than " the moon , " we might very well have gone to war with Napoleon instead of with England , and the whole sentimental history of our international relations might have been quite different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad foundations for international relations . Had Napoleon not sold us Louisiana , we should have been dragged into war with him , and " married the British fleet . " The War of 1812 began in Napoleon 's bathtub , where he was when he made known his inexorable decision to sell Louisiana . It ended on the Atlantic Ocean with America fighting his enemies for him . His legend never came between the American people and that of Lafayette . One more result of the war was that we had at last gained our independence from Europe . We seceded from it almost completely . Not only were we no longer caught in every eddy of its political contests , but we turned our faces away from it and toward the West . A sense of nationality and destiny , as well as an immense task of material exploitation , began to influence all classes . For the next twenty years we scarcely thought of Europe , except , perhaps , now and then to resent it . Our schoolboys continued to declaim the revolutionary orations against England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of " pieces to speak , " and because these orations belonged to our short history as a nation , of which we were becoming very conscious . For the most part , however , we scarcely took our eyes off the colossal task of material development and westward expansion . We decided to our own entire satisfaction that we had just fought a glorious war , and got down to work  | and making money . During the war , Key had written " The Star Spangled Banner , " and it now began to " wave . " Emigrants swarmed into the new West , which seemed to be sucking in men from the whole of the old , and now comparatively small , South and North . The new centre of gravity was being ever more heavily weighted . On the other hand , the collapse of the Federalist Party , the disloyalty of New England , the stench ? of which the most was made ? of the Hartford Convention , all left New England with only a tithe of the national influence it had possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great estates , many of them wearing out from too incessant cultivation of single crops , was becoming a section apart from the fast-throbbing life of the new nation . Over the mountains the great valley , two thousand miles wide , with its unified river system four thousand miles long , opened an empire such as man had never seen . There was nothing now to stop the American short of the Rockies , except the " Great American desert . " The songs of the voyageurs had been hushed . On the slopes of the Pacific the bells tolled on in the sleepy Spanish missions of California , where the dreams were of Heaven or bright black eyes and not of expanding empire . Louder and louder rose the sound of the Saxon . Along the whole front of the moving American " West " a myriad axes swung , crackcrack-crack , in ever faster and more dominant staccato , as the trees crashed , and the clearings multiplied with incredible swiftness .  | THE SUN RISES IN THE WEST In 1800 a million Americans were living west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly as to frighten Eastern conservatives out of their wits . Then came the Louisiana Purchase , the war with England , and Indian cessions , throwing open a new empire to settlement . New England had always liked to consider itself the driver of the American coach , and the old die-hard Federalists there fought tooth and nail against the upbuilding of a new section which might threaten its dying influence . Through their mouthpiece in Congress , Josiah Quincy , they had thundered against the addition of French Louisiana and the creation of new States . " You have no authority , " Quincy told the members of Congress , " to throw the rights and property of this people into the ' hotch-potch ' with the wild men on the Missouri , nor with the mixed , though more respectable race of **28;1208;TOOLONG who bask on the sands in the mouth of the Mississippi . . . . Do you suppose the people of the Northern and Atlantic States will , or ought to , look on with patience and see Representatives  | and Senators from the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other floor , managing the concerns of a seaboard fifteen hundred miles , at least , from their residence ? " Whether patiently or not , that is precisely what they were going to see . By 1820 there were two and a half million people instead of one million over the mountains ? one quarter of the whole population of the United States , and a million more than there were in New England . By 1830 one third of the American people were " men of the Western Waters , " as they liked to call themselves , numbering three and a half million . For still another decade emigration westward was to be wholly of native-born American stock . As we shall note in a later chapter , the vacuum left in the older States by this vast exodus and by the rapidly increasing demand for industrial labor brought about an inflow of foreigners , but these stayed on the seaboard , so that until past the mid-century the Mississippi Valley was racially , as well as in its enforced economic democracy , the real home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed most certain of realization . Emigration from the seaboard States , mostly Southern , had continued throughout the war , but after peace it became a veritable exodus . From the North , which was also swept by what was called " the Ohio fever , " the chief entry to the West was over the mountains and down the Ohio River . The flatboats carrying a nation to empire floated steadily westward . Colonel John May , a rich Boston merchant who was a stockholder in the Ohio Company , watched them pass Pittsburgh , and noted that two had " on board twenty-nine whites , twentyfour negroes , nine dogs , twenty-three horses , cows , hogs , etc. ? besides provisions and furniture . " Thousands upon thousands floated and poled their way down the Ohio , after having crossed the mountains on foot or in Conestoga wagons . " To-day , " wrote Judge Hall , " we passed two large rafts lashed together , by which simple conveyance several families from New England were transporting themselves and their property to the land of promise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | feet long , with a small house erected on it ; and on each was a stack of hay , round which several horses and cows were feeding , while the paraphernalia of a farm yard , the ploughs , wagons , pigs , children and poultry , carelessly distributed , gave to the whole more the appearance of a permanent residence , than a caravan of adventurers seeking a home . A respectable looking old lady , with spectacles on nose , was seated on a chair at the door of one of the cabins , employed in knitting ; another female was at the wash-tub ; the men were chewing their tobacco , with as much complacency as if they had been in the land of steady habits , ' and the various family avocations seemed to go like clock-work . " So they passed , these men and women of destiny , to the infinite toil of home building in the wilderness . Indian alarms were as frequent as fires in Boston , May wrote in 18o5 , and he was tortured by myriads of gnats which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a number of poor devils ? five in all ? took their departure homeward this morning . They came from home moneyless and brainless , and have returned as they came . " Another traveler a decade later noted.that after passing the Wabash " there was a complete departure from all mark of civilization . " " These lonely settlers are poorly off , " he added ; " their bread-corn must be ground thirty miles off , requiring three days to carry to the mill , and bring back , the small horseload of three bushels . Articles of family manufacture are very scanty , and what they purchase is of the meanest quality and excessively dear : yet they are friendly and willing to share their simple fare with you . It is surprising how comfortable they seem , wanting everything . To struggle with privations has now become the habit of their lives , most of them having made several successive plunges into the wilderness : and they begin already to talk of selling their improvements , ' and getting still farther back , ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The haunting problem was that of a market . The settlers could swallow the gnats and drive back the Indians . They could fell trees and build their cabins , but money ? where  | could they get money ? And money they had to have . Furniture , tools , books , all the implements of civilization had to come from the outer world into their great valley , over the mountains or up " the river , " and had to be paid for in goods or cash , and even " the river " did not yet afford the outlet to a market needed by innumerable small settlers . Money almost every one of them needed , too , to pay for the land itself . Under the Act of i800 , Eastern speculators had taken up vast tracts , twenty thousand to five hundred thousand acres at a time , of some of the best lands , and these they sold to settlers on credit at prices much above that asked by the government . But even if the settler had bought from the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best that the farmers could do , as one of them said , was " just . not to starve . " Default became general . Nearly a third of the land originally contracted for was given up , and , speaking generally , the entire West was in debt to the East , either to individual capitalists or to the government . The government did not evict the settlers , and as the more successful farmers noted this they began to default , for they could not see why they should pay if their neighbor got his land without paying , By 1820 the defaulted payments amounted to over $21,000,000 . The whole situation made for demoralization of financial character . Congress tinkered with the law , but so long as the East remained in control , there was little hope of seeing the West 's demand for free land accepted as a government theory , the East insisting that the government should derive a profit from the public domain . On the frontier this theory had been discarded by 1820 . Free land was demanded as a right for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth something . In 1820 an act was passed abolishing the credit system of purchase and reducing the price to $I.25 an acre , and a compromise was reached with defaulters by taking from them the proportion of land unpaid for and giving a clear title to the remainder . The West , however , had been thoroughly and bitterly convinced that it was being exploited for the benefit of the East .  | It had also had an experience with banks which it never forgot . The need for cash had been answered by the upspringing of many small banks , managed , even when honestly , all too " often by men who knew nothing of the principles of sound banking . Farmers went heavily into debt , believing that land was bound to rise quickly in price . The panic of 1819 found them not only in debt to the East and the government , but to their local banks . The whole community was buried three feet deep in debt it could not pay . If a mortgage was foreclosed , there was no one to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the edge of every clearing . Banks demanded payment , could get none , and merely maddened the people , who stood solidly together in sentiment as they did in debt . The banks then failed like corn popping in the fire , and the West 's conception of the money power had taken definite shape . The Eastern land speculator had demanded money ; the government had demanded it ; the merchants had demanded it ; the banks had demanded it ; but if the settlers had no market for their surplus products , where were they to get it ? The mountain rampart to the eastward made freight rates prohibitive . One could float down " the river , " but its strong current made getting back almost impossible by pole or sail . Two questions were becoming clear . Was the Westerner , with his dream of empire , to sink to the level of a serf or a peasant , tilling his land for just enough to sustain life and to be harassed by his creditors ? With economic democracy throughout a vast area and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominous aspect . Could the Union hold together unless the problem of a market for three million people could be solved ? That meant transportation , and the only means of transport ever known to man , horses on roads or sailboats on the water , had both failed . In spite of a large emigration from the Northern Atlantic States , particularly to Ohio and the Western Reserve , the immigration to the West up to 182o and even 1830 had been , as we have said , chiefly from Virginia and the States farther south . Most of the families had come from the Piedmont and  | frontier sections of the Eastern Southern States , small farmers , and this emigration also continued . There was little difference between these settlers and those from the North . Most of them held no slaves and many were extremely poor . We get a glimpse of the latter sort in a note of 1819 which records that there passed through Augusta , " bound for Chatahouchee , a man and his wife , his son and wife , with a cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders and he drew in the shafts ; the son worked by traces tied to the end of the shafts and assisted his father to draw the cart : the son 's wife rode in the cart , and the old woman was walking , carrying a rifle and driving a cow . " Not many slaves came in at first , and in any case the question of slavery was not a sectional one in the West for some time . A convention held at Vincennes had petitioned the governor of the territory to suspend the prohibition of slavery in Indiana so as not to divert Southern settlement to Missouri , and as late as 1824 a proposed pro-slavery amendment in Illinois was defeated by only five to four . After the end of the War of 1812 , cotton rose as high as thirty-four cents a pound , and during that decade there was heavy emigration of another sort to the southern part of the West . The larger slave owners bought tracts of several thousand acres each in the belt of rich black soil , and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their families , troops of slaves , and horses and cattle . For the most part they bought land already cleared by the pioneers of the first advance , who were pushed farther ahead . A change was becoming apparent rather than notable by 181s , and increased from then on . In the second advancing battalions of the frontier , population increased in both the north and south of the West , but in the north it was mainly a white population which built up towns where the first pioneers had left hamlets , which founded schools , cultivated farms more carefully , and accumulated property . In the southern part , the white population diminished rapidly in proportion to the total , and slaves replaced the free labor of the first Southern frontiersmen . Instead of towns , plantations sprang up , requiring ever more land and more slaves .  | From the beginning the cotton planter had a sure market for his produce , and this was to have an effect we shall note later . But in the third and completely settled stage of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the northern and southern sections . The northern towns and farms became more prosperous , and a community life of prosperous people developed . The southern plantations , on the other hand , began to feel the effect of an exhausting single crop . The largest owners , many of whom had become absentees , living in Charleston or Savannah or even in Paris , might buy new land farther west and move their plantation almost bodily forward , leaving an impoverished community behind them ; or , more usually , they would stay on in the old place , getting steadily more mired in debt , but keeping up the scale of living to which they had been accustomed . By 1821 one third of all the cotton raised was on land west of Georgia , but no prosperous and populous communities were being built up . The real Southern frontiersmen had this landhungry , plantation economy pushing steadily behind them . The " West " in the South was geographically very narrow as compared with the North , and when the Southern pioneer had been pushed across Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Spaniard . Mexico had revolted in 1821 and declared her independence . In her great province of Texas , land could be bought for twelve and one half cents an acre , or one tenth what the American government charged , and within a decade eighteen or twenty thousand Southern pioneers had pressed over the border and were living under Mexican rule . The waves of the advancing English had finally begun to lap at the doorsills of the Spanish missions . On the open plains of Texas the sound of the American axe was little heard , and the American , now half farmer , half ranchman , listened with Protestant dislike to the sound of the mission bells . Two great racial and religious currents had met at last , and began to swirl in dangerous water . However different the northern and southern sections of the West might be growing from each other , the West as a whole  | was a unit as compared with North and South in the East . In twenty years two million people had shared the experience of pioneering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was subtle . The Connecticut Yankee might talk with a nasal twang and the neighbor who had trekked over the mountains from the upland of Carolina might talk with a drawl , but between them was a common bond of a great experience ad of the acceptance of a mode of life . Debt , hardship , independence , a dozen things bound them together and made them brothers when contrasted with the Northern merchant or Southern planter " back East . " And the Mississippi , " the river , " " 01 ' Man River , " bound them again . Back East a Yankee farmer never went visiting to a Georgia patch up on the mountain side , but up and down " the river " people traveled and met and mingled . Life was mobile , free , and often lawless . The men of the Western Waters had more than Indians and trees to fell , and debts to worry about . Wreckers and robbers infested the river towns of the Ohio and the Mississippi ; the Harpes , Hare , the Masons , " Pluggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were names which brought terror to many a home and town . Picturesque and villainous , living on horseback or on islands in " the river " or in caves in the banks made into fortresses , they brought a new element into the complexity of American life . There had been plenty of lawbreaking back East , but there , for the most part , life had been safe . Life along " the river " was far from safe , and the vast stream which welcomed everything , clutched at everything , received without a sound many a body riddled with holes from ball or knife . To go back East was to get into another life , a life of crowded population , of drawing-rooms and countingrooms , where the poor were quite safe from the assassin but not from the tax gatherer , and where the cultivated classes were getting very much worried about the threats to their property coming from such outlandish communities as Kentucky and Illinois and Heaven knew what new States which were being " admitted " to outvote them . Besides Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Louisiana in 1812 , Indiana in 1816 , Mississippi in 1817 , Illinois in 1818 , Alabama in 1819 ; and each of them had as many Senators as Massachusetts or New York or Virginia . What was to be the end of it all ? President Timothy Dwight of Yale College gave full vent to his spleen . " The class of pioneers , " he wrote , " can not live in regular society . They are too idle , too talkative , too passionate , too prodigal , and too shiftless to acquire either property or character . They . . . grumble about the taxes by which the Rulers , Ministers and Schoolmasters are supported .... After exposing the injustice of the community in neglecting to invest persons of such superior merit in public offices , in many an eloquent harangue uttered by many a kitchen fire , in every blacksmith shop , in every corner of the streets , and finding all their efforts vain , they become at length discouraged , and under pressure of poverty , the fear of the gaol , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betake themselves to the wilderness . " Poor Dwight ! " Regular society " and " the fear of the gaol " ! It is time we went back over the mountains to see what all this was about . " Gaol , " of course , was the prison for poor debtors who could not pay , which , with its horrors for the poor , was still in vogue in the East ; but America was evidently getting to be much more complicated than had been the eighteenthcentury seaboard civilization which had so proudly announced to the world that all men were born equal and that all had the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . Dwight , being related to the half-dozen or dozen families which ruled Connecticut , naturally saw things in a different light . To him and his like , the American dream was a distressing nightmare . New England , and , to a slightly lesser extent , the Middle States , were in the grip of a revolution which was completely to alter the life of the sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South and the West . Manufacturing , as we have seen , had made a start in the earlier period , but until the Embargo and the War of 1812 the economic life had consisted chiefly of small farming and of shipping . Between 18os and  | the end of the war , shipping had received a series of blows from which it was long in recovering . On the other hand , conditions fostered the growth of manufacturing at a stupendous rate . By 1810 the total value of all manufactured goods had reached the figure of at least $125,000,000 in the United States , mostly centred in the Northern States . New England textile mills which had been able to use only 500 bales of cotton in ' Soo were calling for 90,000 by 1815 , and the new industries , like snowballs rolling downhill , kept increasing their size with extraordinary rapidity . Between 182o and 1831 in Massachusetts alone , the output of the cotton mills rose from $700,000 to $7,700,000 , and of her woolens from $300,000 to $7,300,000 . Of less immediate importance than such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , was the new system introduced by Eli Whitney , who had already profoundly altered American history by his cotton gin . In fact , while history usually deals with political persons , it would be hard to find any statesman or politician of his day who has had a more lasting influence upon our life than this Yankee inventor . Whitney received an order to make muskets for the government during the war . Up to that time a musket , like everything else , had been made by one man , who did it all from start to finish . Whitney , owing to the scarcity of skilled mechanics for sudden large-scale production , conceived the idea of having each man make one part only , ? a much simpler matter to learn , ? and having all parts interchangeable . It took him two years to perfect his system , but once done , the way was open to mass production at lower cost . The news of the exploit spread over the world , but Europe preferred to continue the old craftsman method , for there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been precisely this lack which has determined much in the development of our social and economic life . For the first two decades or more of the century , it was still an open question whether shipping or manufacturing was the more important New England industry , and as their interests were naturally opposed , there was confusion in political policies . In other respects as well as this , the old solidarity  | of New England life was breaking down . Population was increasing , the best land had long since been preempted , and the small farmer , who had been the backbone of New England , was suffering . He was either moving West to better and cheaper land or becoming a hand in a factory town , although for the most part the hands were still women and children . There was little in common between the man who had owned and worked his own farm and the same man working on low wages for a mill owner in one of the new towns fast springing up . Many of the young women who went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make enough for a small dowry , to help pay a mortgage on their father 's farm , or help a brother to go to college or to migrate West . In some mills , notably those at Lowell , the working conditions were considered excellent for that day , though they deteriorated between 1830 and 1840 . The working hours were often from five in the morning to seven at night , and a system of corporation paternalism grew up which dictated the time at which the women , who were forced to live in the companies ' boarding houses , had to go to bed , enforced their attendance at church , and even prescribed ' what church they must subscribe to . Liberty and the pursuit f of happiness were somehow not progressing under industrialism . In spite of the great number who went into the mills , the problem of securing a labor supply was always acute . " Our greatest difficulty at present , " wrote one mill owner in 1832 , relating his twenty-five years ' experience , " is a want of females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of factories now building , I have my fears that we shall not be able to operate all our machinery another year . " If wealth was rapidly accumulating , it was yet more rapidly concentrating . The changing conditions which were fostering the growth of cities in the North were laying the foundations of many of the great fortunes of to-day . The day of the great country magnate even in New York was passing , but that of the city " landlord " had come . The poorer people , who under country conditions had had homes of their own , began to be herded into small quarters in the cities in the hope of finding  | employment . In 1831 , miserly old Stephen Girard died in Philadelphia , leaving $6,000,000 , but only three years before , Mathew Carey had written of how thousands of the poor traveled hundreds of miles seeking employment on roads or canals at 622 to 872 cents a day ; how hundreds died annually from this work under bad conditions , only to have their places taken by others ; how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 35 to 5o cents a day ; and how " there is no employment whatever , how disagreeable or loathsome , or deleterious soever it may be , or however reduced the wages , that does not find persons willing to follow it rather than beg or steal . " Economic democracy was fast breaking down in the North , and the comparative simplicity of an earlier day was passing . There had always been some distinction between town and country , but the two had formerly merged at a dozen points , and in all of the older towns one had had to walk only a few minutes to find one 's self in the country . There had been no such difference in the old days as there was now between an Astor and a farmer , even though the farmer , as might easily have been the case , were better educated than the ignorant immigrant who had become the leviathan of American wealth and who defied the United States government from his home on Broadway . There were , however , more hopeful signs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being broken . Church and State were at last separated in Connecticut in 1818 , and in Massachusetts in 1833 . This was the outward and visible sign of a change that had long been taking place . The old Puritan theology and fervor had been dying for many a day . Unfortunately , whereas the former faith had in many cases been an effective builder of genuine strength of character , the sediment that was deposited when it drained off held chiefly the dregs of some of its worst qualities . The two centuries of insistence upon certain rigid forms of conduct , and the equal insistence upon the duty of the community to be the keeper of the conscience of the individual , remained . The Puritan had  | possessed some sterling traits . His descendant became mainly Puritanical . His belief in himself as the chosen of God lingered long after the relationship had probably become repugnant to the Deity ; it certainly had to the New Englander 's fellow citizens in other sections . On the other hand , much that was good remained , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of many a Western settlement in the wild days ahead . Among the more mediocre minds , the belief that it was incumbent on them to be missionaries , and the welcome given to every crazy doctrine were to strew the country in the next decade with the weeds of thought . Among the better minds , by the change from Congregationalism to Unitarianism , under the lead of Channing , the way was opened to a religion of self-reliance and to a broad humanitarianism . Intellectual preparation was being made in Boston for that burst of optimism , idealism , and a joyous acceptance of life that was to flood the country in the next period . As yet , however , the chief signs of a reviving life for art and letters were to be found in the coterie gathered in New York , with Washington Irving at its head and including Cooper , Bryant , and lesser lights . While this new life of merchants , manufacturers , bankers , literary men , magnates , and proletarians , increasing urbanization and dwindling agriculture , was rapidly setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were becoming fixed and idiosyncratic in the South . The old crops of tobacco , rice , and indigo had become completely overshadowed by cotton . Only a small percentage of the Southern whites had owned slaves , but cotton had opened new visions of riches . Since the beginning of the century there had been much to turn our heads from the older and slower ways of building up a property . The breathless speed at which certain manufactures had grown , the easy money to be made in starting banks , the speculation in Western lands , the risks of commerce in the war , the rapid rise in city real estate as population concentrated , and the effect of the cotton gin , had all been breeding a spirit which demanded riches overnight instead of by the efforts of a lifetime of toil .  | In the South everyone turned to cotton . " The lawyer , and the doctor , and the school-master , as soon as they earned any money , bought land and negroes , and became planters . The preacher who married an heiress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The merchant who wished to retire from the perplexities of business . . . passed his old age in watching the cotton plant spring up from the fresh-plowed ground . " But as the slave trade had been prohibited , the price of slaves advanced rapidly . The small man was losing his chance to get even a start in life . It was estimated in 1839 that a planter could get a thousand acres of good cleared cotton land for $10,000 , but that it would cost him $5o,000 to get the slaves to work it . Had there been a system of free labor , the initial investment would not have been a quarter as much . Once established , the cotton planter was caught in an economic system from which there was no escape . In bad times he could not , like the Northern manufacturer , turn off his hands . They were property , and valuable property , which had to be carried at any cost short of ruin . Across the sea , England was in full tide of industrial revolution and was becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1829 , production of cotton in the South rose from 16o,000,000 pounds to 365,000,000 , a large part of the increase being due to westward extension . Of the total crop , full four fifths was exported to England and France , less than one fifth going to the New England mills . The ships that carried the cotton east to Europe preferred to bring freight back at any low rate rather than come in ballast , and the consequence of this vast and assured foreign market was thus to flood the South with manufactured goods at prices far below those offered by Northern manufacturers . Not only was the South thus building up a culture of its own quite different from that of the North and West , but it was becoming detached from the Northern sections in its whole economic life , Europe being the market in which it both bought and sold to the extent of about 8o per cent . Slaves had begun to seem as vital to the Southern plantation  | as machines in a Northern factory , and as the steady press westward of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was diverted northward much as a glacier meeting an immovable obstacle . Only those who did not mind becoming Mexican expatriates trickled through . The West was still set off against the North and South , but its southern part was becoming slave . The first rumbling of the inevitable conflict was heard with the controversy over admitting Missouri as a slave State in 1819 . Slave and free States had been admitted alternately , and there were eleven of each , giving the two economic systems equal power in the Senate . Missouri , however , lay north of the line which had hitherto tacitly been accepted as marking the northern limits of slavery , and the I North was thrown into ferment by what seemed a new aggressiveness on the part of the expanding Cotton Kingdom . The matter was finally settled by the " Missouri Compromise , " by which Maine and Missouri were both admitted , one as free and one as slave , with the prohibition of any extension of slavery in the Louisiana Purchase north of latitude 36 ? 30 ' . John Quincy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words of the Compromise the " title-page to a great , tragic volume . " By 1820 there were thus coming into clear alignment three sections , the industrial North , the Cotton Kingdom of the South , and the Wert , now narrowing somewhat to mean the part north of the new line . Of these , it was in the West alone that the old economic democracy of pre-Revolutionary days still survived and that the Declaration of Independence was still a living gospel for nearly all classes . It was the beating heart of America . Were the functions and interests of each of these sections to prove irreconcilable with those of the others ? Was the force of nationalism or of sectionalism to prove the stronger ? We have already spoken of the intense need of the West for markets and transportation , and the apparent absence of any solution to the problem . With the increase in industrialism and the decrease in agriculture , the North needed a market  | also , and likewise food . One problem could be solved if the two sections could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the Roman days of roads made of large blocks of stone , most roads on both sides of the ocean had been mere dirt tracks in which wagons could be mired to the hubs in bad weather . About 1800 , the Scotchman McAdam experimented with crushed stone for a surface , and the success of his work made the greatest advance in rural communication until the Ford car . The invention came just in time for the West . The Cumberland Road , following the route of an old Indian trail , was begun before the war and completed from Pennsylvania to Wheeling by 182o , at a cost of a million and a half , provided by Congress . Its solid construction and fine surface at once made it the main entry to the West , but although it II served splendidly for communication and as a link , it had not solved the problem of freight . Another invention , however , came to the assistance of American nationalism . Although John Fitch had built a steamboat as early as 1787 , the first successful one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new era opened for America , East and West , when the Clermont puffed its way laboriously against the current of the Hudson . Within two years Nicholas Roosevelt of New York was in Pittsburgh looking over the problem of Western river navigation . The next year he was back again , and a steamboat a hundred and sixteen feet long , costing $30,000 , was launched from a Pittsburgh yard . Having descended the Mississippi , it turned northward again and demonstrated that here at last was something that would go up stream as well as down . The old flatboats and rafts for floating down " the river " continued long in use , one traveler encountering two thousand of them in a twenty-five days ' trip in 1816 , but this was a one-way traffic . It was a business , however , on all the Western waters , and one which , like all the many varied occupations of Americans , bred its own characters . The boatman had become a type and had his songs as well as the old French voyageur . The  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations earlier the " Fringue , fringue sur la riviere , " now resounded to " The boatman is a lucky man , No one can do as the boatman can , The boatmen dance and the boatmen sing , The boatman is up to everything . Hi-O , away we go , Floating down the river on the O-hi-o ! " Much experimenting and many disappointments were still in store before the great period of steamboating on " the river " was to form such a picturesque chapter in American life , but at least the prospect had been opened of an inward as well as an outward movement of freight for the West . Until the Civil War , New Orleans disputed the position of leading port with New York , and would have easily eclipsed it had it not been for the greatest engineering feat Americans had yet undertaken . It was all very well to have steamboats beginning to pit their strength against that of " 01 ' Man River , " but that did not avail to link the West any closer to the East , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1810 it cost $r25 to carry a ton of freight by wagon from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh , and Poo to move a ton from Buffalo to New York . Canals had been talked about by many , but Governor De Witt Clinton of New York turned dream into reality against scoffing and skepticism . On the Fourth of July , 1817 , he dug a shovelful of earth , and the work on the Erie Canal , from the Hudson to Lake Erie , was begun . In eight years the long trench , three hundred and sixty-three miles , had been dug at the then stupendous cost of over 77,000,000 , an amount , however , which was more than repaid by tolls in the first decade of operation . The effect was amazing . Clinton , like Whitney , had had more influence on the development of the country than 99 per cent of the statesmen in Washington . There had been speeches  | in Congress nearly as long as the Canal , but the Canal accomplished what they did not . The time of travel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six , and the cost of moving a ton of freight from one hundred dollars to five . In one month of the first year , 837 barges left Albany for Buffalo . Eastern-manufactured goods poured westward ; Western farm products poured eastward . Even Western lumber could now be shipped profitably . New England potatoes , at seventy-five cents a bushel , were crowded out by " Chenangoes " at half that price . Flour manufactured on Lake Erie water fronts could be shipped via New York to the Carolinas at less than $1.5o a barrel freight . The West could at last buy and sell to the East . New England farms were abandoned in large numbers , and hustling towns sprang up in western New York , Ohio , and further West . The West was linked to the East not at Charleston , Baltimore , or Philadelphia , but at New York . The Cumberland and other roads could not compete with the all-water route , and in ten years from 182o the real and personal property of New York City leaped from $70,000,000 to $125,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was out of the picture altogether as an entrepOt for Western business . Other canals elsewhere were projected and partly built . Philadelphia and Baltimore struggled valiantly to regain their lost position , but there was no other such passage through the mountain barrier as was afforded by the Hudson-Mohawk Valleys . New York was to remain supreme on the Atlantic seaboard . The incomes of its merchants shot up and they themselves could afford to become more exclusive socially . But out on the long waterway the bargemen whom the n , w business had brought into being were singing , the words q iming , as those of folk songs always do , from nowhere : " I ' ve got a mule , her name is Sal , Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal . She ' s a good old worker and a good old pal , Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal . Low bridge , ev'rybody down ! Low bridge , for we ' re going through a town ,  | And you ' II always know your neighbor , You ' 11 always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Erie Canal . " It is true that the West was now linked economically with the East . De Witt Clinton had knocked a wide door through the wall which had separated them . The Mississippi Valley was no longer an enclosed empire which could trade with the world only down " the river . " Other doors , though not so wide as the Erie Canal , were being opened . But , on the other hand , the interests of the West were not those of the East , and the contending forces of sectionalism and nationalism were far from having reached a point of equilibrium . The Western farmer was not to be a European peasant ; this much had been settled ; but he was a debtor and a citizen . He was inevitably opposed to his Eastern creditors and might be to his other fellow citizens . Little by little , the Federal government had been growing more like the vision of Hamilton and less like that of Jefferson . Jefferson himself had , by force of circumstance , given it an impetus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmanship to overrule the theory of the political thinker , he had forced the western half of the Mississippi Valley down the throat of a Constitution which had never been designed to receive it . Jefferson had a fit of mental indigestion over it , but the Constitution did not . Louisiana slipped down perfectly easily . j In session after session of the Supreme Court in Washington , Chief Justice Marshall was handing down decisions , five hundred and nineteen of which were written by himself , in which he steadily strengthened and extended the powers of the Federal government as against both the people and the States . In phrases which have been quoted innumerable times , Lord Bryce wrote of him that " the Constitution seemed not so much to rise under his hands to its full stature , as to be gradually unveiled by him till it stood revealed in the harmonious perfection of the form which its framers had designed . " It would be more accurate , perhaps , to say some of its framers . At any rate , the Constitution owes nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to its original authors ; and it certainly became much less the instrument which , wisely or unwisely , a large proportion , if not a majority , of the people who had originally consented to it would have desired . The attitude in favor of " loose " or " strict " construction of its clauses ? that is , of nationalism versus States ' rights ? was gradually altering according to sectional economic interest . It is quite unnecessary to go the full length of the economic school of historians , who can see nothing but the economic motive in history , to allow that such a motive is extremely potent . It has always been so in the political history of our own country . Whitney had given the Southerners the cotton gin . The gin had fastened cotton on them as the chief mode of economic exploitation of the resources of their section . Cotton had fastened slavery on the black , and the black on the back of the white . Slavery was the institution of a section , and that section was in constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the disproportionate increase of population in other sections . If additional power were given to the Federal government it would be more and more dangerous to their " peculiar institution " to be a minority . Safety thus lay in limiting the powers of the Federal government over the States . It was clear as a proposition in Euclid . The South in self-defense was bound to stand more and more for strict construction and States ' rights , in what was , after all , a matter of opinion and interpretation . The North was in process of transition . Nullification and talk of secession had been rife in New England for the first decade and a half of the century , but now manufacturing , which was hungry for tariffs and special favors from the government , was competing with shipping , which thrived on free trade . The leader of the section , Daniel Webster , was to register clearly in the shifts of his own opinions the money interests of his constituents . The West , almost from the start , had been the creature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | before the Union , as had those of the East . They had mostly been carved out of the national domain first as territories , then as States . Moreover , the West cared little for finespun theories of government . It had its idealism of individualism and freedom , but was also practical enough in calling for economic help from whatever source could supply it , and the natural source to which it looked was the national government in Washington . The immediate relation of the Westerner to the government was far more direct than that of the citizen of any other section , for in most cases even the title to his home , not always settled , came to him straight from the government of the United States . For the Easterner the government was something aloof from his daily concerns except on election days or when the tax gatherer came around . For the Westerner it was the rock on which his home was built or a landlord whom he was fighting . Roads , canals , internal improvements of all sorts , were essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the government supply them . For a while Congress lent willing ear . As we have seen , it had built the Cumberland Road , but it began to have doubts as to whether it could constitutionally appropriate the money to maintain it . In 1816 it chartered the second Bank of the United States , and passed a tariff bill , but President Monroe and the South and North had , severally , constitutional doubts and sectional reasons for calling a halt on Western demands . The South , hoping to build up domestic manufactures , had voted for the tariff ; New England , the shipowners still being able to outvote the manufacturers , had voted against it ; but a reversal of sectional interests in that respect was to come in another dozen years , and although Northern manufacturers were to welcome tariffs they began to balk at internal improvements for the West . After a long series of international complications running all the way from England , and the Holy Alliance in Europe , over South America , and up to Russia in Alaska , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams , had been coping with distinguished ability , President Monroe in his annual  | message in 1823 had announced the doctrine which has ever since borne his name . Briefly stated , this was to the effect that whereas the political systems of Europe and America were different and we would not interfere in the internal affairs of the old continent , neither would we consider the New World hereafter as a sphere for European colonization or permit European powers to extend their system hither . It was a gesture , but a gesture that emphatically meant not only that we had seceded entirely from Europe , but that we had embarked on a policy of the Americas for the Americans . Although the public had been unaware of the dramatic incidents that had led to its enunciation , it was well received by the people and strengthened the feeling of Americanism and nationalism . We intended to keep forever out of Europe and to keep Europe out of the New World . The doctrine became almost as deeply imbedded in our minds as the Declaration of Independence . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its inherent nationalism that the political thinker who at this time brought forward the only plan for overcoming the growing sectionalism was Henry Clay of Kentucky . His plan , which came to be known as " the American System , " was simple enough in broad outline , and was based on the old Hamiltonian doctrines . Clay , however , was a popular orator in a day when the American loved oratory and hailed every speaker as a Cicero or a Demosthenes . Clay had a power of cogent presentation that had been denied to the logical but boringly diffuse Hamilton , and protectionists since the day of Clay have merely rung the changes on his speech of March 30 , 1824 . Clay 's economic policy was distinctly American and national . In the three sections of the country , he saw a North which was becoming predominantly industrial and manufacturing , and a South and West that were overwhelmingly agricultural , but both of which had some nascent manufactures . The panic of 1819 had laid the country , particularly the West , prostrate . Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would be unsalable in Europe , and he saw the West 's  | need of internal improvements . As a means of making us independent of Europe and of bringing the three sections into economic and political harmony , he proposed a protective tariff that would greatly increase American manufactures , and provide money for roads , canals , and other improvements . He counted on the industrial sections being pleased with the protection afforded , the West with the improvements it demanded , and the agricultural sections to be made generally prosperous by the market for their produce that he believed would come with the increase of the industrial population . The need for a market for the West had become painfully clear . Corn was selling at Cincinnati at eight cents a bushel and wheat at twenty-five . But New England merchants still outvoted the manufacturers , and Webster made a powerful speech against the measure in Congress , while the South condemned it as a " combination of the wealthy against the poor " ? that is , of the Northern manufacturer against the Southern planter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 107 to 102 , but the sectional nature of what he had hoped would be an " American System " was clear . New England cast 15 votes for and 23 against ; the Southern West , 13 and 7 ; while the Northern ' Vest was solidly in favor . Four years later , when a new tariff bill came up , the New England manufacturers had won their local struggle , and Daniel Webster thundered as powerfully for the " Tariff of Abominations " as he had against the earlier and less " abominable " one . The measure was carried by all sections except the South , which , under the lead of South Carolina , was so incensed that it threatened nullification , boycott of Northern goods , secession , and even armed resist ' ance . The West had produced a national leader and a political thinker who had outgrown the frontier , but the West itself had not yet done so . In the election of 1824 there was no party issue . The Federalist Party was completely disrupted and all four candidates for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts , William H. Crawford of Georgia , Andrew  | Jackson of Tennessee , and Henry Clay of Kentucky . It is notable that the West had two candidates , and that the South produced one from the Cotton Kingdom instead of any successor to the " Virginia Dynasty . " Adams , having been Secretary of State , would according to precedent have been the next President , but precedents were failing , and Adams , one of the ablest men the country has ever produced , was austere , wholly independent , and refused a single concession to political chicanery or mob popularity . Crawford had no chance from the start , and the West could have elected Clay had it stood by him . That section , however , preferred action and emotion to thought and logic , and voted overwhelmingly for the dueling , swashbuckling hero , " Old Hickory . " Clay did not get a single electoral vote from over the mountains except in Kentucky , Missouri , and Ohio . When the votes were counted , Jackson had 99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralytic stroke , had 41 and Clay only 37 . No one having been elected , the choice was thrown into the House of Representatives , Clay having there the power to elect either of his opponents . His choice fell on Adams as the abler man and the one whose policies were nearer to his own . The West had not won the Presidency , but it had made a President . Adams had been elected by a section , but he tried to carry out his policies without a thought of party or personal political profit . These policies included internal improvements on a considerable scale , and the devotion as well of public funds to educational and scientific purposes , all in advance of his time . The South feared for its slaves in a loose-construction theory of the Constitution ; the West haw-hawed at the " intellectual " President ; party leaders , looking toward the next election , saw the impossibility of a man who would not cater to hungry claimants for political favors ; Adams was aloof , and doomed . In spite of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular vote , but the South and West beat him heavily . Adams had stood by Jackson when he had raided East Florida , and finally by diplomacy , in 1819 , Adams had won that new bit of territory for us from Spain ; but Jackson had done the fighting , and  | anyway he was the sort of man who would be popular with those who liked that sort of man . The West assuredly did ; the South was afraid of Adams , the North , and loose construction ; and Jackson was easily elected . For the first time a man of the Western Waters journeyed to Washington to take his place in the White House . The democratic elements of the nation had brought about a mild revolution in 1800 when they elected Jefferson in order to swing the government back to the Americanism of the frontier and the simple citizen , and to stem the tide of Hamiltonianism and Federalism , with their emphasis on privileges and the rich . That movement of revolt , however , was slight as compared with the revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jackson with that of the preceding Presidents ? Washington , John Adams , Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , and John Quincy Adams ? to realize that new forces would have to be taken into consideration in American life . The scenes at the White House after his inauguration were accepted as a portent , and the crowds who thronged the city to see the man of the people placed in power were likened to the barbarians pouring into Rome . " It was the people 's day , " wrote an eyewitness , " the people 's President , and the people would rule . " A disorderly mob crushed their way into the White House , stood on the satin furniture , smashed china and glass in their rush for refreshments . In the press , the President himself was nearly suffocated against a wall and had to be rescued . Tubs and buckets of punch were placed outside on the grounds in the hope of keeping some of the mob out of the house , but they continued to surge at the doors , and those inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms cleared by using them as exits . To dwell on this aspect of what was in reality a great movement would be unfair . The election had been a victory not merely for a section , but for a class . By 1825 every Northern State had finally provided for manhood suffrage , and Jackson had been the choice of many of the laboring and small-farmer class in the East as well as the overwhelming choice of the West . Ignorant as  | they were compared with the richer Eastern classes , it was these people who had kept the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Revolution in their hearts . Americanism in those days had assuredly meant more than mere secession from the British Empire . The common man had believed , and been taught to believe , that it meant a new hope for him , an opening of the door of opportunity for all , a recognition of his rights as a man ? not simply as an owner of property ? to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doors upon him , the rise of privileged classes , and the increasing difficulty or inability for himself to reap profit and benefit from his toil . He feared a leader from a class which he instinctively felt could not or would not sympathize with his own troubles and ideals . He sought a leader of his own sort , and as the West was the heart of this Americanism , it was there that he was found . But if moving on from frontier line to frontier line had stirred the wits of the settlers in some respects , their experiences had nothing to give them more than the old parochial view of politics which had been held by the men of the towns and parishes of the East . Their contacts with the world at large were so negligible , the problems of their small communities were so standardized and simple , that they could see few difficulties in the way of being provided with what they wished by government . The American doctrine had developed , through the long training of the common man in local politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned to become a Jack-of-all-trades himself in his daily life , without special training , he could see no reason why public office called for particular qualities or experience . The fact that men had had to turn their hands to everything in communities where life was reduced to its simplest terms , and where there was little division of labor , had tended not only to self-confidence , which was admirable , but to a lowering of the quality of work and thought . Superficiality had inevitably resulted from enforced versatility . Both the demand for  | a high quality and the need for technical training ceased to be felt . Jackson voiced the almost universal sentiment among his supporters when he declared that " the duties of all public offices are , or at least admit of being , made so plain and simple that men of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for their performance . " Mediocrity is one of the prices paid for complete equality , unless the people themselves can rise to higher levels . The Jacksonian movement of revolt , like most of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of intellect . The men of the West wanted a leader who would appeal to all of their instincts and traits , not to their minds . The frontier bred equalitarianism , it is true , but at the same time a swaggering individualism . Life had a terrific sameness for all , which made each individual fear to be different , and yet from which he would fain escape by asserting himself . The frontiersman refused to admit that anyone was better than himself , and at the same time , with the ancient instinct of human nature , would stick through thick and thin to a leader . Such a leader , however , must have the frontiersman 's own traits glorified , not those of another group . The West agreed with Henry Clay 's doctrine of an " American System " as meeting the needs of his section , but the Westerner was not a thinker and could not give his allegiance to one . In Jackson he found the man he needed . At once a born frontiersman , an Indian fighter , duelist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British at New Orleans , the man who without a thought of constitutional or international difficulties had marched into Florida and seized it , a man of almost superhuman strength of will , of sterling honesty , uneducated , but with often uncanny good judgment and happy intuition , Jackson provided just the figure the ignorant but hero-loving and idealistic masses could cling to . Tall , lank , raw-boned , picturesque , fearless , honest , stubborn , his legend crossed the mountains as " Old Hickory , " and the revolution was accomplished . There has never been a more devoted patriot than the man he defeated , but the lofty vision of Americanism in the mind of  | John Quincy Adams was not the Americanism of the masses . He thought too much in terms of the " superior " man in the best sense of the adjective rather than of the " common " man . Adams did not represent riches , but he did represent intellectual and moral integrity of the highest type . The common man cared nothing for these . Intellectual integrity was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting the devil with fire and rewarding one 's friends with public office . At the low end of both the economic and the intellectual scale , his material needs bulked large . But he also had his idealism . He did not seek to plunder the rich . What he asked was what he thought America stood for ? opportunity , the chance to grow into something bigger and finer , as bigger and finer appeared to him . He did not envisage America as standing for wealth only , and certainly not as standing for culture ; still more certainly not as a reproduction of European classes and conditions . Somewhat vaguely he envisaged it as freedom and opportunity for himself and those like him to rise . Perhaps his Americanism was a dream , but it was a great dream . The common man had dreamed it in 1776 and hoped he had brought it into being . After a quarter of a century of uneasiness over its passing , he had stirred himself and sought to recapture it under Jefferson . Now , more than a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize it . We shall see him do it twice again , before our story ends with its final question . If Americanism in the above sense has been a dream , it has also been one of the great realities in American life . It has been a moving force as truly as wheat or gold . It is all that has distinguished America from a mere quantitative comparison in wealth or art or letters or power with the nations of old Europe . It is Americanism , and its shrine has been in the heart of the common man . He may not have done much for American culture in its narrower sense , but in its wider meaning it is he who almost alone has fought to hold fast to the American dream . This is what has made the common man a great figure in the American drama . This is the dominant motif in the American epic .  | THE NORTH BEGINS TO HUSTLE BETWEEN 1830 and 185o the two great obvious changes in the country were the industrialization of the North and the expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . : Although manufacturing had got a good start in the North during the Embargo and the War of 1812 , it was , as we have seen , not until the Tariff of 1828 that capital in New England had swung over to the factory from the ship to such an extent as to enable the manufacturer to outvote the merchant . From that time on , the character of the North was settled , and we watch the rise of fortunes , of a foreign population , of a permanent wage-earning class . Until the various financial Acts of Hamilton in connection with the establishment of the national government , " property " in America had , to an overwhelming extent , meant investment in land . This had involved two points : first , the fact that the sort of property owned by nearly all , rich and poor , was of the same sort ; and , second , the fact that its ownership entailed a certain sense of responsibility . With the rise of speculation  | and investment in government and other securities at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The owner of a boxful of papers was far less hampered in his relations both to his property and to his community than was the large planter of the South or the small farmer of the North and West . His methods of accumulation and the amount of his wealth were much less open to public knowledge and scrutiny . His occupations and daily life , so different from those of either farmer or planter , bred a different set of qualities . The trader who dealt in securities or who turned over real estate quickly in rapidly growing towns had no need of such qualities as made the New England farmer or such a Southern planter as Washington . His personal interests often became disassociated from those of his fellow citizens , and even inimical to them . Human nature being what it is , he would , consciously or not , tend to view the public interest in the light of his own , just as Daniel Webster , the greatest statesman New England has produced , could turn a somersault on the tariff question when the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class been able to exert their influence only by speech or writing or casting their solitary ballots , they would not have made much difference in the country . Their comparative numbers were very small , and they might have entertained any views they chose as to the American dream . That , however , was not the case . No man can make a fortune by himself . He has to depend in part either on his neighbors making it for him , ? as for example in the unearned increment he derives from the increasing value of land , ? or he has to employ the labor of others , reserving for himself , in return for his own capital and services , a portion of the return from the labor of each of his serfs , slaves , or workmen . The fact that an individual is shrewd or unscrupulous enough to avail himself largely of these means should not blind us to the fact that he has not made his money solely by himself . He owes the greater part of it to his fellows . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  | having used the labor of others . There is both an economic and a political question for us in this . The first is , In what proportions should the surplus of labor be distributed between the capitalist and the laborer ? The second , What sort of character for citizenship is evolved in the wage earner as contrasted with that of the man who works for himself ? So far in our history we have settled the first chiefly by force , and dodged the second . As we have seen , Jefferson , the apostle of the American dream , did not believe in the possibility of realizing it except in a country in which the vast bulk of citizens were independent farmers , owning their own farms . He believed very firmly that a great self-governing democracy could not survive the rise of a town , wage-earning proletariat . So far as our story has gone , the Jeffersonian democracy was safe . We have seen that its believers had risen twice to repel what they had felt to be attacks on it , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because economic and political democracy had advanced together , it was still assumed , putting the cart before the horse , that economic democracy was the result of political , and that life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ? in a word , " opportunity " in its widest sense ? would be assured to the people at large by manhood suffrage . In 1840 , out of a total working population of 4,800,000 , over 3,700,000 were still engaged in agriculture . The next largest figure , that of nearly 800,000 in manufacturing , was , however , becoming ominous , especially as more than 520,000 of these were concentrated in the Northern States . It had been becoming increasingly clear that the opportunities for making large individual fortunes in that section centred in the factory . Large-scale agriculture was out of the question ; turnpikes , canals , the new railroads , banks , city real estate , might create wealth quickly , but they all depended on increase of goods and population . Manufacturmg was the key to both of these . But manufacturing required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profits from a great deal of labor or the unearned increment  | arising from the efforts of others . Astor , in New York , what with his fur trading , his city real estate , and deals of one sort and another , was setting the pace . As with Ford and Rockefeller to-day , his fortune towered above those of other business men of his time , but when he died in 1848 and left $20,000,000 he showed the business men what " success " might mean . The great fortunes of the early Republic , such as those of Hancock and Washington , had amounted to a few hundred thousand . The pace had been immensely quickened . The problem was labor . Machinery , markets , transportation , were now ready . But fortunes could not be made withou t hands who would work for wages . Not only was the supply of native American women and children inadequate , but , as the mill owners became more rapacious and the conditions of work less attractive , the native American was largely driven out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the farms to work for a few years , by 1846 we read that " a long , low , black wagon , termed a slaver , ' makes trips to the north of the state Massachusetts , cruising around in Vermont and New Hampshire , with a commander who is paid one dollar a head for all the girls he brings to market and more in proportion to the distance ? if they bring them from a distance they can not easily get back . " Although a few of the mill owners , notably some at Lowell , were high-minded men who did their best to maintain decent conditions for their employees against the pressure of their greedy competitors , the whole situation radically altered in manufacturing between 183o and 1850 . The pre-Revolutionary immigrants who had come in floods in the middle of the eighteenth century had almost all gone on to the land , and their families had now been in America for nearly a century . They were thorough Americans who insisted on American standards and conditions . Since that great movement had spent its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first census in 1790 to 1825 , the inward flow of foreigners averaged only about S000 a year at all ports , and these were easily absorbed . From  | 1825 , however , the numbers increased annually almost without a break , from 10,000 in that year to nearly 300,000 in 1849 , most of them coming into Northern ports . From about 1830 the employer of labor found himself in possession of about 50,000 possible new hands a year . After another decade this had risen to over ioo , 000 , and when the famine in Ireland had done its worst , immigration jumped to between 250,000 and 300,000 annually . Here at last was what the manufacturer had been looking for . At the end of the period , the abortive revolutionary movements on the continent sent a good many educated Germans to us , but for the most part the immigrants who came were extremely poor and ignorant . They had fled from unbearable poverty at home , and had expended everything they had merely to get here . To them America was a land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America was , indeed , a land of promise , but its Eastern section was not so indubitably one for a poor man . Among the economically ower classes many people were fleeing from it as fast as they uld . By 1850 over 16 per cent of all persons born in the Eastern and Middle States , and nearly 27 per cent of those born in the Southern States , had gone westward . Again , in the same year , more than 50,000 persons , almost all in the East , were paupers , and 135,000 were supported in whole or in part by the State . More than 66,000 of the latter and about 7,000 of the former were not immigrants , but native-born Americans . The earlier Irish who came were mostly put to spade work , and to a considerable extent they dug our canals and laid down our railroads . The native American brought up on a farm ? Jefferson 's good citizen ? had an inborn dislike for working for someone else . He had a proper and instinctive dread of losing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fall to that , he preferred , if he could , to move West and begin again as his own man . He had not had in the past , however , any feeling that manual work was beneath his dignity as an American . No European race has any such feeling to-day , and , much to their advantage in every way , the  | English , French , Germans , Italians , and Spanish perform all the duties in their civilizations from the bottom to the top . The immigrant who came to America was greatly looked down upon , because of his strangeness , frequent uncouthness , and low standard of living . As he took the low-paid manual jobs working for other men , which the American had declined not on the score of their being manual but because of their being for others , the contempt for the foreigner began to be transferred to the work he did , and the American began to establish his tradition that the work , as well as the foreigner doing it , was beneath him . As shoals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include domestic service . In this respect , and most unfortunately , the despised foreigner in the North fed the same superiority-complex tendency in the development of our psychology as did the negro slave in the South . The negro slave had at least one great advantage over the Northern factory worker . He was property , and had to be taken care of . What the Northern manufacturer considered his property was the mill with its machinery , and he came to care no more for the worker than for the bale of cotton . The few mill owners who wished to be fair to their employees had to meet the fierce competition of the unscrupulous . It was characteristic of a good deal to come in our life that the " American System " of Henry Clay was maintained by the manufacturers as a " system , " but with no regard for the individuals to whom alone any system could mean anything . Like our modern " efficiency , " it forgot the man . The manufacturers did indeed manufacture goods , and so increased population and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded " protection " and other special favors from the national government , but they cared not a rap as to what they were doing to Americans as human beings . Prices to the consumer , on the one hand , were raised as high as the special privileges secured would permit ; and , on the other , the native American working class was beaten down in the economic scale as low as possible . The manufacturer was enabled to do this by using the club of cheap immigrant labor .  | Recovery from the disastrous panic of 1837 was slow , but in another half-dozen years the mills were making very large profits . By 1845 , for example , the Nashua and Jackson mills were paying 24 per cent in dividends , and many were returning heavily on watered stock . Meanwhile , wages had been largely reduced and production speeded up . A girl was expected to handle machinery doing nearly four times as much work in the late 184o 's as compared with little more than a decade previously . In the Middle States a ten-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but New England still clung to twelve or fourteen . It was there contended that " the morals of the operatives will necessarily suffer if longer absent from the wholesome discipline of factory life " ! Could Puritan hypocrisy go farther ? The legislature was assured that if it lowered the hours of work no limit could be placed to the evils of misspent time by thus leaving the operatives " to their will and liberty . " As the mills and factories increased in size , and the mill towns grew in population , both hygienic and social conditions became worse . A petition to the Massachusetts Legislature in 1842 declared that " the population of manufacturing places are now , in great measure , dependent for the means of physical , intellectual and moral culture , upon the will of their employers . " In both Europe and America the period was one of laissez faire in economics . The will of the business man , even in the America of to-day , is , by the necessity of the case , a will to make a profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond a certain point , in the way of business or social service , rests entirely with him , even when the competition of unsocially-minded competitors permits him to exercise that choice . In New England , the will of the employers , with very few notable exceptions , was directed to making every cent of profit possible without the slightest regard for the welfare of their employees or the larger social questions of Americanism in the section . The manager of the largest mill in Fall River announced that , so long as he could find hands to work at the lowest wages , he would get every particle of work possible out  | of them , and , when worn out , would discard them as he would worn-out machines . The manager of a mill at Holyoke who found his hands " languorous " in the morning conceived the idea of working them on empty stomachs , and succeeded for a while in getting three thousand yards more of cloth a week for the same wages . Had the manufacturers been scraping along on little or no profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs in order to keep going at all , but dividends were high , and watered stocks were spouting fortunes . The attitude toward labor was thus dictated by pure greed and not by the necessity of the case . By 1850 the good type of native New England men and women who had originally flocked to the mills to work had been driven out . The highly respected and prosperous merchants and ship owners of Boston and other leading New England ports had proved equally incapable of any vision other than that of lining their own pockets . After the " War for Sailors ' Rights " fought against England in 1812 , the shipowners reduced wages until in a few decades they had brought them far below those possible for an American workman . The captains and officers were often brutal , and sailors could get no redress when conditions were brought to the attention of owners . Within a comparatively few years the fine Yankee sailor had almost disappeared , and his place had been taken by the lowest and most abandoned of the foreign groups . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thirds of the crews must be Americans , but , as usual when a law conflicted with their supposed interests , the business men completely disregarded this one . On the other hand , after flogging had been made illegal , the Boston Marine Society , composed of the most respected shipping merchants in Boston , at a time when the North was being inflamed over the cruelties to the negro in the South , petitioned the government to restore the right to flog sailors to their work . The great shipowners were making fortunes and laying the foundations for future social snobbery , but in the process they were breaking Federal laws and , by forcing down wages to starvation levels and by wielding the  | lash , they were driving self-respecting American sailors out of our merchant marine . To a considerable extent the same story could be told of the rest of the industrial North . " The rich , the wise , and the good " of the old Federalist formula had broken down in their leadership , and a class of wage earners new to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ranks . Labor began to organize , but for the most part it was merely on the defensive during this period . Between 1830 and 1850 , about two and a half million foreign-ers had been added to the population , chiefly in the Middle and New England States , giving an entirely different complexion to the problems of self-government and manhood suffrage . I lordes of underpaid ignorant immigrants , with little training in government of any sort , replaced the old American stock with its long experience of town meetings and politics . The new citizens could be led to the polls by " bosses , " and the demoralization of the larger municipalities quickly ensued , the rich caring no more for the quality of the electorate than for the welfare of their " hands , " provided that the legislatures , like the factories , gave them the desired results . People were no longer thinking in terms of statesmanship and the future , but of private business and the present . Constitutional questions which had perforce been the chief study of the earlier generations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which everyone thought of as little as possible when allowed to forget it . The conditions of the period were developing several of those traits which we consider rather distinctively " American , " but which really date from this time . The nation was growing at a staggering rate . Whether we pore over the tables showing population growth , manufacturing , commerce , the increase of wealth , or what not , we are struck even to-day by the marvelous changes wrought every year . There seemed no limit whatever to the possibilities . The Federal Census of 1850 estimated that , if the ratio of increase for the preceding decade were maintained , the United States would have a population  | of 269,000,000 in the year 1930 . In a table showing the comparative progress of our population with that of foreign countries it demonstrated that , whereas between 1790 and 1850 the average growth of Prussia , Great Britain , Russia , and France had been only 1.7 per cent annually each , ours had been 8.17 per cent . We no longer feared any nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The future seemed clear and glorious . A great wave of optimism swept over the country , and reenforced by the material development of the next three quarters of a century , was to become a lasting trait in the American character . America had always been a hopeful country , but , until the middle of the eighteenth century , life had been a fairly serious business . Nothing but parts of the seaboard had been won from the wilderness , and everywhere in the background were French and Indian enemies . The colonies were weak , dependent parts of an empire . By 1750 , as we have seen , a very substantial civilization had arisen along the coast , but then came the anxious years of controversy , war , and the weakness of the new independent government for an entire generation . The attitude hitherto had thus been hopeful but serious . From the 183o 's on , this changed to a rampant optimism . If , in view of the somewhat dark picture painted in the beginning of this chapter , it be asked how optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far to seek . It must be noted , for one thing , that however badly off a large multitude of the new immigrants might be at the lowest rung of the American economic ladder , they were used to a low standard of living , and in almost every respect , not least in the independent political atmosphere , they found themselves far better off than they had been in the countries from which they came . The Germans , of whom we shall speak in the next Chapter , mostly went West and prospered . The Irish , poor as they were on first arrival , took to American life like ducks to water and soon rose in the scale of living , becoming foremen , policemen , politicians ; and in a few years many of each succeeding crop of immigrants climbed to a level of influence  | and economic standards undreamed of in the old country . For the native-born who were being worsted in the struggle in the East , there was the West , with its rainbows . But , most important perhaps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class distinction . The fact that opportunity appeared at least to be open to everyone kept alive belief in the American dream . After Andrew Jackson every boy was being told he might be President of the United States . In the Old World , luck or genius might raise a man from nothing to eminence , but for the general mass of men there was little hope there of rising above the station in life into which they had been born . In the America of the earlier days , character and hard work might bring a competency , but in an agricultural economy the accumulation of property was for most a slow process , and wealth was attained by very few . On the contrary , in the seething America of the 183o 's and 184o 's , both immigrant and old American felt that , with just a little luck , fortune might be waiting for him around the corner . Had n't Astor made $zo , 000,000 , Girard left $6,000,000 , while men in every community were evidently getting rich on a large if less spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to read and write , yet there he was , rich as Crcesus , and dictating to the government . Native or foreigner , rich or poor , learned or unlearned , the race was free for all , and the prizes were beyond the imaginations of the preceding generation or of European magnates . There was nothing but the mysterious texture of the brain cells that need keep one man below another . But if one were to get ahead of his fellows , if one were to grow rich in a few years , he must hurry . City lots were rising in price with every year of added population , corporations were growing greater all the time , the tap-tap-tap of opportunity at the door seemed to grow louder and more insistent as a man listened , and life was short . For one 's self , for one 's family , one must hurry . The older American civilization had been leisurely . Many travelers found Americans rather slow and all too often lazy . Work had been necessary and had been enthroned as a virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position were small , and the farmer or storekeeper expected to be farmer or storekeeper all his life , there had been time , and stability . Now there was neither . Better roads , railways , and steamboats had all speeded up the actual tempo of life a bit , but not sufficiently to account for that nervous haste that from now on was to be another distinctive American trait . New York , wrote one traveler about 184o , " is the busiest community that any man could desire to live in . In the streets all is hurry and bustle ; the very carts , instead of being drawn by horses at a walking pace , are often met at a gallop , and always in a brisk trot . " " The whole of the population , " he adds , " seen in the streets seem to enjoy this bustle , and add to it by their own rapid pace , as if .. . under the apprehension of being too late . " Nervousness became a common physical trait . All observers of the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their meals , and hurried from the table . The American jaws began their ceaseless motion , and the chewing of tobacco , precursor of gum , became almost universal . Describing the New Englander , another observer wrote that " when his feet are not in motion , his fingers must be in action , he must be whittling a piece of wood , cutting the back of his chair , or notching the edge of the table , or his jaws must be at work grinding tobacco . . . . He always has something to be done , he is always in a terrible hurry . He is fit for all sorts of work , except that which requires slow and minute processes . The idea of these fills him with horror ; it is his hell . " " We are born in haste , " commented an American of the day ; " we finish our education on the run ; we marry on the wing ; we make a fortune at a stroke , and lose it in the same manner . " The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that the universal mania had spread to the children . " Try , ' is the first word , the meaning of which is thoroughly mastered . Boys are men before they are loosed from their leading strings . They are educated in the belief that every man must be the architect of his own fortune . . . . Dreams of ambition or of  | wealth , never the arm which drives the hoop ? the foot which gives the ball its impetus . Toys are stock in trade . Barter is fallen into by instinct , as a young duck takes to water . There is scarcely a lad of any spirit who does not , from the time that he can connect the most simple ideas , picture to himself some rapid road to wealth ? indefinite and obscure , it is true . But he reads the history of Girard , and of others who have amassed wealth . He sees the termini of the race ? poverty at one end ? affluence at the other , and jumps the intermediate years . He fancies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dreams of dashing into a fortune by some lucky speculation . Contentment with competence he learns to regard as a slothful vice . To become rich , and , of course , respected , influential , great , powerful , is his darling object . " It was already noted by foreign travelers that the American did not love money for its own sake or hoard it as did the European , but was careless of it once gained , was lavish in both spending and giving , and seemed to enjoy money-making chiefly as an activity . The American had always been " taking a chance . " The most serious of the religious leaders of the Pilgrims and Puritans had taken a great chance when they left comfortable Holland and England for the bleak wilderness . Every trial of new sites for settlement had always been a chance . Every one of the many million immigrants ? German , Swiss , Scotch , Irish , English , French , and what not ? who had staked their last bit of money in the world to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and his family . The colonists had taken a chance when they defied the might of the British Empire . Yet , somehow , it seemed that ninety-nine times out of a hundred the dice had fallen right . Taking a chance had got into the blood of the American until by the mid-century we find , as Kipling wrote of him nearly a century later , He greets th ' embarrassed Gods , nor fears To shake the iron hand of Fate Or match with Destiny for beers .  | The influence of this taking a chance , of matching with Destiny for beers , had been cumulative , generation after generation , but it was the West that had made the winning chances so dazzling even for the Easterner . As we have pointed out , had the continent stopped short at the Appalachian Mountains , the civilization of the seaboard would probably have developed along the lines already so clearly marked out by the middle of the eighteenth century . As it was , that older civilization was almost completely wiped out . American culture and character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . The planter , the statesman , the churchman , the " gentleman " as then understood , the budding poet or artist , were all to be conquered for many generations by the rising man of affairs . There were two factors which chiefly influenced the new type of civilization . One was the colossal size and richness of the new American empire , which made the prizes to be won so great as to turn the heads of even the most conservative of old Eastern families ; and the other was the absence of any impassable social barriers , which made success a free-for-all race , and so intensified the fierceness of competition to the nth degree . Man 's love of being distinguished among his fellows has been one of the leading factors in raising the level of the whole race . In America , as contrasted with Europe , it was open to every man , theoretically at least , to rise from the very bottom to the top . Wealth in every society has spelled , to a considerable extent , power and opportunity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , after the pioneering stage was over . The difference between Europe and America was that in the latter the prizes of wealth were far larger , they were to be won more quickly and easily , and they were open to all . This naturally meant that the possibility of winning them was in everybody 's mind , just as in England to-day , where high and low bet on horses , everyone talks races , or as in a Latin country they talk lotteries . In America , the place of horses and lottery tickets was taken by vast enterprises , the prizes were millions , and the people talked about them . Making  | money became a great and exciting game in which everyone participated . Of course the element of luck was great , but those of skill and ability were also present ; and thus , apart from the excitement of the game , and the power and pleasures to be derived from wealth , a fortune , if made by one 's self , became also a badge of personal merit in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mark the man of outstanding ability . If the size of the prizes , and the opening of the race to all , made for much aimless " hustle " and sheer bodily nervousness , they also released an enormous amount of energy in the people at large and directed it into the channels of personal ambition . It was a fact of vast significance that not only , as the Sun said , was the word " try " the first of which the child mastered the meaning , but everyone , educated and uneducated , old American or newly landed immigrant , was also expected to " try . " For the several million foreigners in particular , to be expected to try , and to have something to try for , was a challenge releasing unsuspected reservoirs of energy and resource . Some of the effects , however , were not so good . The winning of a fortune in haste required intense concentration . We have already seen how , in spite of the idealism also present , the life of the lower classes in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pursuit of the material basis of life . In the older sections the pursuit of wealth , although it had its idealistic side , tended likewise toward materialism . In 1834 , a by no means unsympathetic traveler noted that scenery meant nothing , that to the American a waterfall " is a motive power for his machinery , a mill privilege ; an old building is a quarry of bricks and stones , which he works without the least remorse . . . . At the bottom of all that an American does , is money ; beneath every word , money . " Although he gave much more liberally than the European to useful and public objects , " it is neither enthusiasm nor passion that unties his purse strings , but motives of policy or considerations of propriety , views of utility and regard for the public good , in which he feels his own private interests to be involved . "  | The American standard of living , except in the notable extravagance in dress , was in some respects as yet below Europe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler in 184o could complain bitterly that even in most first-class hotels , like the Tontine House in New Haven , there was no such thing as a water-closet , guests having to go out of doors to an ill-smelling place at the end of the back yard . With the rapid increase of wealth , however , the standard was rapidly rising , and the American man began to be caught in the endless treadmill of rising family costs . With the great readjustment going on , the limitless possibilities , and the establishing of a new scale of incomes , he must needs indeed have been a brave or quixotic man who deliberately declined to try to make money and who interested himself in other things . Moreover , there has been one factor in American moneymaking of deep and lasting importance to American social life and character , present from the start , but becoming more marked in this period . In communities of more or less stable population and resources , a competence is accumulated slowly . The speed with which one could get rich in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the exploitation of the continent 's unequaled resources . In old countries there would have been a distinct limit to the expansion of a business or the building of cities . In the Land of Promise there seemed to be none . The more men who devoted themselves to the material development of the country , the more quickly it developed , and the greater the chance of everyone to get something out of it for himself . Thus , superimposed on the old Puritan and pioneer raising of work to the rank of a virtue , was the new conception of business as somehow a social and patriotic duty . Accumulated competencies or fortunes were rare . The overwhelming mass of the people , with boundless energies let loose , were anxious to improve their position . The combined mass of their desires , united with the realization that the more rapid the development of the country , the more chance they had individually to realize their hopes , created  | a public opinion that it was the duty of every man to assist in the development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort and to " make business . " This , combined with the ordinary temptation to make money and the lack of social pleasures and the resources of cultivated society , made the pressure to think in terms of business almost irresistible . Even the young heir to a fortune , an observer of the 1830 'S tells us , " has no conception of living without a profession , even when his family is rich , for he sees nobody about him not engaged in business . " The man without a business gradually ceased to have public respect or social standing . One rich young man , " wearied out with his solitary leisure . . . could nd no other relief than to open a fancy-goods shop . " Even the pulpit , always sensitive to public sentiment , hurled anathmas at the man of leisure , devoting himself to the cultivation f the arts , as a political enemy to his country , and the introucer of aristocracy and of idle and pernicious habits . Here nd there the exodus to Europe started , and occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes and temperaents could not be satisfied with the new conformity to busiess , began to appear in Paris , London , or Rome as exiles . These , however , were rare and unimportant exceptions . or the rest , every possible motive of private desire and public pinion tended to make them swing into line . The fact that he race was free for all , with its resulting fierceness of corntition , and the fact that going into business and making oney had for the reasons just given been exalted into a sort of religious duty and patriotic virtue , introduced yet another element into the moral condition of the nation . Business ceased to be a mere occupation which must be carried on in accordance with the moral code . It had itself become part of that code . Money-making having become a virtue , it was no longer controlled by the virtues , but ranked with them , and could be weighed against them when any conflict occurred . The quick development of an industry or a tract of land , the making of a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , could be weighed as exhibitions of moral and  | patriotic virtue against breaches of other exhibitions of virtue , such as justice or honesty . It was the tremendous development of the country , and the opening of the gates of opportunity to all , that had brought this about . Had it not been for this raising of money-making to the moral plane as a virtue in itself , its delinquencies could never have been measured with crimes against other parts of the moral code . As it was , unhappily , they could be , and were . As we have seen , in the colonial period the American had been tempted into an attitude of lawlessness by the passage of impossible , unwise , or inconvenient laws by the British Parliament three thousand miles away . The colonist had got into the habit of deciding for himself what laws he would or would not obey . As the country had expanded westward , frontier conditions had reenforced this attitude toward law . Of the widespread lawbreaking in the period from 183o to 185o we shall speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may here note that another factor , very subtle but very deep-reaching , in the attitude of the American toward law was introduced by the raising of money-making to the rank of a virtue . This , and the fast tempo of the new American life , made it all too easy for the individual to get himself involved in all sorts of moral casuistries . It might , of course , be wrong , so he could argue to himself , to make false statements , even to perjure himself in a report or application to the government , to bribe a legislature , to hoodwink a competitor , to take an unfair advantage ; but on the other hand , if by doing so he could put through his deal , if he could make a million in a year instead of in ten , was not that a patriotic service that might well outweigh the personal peccadillo involved in the means of its attainment ? Were not the voices of the Church and public praise united in assuring him that by making money fast and " developing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral duty ? If the making of a hundred thousand was a moral act , the making of a million must be one of exalted virtue and patriotism . If , in the course of doing so , a policeman or a landoffice official in Washington or a few legislators in the State  | Capitol seemed to be in the way , it could hardly be immoral to het rid of their obstruction by the simplest and quickest method ssible . It might be , as old Ben Franklin had said , that onesty was the best policy , but that meant it was only a licy , and if another policy worked better , why not employ t ? If honesty was a virtue , so also was " developing the untry . " They could be weighed quantitatively against ach other , and if the reasoner happened to profit to the tune f a million , that was his luck or God 's providence . As for honest government , municipal or State , " the Fathers " ad fortunately set up all the machinery for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the machinery in the factories d to , but it was ill-paid work which could be left to a low ass of labor just as foreigners were being put to run the achinery in the mills . So long as the government ran fairly ell and the cost was not too high , a patriot could be better ployed in making a million in his office than in working for Soo a year as a State Senator . If the machinery did not run oothly , if the cost got too high or the legislative product were of satisfactory , it might be necessary to bother about it ; but eanwhile the country had to be " developed , " and a practical atriot was busy about more important things than legislating. s to the crime that was becoming rampant throughout the untry , there was no use in getting excited about that , and e business man had his affairs to attend to . So ran the rdinary business man 's mind . Indeed , what with the hurry , the illimitable opportunities , and the fierce competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy strain on men . Just as in the rly colonial days , or out on the advancing frontiers , a good bit of man 's culture had to be dropped overboard , so now , in this new sort of struggle in the developed East , it had to be . Each stripped for the race to meet competition . Time was money and could not be wasted on what did not produce money . In the West , culture had come to be looked down upon by the pioneers as effeminate and useless because it did not help to fell trees and make a clearing . So in the East , among a very  | different class , it began to be disparaged because it lessened the speed in making money . Reading and music began to be left to the women . Men dropped out of society , or if they attended some function would be likely to be found segregated on one side of the room , uninterested in the conversation of the women and in turn incapable of interesting them . Just as moneymaking had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and letters tended to become a feminine minor vice . It was the frontier over again in fundamental influences , though in a gilded , rococo setting . As we compare the East of 1850 with that of 1750 , I think we find the most essential contrast to be in the field of morals and the scale of values . There is no use in throwing stones at the men of the later period ; they were caught in the conditions which surrounded them . We can not find fault with the pioneer for losing some of the standards of civilized life and developing others under the strain of the type of life he led . In similar fashion these men of the East of 1830 to 1850 were subjected to new and colossal strains . Unfortunately , however , just as the pioneer period on the frontiers left scars on the American mind , along with some excellent legacies , so did the Eastern period . Chief among these was the moral confusion caused by the expansion of the old conception of work as a moral virtue into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a patriotic duty , with the resultant confusion as to its relation to the rest of the virtues and the whole scale of social and moral values . Emanating directly from the too rapid expansion of the country , I think we must consider it one of the most potent influences for evil in American life . Yet the more one studies it sympathetically with a wish to understand , the less does one see how it could have been avoided . There was assuredly no innate weakness or sinfulness in the American people . We did not love money for its own sake as much as did the Europeans . In accepting the Industrial Revolution , we never brought into being such frightful conditions as ensued in the English manufacturing areas , bad as were our own . Both Jefferson and John Quincy  | dams , foreseeing the evils of too rapid growth , had wished so to conserve the land in the West as to spread the process of development over centuries . Only a despotic government could have forced that policy on a people multiplying with credible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery , the rapid expansion westward , our mitless resources , and our multiplying population , the swift ccumulation of wealth was inevitable . In a society without barriers , where there were no established social distinctions , competition would be of unheard-of fierceness , but that was part of the American dream . It was an inevitable corollary of uality of opportunity . That was a legacy of incalculable value , though it has come down to us encumbered by the consion of moral values which may , happily , not prove peranent . Possibly , neither legacy may prove so . In stressing the above topic because of its importance , I have us far given an impression of cultural simplicity to the period in the North which it was far from possessing in reality . The time was one not only of abounding vitality but of vast confusion . In Europe , as well as here , it threw to the surface all sorts of new " movements " and " isms , " wise and foolish ; but , besides receiving innumerable cranks from the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own , idiocy , unfortunately , never needing a protective tariff . Mingled , however , with all kinds of absurd experiments to make the world over socially and economically , discussed in books and lectures or put into practice in short-lived " communities , " there was much of lasting worth . Imprisonment for debt was abolished , prisons were reformed , the care of the insane was improved , flogging abolished , education provided for the blind , movements started for temperance , world peace , women 's rights , abolition of slavery . One of the most broadly important of the movements was that in education . Even in New England , where opportunities for free education of the very young had been greater than elsewhere , the laws were much better and more liberal than was the actual practice . Chiefly on . account of taxation , the rich  | almost everywhere opposed free education , and the movement developed from the working class . The American system of education is one of the fruits of the practical working of the American dream . In 1830 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no real liberty without a wide diffusion of real intelligence . . . that until means of equal instruction shall be equally secured to all , liberty is but an unmeaning word , and equality an empty shadow . " Within the next two decades the present system of free education in the lower grades was established , and colleges likewise multiplied , there having come into being a hundred and fifty small denominational ones alone by the midcentury . Unfortunately , just as our modern system originated among the people and continued to be largely controlled by them , so it bore some of the marks of its sponsors . Not only were instruction and intelligence considered more or less synonymous , as in the above quotation , but the aim and content of education tended to be limited by the cultural standards and outlook of the class which had brought it into being . It was aimed at safeguarding economic and political democracy rather than at the development of the individual , and its content was selected accordingly . To a great extent , largely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this original confusion in our educational system has never been resolved . Innumerable voices seem to come to us from the North in these decades , advancing every sort of business scheme , urging all kinds of social reforms , offering to cure every ill ? individualism run mad in an effort to build a society and a nation . They come to us blended in a confused roar like that of a stage mob in the wings of a theatre . In a rapidly running commentary such as this , it would be impossible to distinguish between them by detailed analysis of all the isms and movements , but three voices , all from Massachusetts , sound clearly above the clamor and give expression to three distinct traits of the period ? Emerson with his optimism and self-reliance , Garrison declaiming against slavery , Webster pleading for nationalism .  | It is useless , with our present small knowledge , to attempt to account elaborately for the appearance of the arts at any given time and place . We have seen that a group of intellectuals , headed by Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a much more important one ? including Emerson , Hawthorne , Whittier , Longfellow , Thoreau , and others ? began to appear in the neighborhood of Boston . This has been called the flowering of the Puritan spirit , and various pother things which equally mean nothing . It is easy to bemuse ourselves with words , but the plain fact is that we do not know why , out of the three centuries of Boston history , there should have been a few decades during which an unusual literary oup appeared all at once , and never before or after . One or two things may be said . Whatever other by-products it may have had , the Calvinistic theology of Puritanism had trained the New England mind to think ? no mean achievement anywhere . Thought as thought , and mind as its instrument , had been held in higher respect in New England than in any other ksection . The decadence of the old theology had left the people at large indifferent to a great extent , but the release from the at of Hell did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct . Among a small group in Boston , however , Unitarianism had served as a rationalizing bridge between the dread Jehovah and a somewhat vague Power for Good at the centre of things . This abstract Power for Good , reenforced by the concrete development of the esources of the West , began to make the world ? that is , oston and its neighborhood ? a pleasanter place to live in . If God after all was good , and if the U.S.A. was definitely on the road to becoming the greatest nation on the earth , there was ample material for the highly trained Boston intellect to work on . All this , and more , does not explain , nevertheless , why there should almost simultaneously have appeared such a group as did appear . Of them all , the most authentically American was Emerson , if we possibly except Thoreau , and there is no comparison between the men in the influence they have  | exerted . Without any thought-through system , a fact which perhaps has endeared him all the more to Americans , Emerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the religion of the infinite possibilities in the individual common man . Why all this deference to the great men of the past , he asks , when " as great a stake depends on your private act to-day as followed their public and re nowned steps ? " " Hitch your wagon to a star , " he told his hearers in a thoroughly American metaphor which could thrill them . Probably his most popular essay has always been that on " Self-Reliance , " and he has indubitably stirred innumerable youth to high endeavor . In the history of American thought , the further west the Indian was driven , the more remote the Devil became . In Emerson , the Devil , or the problem of Evil , evaporated almost completely . Dr. Channing and the now distant pioneer had done a complete job . The American dream ? the belief in the value of the common man , and the hope of opening every avenue of opportunity to him ? was not a logical concept of thought . Like every great thought that has stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great act of faith , a courageous leap into the dark unknown . As long as that dream persists to strengthen the heart of man , Emerson will remain one of its prophets . On the other hand , noble and simple as his life was , there was much in his doctrine that lent itself all too readily to the emphasizing of American traits already produced on frontier after frontier . Such a quotation as " Do not craze yourself with thinking , but go about your business anywhere . Life is not intellectual or critical , but sturdy , " illustrates what I have in mind . His belief in the value of spontaneity , of they intuition rather than the thought-through conclusion , was of the frontier , not of the Puritan . In no other author can we get so close to the whole of the American spirit as in Emerson In him we sense the abounding vitality and goodness of life , the brushing aside of the possibilities of failure , evil , or sin , the high value placed on the individual , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the aspiration toward the stars anU  | the calm assurance that the solid earth is ours , the worship of culture combined with the comforting assurance that the Spontaneous glance may be best , the insistence on a strenuous individuality , the trumpet blasts that call us to high endeavor in the lists of thought and character , combined , for our weaker moments , with the dicta that " we are all wise " and that " culture ends in headache . " His volumes are the mirror of the American soul . Every lineament is there reproduced . ut American conditions have changed . Steeped as he was n Concord and Boston , Emerson was a product of the development of the West . He belonged to our century of optimism , an appendix to the Tables in the Census of 185o . For him all as good ? God , the possibilities of life , the heart of man . o-day we are not so sure , and boys and girls no longer read eir Emerson as did those of my generation . In the vast optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as possible from the portentous cloud that they aw , and refused to see , slowly rising on the Southern sky ? avery . The South had changed and was buying Northern anufactures heavily now , because the North needed Southern tton for its mills . Everything had been settled in the issouri Compromise . The North had talked secession in e War of 1812 ; the South had talked it later , but we were tting bigger and richer every year . " For Heaven 's sake be ractical ( so ran the popular mind ) ; attend to your business nd leave the Southerners alone . They have got to have iggers to raise cotton , and cotton is one of our biggest assets . t is a long time since we had slaves and we do n't want them ain , but it is the South 's affair and not ours ; if you make em mad down there , you will ruin business and perhaps mash the Union . Everything in America has worked out for e best in the past , and if only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this slavery problem would work itself out somehow . " Thus felt 99 per cent of the Northern business men . But in Boston in 1831 , " in the sight of Bunker Hill and in the birthplace of liberty , " as he dated it , William Lloyd  | Garrison published the first number of his fanatical weekly paper , the Liberator . " I shall strenuously contend for the immediate enfranchisement of our slave population . Urge me not to moderation in a cause like the present . I am in earnest ? I will not equivocate ? I will not excuse ? I will not retreat a single inch ? AND I WILL BE HEARD . " And he was heard . The Abolitionists , as those of his party and way of thinking came to be called , stirred the country , North as well as South , to a pitch of passion such as has never been witnessed among us before or since . The destruction of printing plants , mobbings , even murders of Abolitionists , marked the next decade and more . Opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run the movement served the genuine good of the negro or not . There can be no doubt , however , that it kept the subject of slavery before the two publics , ? Northern and Southern , ? which would fain have let it rest undiscussed , and that it sowed the seeds of intense bitterness between the sections . In our own day we have experienced the strength of feeling aroused among our people by the passage of Prohibition legislation by the fanatical reforming elements . If we can imagine that , instead of having merely deprived a large part of our population ? a part that considers itself quite as moral and high-minded as the reformers ? of the enjoyment of a social habit , the reformers had threatened in addition on moral grounds to deprive them of so large a part of their property as to ruin them financially , we can get a better idea of the feeling stirred up by the Abolitionists . The general subject of slavery will be discussed later , but we may here note that the two sections were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized . The richer classes in both of them were exploiting labor , as every civilization has always done , as every civilization may , perhaps , have to do . That , in spite of the American dream , is an unsettled question as yet . The Southerner exploited labor in the shape of legal slavery , the Northerner in the shape of wage slavery . Neither was conscious of any moral guilt in adapting himself to the  | social structure that had been shaped by the economic situation of his own section . In both sections , the rapid increase of the new wealth had brought new men to the top . The men of the North , who had risen from nothing , without traditions , to wealth and prominence as bankers , merchants , manufacturers , or stockjobbers , could be duplicated in the Cotton Kingdom among owners of eat plantations . Planters were far from being invariably f ancient lineage or fine old Southern stock . On the other and , the social traditions of the South were quite different from those of the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked down on the Northern business man as an uncouth upstart without the manners of a gentleman . There was also at work the dislike of the landed proprietor for the city trader , and of the man of easy-going ways for the business hustler . To have these Yankees , who drove their wage slaves twelve and fourteen hours a day in badly ventilated mills for a few cents ' pay , and who never assumed the slightest responsibility for them when sick , old , r out of work , tell the Southerner that his form of slavery only as immoral , and thus assume airs of superiority , was galling . he Southerner rightly said that he was not presuming to nterfere between the Northern employer and his exploited labor , and so what right had the latter to make all these threatening speeches against a perfectly legal economic system which was guaranteed in the Constitution of the nation ? To im it was an outcropping again of the inevitable persecuting mania of the Puritan ? a sequel to the Salem witches , the banishments and hangings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form comes to nourish and depend upon a certain set of cultural values . The South had a distinct type of civilization , and its cultural values were dear to it . Those of a highly competitive , cornplex industrial civilization are bound to be very different , and as the North became definitely committed to such a civilization , the South began instinctively to feel its own threatened . In the same way , what many of the sanest critics of America  | to-day object to is not its system of life per se , but the distorted and debased cultural values which have resulted . As the North grew in population and wealth , the South felt that it was trying more and more to exploit the rest of the nation for its own benefit and to extend its system . The tariff , to which the South had become bitterly opposed , was a case in point . When that of 1828 had been passed , South Carolina had threatened secession , asking whether it was worth while to remain in a Union " where the North demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be their tributaries . " North and South as yet were fairly evenly balanced . Each , to get the better of the other , would have to enlist the West on its side . The balance of power had followed the Cumberland Road over the mountains . Baits were offered . There was much jockeying for position , and the endless speeches in the Senate went on . Finally the climax came when , on January 26 , 1830 , Webster made his great reply to Senator Hayne of South Carolina , giving voice to the new nationalism and attempting to sweep away the whole doctrine of the right of a State either to secede or to annul a Federal statute . Denying that the Federal government was a mere compact between sovereign States , he declared , in words which every schoolboy knows , that " it is the people 's constitution , the people 's Government ; made for the people ; made by the people ; and answerable to the people . The people of the United States have declared that this constitution shall be the supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nullify or secede , the great orator from a State which had itself threatened secession less than two decades before ended with an impassioned plea for unity in the florid oratorical style of the day . " When my eyes shall be turned to behold , for the last time , the sun in heaven , may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union ; on States dissevered , discordant , belligerent ; on a land rent with civil feuds , or drenched , it may be , in fraternal blood ! Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the republic , now  | known and honored throughout the earth , still full high advanced , its arms and trophies streaming in their original lustre , not a stripe erased or polluted , nor a single star obscured , bearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory as ' What is all this worth ? ' nor those other words of delusion and folly , ' Liberty first and Union afterwards ' ; but everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing on all its ample folds , as they float over the sea and over the land , and in every wind under the whole heavens , that other sentiment , dear to every American heart , ? Liberty and Union , now and for ever , one and inseparable ! " A few weeks later , at the Jefferson birthday dinner , the issue was clearly joined , President Jackson electrifying the Nullificationists by giving the toast of " Our Federal Union ? it must be preserved , " to which Vice President Calhoun immediately added the challenging one of " The Union ? next to our liberty , the most dear . " The issue balanced on a knife edge for two years , when the West , having been bought over by favors , gave its support to a new tariff bill , which at once set the State of South Carolina aflame . The Ordinance of Nullification was passed ; armed resistance to the Federal government threatened . But the nation was not yet willing to drink the cup of blood . Compromise was effected , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties during the next decade . Before that was quite passed , however , the Abolitionists , through the Massachusetts Antislavery Society , had declared that the Constitution , making a slavery compact between North and South , was " a covenant with death and an agreement with hell ? involving both parties in atrocious criminality , and should be immediately annulled . " A few weeks later , the New England Antislavery Society went on record , passing a resolution by 25o to 24 , that it was the duty of every Abolitionist to agitate for the immediate dissolution of the Union . The South was being more and more goaded . Wild words were spoken there , the mails rifled , lives threatened . It was not merely a question of slavery . It was a question of inter-  | pretation of the fundamental compact between the States ? a question whether , as in the tariff controversies , one section of the country could be made tributary to another ; whether property guaranteed by the Constitution was safe or not if the North objected to an economic system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planter should be forced to take his morality from the Northern business man ; whether an agrarian civilization could preserve its character or should be forced to conform to a disliked industrial one ; whether a section of the country was to be allowed to maintain its own peculiar set of cultural values or be coerced to conform to those of an alien and disliked section by force of numbers ; a question of what would become of liberty if Union were to mean an enforced uniformity . As we look back to-day , ? because , from a military necessity in the conflict which we shall have to chronicle in a later chapter , the slave became legally free , ? the tendency is to think of the whole conflict of sections in the simple terms of slavery . To do so , however , is to mistake the forces at work . The questions at issue were far more numerous and far less simple . In the life of the nation to-day , overwhelmed by an industrialism and a uniformity that have become subversive of our American dream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers refused to look at the black cloud which was coming up in a sky which otherwise seemed to be dazzling blue . If there were anxiety and resentment in the South , the North was humming with industry and its business men were doing their best to hush up the Abolitionists , even by threatening their lives . The West ? to which , like the party managers of that day , we must now turn ? was exulting in its youth and beginning to glimpse " Manifest Destiny " in the sunset sky over the Western mountains . The plain citizens everywhere felt a thrilling sense of freedom and of power . To a crowd that pressed too closely on a political procession , a gentleman at the head had called out , " Make way for the representatives of the people ! " " Make way yourself ! " was thundered back . " We are the People themselves . "  | MANIFEST DESTINY LAYS A GOLDEN EGG " MAKE way ! We are the people ! " In Spanish and in English , though not in French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly three centuries . It was only in English , however , that the cry was hurled at any and all that hindered or helped the steady advance of the ordinary man . The fish in the sea , by millions annually , had succumbed to it . The fur-bearing animals in the woods had scurried before it across half a continent . The incredible flocks of wild pigeons in the air had melted before it . The trees of the forest had heard and crashed in helpless obeisance to it . The Indian , native owner of the soil , had heard it , and fought or sickened or fled . The rich had heard it and entrenched themselves more strongly behind political privilege and a Federal Constitution steadily being modified by judicial decisions to bulwark the rights of property against the demands of man . The English , when America was first settled , had been a seafaring folk . It had been many centuries since the founders of the race had dwelt in the vast forests of Germany and  | Britain . When their descendants had crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost forgotten conditions of the forest . In the two hundred years since the first permanent settlement had succeeded in Virginia , they had learned the technique of forest living and clearing . The American frontiersman was as much at home in the silent forested wilderness as his ancestor had been on the tossing waves . That wilderness had extended from the Atlantic over the mountains , until , in the Mississippi Valley , it gave place to the open prairies and plains . Slowly the American civilization had cut its way through , but when it emerged into daylight again on the Western side , owing to its long forest training it was as uncertain of itself in the face of the great open spaces as a seaman on the land . Moreover , the wide expanse of the plains had been proclaimed by every explorer who had visited it as a waste desert utterly unfit for human habitation . Almost as inevitably as though it had been the sea itself , it seemed to set the bounds to the western advance of the white man . Throughout the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in constant contact with the retreating rear line of the savage . Occasionally , as in the cases of the Cherokees and the Seminoles in the South , large bodies of the red men had clung to their hunting grounds and been surrounded by the whites and a civilization to which they could not be assimilated . The racial pride of the English had prevented any amalgamation . The impact of one race on the other had not been ameliorated by intimacy and human kindness . The black slave had become a domestic animal , occasionally ill-treated , but more often kindly and sometimes even affectionately used . The red man had remained , in the view of the white , a wild beast of the forest to be exploited or exterminated . In the broad sweep taken through our history by this book , we have been unable to chronicle the incessant local contacts and conflicts , but they had not been without their effect on the psychology of the whites in creating a certain race prejudice and insensibility to the rights of those who were considered inferior , emphasizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after  | treaty had been made with the natives , only to be broken without compunction when the white man wanted more lands for his insatiable demand for expansion . Two centuries of almost yearly conquests over a weak foe had implanted in us a feeling that nothing could stand to block our way . Almost the only " foreigners " we had known had been poverty-stricken Europeans and American savages . Both fed our sense of superiority . At last the " Great American Desert , " as it came to be named , seemed to call on us to halt , and a permanent Indian policy was evolved which contemplated forming the plains into a vast reserve for the red men , who , in spite of war , disease , and stolen hunting grounds , yet numbered between three and four hundred thousand east of the Rockies . The Cherokees and the Seminoles were removed bodily from the South , and with the Plains Indians ? the Sioux , Shawnees , Pawnees , Kansas , and others ? were forced to sign treaties that they would remain behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Jackson in his annual message of 1835 declared that a barrier had at last been raised behind which the Indian would be protected , and that " the pledge of the United States has been given by Congress that the country destined for the residence of this people shall be forever secured and guaranteed to them . ' " Already , however , the inability to keep the white man from anything he wanted had become evident . The northeastern part of the boundary had been settled by solemn treaty in 1825 , but the discovery of lead mines and the pressing in of new immigrants at once made trouble . Without a shadow of right , whites settled on Indian lands and preempted their cornfields . A rising under Black Hawk was suppressed by local militia and Federal troops under General Scott , and the Indians were pushed back regardless of treaties . If the great Desert should ever be found to have value , the doom of the natives would be sealed . Meanwhile , westward expansion was diverted from the Desert 's inhospitality and the wildness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oregon country .  | West of the Sabine and south of the Red River lay the great Mexican province of Texas . Mexico had won her independence from Spain in 1821 , but neither the vast body of the population , composed of civilized Indians , nor the small Spanish and Creole element at the top , had shown any capacity for selfgovernment . Roads ran from Mexico City to Natchitoches in Louisiana , Santa Fe in New Mexico , and San Francisco in California , but these vast outlying provinces were too huge and distant to be well governed , even had the government been stronger , sounder , and more capable at the heart . Owing partly to national character , whatever that may mean , and partly to the character of the civilization which he had first encountered in the New World , the Spaniard had remained an explorer and exploiter and had never become a genuine pioneer . Texas was almost uninhabited , and at first the Mexican government welcomed colonization by the Americans . Land grants for that purpose had been made to a Connecticu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence was won from Spain . His son , Stephen , continued his father 's work , and in 1822 planted a colony on the shore of the Gulf . Under the new Mexican colonization laws each married settler could acquire 4428 acres for less than two hundred dollars , and the population rapidly increased , as we have noted previously , the immigration coming mostly from the American South . It was the intention of Mexico that these settlers should become Mexican , and Austin abided loyally by the understanding . In 1831 he wrote confidentially to a friend , saying that he had bid an everlasting farewell to his native country and intended to " fulfill rigidly all the duties and obligations of a Mexican citizen . " Down to about 1834 , Austin was able to abide by his pledges , and was the absolute leader of the twenty thousand or so inhabitants of the province , of whom about two thousand were slaves . Mexico had prohibited slavery within her borders , but , as on all frontiers , white labor was almost unobtainable and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico itself . Unless the settlers were to remain peasant  | farmers , the only recourse was to black slavery , and the Mexican government looked benevolently the other way . The instability of that government , however , the uncertainty as to the status of slave property , the prohibition against further American colonization , and the fact that recently the immigration had embraced a large proportion of reckless and even criminal characters , made no longer tenable the continuance of Mexican loyalty on the part of a State whose population was almost wholly American in origin . Santa Anna exploded the situation when , in 1835 , he proclaimed a new constitution for Mexico , abrogating certain States ' rights hitherto possessed by the Texans . The settlers in turn proclaimed a provisional government and expelled the Mexican garrison from San Antonio . The military plans were badly bungled , and when Santa Anna appeared in that little town with three thousand troops , the fortified mission house of the Alamo was found defended by less than two hundred Texans , with no rescuers on the way . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault and every defender was massacred , almost every Texan within having been already killed or wounded before the Mexicans reached them . Among the slain were Davy Crockett and the notorious Bowie of hunting-knife fame . A Declaration of Independence had been drawn up , March 2 , by fifty-five Texans , whose average age was under thirty-eight . Sam Houston , who in the autumn was to become President of the new State , defeated the Mexicans in a battle in which the American war cry was , " Remember the Alamo ! " A constitution , legalizing slavery , was ratified , and the United States was ked either to acknowledge the independence of the new State or , better , to annex it to the Union . Recognition was granted within a year , but annexation meant war with Mexico and an addition of territory ( large enough to carve into five States ) to the slave portion of the Union . The revolt had come from natural and almost inevitable circumstances , but voices were at once raised in the North protesting that the whole affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the tension which then existed annexation had to wait .
