txt Both London and New York yesterday noted developments which indicated that money rates may be following the classical course of tending upward with revival in trade . The London . indications , which included the second sharp drop in British government securities within two weeks , were regarded in that center as unmistakable and pronounced . In the domestic market , so far the trend has been most apparent in municipal bonds , which are among the most susceptible among securities to changing money rates . Corporate issues , measured by the Dow-Jones averages , are off appreciably from the high of the year . At yesterday 's close the average of 40 bonds stood at 104.82 . The high for 1937 was 105.89 attained January 16 . The sharpest decline has occurred in the high-grade rail average . currently off 2.30 from the 1937 high of 113.79 . The industrial average is off 1.05 from the 1937 high of 107.93 . The public utility average is off 0.55 from the 1937 high of 106.66 and the second grade rail average is off 0.97 from the 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their 1937 highs late last year . No Delay in New Issues Nevertheless , investment bankers , while agreeing that the market is somewhat touchy , are proceeding without delay in marketing the various new issues as they come out of registry with the SEC , the only difference being that prices are slightly lower than probably would have been the case a few weeks ago . The downward price trend of municipals in the past five weeks , which added 25 basis points to the yield of 20-year bonds is the sharpest since the middle of 1935 when the yield advanced from 3.25% in the week ended August 2 to 3.54% in the final week of September . It was not until early in 1936 that the yield had again declined to 3.25% . The following developments of the past few days are being watched here : Reduction in the offering price , from 1032,4 to par , for a part of the $50,000,000 New York City bonds recently offered . Sale by Massachusetts of $3,000,000 of notes at a figure approximately 32 basis points higher than a. similar loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utica , N. Y. , at a level 21 basis points above similar borrowing by this city six months ago . There has been a noticeable resistance on the part of large institutional buyers to the record low municipal bond yields of recent months . The withdrawal of large buyers from the municipal market accompanied the indications that Federal Reserve member bank requirements would be increased . Highest Grade Issues Down Of particular significance is the fact that the municipal obligations which are now selling at substantial discounts from their record high levels of December include the highest grade securities . Several syndicates which purchased large blocks of securities at prices which prevailed during the first half of January have had to cut quotations to move their holdings . The price reduction by the National City Bank syndicate on the . New York City bonds , marked the capitulation of the last large syndicate to the new price level . Some hope has been given to dealers in the success of more recent syndicate purchases . Several offerings which were obtained by municipal syndicates at the lower price level have met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist not far from present levels . What particularly concerns those syndicates which still have bonds purchased at the higher levels is that price reductions do not always spur sales . Resistance of large institutional buyers to the record low yield of municipals about a month ago is one of necessity rather than of choice . Municipals , according to some insurance company buyers , had declined in yield to a point where the tax exemption feature had little or no value in comparison with corporate yields . Some Favor Governments Some of the exceptionally high grade municipals were selling higher or close to governments , and many of the larger buyers decided in favor of governments . A comparison of the yield of eight-year governments with the Dow-Jones average yield of 20 representative 20-year bonds shows that the spread between the two has widened about 19 basis points . In December these governments were yielding 2.25% while the municipal yield was 2.69% . In January governments were 2.29% and municipals 2.77%. while in the first week of February governments were 2.30% against 2.93% for municipals . Long Term Rates Gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of firmer money rates was given last December . would seem to have been answered . Long term rates have increased along with short term yields , although the advance has ' not been so sharp . Against the increase of 25 basis points in 20-year bonds . short term paper has moved up about 30 to 40 basis points .
