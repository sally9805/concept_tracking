While neighbors in Richmond , England , shook their heads , lonely little old Ada Littlejohn packed her small trunk last August and sailed for Manhattan . Her husband had died . So had her terrier Jumbo and her canary Nanki-Poo . For Mrs. Ada Littlejohn it seemed at first like just one more tragedy in her life when the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company announced it would give Gilbert &; Sullivan in the U.S. this season ( TIME , Sept. 17 ) . But then she reckoned her slender income and decided to go along . <P> For 40 years Mrs. Ada Littlejohn has been a Gilbert &; Sullivan addict . She has heard nearly every London performance , thought little of traveling to Liverpool , Manchester , Edinburgh , Glasgow to hear others . This week the D'Oyly Carte players gave their 100th Manhattan performance . For Mrs. Littlejohn , who goes five times a week , it was the 62nd . Singers in the company have come to regard the small white-haired lady as their mascot . She knows each time they make a mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre . For the performances she insists on buying her own $1.65 balcony ticket . Says she in her bright cockney accent : " I ca n't imagine ' eaven without Gilbert &; Sullivan . I do hope those two men will be busy at it when I get up there . "
