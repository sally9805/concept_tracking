txt With the end of the long controversy at last reached by Congress , and the Senate started on a program of retrenchment in expenditures , the question of Federal relief is the great problem still facing Congress . After his conference at Rapidan with representatives of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve , the President again stated the program which he favors . He would increase the borrowing capacity of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation from $1,500,000,000 to $3 , - 000,000,000 . He would then permit it to use this additional credit for four purposes not authorized by existing law : ( 1 ) to loan up to $300,000,000 to such States as may need funds for the direct relief of distress ; ( 2 ) to buy bonds from both public agencies and private corporations in order to start construction of " income-producing or self-liquidating projects " which will increase employment ; ( 3 ) to make loans on security of farm products and , " by stabilizing their " loan value , thereby at once steady " their price levels " ; and ( 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farm Board , to enable it in turn to extend " loans to farm co " operatives and loans for export of 1 " agricultural commodities to guar " ters otherwise unable to purchase " them , " President HOOVER believes that this program is adequate to the needs of the present situation and so devised as not to impair the credit of the Government . While additional borrowing would be undertaken by a Federal agency , through the sale of debentures of the Reconstruction Finance Coiporation , this would impose no charge on next year 's budget and thereby upset , a. still precarious balance . Meantime , the Government would have at hand a reserve with which to aid the States if they should need assistance and a fund with which to start work on " selfliquidating " projects . Whether the President 's plan would also accomplish as much for farm relief as he seems to hope is more doubtful . Thus far a policy of large loans on agricultural commodities , underwritten by the Farm Board , has failed dismally to " steady their price levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GARNER 'S , with its 2,300 postoffices , there is a wide difference . This is not true of Senator WAGNER 'S bill , sponsored by a strong Democratic subcommittee . This measure proposes to make $300,000,000 available to the States for relief , though on a somewhat different plan than that urged by the President . It authorizes an addition of $1,500 , - 1000,000 to the resources of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , accompanied by power to make loans to " self-liquidating " projects undertaken by both public and private agencies , as the Administration recommends . It also follows the President 's suggestion that funds be provided to enable the unhappy Farm - Board to get rid of some of its surplus wares in foreieg ) . markets . On the question of additional loans on farm products it says nothing , Instead , it includes Ione proposal absent from the President 's plan  --  Tnamely , a $500,000,000 bond issue with which to finance new Federal construction . But here the two plans are not so far apart as this figure would suggest . For two-fifths of Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for in the budget . With so many points in common , it seems reasonable to I hope that an agreement may be reached .
