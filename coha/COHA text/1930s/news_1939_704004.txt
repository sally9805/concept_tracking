txt In a concession of outstanding importance to Canadian business the federal government has decided to forego part of its income tax collections for the next six years . Any company undertaking construction , installation betterment , replacement or extension of plant machinery or fixed equipment in the 12 months ending April 30 , 1940 , will be allowed a credit against income tax equal to 10% of the coat incurred in capital projects . The credit will be placed on the books of the income tax branch and may be used by a company to offset taxes incurred between now and 1945 . In the form in which the legislation was announced by Finance Minister Dunning in his budget a month ago , the credit remained on the government books for three years only . The Administration now has decided to extend the period . so that new businesses with little income tax to pay in the early years of development will be able to benefit more substantially . A conviction that effective action must be taken to stimulate expenditures on capital account led the government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government deficits . As part of the same policy , the Finance Minister announced in his budget that the , exemption from income tax given new metalliferous mines coming into production will be extended for three years to January 1 , 1943 and dividends paid by new metalliferous mines to Canadian companies during the period in which the mine is exempt from taxation are also to be exempt . While the capital expenditure must be undertaken and paid for before next May to obtain the 10% deduction , there is a belief in parliamentary circles that if the government policy proves effective it may be extended in the bUdget next year .
