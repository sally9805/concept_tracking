txt Urging Stabilization . England is in a position to render the world a great service : to allow the pound to decline to $4.8665 ( $2.8739 new parity ) , then say to the United States that she will stabilize at that figure if the United States will stabilize the dollar at its present valuation of 59.06 cents . It is senseless for these two nations to continue further the devaluation struggle , and should they consent to stabilize with the units at 66.74 grains of fine gold for the pound and 13.71 grains for the dollar , there would be such a restoration of confidence as to immediately set us upon the road toward recovery . Every one is sure devaluation will not effect a higher price level and that it requires an increase in circulation to accomplish that desired end . We can obtain an increase in circulation only through an increase in business , and business will not revive until capital has confidence in the money units of the nations . W. H. LE MASSENA .
