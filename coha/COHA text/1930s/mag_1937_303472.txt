Herbert L. Matthews , who for four months has been Madrid correspondent for the New York Times , last week was in London . Released from the strait-jacket of Spanish press censorship , he was able to cable his paper what he considers the amount of help the Spanish Leftists are getting from abroad . Gist : 20,000 to 22,000 foreign volunteers are fighting for the Leftists . Of these 7,000 have been fighting on the Madrid front . All Leftist tanks are Russian , but paid for with Spanish gold . Some 2,000 Spaniards are undergoing training as pilots now , presumably in Russia . At least 90% of the officers in the Spanish Army went over to the Rightists when war broke ; the Leftists have been advised by Russian regular , and French volunteer , officers . <P> There was no Newshawk Matthews to provide a trustworthy analysis of the number of foreigners fighting for the Rightists last week , but most impartial reporters on the spot agree that there are 40,000 Italian soldiers on Spanish soil , 20,000 Germans . Thousands of Italian troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one another 's throats , have genuinely volunteered for Spanish service for the sake of a bonus dangled before them by Dictator Mussolini , of from 1,000 to 3,000 lire ( $53 to $159 ) . Other Italian soldiers have simply been notified that volunteers are wanted . Colonels reportedly say to their battalions : " All men not prepared to volunteer fall out of the ranks . " In still other cases Italians have been shipped to Spain from Italian East Africa , or have been " sent " to Italian East Africa only to find themselves disembarking at Cadiz . <P> Civilian Rule . The smell of spring survived the stench of corpses in Madrid last week . A few almond trees bravely retained their bloom as the Rightists continued to flail Madrid day after day with unremitting shellfire . And from Valencia , where Leftist Premier Francisco Largo Caballero was still seeking refuge , an order was sent to Madrid dissolving Madrid 's Supreme Defense Junta , headed by formidable General Jos Miaja who for almost six months has been the Capital 's all-powerful boss . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caballero felt that General Miaja had better concentrate on fighting the Rightists . In less than 24 hours a municipal council of 33 civilian antifascists was formed to administer Madrid , which thus again reverted to civilian rule . Elected to head the new Municipal Council was 45-year-old Rafael Henche de la Plata , onetime head of a bakers ' union , a prominent Socialist politician in Madrid for the last 20 years . By week 's end Civilian Boss Henche had already taken over the huge task of feeding and disciplining Madrid 's besieged million . <P> And on his side , General Franco formed his own 20-man Junta , modeled on Italy 's Fascist Grand Council , to help him rule Spain 's Rightist territories and eventually " to supplant the Madrid-Valencia Government . " All political parties were outlawed by General Franco except the one under his command , which received this impressive title : The Spanish Phalanx of Traditionalists and Offensive National Syndicalist Juntas.
