THE LOVE OF JULIE BOREL-Kathleen Norris-Doubleday , Doran ( $1 ) . <P> All U. S. publishers except Doubleday , Doran &; Co. have stopped the experiment of selling new books for $1 . Motherly Kathleen Norris probably feels no handicap ; her novels are sure sellers at any price to a mass public . Her latest is in her same old vein : <P> Pen Barnes was spoiled but a darling , and would get all the Barnes money some day , when her grandfather died . Meantime she had set her heart on marrying handsome but penniless Tony de la Ferronays , French professor at her nearby college . When Julie Borel , supposed daughter of a former governess , came to live with the Barnses , she and Tony took fire at sight . But neither had any money , so Tony married Pen . Julie might have had Nick Barnes , a rising surgeon and solid citizen , but honeymooning Tony still kept her fancy . Finally she took a chance on Nick , but stipulated a platonic union until she had laid Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their long honeymoon abroad Julie found she could face her former idol without batting an eye ; more , that Husband Nick was the man for her . And just then , of course , it was discovered Julie was really the long-lost Barnes heiress : her virtue was rewarded a thousandfold .
