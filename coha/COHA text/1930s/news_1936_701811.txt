txt Noise in Brooklyn Much has appeared in the newspapers about what the Mayor and the AntiNoise Commission are doing or going to do to reduce unnecessary noise . A few arrests of noisy people have been made . One would naturally think that all the propaganda would have a little effect and that there would be less honking of horns and fewer people who awake the sleeping city with their loud talking or singing in the street between 11 P. M. and 4 A. M. But such is not the case . I have lived in many villages , towns and cities , but New York City , particularly Brooklyn , is the noisiest place I have ever lived in . City dwellers need more quiet at night than do country folk because of the nature of their work , yet it is the country folk who have a quiet atmosphere and not the city folk . Ninety per cent of the nocturnal noises in this city , and for that matter all cities , could easily be eliminated with consequent benefit to all . R. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
