txt THE LITTLE EMPLOYER . Tn the Editor of The New York Times : Regarding the solution of the unemployment problem , one fact must be reckoned with , and that is that unemployment began when the cost of labor got beyond the ability of the man of moderate means to hire . For example . thousands of housewives who have employed maids at from $3.50 to $5 a week , with room and board , were forced to go without help when wages rose . Men began doing many things for themselves which they had been in the habit of hiring done because their income would not stretch to cover the cost . All this was reflected in the demand or lessened demand for commodities . It is doubtless a step ahead to adjust the difference between the employers and workers in factories and other " big businesses , " but until some point of contact can be reached between the worker and the " little employer " there will still be a long line of unemployed .
