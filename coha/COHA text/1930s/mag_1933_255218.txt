The cupola and the great central hall of Berlin 's Reichstag Building were gutted by a mysterious fire last winter ( TIME , March 6 ) . Ostensibly to fix the blame the Nazi Government scheduled for this week a great trial before the German Supreme Court at Leipzig of five men charged with arson and high treason . Supposed to have thrown the brand was one Marinus van der Lubbe , a Dutchman whom the Nazis call a Communist . The other four prisoners were Ernst Torgler , a German Communist leader , and three Bulgarian Communists . But last week in London , Germany 's trial was being deflated into an anticlimax by one of the strangest trials in history . <P> It was a trial of the facts of the Reichstag Fire before an " International Commission of Distinguished Jurists , " meeting in the courtroom of the Law Society , without any official sanction whatsoever . Sitting in judgment last week were Arthur Garfield Hays of Manhattan , D. N. Pritt , K. C. , chairman of the Commission and five others . Witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographers . <P> British Laborite Sir Stafford Cripps opened the trial by declaring , " It has been suggested that the fire was a scheme put forward by the National Socialists themselves . In view of the world-wide importance of the trial to take place at Leipzig , and of its political surroundings , the committee feels that some means should be adopted for bringing together the evidence available outside Germany and for bringing it before the world for criticism and enlightenment . " <P> One by one , the witnesses in London arose and riddled every possible story the Nazi prosecution could present in Leipzig this week . Dr. Paul Herz , onetime secretary to the Social Democratic Party in the Reichstag , claimed that the incendiaries could not have entered the Reichstag except through a tunnel leading from the official residence of the Reichstag President , Prussia 's barrel-chested Premier Hermann Wilhelm Gring . A onetime Police President of Berlin testified that 1,500 arresting warrants were ready for use immediately after the fire . Liberal Editor Georg Bernhard and Social Democrat Chairman Dr. Rudolf Breitscheid agreed that the Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reichstag fire , that Communists would have set it only if " the party executives had all gone mad . " <P> One witness placed Ernst Torgler in a Friedrichstrasse restaurant on the night of the fire and completely discredited van der Lubbe 's Communist standing . They described the latter as " weak , vainglorious , partially blind and frequently in debt . " German Communist leaders claimed they had never heard of van der Lubbe until he was arrested running out of the Reichstag during the fire . An anonymous witness declared that van der Lubbe was an intimate of famed Nazi Captain Ernst Roehm.
