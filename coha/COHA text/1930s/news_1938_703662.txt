txt Astronomers throughout the world are expecting unusual guests this week , three showers of meteors , visitants from outer space to the earth 's corner of the universe . Tuesday or Wednesday evening the Taurids are scheduled ; Tuesday and Wednesday shooting stars from the constellation of Leo , the lion , are due ; and perhaps some night between Thursday of this week and Wednesday of next a brilliant shower from Andromeda may occur .
