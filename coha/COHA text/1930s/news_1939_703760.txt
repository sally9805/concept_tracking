txt A special Federal grand jury listened for more than an hour yesterday to the testimony of Jack Benny , radio comedian , and then indicted him and Albert N. Chaperau , convicted smuggler , on charges of bringing jewelry into this port illegally last Oct. 7 . Unlike George Burns of the cgraedy team of Burns and Allen , who recently pleaded guilty to a similar indictment naming him and Chaperau , Benny denied all guilt . " Mr. Benny , how do you plead ? " asked the court clerk . " Not guilty , ' said the comedian , emphasizing the " not . " The indictment charges the smuggling of two gold diamond-studded clips and one gold diamond-studded bracelet , valued in all at $2,131 .

He said bail of $1,000 would be sufficient to assure his appearance here on a trial date , which was fixed tentatively for Jan. 24 . Judge Hulbert set the bail at that figure and Benny was released after bond had been put up and he had been fingerprinted in the office of the United States marshal . His attorney , Walter N. Thayer 3d , handed out a typewritten statement in behalf of his client , which said : " I am utterly amazed that I should be accused in the Chaperau matter . I have always thought that in order to be indicted it was necessary to be guilty of some criminal intent . " Notwithstanding the fact that my attorneys have explained to me that an indictment is equivalent only to an accusation and may be based on circumstantial evidence , it seems to me to be a terrible thing that a citizen who has not intentionally or knowingly committed any wrong should have the onus of an indictment lodged against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in court and prove his innocence . " I have never smuggled jewelry or anything else into this country , and no one can truthfully say or prove that I intentionally committed the acts of which I am charged . " Though the indictment does not explain the details of the government 's case , it is believed that Benny is named merely as the purchaser or receiver of jewelry which Chaperau brought into this port duty free , claiming exemption from tariff in his role of " commercial attach ? " of the Nicaraguan Consul General . The government , it is believed , will not charge that the comedian , himself , attempted to smuggle the clips and bracelet through the customs .
