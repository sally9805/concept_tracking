One day in November 1917 , a hard , dark chunk of a man walked round &; round a team of 34 dray horses at the foot of 132nd St. , Manhattan , feeding each &; every horse a sugar lump . On a tremendous trailer attached to the team was a submarine which had just been hoisted out of the Hudson River . The man turned and walked down the street , the 34 horses following him . Thus , while thousands jam-packed the sidewalks , did Truckman Henry Herbermann haul the German U-boat C-5 to Central Park to be used as a speaker 's rostrum for the second Liberty Loan drive . <P> Henry Herbermann did not remain a truckman for long . For some $60.000 he bought and became president of Export Steamship Corp. , which operates between New York and the Mediterranean . When after the War the Federal Government set out to restore the U. S. merchant marine to its oldtime glory by means of mail subsidies and cheap construction loans , Exporter Herbermann got the first mail contract . His subsequent activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ocean mail contracts . Discoveries : 1 ) the Shipping Board spent $1,825,000 to repair 18 ships which it sold bolt and keel to - Henry Herbermann for $1,071,431 ; 2 ) Mr. Herbermann , under the Jones-White Act , borrowed from the Shipping Board $7,122,750 to build four passenger liners , got his loans extended later although Export 's debts exceeded its assets 3-to-1 ; 3 ) despite large payments on mail contracts ( $115,335 for a single pound in 1929 ) the company was worse off than in 1930 , still owed the U. S. $8,000,000 of which $1,200,000 was already past due . <P> Last week Henry Herbermann was unceremoniously ousted from the presidency of his company . The Shipping Board 's credit expert , appointed to investigate lines in debt to the Government , had decided that Export needed a thorough shakeup . Summoned was brusque William Hugh Coverdale , financial engineer , president of Canada Steamship Lines , to take the presidency of Export . Exporter Herbermann was made vice president , will cooperate with the new management in paying off the loans he contracted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
