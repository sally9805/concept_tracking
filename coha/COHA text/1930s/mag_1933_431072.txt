 | AMERICA ! Land of divorce ! Nearly two-hundred-thousand divorces granted last year in the United States ! What is to be the ultimate answer to it all ? Is there any answer ? Or will divorce eventually tear our western civilization apart ? Meantime , should people be allowed to get married so easily , at the rate of , a million a year ? Just so that the nation may build bigger and better courthouses ? Employ more and more divorcecourt judges ? Thus ran my troubled thoughts one heavenly morning last June . I was driving in my old roadster slowly along an elm-shaded , shadow-dappled road in Connecticut , to the country estate of some friends whose young daughter , Julia , was to be married at high noon . These friends , whom I shall call the Bidwells , were of a dignified old family which had played a modest part in New York society for over a hundred years . Lawyers always , the Bidwell men were known still for their rigid conservatism and stability . And until fairly recent years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But some eighteen years before this account opens , the first Bidwell wife to do so had obtained a divorce -- rather flippantly and with the then startlingly-modern comment given to the Reno newspapers : " I find myself constantly wrestling with other women for Jack 's attention . Please understand me . There 's been nothing indreamt . They are all charming women . My own friends . And I do n't blame them . Jack is a very attractive man , whom I am not even trying to hold . You see , the contest bores me . I 've always detested competitive sports . Besides ? is any man worth fighting for ? I doubt it . Let him go . " As though this one weak , spineless wife had forever pulled down the courageous banner of all the Bidwell women , divorce had followed divorce in that family clan . Never was a family so wrenched apart by marital disaster . In the seventeen years of my acquaintance with them I had personally known eleven Bidwell women and girls to marry . And now , at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still living with her husband . She ? Harriet -- had been a struggling member of the clan before her marriage : a business girl with three young sisters to support . Harriet had always been a buoyant , courageous fighter , no matter what her foe was . For her little sisters ' sake she had fought the wolf and won . Later , for her home 's sake , she had spiritedly tilted lances with all those perilous outside forces and influences which today surround every marital union , subjecting it to an almost unbearable strain . And again she had won . I was thinking admiringly of Harriet ? Harriet the successful wife ? as I parked my battered tin roadster among the few early limousines already gathered in the Bidwell driveway . Would Harriet be there ? Since her mar riage she had become a leader in women ' club work . She was often away on lecture tours . Be-.des , she had borne and reared five children two of whom must be of high school age . Harriet was more likely to be off somewhere on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than making one of the laughing , flippant , cynical throng gathering to witness a Bidwell wedding , forerunner of another Bidwell divorce . But I was wrong . Harriet was very much there . I had hardly been ushered to a seat in the great flower-banked music room before I saw her ? tall , distinguished , graceful , lovable , her vital face simply ablaze with joy in the occasion . She was moving about with quiet efficiency , like a commanding general . Catching my eye she wigwagged from the hallway , summoning me . I slipped out . " Come on upstairs with me , " she implored in a half whisper . " I want you to get the bridesmaids out of Julia 's room and keep them out . I have something very difficult to do . Julia 's mother has collapsed . The strain of these big weddings ! Some one must give the child a little talk about marriage . I 've promised Julia 's mother I will . " " But I thought young people today knew everything ! " I commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " smiled Harriet as she hurried me toward the staircase , her hand on my arm . " They know the physical facts . But no one tells them the thing that really matters ? that a man 's love is a precious , fragile thing . It not only has to be won . It has to be held ! Cherished ! Sacrificed for ! And fought far ! " I tell you , " she went on soberly as we climbed the stairs together , " the modern bride enters the most competitive game on earth . I want Julia to realize this . That fine men like Norman are rare . And that the world is full of lonely , charming , perfectly decent girls and women who will naturally take a keen interest in Norman . Why not ? He 's going to be surrounded by one group of them in business all day long . And by another group in his social life . Julia 's going to have to face the stiffest sort of competition and comparison daily . I want her to expect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not get bowled over by it . " " But , " I protested , " wo n't you unnerve her ? going into all this just before the wed-ding ? " " Unnerve her ! " she retorted earnestly , facing me . " No ! I 'll put some fight and determi nation into her . A fine old soul put them into me on my wedding day . And I 've never ceased to be grateful . She was the dressmaker , an old French creole , who made my wedding gown . She insisted on coming to put it on me just before the ceremony . But what she really came for was to whisper : " Now , you hold your man , honey ! Hold him ! Fight for him ! He 's yours now . Keep him yours ! Remember , honey , they 's jus ' hundreds o ' sweet , pretty girls would be more'n glad to git a nice man like him ? if they found him unhappy-like an ' driftin' ' . An ' they 's goin ' to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you ' bliged to look better an ' act pretier'n any of them . Dios ' important : you got to see he do n't nevah drift ! You wo n't forgit , honey ? ' " Harriet laughed chokily and brushed something from her eyes . " You did n't forgit ' ? " I commented , deeply touched . " No . I did n't @#  | forgit ' , " she replied huskily , and squeezed my hand . We had paused outside Julia 's door . From within came a hubbub . Youthful shrieks of laughter . Cynical advice . Shrill , sardonic congratulations . From Julia 's bridesmaids and friends . Harriet opened the door . Something quieting in her manner caused a silence to fall on the noisy roomful . Julia turned her weary , nervous , flushed face toward us in sudden relief . " Harriet ! This veil ! We ca n't get it right . I was just saying ? next time it 's going to be at the city hall . In a sailor hat . " Her " next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another marriage ? Of course ! The Bidwell women never stayed married for long . I felt Harriet wince . I knew she was hurt and shocked , deep down . But her tact was faultless . She stood there smiling and shaking her finger in gay reproof . And I thought as I watched her , " This is how she has met domestic crises in her own home ? with gayety and humor . " She examined the tangled veil . Suddenly she turned to the girls who were crowding about eagerly . Taking them into her confidence , she whispered : Julia 's a little nervous . We 'd better get her quiet . I want a few words with her anyway . Would you mind waiting outside ? In the blue bedroom at the end of the hall ? Oh , that 's lovely of you ! You are sure you do n't mind ? " Mind ? They loved pleasing her . Harriet 's requests were so beguilingly gracious ! As they filed out , laughing and joking softly , Harriet seized my arm : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll form the procession out there in the hall . I do n't want these girls upsetting Julia after I 've talked to her . " At that instant one of Julia 's bridesmaids , brushing past me , ran back into the room . Overcome with emotion , she hugged the exhausted girl . " Darling . . . I know you are going to be rapturously happy ! " she cried with a touch of hysteria , and ran from the room . Harriet 's dry comment reached me : " Julia , that 's perfectly absurd ! No one knows whether you will be rapturously happy ? or happy at all . That will depend on you ? on whether you can hold what you 've won . Child , you are taking on the biggest job in the world . The most complex . But it 's the most thrilling one ? to a woman . Sit down a minute . Let 's talk . Yes , yes , you can . You have almost forty minutes . I can fix that veil in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only snatches of the sober , earnest talk that followed . Yet I caught the general drift of it , as , every now and then , I was forced to enter the room to convey a message , or find a bridesmaid 's lost glove , or bring in the bridal bouquet . Harriet , in her calm , sensible , cheerful way , was transforming a worldly , cynical young girl , about to take flippantly the most important step of her life , into a woman . A ! sober , thoughtful woman . A poised , purposeful one . Just what she said , how she accomplished the miracle , I can not say , but the change was obvious and startling . Perhaps the last part of their talk , which I overheard , was representative of the whole . " No , no , Julia . Do n't misunderstand me . The world is n't full of rotten women who will try to snatch Norman from you . Be sensible ! I You know better than that . Do you sincerely believe there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's love , any more than she 'd try to steal your purse ? No . Well , that 's even truer of girls in business . American girls are tremendously decent and fair . Come on , now . Are n't they ? " " Oh , of course , Harriet . I spoke hastily . " " But , " Harriet went on firmly , " great numbers of fine girls are lonely , Julia . Millions of them are ! It seems to me the world was never so full of lonely young women , and that marriageable young men were never so few . These girls are seeking happiness . Honest , legitimate happiness . Marriage , home , babies . I think I can safely say that not one American girl in a thousand would try deliberately to draw a happily married man away from his wife and home . But the married man who is wretchedly unhappy ? obviously so ? who has already grown away from his wife and family , and is drifting and lonely ? that man is an object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . Your job , Julia , every wife 's job , is to see to it that her husband never gets to that point . It 's an art , holding a husband 's love , dear . It was a hundred times easier for our great grandmothers ! " " Harriet ! " came Julia 's eager reply . " I 've often thought of that ! What a man wanted then was animal comfort . A huge dinner . A deep chair . An open fire to snore in front of . " " EXACTLY ! " returned Harriet . " We modern wives have a task infinitely more difficult . Men today can obtain comfort in bachelor apartments . They do n't have to marry for it . It 's true they expect their homes to be well-run and their children well-reared as a matter of course , by magic , as it were ! But instead of that being all they require , it is only the beginning . A wife today must be an intellectual equal , Julia . A pal . A delightful chum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics . And books . And the stage . And modern music ? " " And golf and tennis and swimming , " Julia cut in quickly . " And driving a car . And maybe flying a plane . And how to plan a dinner party , and mix successfully with his friends . And how to talk his shop ? " " Yes , that last is very important , " interrupted Harriet earnestly . " If Norman ca n't come home and talk shop with you , and get understanding help , he 'll talk it with some one else , be sure of that . " " And there 's bridge , Harriet , " Julia was chuckling now , " and how to please the in-laws , And how to stay beautiful . And ? oh , yes , how to be smartly gowned at all times ! " Now both women were laughing together . Reaching out , Harriet took Julia 's hands suddenly , in a tense grip . " It 's a large order , dear , " she . concluded soberly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them , will have to be your weapons . Your defense of your besieged fort . Can you hold the fort ? " " Can I ? " cried the girl . Harriet , watch me ! And I 'll never forget this talk ! I 'll thank you for it as long as I live ! " " Good ! " replied Harriet quietly . " Let me fix your veil . There 's the march . " The strains of that sentimental march , to which so many frivolous , shallow , unprepared little brides have walked blindly toward ' domestic tragedy , were drifting up thestairway . The procession was formed . Deeply moved , I watched it go slowly downward . It was all starry-eyed youth and fragrant orange blossoms . Leading the way were two excited little flower girls who comprehended not at all the seriousness of the occasion . Behind them came pretty bridesmaids who hardly comprehended more . And in their midst , Julia ? a calm , purposeful Julia . A Julia who was facing squarely the complex task before her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady brown eyes there was now no trace of flippant cynicism , only strong , quiet resolve . I was the first to leave when the ceremony was over . I had been deeply impressed . I wanted to think . So while the other guests @#  | were flocking to the wedding breakfast , I slipped out , dug my shabby roadster from among the big cars , and went off down the road toward my little summer home . On the main street of the town , however , I turned away from my small house , with its limited personal library , and drove instead to the public library . There I parked my car . And there all afternoon , and for many days thereafter , I sought , in modern scientific works on the divorce evil , confirmation or refutation of Harriet 's theory ? the theory which had transformed cynical , flippant Julia Bidwell into a sober , thoughtful woman , sending her to the altar with the firm resolve to hold her home ? her husband ? against all outside forces and influences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a part of the present-day divorce problem ? Was a major cause of modern divorce merely cynical , spineless wives , easily defeated quitters ? And did the cure lie in this : arousing in these too-easy losers a sober appreciation of what they had , and a mighty desire to fight for its defense ? A consecrated determination to defend and hold , by all the love and tact at their command , the precious thing they had won ? Did modern brides need to be reminded that marriage , today , though originating in sex attraction , must quickly be given a mental and spiritual basis , if it is to endure ? And that to create this spiritual oneness is an art , a complex art requiring patience and study , and imagination and tact , and infinite , tireless striving ? HEARKEN to this , from " Divorce , A Social Interpretation " by J. P. Lichtenberger who is Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania , a post he has held for twentyfive years , and who is also Secretary of the American Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern industry , the economic function of the family is passing away . . . " ( Merely animal comfort . ) " In the absence of economic compulsion the perpetuity of marriage must depend upon factors of internal cohesion . If spiritual ties are lacking or are inadequate to hold the family together , it is likely to disintegrate . Under present conditions the home is maintained rather for its contribution to the amenities of life than as a necessity . And if these expectations are not fulfilled ? the temptation to break up housekeeping ' is increased . " For happy marriage , Professor Lichtenberger points out , there must be present in every home " intellectual affinity , kindred tastes , parallel personality development , agreeable companionship , mutual forbearance , cultural similarities , community of interests , and common objectives . " In most couples who approach the altar these qualities and abilities are latent . But to develop them , to blend them into intellectual and spiritual unity , into a deep , satisfying comradeship that shall withstand all shocks from without through a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especial art . Too delicate and undertaking for the clumsy skill of Man . " Innumerable wives , " Professor Lichtenberger warns us , placing further emphasis on the intellectual-comradeship basis of modern marriage , " who have been brought up to believe that the surest way to a man 's heart is through his stomach , have learned at their cost and not infrequently too late that a man 's heart can remain singularly empty even though his stomach may be agreeably full . Hence many men , who find that their wives can fill their stomachs much more efficiently than their leisure , habitually repair , as soon as the evening meal is over , to their club ... while the connubial cook is left to while away the time as best she may ... " Which reminds me of the sparkling , spirited young wife I encountered recently on a New York street . I had not seen her since her wedding day five years before . I noted with @#  | pleasure her twinkling pumps , and red coat , and saucy little hat . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's marvelous now . Now that I 've learned to be a female Barnum ! " And , as I looked puzzled , she explained : " Put on entertainments . Shows . When I first married Ned , I- concentrated on food . But not for long ! I put a good colored woman in there , in a hurry , and came out of the kitchen into the living room . And I began to fill Ned 's evenings . It was n't a minute too soon . I found him bored almost to the point of desertion . Why not ! He 'd been a city bachelor used to pleasant evenings and weekends . Our evenings and week-ends at home had been deadly ! I began to give small parties ; have his friends in . We joined a tennis club . We helped organize an amateur little-theater group . We 've bought an old second-hand car ; and on Sundays we drive ' way out to where we can study the birds . Ornithology is Ned 's hobby . We 've had a world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We save a little less . But we 're together ? and we 're happy ! " IN HIS thoughtful book just published , " Family Adjustment and Social Change , " Manuel Conrad Elmer , Professor of Sociology , University of Pittsburgh , warns us em-phatically : " We are just entering a period of social development , when the family is being reorganized on a more wonderful basis than ever before . Families are being organized on the basis of mutual affection and sympathetic understanding . The old family was eld together by economic necessity and biological convenience . The family of tomorrow will be as much better and purer and finer than that of yesterday , as our cities and schools excel those of yesterday , and as the airplane is superior to the ox cart . " And as a guidepost to the young couple struggling to create an ideal family life , he offers this striking suggestion : " What are the chief interests of the family as a whole ? In what things are the several members of the family interested ? Unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become dominant , and there is no provision made for anything else . A rich and well-balanced family standard of living must maintain a place for interest in art , in literature , in religion , in ethics , in science , in the world about us , and above all in each other . " Is this too high an ideal of family life , 1933 brides-to-be ? Is it so difficult and complex as to seem dismaying ? Do you prefer great grandmother 's comfortable philosophy , " Red steaks and feather beds make a pair of happy-heads " ? Possibly . Some of you , no doubt , are blessed with a living grandmother who has already called you into her room and warned you impressively : " My dear , remember food ! Food is allimportant . His favorite dishes . An easy chair with a good light above it . And something comfortable to get his tired feet into at night . Comfort ! Swaddle him in comfort , and you 'll hold him . Romance is all very well in the courtship days , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable housewife ! " Does he , Grandmother ? Ah , no , not in 1933 ! If we could lead you , Grandmother dear , from your own too-easy chair to the men 's clubs , the theaters , the political forums , the athletic associations , the apartments of clever , sparkling women , the various and one places , in cities especially , to which bored husbands flee of an evening from the heavy dinners and big easy chairs of home , you would quickly admit that solid comfort is not enough to fill any man 's life in 1933 . No , Grandmother . Complete comfort awaits any unattached man today in the hotels and apartment houses that cater to him . It awaits him at much less expense , and with far less stress and strain , than a marriage involves . Why , then , does the modern comfortable male ever marry ? He marries for companionship ? right , dependable , and completelysatisfying companionship . To satisfy loneliness . To still a craving for affection and all the lovelier things of life . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Comradeship . Laughter . Pleasant times . Bridge . Little motor trips . Golf . Lovely little candle-lit dinner parties at home . These swim superficially before the vision of the lonely man . But down within him are deeper cravings . The longing for some one responsive to come home to ? with his jokes or his business cares . A charming Circe awaiting him there when he is in a gay mood . A poised wife , when he brings important friends to dinner . A tender mother , when he is broken-hearted . A fellow idealist to share his unselfish dreams . A fine , thinking , public-spirited woman who will also make her contribution to the welfare of his community , and thus enable him to be proud of her . And there will be fine children , of course , whose voices will greet him eagerly at night , and whose later achievements will fill his old age with absorbing interests . All this a modern man , unconsciously , preposterously , expects of the inexperienced young creature he is marrying . Every side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment she creates , else the modern man is likely to drift , to begin to seek that missing satisfaction elsewhere . IS THIS too complex a program , too large an order , for the modern girl to fill ? Absolutely not ! Hundreds of thousands of her are filling it today with supreme success ; as is proved by our many happy marriages . These deeply happy marriages are to be found all along your street and mine . Being non-sensational they never get into the newspapers . But there they are for all to see and gain inspiration from . It is true they are far too few ! So long as 200,000 marriages are being wrecked by divorce every year , we can not smugly claim that there is no marital problem in the - United States . There is such a problem ! A grave one indeed ! But while admitting this , we can justly point with pride to the homes where the marriage experiment has been deeply happy , profoundly successful . It is safe to say that not one of these happy marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of both partners , but especially on the part of the wife , whose chief task the home making is . It is she who must be the inspired sculptor chiseling- , from the rough stuff of life a lovely creation ? her home . Count Hermann Keyserling in " The Book Of Marriage " refers with repeated emphasis to the " art " of being married . And he informs us that " constant care " and " skillful vigilance " are required to make marriage a condition of happiness and progress . " This art of marriage , " he declares , " this requisite faculty , is inborn with woman . " It is evident , " he warns the bride who will listen , " that the more complex the conditions , the greater will be the demand for artistic handling . The more talented the partners , the greater the necessity for tact and discretion if marriage is to run smoothly . This skill in adjustment is an art . . . The more manifold a man 's nature , the greater will be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hinder . On the other hand , neither must the latter be injured . This dilemma in itself calls for wisdom and art for its solution . " Effort . Pluck . Unselfish vision . Determination . Being always on tiptoe . Being forever " on the job . " Regarding the high goal as worth the daily struggle and self-sacrifice to  | attain it . These are requisite for success in any undertaking of life ? to retain a sports championship , to hold a fine business job , to create a happy marriage . I am inclined to think there is current now , among some young girls who otherwise are splendidly valiant and fine , a false ideal of what good sportsmanship is , as applied to marital life . " One thing , " a pretty , brilliant , highlytalented young bride told me recently in a tone of deep self-satisfaction , " Billy knows I 'll be a good sport . No matter what ! " " You mean , " I asked , " that when trouble comes , you 'll stand by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , of course . But I mean ? a woman . If I see he is getting interested in another woman , I sha n't wait to be told . I 'll simply slip away and set him free . I can earn my own living . I never , never could compete with another woman for a man 's affections ! " " But why not ? " I demanded . " You did in order to become engaged to him . You competed with many others . " Ignoring this , she went on stubbornly with heightened color : " My sister Janice has left her husband . Did you know ? She was ill , and away for months . Archie was lonely . He began to play golf at the country club with a young widow . An English girl , and absolutely lovely . They fell in love . Janice heard of it . She wrote him that she understood , and she would n't stand in the way . She offered him a divorce ; insisted really . He accepted . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " It was useless to tell her what I thought of Janice 's weakness . That it was pitiful . And wholly unsportsmanlike . Perhaps Archie would not have accepted a divorce from a pluckier mate ? one who considered him worth fighting for . MARRIAGE , home ? these are sacred things . Of tremendous import . Our nation is precisely as strong as its unbroken homes . No stronger . Oddly enough , Marian , the young bride whom I have just quoted , who is all poised to admit defeat and fly at the first indication that a pretty woman has attracted her husband 's attention , is a splendid girl . The fighting , forceful type . Not at all a weak quitter . She was tennis champion at her college all during her four years ' stay . Hotly , joyously , every year she defended that title against all contestants . Had any one told her it would be " sporting " of her to throw down her racket and turn tail and run , when confronted by a new , formidable opponent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder . Yet her husband , her home ? these precious possessions she will not fight to hold . It is n't " sporting " ! It is " bigger " to run away at the first indication of an impending contest ! How different the courageous , blunt , stimulating advice which I chanced to hear a poised young married woman of eight years ' experience giving to a group of engaged girls : " Study a man when you marry him . Try to find out what special trait or ability or charm attracted him and caused him to select you . Why did he consider you superior to all other women ? Was it your slender grace ? Or your way of dressing ? Or your gayety ? Or your sympathy ? Or your being an outdoors girl ? Or your interesting conversation ? Or your sense of humor ? Or your admiring and looking up to him ? Or your motherliness and gentleness ? " What was it ? Whatever it was , develop that trait or gift . Do n't fall away from it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Another thing : a man himself seldom knows what it was he liked best in you , or what type of wife he really wants you to be . Ask the average man , and he 'll say he selected his wife for her domestic genius and that he wants her to become a good comfortable hausfrau , an expert home manager . " This is just self-foolery . Hardly any man is actuated by any such motives . A slim ,  | lovely figure , bright eyes , a charming head of prettily-arranged hair , and quick , spontaneous laughter ? these are likely to have been some of the things that caught the man 's attention in the first place . " Can you blame him then , " the speaker went on , " for feeling outrageously cheated if his bride , chosen for these reasons , lets down immediately after marriage ? If all the grace and daintiness depart ? If frowsy hair and soiled , dull dresses replace the alluring ones ? If the gay laughter and interesting conversation give place to a discontented whine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would never in the world have selected as a life partner . Is it astonishing if , in his dismay , he begins to look in other directions to try to find a way out of it all ?

They are at The Hague ; and while the job is his , behind him , as a bulwark of strength , are her fine cooperation and intelligence . Between the two a rare , beautiful comradeship exists . Perhaps Jane may be called the modern super-wife . She has her home to manage ; her two little sons to rear ; her own intellectual work to carry forward . Yet she is her husband 's invaluable aid and inseparable chum .

I tried to put our love first , always . Above all the unimportant things , I mean ? money , and what people would think : all that . At times his unselfish love ? the fineness of it ? would overwhelm me . I promised myself I would never take advantage of that love . Never whine and fret , to be coddled into good temper . " I tried , too , to see things from his viewpoint , with his imagination and boyish enthusiasm , and be always the same playmate I had been . It 's the little things that determine the trend of a marriage . " For instance , on our honeymoon a small crisis arose . We were in a camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some blueberry muffins for supper and had put them in to bake . All my pride was centered on achieving a triumph .

Those muffins ! My pride in them ! If I left , they 'd be ruined . I nearly refused . Then I came to myself . To stay would be sheer selfishness . For no muffins on earth would make up to John for my snub , my lack of enthusiasm , my not sharing that sunset with him . I chose the sunset , turning off the oven . When we returned , the muffins were soggy ruins . But we laughed over it and made some toast instead . What mattered was ? we had shared that glorious sunset to-gether ! " We were silent .
