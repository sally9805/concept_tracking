BIG SHOW-Charles Cooke-Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> Since the death last year of Dexter Fellows , circus press agent extraordinary and perennial , the literature of the circus has seemed as subdued as mourning . With Big Show , the first novel of a circus-loving staff member of The New Yorker , the circus goes to town in bigger &; better literary spangles than ever . A three-ring romance presenting a tender love story , an engaging dog story and authentic circus life , Big Show shares with Dexter Fellows ' ballyhoo the distinction of being frequently livelier than the circus itself . <P> The story contains many a hero , but its main hero is Bob Boulton , a lazy , circus-struck , upState New York kid who teaches his collie , Skipper , a repertory of backyard tricks , rises from a frowsy dog- &-pony; show to headline billing in Madison Square Garden in The Greatest Show on Earth . With him goes pretty Ann , a blonde snake charmer whom he won when she was abandoned by an athletic , womanizing clown . <P> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful traveling circus , he makes a bad mistake , accepts a contract for the Big Show which includes his doubling in a high-wire leap and Ann joining a snake act . Thereafter the story centres on the Big Show at Madison Square Garden , spotlights the thinly disguised big-time circus stars : the Flying Codonas , Hugo Zacchini , Clyde Beatty , and , most brilliantly of all , the " animal-audience . " Sure enough , Bob 's dog act is a flop . Ann is bitten by a huge python and has a miscarriage . And every high-wire leap plunges Bob closer to a nervous breakdown . When he is only a few days away from a psychopathic ward , Ann hatches a scheme to get him fired . In the big , happy finale , superpressagent Wright Boyes ( a ringer for Dexter Fellows ) sends them off with good wishes for a long life of headlining with fine medium-sized circuses.
