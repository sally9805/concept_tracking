txt The disclosure that assessments totaling $28,750,000 for local improvements had been " practically stuffed away in pigeonholes " during Tammany control of the city government was made last night by W. Arthur Cunningham , the new City Controller . Pointing out that the work for which the levies had been made had been completed in some instances as far back as 1926 , he said the property owners concerned had not even been billed . " The city has paid the contractors , " he said , " but . with elections in the offing you can understand the reluctance of former officials to send out these bills . They have left them for us . This money must be collected , not merely because it is an asset of the city and is due , and it is my sworn duty to collect all moneys owing to the city , but because similar improvements are badly needed by other neighborhoods and are being held up . " Never Confirmed by Board .

" The work for which these must be levied has been completed . The sewers and pavements were installed in many instances five and six years ago  --  a few of these items go back as far as 1926 . " Explaining that local improvements represented by the outstanding assessments were financed through revolving funds , Mr. Cunningham said that if these costs were not billed promptly and paid promptly the funds " dry up . " Affairs Declared in Tangle . The disclosure was made by Mr. Cunningham in a speech over WOR .

" Mr. Cunningham said he felt " indebted " to his immediate predecessor , George , who had " worked hard and skillfully to avert a pressing current financial situation . " " Among the knotty problems which he inherited , " he said , " was a matter of $4,500,000 of revenue bills which the outgoing administration had not been able to refund . Many of these people were clamoring for their money . We have not the money to pay them . " We have continued our negotiations with the holders of these securities and have had the benefit of most helpful collaboration from the city 's bankers .

" He remarked that his second deputy , William R. Donaldson , was a certified public accountant , and that Professor Joseph D. , the third deputy , had been " a detached observer and close student of New York City 's problems  --  particularly its financial problems .
