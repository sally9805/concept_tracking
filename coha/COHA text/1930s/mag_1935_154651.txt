Last week as the Treasury was spending approximately $17,000,000 per day more than it was earning , the House of Representatives settled down to consider a tax bill which would produce just about enough revenue for the Government to break even for 16 consecutive days . <P> Not President Roosevelt , not Secretary Morgenthau , not Senate Finance Committee Chairman Pat Harrison , not Share-the-Wealther Huey Long , in fact hardly anyone except the rawboned , 6 ft. -2 in . North Carolina mountaineer who is Chairman of the House Ways &; Means Committee had a good word to say in public for the measure . Against Chairman Doughton 's loyal but half-hearted defense rose the critical outcry of thousands of Republicans , businessmen , plain citizens . Declared Republican Ways &; Means Committeemen in their minority report : <P> " If this bill serves no other purpose , it will at least demonstrate to the country that the extravagant and wasteful expenditures of the Democratic Administration can not be met merely by ' soaking the rich . ' ... It falls $3,305,000,000 short of meeting the deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth measure , it would provide but $2.25 for each of our 120,000,000 people . . . . <P> " . . .

One way to avoid taxes , and one which cost the Government a lot of money , was to form family trust funds . One U. S. family , he declared , had its fortune split up into 197 such funds . <P> At this point alert Correspondent Harold Brayman of the Philadelphia Public Ledger broke in to ask : " Does your bill touch family trusts ? ' ' <P> The President conceded that it did not , passed on to gift taxes . <P> Goodwill . At a press conference the week before . President Roosevelt 's target had been corporation gifts to charity . What right had corporations , he demanded , to buy goodwill by giving away their stockholders ' money ? In wide circulation last week was the following response by Preston S. Arkwright , president of Georgia Power Co. :
