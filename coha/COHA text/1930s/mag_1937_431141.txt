 | AN OBSERVER on the end of Pier 14 , Balboa , Panama Canal Zone , at 8 a. m . December 31 , 1932 , would have seen the schooner yacht Pilgrim making a desperate attempt to get away on her voyage around the world . While sailing down from Boston that summer , the vessel had sprung a leak , the complications of which had held us in the Canal Zone until this last day of the year . There were eight of us aboard . A ninth member , " Francis , " had just deserted . Francis was technically a coati and resembled something between a raccoon and a very small bear with a long tail ( page 227 ) . As he suddenly left us for the jungle , we suppose he feared the effects of a long voyage . SUPPLIES INCLUDE AN EXTRA LEG When the last of our Panama friends had been shooed onto the wharf , we dropped down the harbor and were soon roaring south under square sail and raffee before the first norther of the dry season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we found a particularly unpleasant-looking wooden leg , with a boot on it , which " Doc " Durant had seen fit to include in his medical stores . It is about 980 miles in a straight line from Panama to the Galapagos Islands , but a sailing vessel , especially at this season , does better to run due south to about two degrees from the Equator and then stand for the islands on the port tack. * Following this route , the Pilgrim had exceptional luck , and we fetched Tower Island in the Galapagos on the seventh day out . It helps to establish friendly relations if you fly on the foremast the flag of the country whose port you are entering . The Galapagos belong to Ecuador , but the flag we had hastily purchased turned out to be that of Colombia . There is a light-blue stripe in the flag of Ecuador , so Joe Ekeland , our rigger , was detailed to obtain some cloth of this color . t The way Joe prowled around the cabin caused considerable nervousness among the wearers of light-blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally contributed a discarded shirt of the proper shade and we anchored in Puerto Chico , San Cristobal Island , January 8 , with a particularly trim Ecuadorian flag at the foretruck . Progreso , the largest town in the Galapagos , is located on San Cristobal and has more than 400 Indianlike inhabitants . The military governor of the group and a prominent rancher did their best to show us a good time . Iguana pie , delicious avocado pears , pineapples , horses to ride ? they gave us everything and we had hard work to get them to accept money for eggs and other articles which we wanted for the voyage . SEA LIONS -- AND SEA TIGERS Next port was the uninhabited island of Santa Fe , or Barrington . ( All the Galapagos have both English and Spanish names . ) Sea lions swarm around the island ; every evening they hauled out for the night among the rocks astern of us . Big sharks are numerous , and one sea lion crawled out of the water with such a large section of his body bitten off that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunged half out of the water onto the rocks , trying to pull in the dead lion , and Joe beat them with a short club without producing the slightest effect . They soon had the body in the water and devoured . With an outboard motor on our big dory , we trolled outside the harbor and caught all the fish we could eat . Each night we were here , just at dark , our rigging was filled with small owls - a hundred or so , black and brown mottled . Having heard at Progreso that there were wild goats on Santa Fe , Starr , the  | Doc , and I started after some fresh meat . After walking over lava and through dry bushes for half a day , in the course of which we saw a light-green iguana , Starr shot a goat the size of a large cat . Boiled , it tasted like pretty good mutton . A BARREL AS A POST OFFICE A run of 35 miles from Santa Fe took us to Santa Maria , or Floreana or Charles Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old whaling days . The ancient barrel in which the whalers put letters to be picked up later by homewardbound vessels is still there . Sea lions were everywhere and very tame . Horace Fuller , our engineer , known as " the Chief , " picked up a baby lion on the beach . The mother rushed up , grabbed the baby out of his hands , and swam off with it . Our next anchorage was Tagus Cove , on the volcano-studded island of Isabela , or Albemarle , largest of the Galapagos . Three miles across the strait is Fernandina , or Narborough , a hunk of ragged lava 3,700 feet high , rising indescribably sad and silent out of a smooth ocean . On Fernandina , where we saw some flightless cormorants and thousands of marine iguanas , the walking was like climbing up and down large piles of broken bottles . PEA SOUP RECORD AT STAKE On the long run of 3,300 miles across the South Pacific to the Marquesas we had a fair wind , the southeast trade , and a current that sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We lived well . The log for January 30 records : " Pea soup today . Joe has the record of 3 bowls in 5 minutes . The Capt . can handle 3 bowls also , but takes longer . " And on February 2 the Harpooner ( Mr. Murphy ) was reported sitting up to curried chicken ( canned ) with rice and chutney for 46 minutes .  | Husky Joseph K. McCammon 3d , of Washington , D. C. , had now become known as " the Trader . " About six feet tall and pretty stout , he had a tendency to burst clothes and with a new beard he began to resemble exactly the typical South Sea trader of story and song ( page 239 ) . Despite generally light winds , we made a fair passage of 20 days without once using the engine , and daylight of February 8 found us close in with what Stevenson , who came here in the yacht Casco in 1888 , called the " great cannibal isle ' ' of Hiva-Oa , in the Marquesas . The trade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most magnificent scenery in the world up into Vipihai , or Traitors Bay . After sailing 3,300 miles , it is a little disconcerting to find yourself running dead before a big sea at a perpendicular wall of cliff , but at the last moment the little bay of Taahuku opened up and we let go our anchor in the same spot the Casco had occupied 45 years before . High , rocky shores crested with coconut palms and a beach of fine black sand are backed by precipitous mountains , of which Stevenson says : " They are reckoned at no higher than 4,000 feet : but Tahiti with 8,000 , and Hawaii with 15,000 , can offer no such picture of abrupt , melancholy alps . " CANNIBALS SURVIVE IN IMAGINATION Here lies the little town of Atuana , where we met the two white men of the island , the French administrator and the trader . Through the latter we hired horses and penetrated the island plateau . A small remnant of natives , many of them halfcastes , survives of the 20,000 or so husky cannibals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eerie spookiness about these silent ravines , where it is easy to imagine the spirits of the old warriors glaring hungrily at you from behind the coconut trunks or the overhanging crags . As dusk falls over the black beach at the head of Taahuku Bay , you can practically see the  | cannibals yelling down the valley on the heels of some white fugitive , while a ghostly whaleboat lies on her oars just beyond the surf . A sail of 91 miles to the northwest brought us to the magnificent Bay of Tai-o-Hae , on Nuku-Hiva , best known of the Marquesas ( page 228 ) . Everywhere in the group there seem to be abundant breadfruit , mangoes , bananas , and other fruits of which the scanty population can use but a fraction . Visiting TaipiVai , or the Vale of Typee , scene of Melville 's famous book , we found it still as lovely as ever but inhabited b y a mere handful of people . GIFT FROM PRESIDENT LINCOLN In the little village of Hakahetau , on the rock-pinnacled island of Ua-pu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father in the early sixties had saved the mate of an American whaleship from being eaten by the cannibals on HivaOa . President Lincoln had presented him with a telescope and a gold watch . The son showed us the telescope . a fine instrument . evidently much cherished . It was inscribed " From the President of the United States , " dated 1864 , and contained a long inscription in Polynesian . The trading schooner Tereora , of Papeete , which had been precariously boatint off copra from a small cove farther south . anchored near us one evening and Captain Alec Doom brought an ancient Marquesan aboard . He was old enough to have tasted " long pig " ( human flesh ) in his youth and looked as if he would enjoy it now . His face , including the eyelids , was covered with delicate tattooing . The morning of February 23 found the trade wind in full operation and the  | Pilgrim , under five lower sails , was off for the island of Takaroa , in the Tuamotus , or Low Archipelago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , plus the usual westerly current , brought the welcome hail of " Land ho " from the foremast head , where the Doc had picked up the ragged fringe of Takaroa 's coconut trees on the horizon . THROUGH THE JAWS OF A REEF We were boarded offshore by a grinning old Polynesian in an outrigger canoe . Scrambling over the side , he announced , in what John Vranken , our steward and cook , said was French , that his name was Hono Takora and that he was the pilot ( p. 227 ) . With sails furled , using our Diesel engine , we started into the narrow entrance . We anticipated a simple job , but as we entered the jaws of the reef , each embellished in characteristic South Sea style with a wreck , the pass disclosed itself as scarcely 200 feet wide , with a strong current pushing us along . Holding to the forestay and giving his directions by signs , the old fellow succeeded in turning the vessel around in a space I had thought impossible , and we suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rough coral wall . It looked as if our starboard side would be stove in . Indeed , I think this must inevitably have occurred had not the entire population of the village collected . As we drove in , about twenty of them simply leaned against our rail , elbows touching , and eased us alongside without a scratch . Mr. Takora having been suitably rewarded his efforts appeared to have produced an amazing thirst the Commander ( Starr ) and I accompanied him to call on the chief of the village . The chief 's wife , a stout lady taking a nap on the floor , routed out her husband , who donned a pair of dungaree trousers , a white French naval mess jacket , and a pith helmet , and came down to look at the Pilgrim . A handsome old chap with a beard , very dignified , he examined everything with keen interest and profound silence . Finally , seated in the cabin , he made a short speech  | which Mr. Takora interpreted in French something like this : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equipment , and fittings are all in accordance with the law of the Mormon Church , which is good . " The swimming here was fine . Sharks rarely entered the pass , and the water was full of queer-shaped fish , some bright yellow and blue . The Chief and the Harpooner caught a few tuna from the dory just outside the pass , and with these , a delicious young Takaroa pig , baked breadfruit ( from Ua-pu ) , and plenty of coconuts , we continued to live well . When we got two of the notorious Tuamotu squalls , rather tremendous affairs , black and desperate-looking , that blew hard , we were glad to be tied up in such a snug berth . ISLANDS OF ROMANTIC NAMES Sailing from Takaroa one afternoon we passed Takapoto are n't these lovely names ? the next day Aratika and Fakarava , and that afternoon , with a perfect trade on the quarter , mainsail , topsail , foresail , fisherman staysail , raffee and balloon jib all pulling hard , we cleared the squally Tuamotus and bore away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than 7,300 feet high , 20 miles wide , and visible nearly 100 miles away in clear weather , the western horizon was smothered in such a heavy pall of cloud that we sailed to within 15 miles of it before sighting land . After dark the clouds gradually dispersed and midnight of March 2 found the Pilgrim hove to under Point Venus waiting for daylight . Dawn over Tahiti discloses one of the world 's most beautiful scenes : high mountains , including the " Crown " or Diadem , their slopes covered by tropical vegetation ; tall coconut palms along the beaches ; deepblue waters of the South Pacific tumbling heavily on the encircling coral reef . A pilot appeared , took us through the pass into Papeete Harbor , and we were soon tied up , anchor ahead , stern to the bank , with a gangway ashore and our lines fast to a couple of old cannon embedded in the ground . Our stern with " Pilgrim Boston " emblazoned thereon was , of course , presented to a considerable crowd collected on the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the hail LS THE SEVEN SEAS 233 which greeted us , Is there anyone on board from Revere ? " We were told that the word Papeete ( pronounced Papayti ) is composed of two words meaning " basket of water " and this describes the harbor . TAHITI STILL A LOTUS LAND Like nearly all the Society Islanders , the natives are jolly , handsome , and friendly . More advanced than some inhabitants of Oceania in what we call civilization , they have adopted European dress in the larger towns and for formal occasions . They are extremely clean and it is considered a disgrace for a girl to appear in public unless she has just had a bath and wears a freshly laundered dress . Many of these natives are accomplished guitar players , and the girls ' songs have a lively rhythm and haunting melody . Harrison W. Smith ( Harvard 1895 ) , who has done so much for Tahiti , entertained us , and Charles B. Nordhoff , who had recently published , with J. N. Hall , Mutiny on the Bounty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was only a few feet longer than the Pilgrim . No wonder they had a mutiny with so many people in such a small vessel . Being captain of the Pilgrim and enormously interested in the whole nautical life of the islands , I found the captains of the trading schooners fascinating . Captain Doom , in from the Marquesas with a load of copra in the Tereora ; Captain Thomson of the Tagua ; Captain Winnie Brander ; Captain Viggo Rasmussen of the Tiare Taporo ; Captain Laurent of the Vaiti ? she 's 34 years old and sound as a nut ; old Captain Larsen he came to the islands as a sailor with Stevenson in the Casco in 1888 and has stayed ever since ? where can you find another such group ? As Papeete is the core of the real South Sea , so Bohler 's Bar , in many ways , is the core of Papeete . Sitting at a table there over a glass of rum punch , listening to these men , was a rare privilege . One morning the schooner Manureva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside us . She is owned in small shares by many Austral Islanders , who take their dividends in a semiannual trip to Papeete . Smaller than the Pilgrim , she carried some forty natives of all ages and a cargo which included three cows , a bull , many pigs , and many crates of fowl .  | Copra , vegetables , and fruit were stowed in every possible cranny , strings of dried fish hung from the end of the bowsprit , and high in the main rigging were lashed two bicycles . Since the Chinese to whom she was consigned had died the previous night , there was a day 's delay before the cargo could be sold . The cows and the bull were staked out on the bank under our stern , and local buyers , mostly Chinese , commenced to attend . At close range for nearly a week we could see the most tremendous negotiations being carried on , punctuated at frequent intervals by the pierc- ing squeals of the pigs as they were dragged ashore . Occasionally a victim escaped and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porker being chased by three Chinese up the main street of the town . He was heading about south and seemed to hold a better breeze than his pursuers . We made an expedition to the neighboring island of Moorea. with its spectacular peaks , to attend a wedding and carried about thirty seasick wedding guests . I married a couple myself on the " high seas , ' after which Joe wanted to know if I had put in " a splice that would n't draw . " Completely confounding shore opinion . which held that the Pilgrim would never be able to collect her crew sufficiently to make a start . we sailed from Papeete early in May for RaIatea , in the Leeward Group of the Society Islands , a group officially described as the " Iles Sous le Vent . " Although family affairs had called the Harpooner home to Detroit , we had been lucky enough to ship in his place Charles J. Lipscomb of Easton , Maryland , a yachtsman and a jolly soul who played the guitar ( page 237 ) . Wilfrid O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returning from a visit to relatives in Australia . joined us for the run to the Leeward Group .  | Eight o'clock next morning found us running the Teavarua Pass under the square sail , with the beautiful mountains of Raiatea sweeping up ahead , and soon we tied up at the little wharf of the town of Uturoa . CANOES MAKE HIGH SPEED Raiatea is noted for the speed of her outrigger sailing canoes , fabulous accounts of which are circulated in Papeete . The native owner of the champion canoe took me for a sail on the lagoon and it seemed as if I had never rushed through the water at such a tremendous rate before . Our departure was delayed a day by a case of illness in which the local physician requested the assistance of our doctor . Despite everything that could be done , the poor native woman , who weighed 250 pounds , finally succumbed to the simultaneous afflictions of childbirth and elephantiasis . The neighboring island of Tahaa is enclosed by the same coral reef as Ralatea and we passed along it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masthead and assisted by a couple of old French charts presented by a friendly resident of Uturoa . Although rats had eaten off substantial portions , they fortunately seem to have preferred the mountains to the water , so we got safely out through Paipai Pass and that afternoon anchored under the mighty peak of Bora-Bora , off the little village of Vaitape . All these islands , Ralatea , Tahaa , BoraBora , are beautiful , with their high mountains , coconut trees , beaches , lovely lagoons , and coral reefs . The mountain of BoraBora , 2,379 feet high , dominates the anchorage . Foremost of events during our stay were the capture by the Chief and the Trader of a giant barracuda , with teeth like a wolf 's , and the arrival from Papeete of the 236 THE NATIONAL GEO  | little 50-foot trading schooner Vahine Tahiti , commanded by our old friend , Captain Winnie Brander . She was under charter to pick up copra at the neighboring island of Maupiti and then at Mopelia , where a German raider was wrecked during the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an amazing person with experiences in every island and sea in the eastern Pacific . Captain Brander , whose family once owned interests in Easter Island , was just as entertaining . They both insisted we ought to visit the island of Maupiti , plainly visible some 30 miles west of Bora-Bora . MAUPITI IS A CLOSELY GUARDED GEM So far as I know , there is no large-scale chart of Maupiti , and the narrow , crooked entrance has such a bad name that we had never considered going there . When the trade wind blows fresh from the southeast , it is often absolutely unnavigable for many days at a stretch . With calm weather and a good pilot it is quite another story , and noon of May 20 found the Vahine Tahiti bucking the current in the pass , followed at some distance by the Pilgrim with the redoubtable Miller waving directions from her buffalo rail . I was steering and we could just stem the current , crawling along so close to the reef that I hated to look at it and then twisting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had no current to contend with , but it was hard over wheel , first one way and then the other , for about half an hour , before we anchored under the cliffs of Maupiti ( page 242 ) . Of all the lovely tropical islands I have seen , Maupiti is the gem . The blue is bluer around Maupiti than anywhere else ; the green trees are greener , the beaches whiter , and the coconut trees grow at more extraordinary angles . FIRST VISITORS IN SIX MONTHS The natives boarded us . English is of no use on Maupiti , nor is French , at least the kind I speak . One must speak Tahitian to get the best out of any of these islands , so our two friends from the Vahine Tahiti came to our rescue . We were the first arrivals in six months and except for one memorable occasion when the Government schooner Zelee had succeeded in getting inside the pass , the Pilgrim was the largest vessel ever to reach Maupiti . Next day the hospitality of the natives became organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faint airs and calm , which had produced the smooth chance we had to enter , the wind blew up hard , making the pass unnavigable for five days and preventing the departure of the Vahine Tahiti for Mopelia . The natives invited us to a feast in her honor , at which Captain Brander was proclaimed " king " of the island for the duration of his visit . The affair was held in the community house , a long , low building with a thatched roof , and with the sandy ground for a floor . We sat on benches ranged along one wall , the food and a couple of kerosene lamps were placed on the table before us , and as many of the population as could squeeze into the building ? perhaps 200 sat crosslegged on the ground , following our every move with breathless interest and occasionally bursting into song . Polynesian food is delicious . Pig , chicken , breadfruit , taro , and a particularly succulent green , something between spinach and broccoli , all cooked together in the ground on hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a characteristic meal . The meat falls from the bones and its juice flavors the vegetables . And , of course . there was coconut in various forms . The chief , a jolly old soul we had entertained on board , made a speech of welcome . Captain Brander made a speech : so did Miller ; and after each one the natives sang . Then came the " frigate bird " dance , performed by five Tuamotu sailors from the Vahine Tahiti to guitar music from the same vessel an amazing performance which brought down the house . as it would in New York or anywhere else . Then there was more singing and dancing . Once we were invited to dinner by one of the leading families , where we sat on the floor and ate a marvelous meal out of leaf dishes without knives or forks or spoons . It was delicious , and everything about the place , including our host and his two wives , was as clean as could be . Since Maupiti is so isolated it sometimes runs out of what we regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing one stick against another . Though we tried to imitate them exactly , we could never quite manage to get the flame . We always returned from these entertainments crowned and garlanded with flowers and festooned with shell beads .  | Once I found myself wearing three wreaths , one on top of the other . LADIES ' DAY ON THE " PILGRIM " Of course , we tried to reciprocate all this hospitality . One of our greatest efforts was " ladies ' day , " when all the women of the island were invited aboard the Pilgrim . I counted seventy at one time , each dressed in her immaculate best . The chief 's wife , who seemed to occupy a position resembling that of president of the sewing circle , carried a parasol of flowers and cheerfully sat beside me on the weather rail of the sailing dory as we beat out to the vessel against the choppy little seas of the lagoon . She was a small , refinedlooking native , and displayed not the faintest trace of annoyance when , despite an old raincoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spray wetted down her finery . The Doc , a fine pianist , had a small portable organ , well known in all the ports as " Oscar " ; together he and Oscar greatly diverted the ladies of Maupiti . Meanwhile , the pass continued impossible ? a mass of high breakers . It did n't seem as if anything except a fish could possibly leave the lagoon for at least a week . But Miller was not discouraged . " You ca n't buck the elements , " he remarked , " and , anyhow , we 've got our guitar players . Whenever Winnie and I ship a crew we always make sure there are two or three good guitar players among them . " RUNNING . A. GANTLET OF . REEFS The morning of May 26 , the wind having backed to about east and moderated considerably , Captain Brander and Miller boarded us to say they considered the pass navigable and would start at noon . They gave careful directions for the ticklish entrance , which we must cope with alone , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of following close behind them was thwarted by having to say goodbye to half the population . By the time they had pumped in our anchor chain and piloted us through the coral heads of the lagoon ,  | the Vahine Tahiti was some distance ahead . The heavy seas of the last few days , piling over the barrier reef , had increased the amount of water in the lagoon and it poured out through the narrow entrance in a swift torrent . As soon as the Pilgrim began to feel the current 's grip , our native friends had to leave , jumping into their canoes or diving overboard . The place is dreadfully narrow and the roar of the breakers outside sounded singularly unattractive . There was just time , if we acted instantly , to buck the current back before it got too strong and anchor inside the lagoon . The Commander and I looked at each other . We decided to risk the passage . This decision was based on the knowledge that Miller and Captain Brander were too experienced to try this sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilgrim passed the last islet and headed down the race track along t h e inner edge of the reef , it occurred to me that we had not made them fully aware of the difference in power between the two schooners . The Pilgrim 's 85-horsepower Winton-Diesel. handled by t h e Chief , was plenty powerful , but our propeller was a very small twobladed affair , designed more with the idea of not being a drag when under sail than of pushing the vessel , and particularly futile against a head sea ( page 226 ) . With this scarcely comforting reflection , I steered the Pilgrim along what we fervently hoped was the channel . We were going at a tremendous clip with the full force of the current behind us . " Keep the edge of the reef six feet from your port side , " Miller had directed , and I tried to do so , glancing out of the corner of my eye at the horrid brown ribbon with  | a feeling of intense dislike . There was about two feet of water washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel hard over as the bow swept up and over the first big sea in the jaws of the pass , with the edge of the reef still approximately six feet from our port quarter . We made the turn and faced out to sea , but were barely moving , while close aboard , on both sides , closer than I like to think of even now , tremendous breakers fell with a shattering crash . Ahead , every other part of her hidden in the trough , the mastheads of the Vahine Tahiti reeled across the sky as she staggered through the big seas in front of us . The engine held us bow into it , and the tremendous current , although it made the seas higher and steeper , squirted us out to a point where we could set , with some trouble , the foresail and jumbo . This steadied her and increased the speed . " POSITION DOUBTFUL " CAUSES WORRY Half an hour after weighing anchor we stopped the engine , made sail , mainsail , topsail , fisherman 's staysail , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,500 miles westward . We soon overtook the Vahine Tahiti , swarming with people , and exchanged frantic farewell salutes . The weather continued lovely all the way to the Tongas , but after the first day the trade wind fell very light and we made a slow passage . On the 30th we passed close to Aitutaki , in the Cook group , an extremely pretty , typical tropic isle , but with no harbor , and shortly after were confronted with our first " P. D. " reef . On charts of the South Pacific are a few small circles with the letters " E. D. " or " P. D. " in the center . " Existence doubtful "  | can probably be safely disregarded , but " Position doubtful " is more annoying . We got a vague inkling of the troubles of the early navigators in clumsy squareriggers , with no charts or modern equipment , to whom every foot they covered had been " E. D. " before . It was good weather for haircutting . Earlier in the voyage the Harpooner had volunteered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off one of the Commander 's ears the job had been turned over to Joe , who continued to handle it to the satisfaction of the customers . I t got so smooth that the Trader and Doc launched the " pea pod " and took some snapshots of the vessel with most of her finery on and just enough air to fill it ( page 261 ) . But eventually we reached Tongatabu , and anchored off the town of Nukualofa . We had taken 13 days to sail 1,580 miles . This was winter in the Southern Hemisphere . and here in 21 ' South Latitude it felt almost cold . The Kingdom of Tonga is under British protection and ruled by a queen , who , with all her subjects . was now in deep mourning for the death of a princess . The English colony was e xtremely hospitable . One of the bad aspects of long voyaging is that just when you 're having a good time you 've got to move along ; and move along we did to Vavau , a 190-mile run from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcanic Fonuafoo , or Falcon Island , which has literally had its " ups and downs " in the last fifty years . It was now about a hundred feet out of water .  | After tearing ourselves away from Vavau , we headed for Pago Pago ( Pango Pango it is pronounced ) on the island of Tutuila , Eastern Samoa , with a cracking good trade on the starboard quarter . At dawn next day we were scrutinizing , in a drizzle , the high coast of Tutuila , trying to find Breaker Point Light , and shortly after swept grandly into the harbor of Pago Pago under the square sail and tied up in our first United States port since the Panama Canal ( p. 240 ) . Governor G.B. Landenberger and the officers of the Naval Station outdid themselves in entertaining us . We were introduced to the native siva dance and a sort of Samoan imitation of the Society Island hula . One day the Commander and I climbed the little mountain back of the town , where we fell in with three or four natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took the form of a pair of short pants tattooed in fine scrolls and with much artistic dash on one of the chiefs . PRESENT-DAY PERILS OF THE FIJIS In Pago the Pilgrim lost her last Yale man ? the Harpooner was the other ? when Doc departed to start his final year in medical school . We left him on the dock July 27 when we sailed for Suva , in the Fijis , with a freshening breeze from southeast . Although cannibals are no longer found in the Fijis , they have modern terrifying successors , such as the Department of Agriculture . The Pilgrim had no sooner tied up alongside the wharf than she was boarded by a representative of this branch of the Government , who pleasantly remarked that he understood we had just come from Eastern Samoa . " Yes . And in four days , " we answered with some pride . This was a mistake . Our visitor commenced to talk about  | Samoan beetles . The horrid situation was this : Samoan beetles are so dreaded in Fiji that every vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then come direct to Fiji is compelled to go three miles to sea every night and ca n't return until daylight . We were appalled . " But we have n't seen any beetles , " we insisted . " They 're nocturnal , " said the Department of Agriculture . He lit his pipe and repeated with a sort of gloomy satisfaction the dreadful remarks of the captain of a Scottish tramp who had managed to locate the Suva pass in a thick gale of wind , got in about an hour before dark , and had to turn around and go to sea again immediately for the night . The Department of Agriculture representative was really most agreeable . He weighed about 200 pounds , not fat , but very able looking . " What 's that ? " he suddenly asked . " That " was a cockroach , which fortunately kept in view long enough to be unquestionably identified . It was a close call . I do n't know now why we eventually escaped . Possibly the Department of Agriculture realized what we are convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel . Anyway , he inspected everything , sealed up our sail locker , told some really interesting yarns , and finally departed . Then Charley Lipscomb came down with jaundice and had to be left in Suva . So when the Pilgrim stood out of the pass into a whistling trade on the Chief 's twentyfifth birthday , bound for Port Moresby . New Guinea , her complement was reduced to six . On the long runs the Pilgrim never got enough wind and this passage was no exception . Here it was August , the middle of winter , when the southeast trade is supposed to blow fresh , and miserable , piddling little airs persisted for much of the passage . According to the log : " Rain , and wind very variable . Some slamming of boom in light spells . Cold and gloomy . . . Vahine Tahiti , ' our fine cat , is having  | a time with the flying fish . Several of these have come aboard recently . She can eat about six at a sitting . All but the tails . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time , but kept going under square sail and raffee . . . " Running up the Coral Sea before a strong trade . Fine night . Considerable following sea . . . Steering W X N 3A N to clear a shoal called ' Nellie ' ( ' P. D. ' ) . " Fourteen days out of Suva , when we were nearing New Guinea , the trade wind suddenly changed its tactics and blew up to about forty miles an hour , with a heavy sea , weather thick and hazy , like a Cape Cod southwester . Next afternoon we anchored under the bare brown bluff at Port Moresby , 2,300 miles from Suva . As in every British colony visited , the little group of whites were extremely hospitable and helpful . This is wild country , and even around Port Moresby the native men wear only a loincloth and the women a grass skirt ( page 245 ) .

Painted , heavily tattooed , and tricked out in feathers , with fancy headdresses and topknots , with skewers through the noses of many of the men , and brandishing spears and clubs , they were a desperatelooking crowd ( page 243 ) . TWO GENUINE CANNIBALS ARE CAUGHT At Yule Island , about 65 miles northwest of Port Moresby , where the Pilgrim lay a few days , the resident manager of the district , who was also the lone Englishman , showed us a couple of " certified " cannibals his native police had captured . Objecting to the attentions of a certain man to their sister , these two had killed him and eaten his leg . They had just commenced the regular penalty for this offense -- one year in jail for murder . The jail , a little frame building , looked rather attractive . The cannibals did not . Now came Torres Strait , the passage through the islands and reefs between New 250 THE NATIONAL GEOI  | Guinea and Australia . We sailed from Yule Island on September 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous and to us ? unknown sea birds . There was a full moon ; it was pretty rough , and these great birds , sweeping across the vessel , hovering close over our heads and casting gigantic shadows on the deck , recalled the old deep-water superstition that certain sea birds are the spirits of drowned sailormen . But in the jumble of a cold and drenching northwest squall that hit us at 5 a. m . ? " You never get the wind northwest at this season , " we had been assured ? we forgot about the birds . We spent the next night anchored at Cocoanut Island , about halfway through the strait , a lovely little place with plenty of coconut trees . There we obtained another cat , Tom , as company for our little black Tahitian lady , and they promptly set up housekeeping in the vegetable bin ( 245 ) . Once through Torres Strait , the Pilgrim entered the smooth waters of the Arafura Sea , and all the way to the Tanimbar Islands , about 700 miles , she had beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly good little breeze astern . SEA IS DOTTED WITH WATER SNAKES The Tanimbars , outpost of the Netherlands Indies , are on the edge of nowhere . As we approached them , this impression was increased by the presence of many big , brown , banded water snakes with knobs on the end of their tail . The question as to whether these snakes could get aboard via the bobstay was rendered more interesting by the fact that our medical book listed them with the king cobra among the most poisonous known to science . September 12 we picked up the island of Jamdena , or Timor Laut , largest of the Tanimbars , ahead and steered in for the village of Saumlakki . When we anchored off a trim stone pier , the town disclosed several little frame dwellings and a large church . We were received by a young Dutch-speaking Malay , a sort of deputy port officer . The island is moderately high and covered with vegetation , including , besides the usual coconut palms , some large and fairly stout trees . Three miles across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oelilet where I saw two fine anchors , weighing about 1,500 pounds each . These belong to the village and came from some vessel wrecked long ago . The natives are primitive and eke out their larder by hunting birds by means of bows and arrows . We saw some pretty red and blue parakeets and I got a dead bird of paradise from a Chinese . West of the Tanimbars is the Banda Sea , where we had one of the best sails of the voyage . With the big jib topsail and fisherman 's staysail set , we averaged 7% knots for the 286 miles to the Banda Islands . IN THE HOME OF THE NUTMEG The Bandas , chief of the Moluccas , or Spice Islands , were at one time the only source of nutmegs . The harbor is good and dominated by the 2,159-foot volcano of Goenoeng Api , which did not smoke for us , although it is active . The town of Banda Neira is very old , with a fort built in 1611. and contains some ancient nutmeg buildings and innumerable thatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be stationed in Netherlands New Guinea , where the cannibals ate three of his policemen . A planter entertained us and showed us through the old nutmeg groves . The New Guinea natives once tried to buy his wife for 100 pigs . I did n't blame them ; she was very attractive . The Pilgrim 's good luck in the Banda Sea continued and we held a fine easterly breeze all the way to Dili , in Portuguese Timor , some 400 miles to the southwest . At Timor we lost the wind completely . It was stark calm when we left Dili on September 22 and stark calm it remained . It was up to the Chief , and he certainly did a good job . For four hot days the Diesel pushed us to the westward along the string of islands that extends from Timor clear to Java ? Alor ( Ombai ) , Pantar , Lomblem , Flores , all mountainous , with some of the peaks rising more than 7,000 feet . We passed south of them . Some 440 miles of this brought us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon lizards . After a long , hot tramp up a dry river bed and over some plains covered with bushes , we scared up one of the lizards about seventy feet away . He was a grand  | lad , perhaps ten feet long , and scuttled out of sight with amazing speed . " BALI OR BUST " The calm continued after we left Komodo . When asked if he wanted to stop the engine and rest , the Chief said , " Bali or bust . " So we kept plugging along at four or five knots and two days later dropped the hook in the protected harbor of Benoea , near the south end of the fascinating island. * In our nine-day stay we attended a religious festival at Besakih , part way up the 10,308-foot Peak of Bali ( Agoeng ) , saw monkeys , cockfights , countless rice terraces , gorgeous costumes . Best of all was the exquisite dancing of some little girls , apparently about twelve years old , in blue and silver dresses and tall headgear . At Bali we lost our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the pass at Maupiti , the Trader 's purple pajamas , and , if there were no flying fish , she would take what was offered . It was a real sorrow to lose her . From Benoea we bucked a terrific head current through Badoeng and Lombok Straits around the east end of Bali , from which point we found enough wind to sail at a slow pace through Sapoedi Strait into the Java Sea . Robert L. Hoguet , Jr. , a friend of the Chief at Harvard , had joined us in Bali for the run to Batavia . For six days we flapped along , usually  | in sight of the coast of Madoera and then Java , where we could sometimes see the high mountain peaks over the clouds . The sea was smooth . There were plenty of water snakes , and as we got to the westward the queer native craft of all kinds increased . The names changed . We passed Tandjoeng ( Point ) Boegboeg , and Boompjes Island . After narrowly escaping being run down by a steamer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a fine sheltered berth off the yacht club in the inner harbor of Tandjoengpriok. * As we left Batavia calms continued and we churned north through Gaspar Strait into the China Sea without a breath of wind . We carried a shotgun handy to the wheel now , which took care of the snake question , at least during daylight . They were pretty thick sometimes . Occasionally a Chinese junk would appear , and the Pilgrim passed close to one , a big three-master , completely becalmed . Five days from Batavia - 610 miles - we anchored at Singapore . The harbor was filled with craft , from big steamers hailing from all parts of the globe down to junks , proas , and queer lateen-rigged affairs , manned by crews of desperate and piratical appearance ( 249 ) . The Commander hired one of the myriads of sampans to attend the Pilgrim and ferry us to and from the shore . The proprietor 's name , unlikely as it may seem , was Ng . You can pronounce this if you know the language . We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name to which Mr. Ng , as a special favor to us , was obliging enough to answer . A " WANT AD " GETS RESULTS Just why the Commander chose the middle of a voyage to get married is a question he has never satisfactorily explained . Cables flashed , the future Mrs. Starr and her mother left Boston for Italy , and in an atmosphere of deep gloom we saw the Commander off on a steamer bound for the same place . He did not leave until a substitute had been shipped . " Yachtsman desirous free passage to England in return for services on voyage please apply . . . " * See " Through Java in Pursuit of Color , " NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , September , 1929. t See " Singapore , Crossroads of the East , " NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , March , 1926 . This notice in a Singapore paper produced Mr. S. C. M. Cutting , an English civil engineer and yachtsman who was bound home and who arranged to join the Pilgrim at Penang , about 440 miles up the Strait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore November 27 with her company reduced to five . It was usually flat calm and the Diesel pushed us most of the way . The coast of the Malay Peninsula is generally featureless , low mangrove swamps with mud banks extending one to twelve miles offshore . After spending a day watching a gorgeous and incredible Chinese procession in the old town of Malacca , we passed through Klang Strait and anchored at the Dinding Islands off the village of Pangkor . Thatched huts on piles extended over the water and several big junks and dugout canoes with carved ends indicated a certain amount of commercial activity . There was n't a white man in the place . There were two Chinese traveling salesmen at Pangkor whose line was medical supplies . Having attracted a crowd by a short speech and the simple expedient of laying a cloth over the bare earth and extracting a live hen from beneath it , one of the salesmen swallowed ( so far as I could see from a distance of ten feet ) a handful of tacks , and relieved the ensuing distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his medicine . The other man shoved eight or ten spikes about eight inches long through the skin of his cheeks until the ends stuck out and his face resembled a pincushion . When the spikes were withdrawn and a healing ointment applied , no wound was visible . The Chief , whose untiring attention to the Diesel had pushed the Pilgrim so many miles in these calm eastern seas , kept his machinery turning , and eventually , after drenching rain , head currents , and under appalling clouds , which never seemed to have wind in them , shoved the vessel into Penang , where we anchored in the midst of about fifty junks . Cutting joined us here and proved just the right man for the voyage . Running before a light easterly breeze , on the fourth day out of Penang the Pilgrim raised the murky hills of the Nicobars through the mist and anchored in a landlocked harbor off a lovely sandy beach . Immediately outrigger canoes appeared from behind a point and surrounded us at  | a short distance . Each contained three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling down behind . They seemed a bit fearful , but very curious . Contact having been established by means of an old shirt , one of the canoes ventured alongside , revealing its occupants as medium-sized , well made , and wiry , with what we thought a resemblance to the Polynesians of the eastern Pacific . Although the Pilgrim was pretty full of curios by no w , we exchanged old clothes for paddles , spears , and other objects . We saw no firearms . The most popular bargain aboard the Pilgrim was put through by John when he swapped an old shirt for four fat ducks ( page 246 ) . We saw no women or children ; they were invariably rushed back into the bush whenever we came ashore . FRIDAY SAILING PROVES A JONAH Although the superstition that it is unlucky to sail on Friday has no scientific basis , we had a miserable passage from the Nicobars across the Bay of Bengal to Ceylon . Calms , light shifting airs , torrential rains , and mixed cross seas plagued us for most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the harbor of Colombo 1,040 miles in 10 days ! We were soon boarded by natives who camped on deck with three cobras and a mongoose . The mongoose would n't fight , but the cobras performed perfectly ( page 251 ) . On New Year 's Day , 1934 , the Pilgrim sailed from Colombo , and from noon that day to noon on the 2d she covered 217 miles of Indian Ocean , the best run of the voyage . January 4 we passed close to Minicoy Island , where we met a brigantine and saw a large steamer piled up on the reef near the lighthouse ? the result of a long , thick squall.  | When we were well into the Arabian Sea , the regular northeast monsoon settled in , and for eight successive days the vessel averaged 171 miles with this fine cool breeze on the starboard beam . Flying fish came aboard in whole squadrons , and one night we collected a bucket of them in half an hour , giving all hands a breakfast . Rounding Socotra on January 11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the Rock of Aden early on the 15th , and tied up in the harbor fourteen days from Colombo-2,440 miles , a very decent passage . If you like plenty of hot bare rock and sand , you 'd like Aden and its environs. * There are camels and goats and dust and beggars . Sailing from Aden on January 20 with a good easterly breeze , next morning we rounded the island of Perim , which lies in the middle of Bab el Mandeb , the strait at the southern entrance to the Red Sea . From this point , driving before a strong south-southeast wind under square sail and See " Rock of Aden , " by H. G. C. Swayne , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE for December , 1935. raffee , the Pilgrim ran 90 miles in ten hours and entered a group of high , desolate , sundried islands : Jebel ' Lugar , 2,047 feet high ; Quoin Island , Jebel Teir . I doubt that even a lizard could exist on any of them . Jebel Teir , about 300 miles from Aden , suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck in the Red Sea . FOOT BY FOOT UP THE RED SEA We had scarcely passed it when our southerly breeze , which had been gradually dropping , disappeared entirely and was succeeded by a moderate wind from northnorthwest , dead ahead , accompanied by a high , short , steep sea into which the Pilgrim plunged to her buffalo rail . We could not make headway , under sail or power , or both , and the moon looked nearer to me than did Suez , a thousand miles dead to windward . People think of the Red Sea as calm , smooth , and hot . But for every hour of calm we had two hours of strong head wind . Without the engine we 'd be there yet . It was rough most of the time and as we  | approached the northern end the thermometer fell at night to the forties . It is about a hundred miles through the Suez Canal to Port Said , and we took two days to pass through , spending the night at Ismailia , on Lake Timsah . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional glimpse of wild dogs . WHO SAID " SUNNY " MEDITERRANEAN ? It was 46 ? Fahrenheit on deck when we left Suez , and when we arrived at Port Said , in a penetrating rain driven by a strong west wind , it was 42 ? . After a day or so the rain stopped , but the cold westerly continued and kept our decks and everything not shut tight filled with sand off the desert . The Pilgrim sailed from Port Said on February 18 bound for Nice , on the French Riviera , where the Commander and his bride awaited her , and for five miserable days was unable to make any westing . This spell of desperate westerly weather culminated , near Cyprus , in an exceptionally heavy northwest gale which compelled us to heave to . Occasional crests of seas came aboard and got through skylights , tarpaulins , and everything . On the evening of the 23d it fell calm . For four days there was n't a breath of wind . The engine was getting worn and once the Chief had no sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pilgrim crept to the westward and at dawn of the 26th raised the snow-covered mountains of Krete ( Crete ) above the horizon . Passing through Kasos Strait , we cruised along the precipitous north side of the island where at times a light breeze off the land enabled the sails to help the engine . We were now in the Sea of Candia ; the weather was fine , and at 8 a. m. on the 27th we anchored in the protected harbor of Suda Bay . It had taken us nine days to cover the 550-odd miles from Port Said ! The surroundings of Suda Bay are barren but picturesque . Back of the little village rocky slopes soon merge into a mountain that sweeps up 8,000 feet into  | the sky . At this time it was covered with snow and ice to within a few miles of the village . About three miles west of Suda Bay lies the capital and chief seaport , Khania , or Canea , a fascinating old town where we spent several hours . Repeating a mistake made earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northwest corner of Crete at dusk on March 2 , picked up a fair wind from the northeast , and headed for Sicily . But the weather was gray and gloomy , with a falling barometer , and the second night out we hove the vessel to in another northwest gale , identical with the one off Cyprus , except that it lasted longer . Head winds , squalls , and the peculiar short , steep sea from the westward that seems to characterize the Mediterranean at this season held us back , and it was not until the morning of the 10th that we entered the Strait of Messina , where it fell flat calm , with the snow-capped volcano of Mount Etna belching smoke in front of us . We moored in the little port of Messina with our stern fast to the shore , as in Papeete , but instead of lovely tropical scenery for a background , we now had a freight train ( page 256 ) . BETWEEN SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS On the 13th we rushed out of the Strait of Messina at a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Scylla ( a rock on the Italian shore ) and passing through Charybdis ( marked on the chart as a whirlpool ) without noticing any disturbance . Passing Stromboli and the Lipari , or Aeolian Islands , we ran into more bad weather in the Tyrrhenian Sea , illuminated at night by plenty of lightning . But the wind providentially held abeam and we made fair time up to the barren 2,116-foot island of Montecristo , where the northwester jumped on us again with its usual violence . With the snow-covered mountains of Corsica in sight to the west , we made a lee under the island of Elba and finally dragged the Pilgrim into Porto Longone , on the east side of Elba , where we anchored in a rattling deluge of the biggest hailstones I ever saw . 262 THE NATIONAL GEO (  | The Pilgrim 's anchors weigh 400 pounds each and it took both of them with 50 fathoms of chain apiece to hold the vessel against the tremendous williwaws that roared out of the harbor . It was desperately cold . We had crossed 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if we were inside the Arctic Circle . Down below , with the galley stove going and plenty of hot buttered rum circulating around the table , we listened to the roaring of the wind and the hailstones rattling around the deck , and the toast , " She 's howling for somebody else tonight , " was never drunk with more enthusiasm . This blow lasted two days . We walked around the barren country where people were gathering sticks for firewood , and also looked over the town . When the northwester let go , we left Porto Longone and found a flat calm and mixed cross sea outside , the Mediterranean alternative to a gale of wind . The Pilgrim weathered bleak Cape Corse , the northern tip of Corsica , on the first night out , and , finally , on March 21 , tied up in a little pool in the inner harbor of Nice . We were more than a month out of Port Said ! The Commander was on the dock and boarded us . The log does not say that we turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Nice we said good-bye to Bill Cutting . Our " lime juice " shipmate had been with us four months and had battled out the desperate weather with unvarying cheerfulness . I doubt that he will ever forget the time he signed on in the " Yankee hell ship " out of Singapore for a winter voyage up the Red Sea and the " sunny Mediterranean . " OFF AGAIN , ON A FRIDAY ! April 20 saw the Pilgrim leaving Cannes ? again it was Friday , despite our previous resolutions bound for the port of . Mahon , in the Balearic Islands . She was manned by the original six , for the Commander had joined his vessel again , to the intense satisfaction of the rest of us . And we had a Siamese cat , which had instantly retired to the depths of the lazaret . A light , fair wind gradually increased and the next night we were driving before another gale from north-northwest , across the notorious Gulf of Lions . Except for the lightning , it was as black as the inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't like it on deck , we could go below and read the Pilot Book : 3RAPHIC MAGAZINE VOL . " Northerly winds prevail at Menorca for two-thirds of the year and at times blow with such force as to carry the spray across the island , covering the ground with a slight coating of salt . " I do n't know if there was salt on Menorca that night , but there was certainly enough of it on the Pilgrim . The next night we reached Menorca and anchored away up in the port of Mahon . This is a very long , narrow arm , winding between high , bold shores , on which various houses sit at the water 's edge . Of course , it is quite well known now , as is Palma on Mallorca , or Majorca , where we stayed several days , enjoying the first real warm sunshine in months . From Palma we beat and steamed and clawed along , wind often dead ahead , once getting close in with the desert coast of Africa , but usually in sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally dropped anchor under the Rock of Gibraltar . After loading stores and seeing " Aussie . the boxing kangaroo , at the theater , we pulled out of Gibraltar with a " black levanter " astern and sailed down to Las Palmas , in the Canary Islands . Here we loaded fuel , which proved a long job . Sailing from Las Palmas on May 25. the Pilgrim had practically nothing but fine weather all the way across the Atlantic . One night , though , I was hit in the mouth by a big flying fish going at a tremendous rate . AN ADDITION TO THE CREW The Siamese cat seemed to take an unduly long time to get her sea legs . As Joe said , " These parlor cats are no good aboard a vessel . A good barroom or alley cat does much better . " On June 6 I was painting my stateroom when the cat , which had not been seen for two days , stalked out of my clothes locker looking strangely slab-sided .

Although the hat had to be discarded , the coat survived , as did the kittens , and we landed them in Boston in good condition .
