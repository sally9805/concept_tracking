Mr.- Hilly asserted yesterday that he . believed that figure ' ought to be cut in ' two , ' and he will present fig ures and other data In support of his contention when he argues the matter - before the Public Service Commission . - Mr , Hilly said it was true that Mayor Walker and he had discussed the possibility of obtaining ' a reduction in the ' valuation of the telephone company 's building in West Street and other real estate in New York City . He disclosed also that the Mayor and he had discussed other possible ' points of attack . " We are considering an attack not alone upon the company 's main building and other real estate , " said Mr. Hilly , " but upon every other phase of the case which is open to attack .

" Hilly to Take Personal Charge . Mr. Hilly said that in presenting the city 's case before the Public Service Commission , he personally would take charge of the case , with A. S. B.

" The commission will go ahead with the hearings in the matter on Friday and Saturday , and the commission already has announced . that it will have its schedule of rates ready within three months . " It was announced yesterday also that manufacturing interests of Brooklyn , organized as the Public Utilities Protective League , would file- a taxpayer 's petition in Special Term , Part 2 , Supreme Court this morning as their first move to fight the telephone rate increase .
