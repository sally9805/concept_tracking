Prime requisite of a fireman is the ability to think fast in an emergency . Last week , the firemen of Boise , Idaho did so . Roused a few minutes after 3 a.m. by a newsboy who had noticed a pile of straw burning in a corral , firemen raced to the scene , found flames licking at a barn belonging to the Myron Jacobs Riding Academy , where swank Boiseans stable their horses . The Riding Academy is 25 ft. outside Boise 's city limits . A city ordinance forbids the fire department to fight fires outside Boise , and firemen injured doing so get no compensation . Boise 's firemen last week promptly decided to take no chances . Instead of trying to put the little fire out , they sat down to watch it . <P> Exact boundary of Boise is the centre of Reserve Street . From engines and a pump wagon , parked on the city 's side of the street , the firemen called out advice to scores of non-professional fire fighters who were doing their best to fight the growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacobs barns were seven saddle horses , valued at from $1,000 to $3,000 each , including a five-gaited , Kentucky-bred stallion named Lady 's Man which was a favorite mount of Senator William E. Borah . Bystanders appealed for axes to help get the horses out . The firemen , aware that insurance on their equipment was void if the equipment was damaged outside Boise , quick-wittedly refused . While the horses burned to death in screeching agony , Boise 's firemen played their hose on a telegraph pole across the street from the fire , to protect it from the flames . <P> When the fire burned out , five barns had burned to the ground . Damages were about $40,000 . Said Boise 's Mayor J. L. Edlefsen : " I fail to see ... what the department could have done . " Said Fire Chief W. E. Foster : " It was as hard for our firemen as anyone else to watch those animals burn to death . "                    @
