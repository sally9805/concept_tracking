At the New York World 's Fair exhibition of " American Art Today " ( TIME , May 15 ) , a belated opening ceremony took place last week . One thing none of the felicitous speakers remarked upon was the fact that , huge as it is , this exhibition does not live up to its title . To do so , it would have to represent not the artists of the U. S. alone but those of all the far-flung Americas . <P> But if Pan-Americanism in the arts lags behind Pan-Americanism in politics there was evidence in Manhattan that it at least exists . Opened at the Riverside Museum was the first sizable exhibition ever held in the U. S. of contemporary art from Latin-American countries . Its somewhat anomalous front man : Secretary of Agriculture Henry Agard Wallace , in his capacity as Chairman of the United States New York World 's Fair Commission . To Henry Wallace 's invitation , nine nations had responded with 343 works of art . <P> For U. S. visitors who went to see the choicest art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pleasant surprise . The disappointment was the Brazilian section , which seemed to have been picked by a myopic bartender and consisted almost exclusively of washed-out imitation of European academicism . That a native art of considerable vigor is budding in Brazil , World 's Fair visitors have already learned from murals in the Brazilian pavilion by Rio de Janeiro 's popular , roly-poly Candido Portinari . There was nothing by him in the show . <P> The pleasant surprise was the Cuban section . Its 40 items included the tenderest painting in the exhibition , a picture of three lost-looking children done in white , grey and sepia by a young artist named Fidelio Ponce de Leon , * and the most effective sculpture , a torqued Figure ( see cut , p. 36 ) by handsome , 27-year-old Rita Longa . Significantly enough , Rita Longa is chief of the Section of Teaching and Art Appreciation in the Department of Culture under the Cuban Ministry of Education . This department was created after the overthrow of President Gerardo ( " Butcher " ) Machado in 1933 and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberal and lively enjoyment of art . <P> From Mexico came minor pictures by the masters , including Jean Chariot , and from Argentina and Chile a number of works lustrous with contemporaneity . Guatemala , Ecuador , Paraguay and the Dominican Republic were represented by curiosities rather than quality , but the whole show was a sidelong stride toward the " intellectual interchange " agreed upon at the Lima Conference . <P> <P> * No kin to the famed fountain-hunter.
