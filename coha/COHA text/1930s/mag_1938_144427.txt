WALT WHITMAN 'S POSE-Esther Shephard-Earcourt , Brace ( $3.75 ) . <P> In his early life Walt Whitman was a conventional poet of modest gifts , a Brooklyn editor , author of a dull temperance novel , a Democrat , a radical . In the Civil War , after years of drifting , he found himself , and for a brief period became the great spokesman for the spirit of radical humanitarianism . But the exact steps of his transformation are not known and even the biographical details of his life are confused , as Whitman apparently intended they should be . <P> Last week Mrs. Esther Shephard ( Paul Bunyan ) advanced a new theory to account for Whitman 's change . She says that he read George Sand 's The Countess of Rudolstadt . The epilogue of that typical romantic novel tells of a seer who dressed in humble clothing , preached the doctrine of man and in his inspired discourse composed " the most magnificent poem that can be conceived . " Deciding to do the same thing in Brooklyn , says Mrs. Shephard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his dress and utterance , a character in a French work of fiction . " But he was always afraid he was going to be found out . So the poor devil spent his time deceiving his friends about the source of his inspiration , carefully neglected to say that he had read The Countess of Rudolstadt ( although to confuse critics he praised George Sand 's other novels ) and hinted at a dreadful secret in his life . <P> To say that this theory leads Mrs. Shephard into difficulties is an understatement : it practically floors her . Pursuing it with the vehement , triumphant air of a gossip on the trail of scandal , she gives pages of evidence that Whitman contradicted himself-which he never denied- pages to show that despite his professions of all-embracing love he had explosions of temper , pages to show that he wrote a lot of nonsense and that his disciples wrote even more . <P> That Whitman might have been inspired by the powerful social movement at the time of the Civil War , that he might , for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Author Shephard will not admit . Says she , the whole thing was a pose , based on a second-rate French novel . As a result , her book is likely to stand as a carefully documented , well worded , 453-page demonstration of its author 's unfortunate inability to understand Whitman , his poems , or his times .
