Little swatches of cloth , in gay colors and designs , reached the U. S. last week from Italy , accompanied by such explanations as : " ' Wooden overcoats ' for live Fascists the rage this season . ' ' Some of the samples resembled wool or flannel , others mercerized cotton . All were specimens of Sniafiocco , a textile made from wood pulp and lately developed by engineers of Italy 's big Snia Viscosa , makers of artificial silk . <P> As in making rayon by the viscose process , cellulose is first reduced to a viscous mass . For Sniafiocco the stuff is passed through a fine-mesh screen ; the threads are coagulated , cut , finished . They are then ready for the spinner . Snia Viscosa loudly protests against labeling Sniafiocco a synthetic or substitute cotton . It is superior to cotton , say the Italians , in that the staple length of its fibre is precisely even and can be given any length wanted by the spinner , and that it is free of dirt and leaves which contaminate raw cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 lire against 5.50 per kilo ) Sniafiocco textiles cost less than cotton cloth ( 3 to 8 lire against 10 to 15 lire per metre ) . Sniafiocco fabrics of varying texture and appearance can be made by admixing small amounts of wool or hemp . <P> Not until last month did Sniafiocco reach Rome 's shopwindows , but for months before that the Snia Viscosa plant was turning it out at an estimated rate of 90,000 lb. per month . Most of this was exported to Germany . Snia Viscosa now looks for a drop in German purchases because Germany has developed an artificial cotton of her own called Vistra . At Vistra , which looks very much like raw cotton , textile men in the U. S. few weeks ago had their first look . <P> Developed by Germany 's great I. G. Farbenindustrie , Vistra is made from wood pulp , has three-fourths the tensile strength of cotton . Vistra fabrics are made with 30% admixture of natural cotton . It is said that they do not wash well . Nevertheless two Vistra plants are running day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> With no silk , no cotton and only 3,500,000 sheep , German efforts to find synthetic textiles are at fever pitch . Rayon production is rigidly protected by import quotas and encouraged by a complex system of rebates to manufacturers . Substitute fabrics , mostly rayons , have been developed to replace woolen and worsted dresses , knitted dresses and full-fashioned silk hosiery . Next problem is men 's suits and overcoats . At a recent chemical congress in Cologne the prophecy was made that suits of zelluloid , zellon and galolith ( artificial wools ) would soon appear , and hats of flirro ( fibre made from Cellophane ) .
