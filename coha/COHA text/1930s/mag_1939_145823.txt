With some angry talk , Adolf Hitler last week launched a boat at Wilhelmshaven . On the previous day , another Hitler got off another boat in Manhattan , and also delivered some angry talk-against his Uncle Adolf . William Patrick Hitler , 28 , arriving in the U. S. for an anti-Hitler lecture tour , explained that he hates his uncle because of 1 ) his policies , 2 ) his attitude toward his own family . <P> In 1909 , Adolf Hitler 's half-brother Alois went to Dublin , got a job as a waiter , married an Irish girl named Bridget Elizabeth Dowling , had a son , two years later deserted wife and child to go back to Germany . Willie grew up to be a good-looking lad with a slight brogue and not much luck . His worst luck , he said last week , was his name . <P> Because of his name , no one would give him a job in Britain . In 1933 , he went to Berlin and applied for work there . Because of his name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him coldly and told him that an adjutant would find him a job . The adjutant found him a poor one , which he declined . During the 1934 blood purge , he was arrested but soon released . This year he received hints that he had better leave Germany . The Fhrer , says Willie Hitler , " is singularly vulnerable on the question of his family relations . " <P> Besides Half-Brother Alois , who now runs a prosperous Berlin caf ( discreetly under his first name ) , Adolf Hitler has a full sister and a half-sister . For a time his half-sister , Angela , served as his housekeeper at Berchtesgaden . His father , also named Alois , was a source of great shame to the Fhrer : he had three wives* and died a drunkard . Furthermore , Father Alois was the illegitimate son of an Austrian peasant girl , Maria Schicklgruber , and a miller named Johann Hiedler , who refused to recognize the child . The boy therefore grew up under his mother 's name , and not until he was 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his patronymic ( which he transmuted to Hitler ) . Had that permission not been granted , Nazis would last week have raised their arms to the speaker at Wilhelmshaven and cried not " Heil Hitler ! ' ' but " Heil Schicklgruber ! " <P> <P> *Of whom the third was Adolf 's mother .
