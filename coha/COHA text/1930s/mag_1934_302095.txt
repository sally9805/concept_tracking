Out of Columbia University , that yeasty pot of progressive ideas , President Roosevelt dipped such potent Brain Trusters as Raymond Moley , Rexford Tugwell , Adolf Augustus Berle Jr . ( see p. 55 ) , Abraham S. Hewitt , Leo Wolman , Blackwell Smith . But Columbia was still left with a good supply of bright young professors who were disgruntled with the old order , passionately dedicated to the new . Last week many of them moved in a body to Cleveland , where the Progressive Education Association and the National Education Association 's Department of Superintendence were convening . There they planted in the educational world the same kind of ideas which their onetime colleagues already have well above ground in Washington . <P> Teachers College 's bald , nervous Clyde R. Miller , reaching Cleveland early , key-noted before the Cleveland Schoolmasters ' Club : " Two percent of the people in the nation control 85% of the wealth and I suspect that if they could sell air they would get a corner on it and let the rest of us suffocate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were : 1 ) Life is worth living . If it is n't we ought to stand the unemployed up and shoot them or let them starve as our financial interests now blandly permit . 2 ) Most people do n't know yet there are enough goods for them to live in comfort . The schools never gave us any notion that with proper organization we could have all we want . 3 ) There must be national control of industry and means of life . <P> Cleveland 's schoolmasters marched out resolved to teach such doctrines to their pupils , and proclaim " the imperative need for a substitution of a planned economy for the present economic anarchy . " <P> Kinetic , young Educational Psychologist Goodwin Watson of Columbia called on teachers and superintendents to unite for the new order in professional unions , the locals of which would be knotted together in a propaganda agency in Manhattan . Warned he : " We have a swell time here wording our dreams of c new society , but when it actually comes to putting them into action that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Sylvester Counts , famed progressive educator , echoed Professor Watson 's call for union and dusted off capitalism for good with : " Teachers must inform the new generation that a new society is here , that the system of private capitalism for private gain is dead . " <P> What his colleagues had done for the economic world , Columbia 's Thomas Henry Briggs did for education . " Sincerity forces me reluctantly to declare , " cried he , " that no inconsiderable part of the money , the genius and the effort expended on secondary and college education is wasted . ... No credits are so frozen as many that are given in high schools and colleges . The facts are a professional scandal . " <P> Philosopher John Dewey , 74 , dean of Columbia progressives , who has spent a lifetime propounding new education ideas , wanted immediate action . " Now if ever , " said he , " is the time for educational change . Today things could be proposed that could not have been a few years ago , and perhaps could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more static .
