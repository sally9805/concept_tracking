The dark closed in , and Will saw only his father 's eyes . It must have been hours . He heard his uncle 's feet coming towards him through many rooms , louder and nearer . His uncle was talking to him long before he opened his eyes . It was all right . Dr. Hart would be ready at four . Joel Simpson would take Will and Uncle Frank and the doctor in his catboat and drop them at Whaleboat on his way to Falmouth . And he would pick the doctor up again when he came back later , around eight , if there were any getting back against this wind tonight . That ought to give the doctor time enough to fix David up . Will 's uncle had a hot supper ready for him , and he made him eat it . Will was n't hungry at all . There was a sound like many bells ringing all through the meal in his head . " You look feverish to me yourself , " Uncle Frank declared . Uncle Frank had dried all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse and buggy and would not hear to Will 's walking to the landing . Dr. Hart was there with his black grip in the dusk , and Joel 's boat was pounding against the piles . Will 's dory had been brought around by someone and was made fast to the boat 's stern . The whole of Menhaden Sound was a wild , dark furrowed field with moving rows of dim and tremendous flowers . The wind was a gale now . The crests of the waves ripped off and camep51at them as they huddled on the wharf . Will never could have made it in from Whaleboat now . The wharf and the whole island behind them shook as if a gigantic organ was playing in under them . They made their way bent double from pier to pier and crawled out one after the other into the crazed catboat . Once they had slipped their cable , they shot out into Menhaden Sound and were a part of the gale and carried along in the heart of it steadily and without much pitching . Joel knew just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wild day was gone except down along the west where there was a jagged fissure of yellow sky . The clouds were massed over it , but their undersides shone like the firelight on a giant kettle 's bottom . Overhead , a few dim stars showed now and then at rifts in the clouds . The wildness of the afterglow got into Will 's mind , until it seemed to him that some kind of a fear had begun he would never get free of . Something tremendouslyfinal and all in all . The wind was so high , there was no saying anything , even in a shout . Uncle Frank was sitting beside Will . The doctor huddled over in the seat at the other side of the boat . Joel had his hands full with the sheet and the tiller . It did n't seem to Will as if his Uncle Frank were there at all . It was like sitting next to a stranger . The dim light from the west was bad . Something was going to happen that would make Will always remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . It was like sitting up in the midst of a fever . It might be that Will did have a fever , as his uncle thought . The wind did not seem to go into him and become a part of his body at all . He was closed up against everything . They came upon Whaleboat in no time almost , in the pitch dark . Joel knew his way along every reef in MenhadenBay by feel . He brought up in the north cove where Will had started out that morning true as a die , and hove to . The three of them , the doctor , Uncle Frank , and Will , got the dory alongside and let themselvesdown into it . Joel shouted through cupped hands that he 'd show a light if he could make Whaleboat on his way back that night . The doctor would be on the lookout for it . Will could row him out . Uncle Frank said he 'd probably be going back , too . They let go of the gunwale of the catboat , and Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crest of a mighty swell . They pulled it up high out of the tide 's way , and left it . Will had found the path and led off . The others came behind him bent over low and using their hands on the bayberry bushes to keep them from poking out their eyes . There was a light in the kitchen window . Will threw open the door and stood there , and the others went by him . He leaned on the doorpost the way he had done in the morning . It seemed years ago . He was tired , away into the center of himself . His mindp53was not clear about anything . It was still lit up by the wild flare of the sunset . His mother came over to Uncle Frank and the doctor . But her eyes were looking as hard as could be at her son . " Oh , Will , I 've been so worried about you ! I thought you 'd be drowned in spite of fate and happenings . How on earth did you ever get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see by your eyes . Come over here by the stove and get yourself right onto the couch . " It was good of you to come , Frank , " she said . Her eyes were lost and wide . She looked at Dr. Hartand then again at Uncle Frank . Her eyes were full oftears , but they did not run over and down on her cheeks . The doctor spoke up : " How 's the boy , Mrs. Prince ? I hope he has n't had too bad a day . " " Oh , Doctor , he 's bad  --  bad ! " " I 'm sorry to hear that , Mrs. Prince . But maybe we can get him onto his feet soon . " Will 's mother 's voice had gone down to a terrible whisper . But Will could hear her . " He 's bad , I tell you . Bad . Ca n't get his breath . Not half a breath . Fighting all day . His father has him propped up . But he ca n't breathe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get him away from the door . Her hands were shaking like leaves . She kept plucking at his coat . " Will , Will , you must lie down on the sofa . "  | Will discovered himself walking across the floor and being absurdly careful of his feet . All the rest of them were moving around the room without making any more noise than if they had been in their stocking feet . Uncle Frank seemed like a cat in a strange garret . The doctor had opened his bag and was setting out instruments and phials . " Whereabouts is the boy ? " Will 's mother was steering Will into the rocker by the stove . As she was doing it , her hands fell upon his hair and slipped down upon his forehead . " Oh , you are burning up , Will . You are burning up with fever ! Did n't I know you 'd be the next one . Doctor ! this boy has a high fever ! " " Probably got chilled rowing over to Menhaden . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all this blow ! I 'll have a look at him after I 've seen the boy that 's so bad . " " But it 's diphtheria , I tell you . " " Maybe . We 'll see . Later on . Where 's the other one ? " The door to the middle room had been closed all this time . Will had kept thinking this was a bad sign . Suddenlyit opened now . A tall man came out quickly into the dim light . His eyes were big with darkness . But that was n't all that was the matter with them . They looked like uncovered coals . His hollow cheeks were covered with dark stubble . His eyes , though , were what Will noticed.  | " This way , Doctor ! " He spoke hoarsely . " Come along quick !  --  You 're late ! " Uncle Frank was staring at the man who used to be his brother . Will 's father had n't glanced his way . Daniel Prince had n't looked Will 's way , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow over Will . Dr. Hart gathered up his things . " Came as soon as I got home , Daniel . I came straight away . Your brother 'll tell you . I guess you ought to be proud of your son . Rowing over like that . " The man never answered a word . He went out of the room quickly . At the door , the doctor turned around and said : " We 'll have to have the light . Lots of light . " Neither grown person stirred . Will tried to spring up . But his mother was bent over him , and her body was in his way . " There ! there ! Will , " she whispered . " Frank will tend to it . " Uncle Frank took up the lamp unsteadily , and followed the doctor out of the room . The kitchen filled up with the deep darkness of the inside of a house . Will could feel his mother 's nearness . Her body almost touching his . He knew it was coming . Her body touched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocker . He had to stay cramped over hard to keep away . The clock on the mantelpiece ticked loud enough to be heard over the ocean 's sound outside . Loud enough to frighten one . The ticking seemed to quicken up . It seemed to be inside Will 's own head . His mother must have felt Will pull away from her . She seemed to be standing up straighter . The idea of a mother 's putting her arms around a man-grown son ! Will felt his stomach tremble . After a while , he realized his mother was crying . He wanted to do something about it . But he could n't do a thing . He wanted to say to her that it was all right about her coming so near to him and wanting to run her hands over his face that way . He did n't hold any hard feelings against her for that . She was upset and worried and half out of her mind . She was n't used to doing such a thing . She had n't put her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all David 's being so sick . That was the trouble . No , it went farther back than that . His father 's taking them out on God-forsaken Whaleboat to live . He remembered the sunlight on the gilt on his great-grandfather 's cap in the picture over on Menhaden . Will felt as if he was crying , too . Down inside himself . The clock ticked away faster and faster . It sounded as though a fever was running away with it . Eaten up by fever . Now Will 's eyes had grown used to the dark , and he could make out the window panes . A star came out in one of the upper ones , but it was blotted out again . Newp57ones appeared below . It might be going to clear off . But the roar of the wind kept up . The wind screamed around the eaves . The whole house shook every now and then . Every so often . It was the heart beating , the big heart in the sea . Beating away , beating away . Regularas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  oh , much slower ! It was cold . But it was full of life . It would be full of life , that heart , after his was stopped for good . He thought of the terrible long kelp ribbons so alive and like snakes , keeping time and ruffling their edges to the beat of the cold heart in the Atlantic . The giant lobsters too big to get into the traps . Big as a man . Alive in every dark feeler of their bodies . Like terrible insects . Living outside of the sun , in the cold and dark . Will had pulled up one once . On the outside of a trap . It covered the whole top . One of its claws could crush in the ribs of a grown man . It had slipped off and gone down again  --  back down into the night of the sea , the night that never lifted . It was still alive down there . So many deep and black fathoms down under the slimy rocks around Whaleboat . The road that went past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To other towns beyondthat , bigger towns , cities . Far away from the sea . Many sons of Menhaden men had gone up along that road and had n't come back . Ever come back . Sons of the Princes had gone . His father 's cousin , the writer , Rupert Prince . He sometimes came to visit Uncle Frank in the Summertime . Who knew but Will himself had the makings of a writer in him ? Uncle Frank had often said he might have . Uncle Frank knew a good deal . About writers . About everything . It must have been the fever . Time went by , and things happened Will could not keep track of . He was trying to say something to smooth down his mother 's mind , and he heard her talking in the middle room . She was talking , the doctor was talking , Uncle Frank was talking . Low . But Will could make out words here and there. "  --  hope . Oh , but the windpipe ! Is n't there any  --  " " A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Will it do any good ? " " Maybe . " " No other way ? " No other way . No other way . That must be something that had to do with David . " But Daniel will never hear to  --  " " He 's got to . There 's no  --  " " You make him see it that way . You go in . " " Will it hurt much ? " " Ca n't be helped . " Now Will 's father was there , too . " Daniel , you 've got to let the doctor do what he thinks best . " Oh , yes . Uncle Frank was there . Will remembered now . The stars were bright all over the windows . They twinkled in the great wind like raindrops on a tree.  | " Has n't he been through enough suffering without slitting his windpipe ? " Every word Will 's father said came to him as clear as a bell . His father seemed to be the only real person in there , in the room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or people talking in dreams . The light showed at a crack under the door . They had shut the door to . Will had only the light of the windy March stars where he was . His feet were in ice , but his head seemed as if it had an August sun beating down on it hard . Everything was strange and confused . Half the time he seemed to be out in the boat still , rowing against the wind . " You want to give your son a chance , do n't you ? " Oh , yes . That was the doctor . Will knew that all along . They had gotten the doctor . " We must go below the membrane that is stopping up his throat . " The doctor 's voice was brisk and hard . " A day ago , I might have done something to stop the membrane from forming . It 's too late now . You should have called me before . There 's nothing else but the throat incision . " " Go ahead then . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may . " " Go ahead . " There were all sorts of sudden footsteps in the next room . Loud commands from the doctor . Chairs pushed back . Something heavy fell . Will sat up wide awake and tense now . He ought to be doing something to help.  |p6o  The door swung open , and light streamed in . Somebodycame out and went to the water pail in the sink . The sudden light made it impossible for Will to tell who it was . There were sounds of water running . He half got up . " You sit still , Will . I will take care of it . It will be all right . You stay right where you are and rest . " It was Uncle Frank . He soothed Will all over , being there in the dimly lighted kitchen . Just his being there . Will sank back and felt his weariness flowing out of him . Down from his forehead , down from his arms , down along his thighs . It was very fine , feeling like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . First it was ripples of sunlight coming out between racing clouds . Then it was a high evening sky full of clouds like millions of thin sea shells strewn over a beach . It was quiet . Not a breath of wind . It was a little strip of meadow he knew between dark fir thickets , and tiny cool bluets sprinkled over every inch of the sod . It was a high hill covered with new snow , sparkling in the sun , and seagulls drifting over it as though pieces of snow had broken off the hill into the sky . It was a day without a cloud . It was Summer , and oxheart daisies blazing all around . But a wind was somewhere . A wind was coming up . He heard it in under the cliffs . Perhaps it was going to come from a cavern somewhere . And clouds began to come out from under the cliffs . He saw them coming . The sun was suddenly gone completely . The dark settled down like a fine rain from the clouds.  |p61The  sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It beat on him like a heartbeat . His father was trying to light a lamp in the dark . But a lamp could not live in such a gale . He could not make his father understand . It was no use . His father kept calling out for the light . The wind came and went , came and went . Came and went , came and went . It was a rocking chair close to him , going back and forth in the dark . After a minute of puzzling , Will knew it was his mother . She was making a crying sound now and then , regular and low . " Mother , what 's happened ? " The woman spoke to Will as if she were counting rows in her knitting . Will never had heard her speak in a tone of voice like that . " He is dying , Will . Your brother is dying . The doctor said he would die , when he went . He will not live to see the morning . He has n't a chance to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was astounded to hear his own voice speaking in the same flat monotone as his mother 's : " Did you say the doctor 's gone ? " " Yes . " " How long ago did he go ? " " Four hours . Yes , all of four hours ago . " " Have I been asleep ? " " Yes , you have been asleep . You 've slept a long time . " " Why did n't you call me ? "  | " You needed your rest . I did not want to disturb you . It was best for you . There was n't anything you could do . " " Has Uncle Frank gone ? " " No . He 's in the other room on the sofa . He fell asleep , too . He is sleeping now . I will not wake him up till your brother dies . " Will 's tongue was dry at its roots . " Why do n't we try to do something ? " " There is nothing we can do . " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your father is in there , and he does n't want me or you in the room . He told me so . He wants to be along with David when he dies . " " But I ought to go . " " He will not let you or me or your uncle come into the room . You know what your father is . " Hot drops began to form in the corners of Will 's eyes . He closed his lids to and felt them flow out and scald his eyelashes . He knew his mother was right . He knew he could not go into the room where his father was with David . He knew his father 's arm was under David 's neck and his cheek resting on David 's . He knew he had no right to go in there with his father sitting like that . And with David like that . The woman had gone on rocking all the time she wasspeaking to Will . She never slackened her steady pace . The lamp flickered uneasily on the table . It wasturned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inp63through the cracks in the house disturbed it . It was just a narrow cut of yellow light in the lamp tube . And yet it wavered . Will became aware of the sound of the wind outside the house . He had taken it for the sound of his mother 's rocking at first . The wind was still blowing a gale . The two of them sat there for an hour . It seemed all of that . The woman swaying forward and back , Will still . The wind seemed to be rising . The boom of the surf made the panes rattle , and the floor vibrated in vast chords of sound . " I will stand by you until the morning , I have come to save you , do not fear ! " Will heard his father 's voice burst out singing all at once , clear as a bell , firm and steady . It rose over the chords of the lonesome waves and the trembling floor boards and the creaking of the walls . It came out of the front room and spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Will 's father had not sung a hymn tune for years . Not since Will was a little boy . One time his father had sung him asleep by that same hymn he was singing to David now . It was a hymn about a great storm at night , and the Saviour coming suddenly to stand by a lonely man who was afraid . Until the morning . His father did not stop when he got to the end of the hymn . He began right over again as clear and loud as ever . " Fierce and wild the storm is raging .... " Will 's mother had stopped rocking at the first note . It started when she was bent forward for the next sweep . She remained bent forward just where she was , perfectlystill . In the next room , the unusual sound had wakened Uncle Frank . Will heard the sofa creak . Uncle Frank must be sitting up listening , too . And Will 's tears dried from his eyes . Dried all away . He felt a thing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never known so lovely a feeling for years and years . That was the song his father had sung him . It was his song . It was his song then as much as it was David 's song now . It meant that his father had loved him once the same way he loved David . " It is coming ! " Will 's mother 's whisper filled the kitchen . " I tell you , it is coming ! " It was Will 's song . He was glad David could hear it being sung so steadily and beautifully above the sound of the gale . His father had the sweetest and strongest voice he had ever heard . Will had forgotten how fine it was , these past few years . " I tell you , he 's dying now . That 's the sign ! " Will thought of how he had loved to sit on his father 's knee as a small boy . He thought how it felt top65be a small boy and have a strong chest like his father 's to lean on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The song came from deep inside of his father 's body . Deep down inside him , in those years long ago . It was deep down inside of him now . It came out and filled the whole house , and it went out and drowned out the wind . It was out in the night . But it was inside his father 's body , too . " Oh , poor David , my poor baby !  --  He is dying , Will . I can tell by the sound of your father 's voice . " Will 's mother put her head down on her knees and sobbed . But Will sat up straight with shining eyes and felt happiness flooding over and over his body . The singing went on and on . His mother tired herself out at last , and fell silent with her head still there in her apron . The man 's voice rolled on . Perhaps Will 's mother was asleep . Will 's father must have sung the same hymn over for more than an hour . Yet his voice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrant as it ever was . Will knew now that his mother had not been asleep at all . He knew she was listening . He knew Uncle Frank in the next room was listening . David was listening . Everybody in the whole house was listening . His father was singing for them all . Weariness and fever were all gone out of Will . He felt every muscle in his body tingling full of life . It might be , this was the turning point of everything . He would never forget this as long as he lived . He wouldp66remember what his father had done this night in the gale . He wished he could go in and put his two arms around his father 's knees and hide his face upon his father 's feet . Will could see the gray hairs in his mother 's head . He had never noticed there were so many of them . Odd to see them in the dim lamplight . Then he noticed what he had not noticed before , he had been listening so hard to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gradually turned his eyes towards the window . The sashes were dark now , and the panes were the parts of the window that were lighter . He sat there and watched them grow still lighter as he looked . He glanced down suddenly and was surprised to see his own hand lying on his knee . He could make out the pitcher on the back of the table . The knife-cut of fire in the lamp could no longer be seen . The kitchen filled up with the coming day . The sky outside had flying clouds on it , of different shades of gray . The man was still singing in the parlor . The clouds moved apart . A rift of pale , yellow sky ran along the window . The man was still singing . It was broad daylight . The sun must be nearly ready to come up . It might be going to be a fair day , for all the wind . In March , the weather was like that . Without a sign of warning , the song came to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say a word . His mother did not say ap67word . But they both got up with one motion and moved straight as if pulled by an unseen cord towards the door . Uncle Frank was on his feet and moving as they were . They all went towards the parlor door . Uncle Frank , Will 's mother , and Will . One behind the other . Their faces had no expression in them . It was Uncle Frank who swung back the door . He stood with his hand on it to let the woman pass through , and Will after her . It was just as though they were going into church . Uncle Frank came in after they were in . It was only after they all were in that they turned to look towards the bed . The clouds had broken all away in the east . The sun was coming up out of the ocean , huge and round as a globe of crystal full of fire . Lovely , golden fire . The light of it came towards them in the little house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stairway of gold . The faint light of it washed in through the window and sent throbbing rays of color like the fire in burning coals over the bed and the man there . Will 's father had his back to the sun . The light washed over his wide shoulders and his dark hair . He was trying to get the length of his arm under the form on the pillow . They all heard what David said , even though it was only a whisper . " I Told me up to the sun , Father . Hold me up . " The man had David in his arms and lifted him bodilyp68out of the bed . He swung slowly around . It was just as if David were a very small boy and easy to carry . They all could see the man 's face then , and David 's face , too . Both faces were as quiet as people 's faces are when they wake up out of a sound night 's sleep . They were full of sunshine , and they looked as peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people in the room no more than nothing at all . He held up the boy as big as himself and gazed steadily and unblinking into the sun . And the boy looked at the sun , too , with wide-open eyes and not a tremble in them . The two looked into the sun . And as they looked , the young head leaned more and more upon the man 's shoulder . Leaned closer and closer as he died . Will 's father did not put his first-born son down for a long time . Even though he knew he had died . He stood there , utterly unaware of his brother , his wife , and his younger son , holding his son 's body . His dry and beautiful eyes looked at the rising sun . Will knew his father would never have looked like that if it had been himself in David 's place . His father looked good to Will . Good as God.  |p69THE  SUN WAS sweeping over Menhaden like a flood tide . Long shafts of light marched across the hills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and barns on the skyline and turned them into heaps of sugar crystals . Dark fir woods suddenly became fringes of deep gold , and a dark cove with gray boats in it turned into a box full of bright beads . One vast ray came down far out on the sea and made a lighthousethere a white Easter lily . The wind came up from the long bays and poured over four people as they came down the highest hill of Menhaden towards the big house with the cupola below . They had to bend their faces down against the wind . It was so windy and bright an afternoon , they had to keep their heads down . They walked single file , for the path that wound be-t ween the bayberry bushes was a sheep track and hardly wide enough for one person . A man , a tall boy , anotherman , and a woman last . They were walking fast . A few other men and women were going down the same hill , but in another direction , towards the houses huddled together away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill a beam of sunlight picked out it long row of white stones . A single man was still there . He was busy with a long thing in his hands , like a spear . He was thrusting it into the ground , and the sunlight made it seem as though it was made of glass or silver . A man with a glass spear . The two sets of people went down the gray hill , fartherapart every step they took . The sunlight , somehow , never got down to them . They walked all the time in a shadow . They might never come together again , upon that hill , these particular men and women . Uncle Frank led off , Will came behind , and behind him his father walked ten paces ahead of Will 's mother . They probably would not come together in that order again , either , on that hill . They had to watch where to set their feet , for there were places where the frost had heaved the earth up and left the holes where the stones had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say anything , they were all too far apart , and the wind was too strong . They did n't seem to have anything to say , anyway . Uncle Frank had done everything . He had even found a collar and necktie  --  the kind all in one piece  --  for Will 's father . He was wearing it now . It had belonged to people who had finished walking on Menhadenmany years ago . But nobody on the hilltop had noticed that . Uncle Frank had even arranged to have some flowers sent down from town . They were stuck into a wire frame to make it look like a pillow . It would have been a hard thing to lean your head on , Will thought . The roses had scented up the whole house . Rp71Will imagined he could smell their scent on his clothes still , even in all the wind . A mass of clouds built itself up higher than the hill , whiter , where the sun touched the clouds , than seagulls ' wings . The bare bayberries hummed in the wind like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sun came around the hill below , and the Prince house stood out sharply against the water of the bay that climbed steeply uphill to the ocean 's rim . The four people were under the hill now . Uncle Drank had crossed the road and was going up under t he elms . Will was across the road . The wind was still high on the hill . But down here it was almost quiet . Will felt , somehow , his father had stopped . He stopped , too , and turned around . The man was waiting for the woman to come up to him . He began to speak in a toneless voice . It was the first time he had spoken all the live-long day . " We will be going back to Whaleboat right away . You get your things ready , and I will take them down to the dory . " Will 's mother did not look at her husband , and did of answer for a moment . She did not stop when she me abreast of her husband . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the quiet way it had cn all the way up the hill and down . " I am not going back to Whaleboat , Daniel . Not . " She kept on speaking quietly as she walked away in Will 's father towards Will . " Your stubbornnessp72has done harm enough . I am not going to put up with it any more . This would n't have happened if you had n't dragged your family out to Whaleboat . Dragged your son out where there was no doctor to save him . You are foolish to think of going back to Whaleboat . If you go , you will go alone . " Will felt the blood ebb out of his head , and his head felt light , as he heard what his mother said . She had never stood up to his father like this before . Not even in those black nights when he heard his father accuse his mother on the other side of the wall . The boy felt hope piercing into him like one of the beams of sunlight that were cutting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The leaf had been turned over at last . The light of the sun passed on then , and he waited for the wrath of his father to burst out . His father never so much as raised or quickened or changed his flat voice : " You will come back with me where you belong , or you and I are through for good , and you can go and earn your own board and do as you please . That 's all f have to say . " Both of them had started to walk towards the house . Will let them go past him . Neither one of them looked his way . It was just as though he was n't there . Will knew then that they had all come to the end of one part of their lives . The end of it was up there high against the clouds . Where the lone man was using hisp73glass spear on the earth at the hill 's top . They had reached the ending of that part quietly . He knew without any thinking at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lonely spruce forests with the gulls sweeping over them low . He knew that he might lie awake at night for hours , and there would not be any more blind and ugly suspicions put into ugly words for him to hear . And Will knew his father would go back to the thin-walled house that the surf snowed over and would not change at all . He would not lie under the Prince roof another night . He would never change . Except he would not ever walk again with the old spring in his stride and the light he used to have in his eyes . The light that made Will love him most of anything on earth . That light was left for good up there where the unspeakably white , high clouds toweredon the hill . It would never be inside his father again . Will knew exactly what his father would do and his mother would do . He did not know at all what was to become of him . That was the only thing he could not see ahead . He would give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have the books to read he had always wanted to read . Have a chance to go to school again , after four years without any . Make something out of himself , and not have to go on being a fisherman . But he knew he would get into the dory in a few minutes , without a single word , if his father so much as gave him a sign he wanted him to go with him . In David's place . Even in a place much smaller than David 's . In any place at all , so long as it was beside his father . It was for his father to decide . His father had not looked at him as he passed close enough to touch him just now . Perhaps he had includedhim with his mother when he had said , " You will come back with me where you belong , or you and I are through . " Will went slowly towards the house . The sun was still upon it full . The shadows of the bare elms with all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace . The house took Will 's breath . It meant everything to Will , except the one thing which his father meant . He had dared to dream that the two finest things he knew of could come together somehow . Now he knew they never would . If he lost one , though , he might still have the other . There was a gilded arrow on the cupola . It swam there like a secret fish which had swum through his dreams at night . It pointed away from the sea . Towardsfair weather . Towards the hill and to the land beyond . There was no one in the big parlor . Will could hear Uncle Frank in the kitchen , talking to the woman who had come in to cook up things for the day . He could hear a man walking about overhead , back and forth . He sat down on the edge of an armchair and listened to the footfalls . He did n't look at a thing in the room . Not even the globe with the pencil lines on it or **25;2841;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch beyond his right foot . He wondered how things would come out with the brothers , his father and Uncle Frank . How they would separate in a few minutes ' time . The footsteps grew louder , both sets  --  along the passage from the kitchen , down the back stairs . The men were coming together . Perhaps they had already settledit . They came in by two different doors at the same time . It was just as if somebody good at planning had planned it all to the second . His father had put his gray flannel shirt back on in place of the white one he had borrowed from Frank . And the tie was gone . He had his canvas jacket on , too , and his high boots . " Why , you are n't thinking of going before you 've had a bite , are you , Dan ? " " Yes , Frank . I guess I 'd better be getting along home . " " You 'd better stay , Dan . Your wife is worn out . She needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's plenty grub for her at home , if she wants it . " Will knew his father had not spoken a word to uncle Frank . " But I expected you 'd stay for the night , at least . ' You 've all been through too much for the last week to hurry back there to that God-forsaken place . The fireill be out . It will be cold as a barn . I should think you 'd never want to lay eyes on that house for a good , long  --  " Uncle Frank never had a chance to finish what he was saying . Something in the way Will 's father looked at him stopped him short . The older brother walked across the room with never so much as a glance at his son . At the door , he turned his head sidewise . " Goodbye , Frank . I expect I will be seeing you sometime before long . I 'm ever so much obliged for all you 've done . And thanks for lending me the shirt . " The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank 's face slowly went red and white and then red again . He did n't say anything to Will . He went over to the mantel and lit his pipe from one of the matches there . His hand trembled ever so slightly as he held the flame over the bowl . But when he turned around to Will , his voice was steady as a bugle : " Well , Will . Ready for something to eat ? " He had not asked about Will 's mother or anything . There was nobody in the world as good as Uncle Frank . Will had to moisten his lips . " I do n't know . I think I  --  I 'd better see if father should  --  should want me  --  if father expects me to go with him . " The boy got upon his feet somehow . He looked around for his cap . " All right , Will . " No one in the world like Uncle Frank . He knew inp77an instant all about it . All about the end that two of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know anything certain about what the end for him was to be . Will could not find his cap anywhere . He turned towards the door without it . It might be it was goodbye to his uncle for a long time . But he did n't say a word about any such goodbye . As he swung open the door , he heard his mother coming down the front stairs . He went along the carpeted hall . The footsteps suddenly stopped halfway down the staircase . But Will did not stop , did not lift his eyes from the floor . Ile knew just how his mother looked standing there expecting him to speak . He went straight on to the front door , took hold of the glass knob , opened the door , and went out , closing it carefully behind him . Ile must have run all the way down the hill . He did not remember doing it , though . His father was just shoving the dory 's bow end into the water . " Father ! " For some reason , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might have run down the whole way and spoken to his father close to . But he id n't do it . The man paused just as he was lifting his other leg vcr the gunwale . He looked around at his son . He lookcd ten years older than he had looked up at thehouse a few minutes ago . It might have been the light , f partly , and the wind that had shagged up his hair and eyebrows and moustache , but Will had never seen his father look so much like an old , old man . Will felt the blood ebbing away from his heart . The old man 's eyes were the only bright thing about him . They burned steadily on him . He did not say anything for a long time . It seemed a long time . The boy knew what kind of an end it was going to be for him now . He did not need to wait any longer . He had already thought about turning around , away from his father , as he heard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . " That was all . Those six words were all there were . But each was like a stroke of a rawhide on Will 's shoulders . They killed out any words he could have said . Speech after speech was killed out by each stroke . Will stumbled away among the dead thistles and wreckage of old rockweed . He wondered how the thistles had lasted through snow and sleet and wind all Winter long . He noticed the pale blue mussel shells dried out by the day 's sun . He noticed how all the littletunnels the field mice had made were laid bare by the melting snow . At the top of the rise , Will sat down on the sodden dead grass . He rested his chin on his hands and put his elbows on his drawn-up knees . He did not look anywherefor some time . When he lifted his eyes to the bay at last , his father 's dory was only a small dot , not much bigger than a lobster buoy , far out towards the skyline.  |p79He  had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His . mind went on saying it now . His father was still there , to his mind , one foot in the dory and one still on the beach . Will was holding him there by what he was sayingsilently . His father was answering him , but Will was answering all his replies . For the first time in their lives the two of them were speaking without hiding any part of their thoughts . Blunt and plain and sharp as knives . And Will was winning . He was persuading him to take him along with him to Whaleboat . To let him live with him and take David 's place . Maybe out there , too , Will would be able to argue with his father until 1 he brought him back to Menhaden and to the house he needed to live in . Will heard his words as clear as any-thing : I want to go with you , Father . I know you have n't ever taken to me the way you took to David . But Davidis gone now . And you need somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my way , not David'sy . You do n't know , but I have . You do n't know I  --  m like you , but I am . I have a right to go with you . I have no use for you . You and your mooning mind . You and your wild flowers you moped over and sat looking at like a girl . You and your staying by yourself in the woods ! That was the way I was made . I could n't help it . I do n't want you around . Talking soft like a girl . Watching me when you thought I was n't looking . Seeinghow I was made and how I acted like a man . And then creeping away by yourself and thinking about it and making me act out what you did n't dare to act out or say in the open . Secret and nasty-minded !  --  Oh , I know ! I 've watched you . I know . I only did that because you did not tell me about what it was like , being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to guess . I did that because you put such thoughts in me . With what you said to my mother . I did not want to go off by myself , away from you and David . You always drove me . What I said to your mother !  --  What right had you to hear that ?  --  I was always afraid of you . I knew you knew there was something between your mother and me . I was afraid of what you knew . I was always afraid of you . You had no need to be afraid . I could not help hearingwhat you said in that little house out there with its thin walls . I tried to go to sleep . I put my hands over my ears . But I heard just the same . I heard it all . But I did not hold it against you . I really loved you more , I think now . I pitied you for being wrong .

Take me with you !  |p81You  would have a better life with your mother . You are more like her . No , I am not . I am more like you . You do not see it , but I am . Like the side of you at night  --  like you talking in the room out there with my mother . David was like you in the daytime , when you were n't thinking  --  when you were busy .

The sky over Will and around him Was already darkening for night . When he got to the house , the hallway was full of fight . He went into the lamplit room . Uncle Frank Was there , and he did not say a word about Will'sther . His mother was not there . She had gone to bed , is uncle told him . She 'd had a hard day and needed agood rest . She 'd left a plate of food on the kitchen table  --  r him , Uncle Frank said , in case he came back . Unclerank thought it was time for him to turn in , too . Heid good night and went off upstairs . Will could put out the light . The boy sat there quiet in the still house for nearly an hour without moving . She had known all along that he would come back !  |p82IT  TOOK TIME to get on to living in a large house on a main road again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was hard to get on to after camping out so many years . They could n't have done it if Uncle Frank had not been there . He went ahead natural as could be , as if nothing had happened . Just as if they had all lived there with him all the time . He never asked any questions . It seemed as though he had arranged the whole business and had the rooms for Will and his mother all ready . And it was n't as though it were going to be a long visit . Everything seemed permanent . Soap enough in to last for a year beside the high , old-fashioned bath tub that you had to carry the water upstairs for from the kitchen . Tea and coffee and saleratus and cream of tartar enough for a family of ten . Potatoes appeared in the cellar overnight . And a receptacle for waste in the shed . It was n't as if Uncle Frank had been a manhousekeeper . There were a lot of men-housekeepers on Menhaden . Many men of Uncle Frank 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason or other . There were good reasons enough . Not money enough coming in as it used to come in the old days of sail . Not so many likely-looking girls any more , of the old ship/families . There were reasons . Many of these bachelors kept big places with twelve rooms , and a fireplace in each one or an airtight . Kept their big houses as shipshapeand clean as a whistle . Even washed the winlowsevery Spring . Very fussy , in their housekeeping ways . Got more so as they got grayer . But Uncle Frank was n't one of that sort . He 'd lived out in the ell , mostly . Closed the front rooms up , ex  --  pt when callers came . Used only the office and onefront room . He 'd been rather happy-go-lucky about . me things till Will 's mother came over from Whaleboat to live in her part of her husband 's place .

He even wanted to keeprs . Snow on , after the funeral , in the kitchen , to cleanand cook . But Mrs. Prince would n't hear to that . She id she liked having things to do , to take up her mind . - he established herself in the kitchen , and grew to be at some there . And she opened up all the rooms at the ont . She was at home in them , too . She began at the top shelves in the kitchen . And she washed to the bottom . Then she began on the top elves in the dining room , in the two china cupboards . here were dishes there which had a hundred years ' dust on them . Teapots made like urns , with red vineleaves on them . A white egg-dish with a hen on its cover and eggs around it . Glassware that looked likep84window panes etched with January frost . Little glass dishes which she had no idea what to use for . Goblets that rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fingernail . She washed everything and polishedeverything till it glittered . She cut new paper lacework to go on all the shelves . Fringed with scallopslike the yellowed ones she took down . She had the knack . She found an old receipt-book with dishes she had never heard tell of before . She tried some of them out on Uncle Frank and Will . Her hands were still slenderhands , and they revelled in the feel of the velvety old china and glass . She took to handling the Prince china as if she had always handled it . It was the kind of house she belonged in . She was entirely at home . One morning Will heard his mother singing as she went back and forth in the rooms . It struck him that he had n't heard her sing that way for a number of years . Uncle Frank went out of his way to show how much he liked having Mrs. Prince there . Not in so many words . Not directly . But in quiet , small things he said and did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a necessity , for that greatunclehad a moustache that could have been looped around his ears . It was a burden to his wife , but it was the pride of Uncle Ebenezer and all the males of Menhaden . The cup appeared by Uncle Frank 's plate one morning , and it stayed there . Though , of course , Uncle Frank was not setting himself up as any rival to Ebe/nezer ! The story of how the forget-me-nots came tobe there on the sides of the cup . It was the favoriteflower of Ebenezer 's wife  --  his first one , that was . Pearlina . She had carried a bunch of the flowers on herwedding day . It was the only wedding day of severalhe 'd had that Eben ever recalled . He got it mixed upwith the wedding day of a later wife , and caused somerumpus or other . But that was when he was an old , oldman . Forget-me-nots had been planted on Pearlina'sgrave. , too . Her husband used to climb way up to thetop of the hill with a watering-pot every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the signs ofSpring on Menhaden . Went up there with the waterg-poteven after he had married his fourth wife . Theforget-me-not wife was a rather large woman to have soall a favorite flower . She was all of twice the heftand size of her husband . His moustache was the onlybigthing on him . Armchairs had to be built especially for her . There was still one in the attic . There hadbeen only one trouble with her . She had never  --  as herhusband put it  --  calved . It was a by-word in the family . The woman who never calved . Usually the Princesdid not use barn language when they spoke of theirwomen folks . Uncle Ebenezer 's other three wives hadmade up for the first . They had calved frequently . Funny a small man could have so many big sons . Younever could tell , the people on Menhaden used to say , though , from the looks of a cat , how far he couldjump.  | These little memories made up a home . Frank 's brother was n't there to tell about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a marvellous story teller . There were the silver spoons that had separated two Prince brothers for life . Each wanted them . Thin as thin paper . But Uncle Frank never went on with the story behind them . He flushed and changed the subject quickly . There was the cradle which had rocked twenty Prince babies to sleep . The rockers had worn down flat . And the cubby-hole where Joel Prince had kept his spirits after his wife had gotten him to sign the pledge not to touch spirituous liquors . It had been made for the family powder-magazine , first , in the old Indian days , when a man was worried about keeping his hair on his head where it belonged . Perhaps that was why Joel had chosen it . You 'd never think , to see the place , there was a piece of the flowered wall paper which came right off in a little door . The big shell with the crimson lip had been one of the few things Captain Robert Prince had saved from the ill-starred Robert Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bad luck . It was on the mantel when James Prince 's shawl had caught afire and burned him so he died from it . He must have breathed in the flames . He had a great beard , and that caught , too . The shell ought by rights to go up to the attic . Unclep87Frank smiled , to show how little he really believed in such stories . No stock to be taken in such tales ! The melodeon came from Germany . Frank 's Great-t uncle Elisha carried it by horseback in three pieces from Munich to Amsterdam , and then on his own barkentinehome to Menhaden . One of the pedals had been lost . But the great-uncle hammered out another one on his anvil . Nobody had ever been able to tell which was which . He was a clever man with tools . All the Princes had been . They did all their own ironwork on their ships , to have it the way they wanted it . So 's to have it right . There was a story that went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine Yankee frigate riding the roads and a fine Yankee sea captain with side-burns sitting ine stern sheets of his gig and ten spick-and-span , can-shaven Yankee seamen manning the oars . You ould see a steam train and an engine with a smoke tack shaped like a molasses funnel over there on the arbor front . One of the first steam engines in captiv-ty ! The story was of how John Prince bought that print  --  r a Menhaden girl who married another man while e was on that very trip and having his wedding china ade for him in Delft . John had never allowed theprint to be hung on his walls . His son unearthed it . m his sea-chest , after he died . The son thought it s a great joke . But the Princes were n't the kind of en who often lost their betrothed when they were over on the other side of the earth . John had been an angry man , whenever the Orrs were mentioned , right up to the grave . Would curse and call them landcaptainsand horse thieves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke of it was , his son used to say , that he himself would n't have been here in the house at all , to laugh and tell about the picture , if his father 's intended had n't gone and got married to an Orr behind his back . The son who would have been here would have been half horse thief . Well , the people who had owned these keepsakes and treasures were up on the hill now , and their things were down here . Somehow or other , it seemed the right thing to have a graveyard on a hill . High above every house on Menhaden . That was what Will thought . The right thing for people like the Princes . It was kind of hard for Will 's mother at the beginningbecause of the neighbors . Folks on Menhaden wondered just how long a stay Mrs. Prince was making . They asked her about her husband . At first . After a while , they did n't any more . Nobody ever asked UncleFrank more than once about his brother 's plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island of Menhaden . He did n't say much , either . Folks agreed that David 's death must have opened Mrs. Prince 's eyes to the foolishness of living so far from neighbors and doctors . They liked to hint at otherp89things , among themselves . But there were too many odd family arrangements on the island for one pot 's calling another pot black . Lots of married people lived in the same house all right , but you 'd never know they were anything but second cousins from the way they went about it . Daniel Prince could do more where he was . The lobsters were much thicker out around Whaleboat . A man could make a lot more money with his traps out there in bold water than he could monkeyingaround the ledges of Menhaden . The big lobsters were farther out to sea . Oh , things would probably come out all right . Come out all right in the wash ! Funny , though , for a man who kept such a close eye on his wife as Dan Prince always had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , everybody knew Dan prince was as jealous a husband as they made them. or no reason , too . But then , that was the way with most jealous men . Oh , things would come out all right . Everythingould blow over in time . Everything always did. very family had its squalls . And cranky husbands and Wives . Of course , Frank Prince was Dan Prince 's brother . ' All the same , he was a man and built like other men . And it was n't the same as if Louise Prince was any relationof his  --  any blood relation . Such things had been known to happen . In the best families ! The Princes . Butter would n't melt in their mouths . They were the White hen 's chickens . But human nature was human na- ture . And every closet had its skeleton . It might pay Dan Prince to fish for lobsters nearer home . Things were bound to come out all right in the end . They always did . Kiss , and make up . Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel Prince did not come over to Menhaden duringApril or May or June . He had taken to landing and marketing his lobsters farther up the bay , on BombazeenIsland . Money matters were the most awkward part of the business at the Prince house , at first . Mrs. Prince had her few small nest eggs she had put by . From her hens and from the crabmeat she had picked out for years . She had thought to bring along all her bank books with her when she came over for the funeral . But the nest eggs were soon all gone . She did not want to be beholden to her brother-inlaw . Not for anything . Uncle Frank had been as near being angry as he ever got when she insisted on buying things for the house . She was running the house , he told her , and that was more than her share . That meant more than the cost of her victuals , and Will 's . But she said No . She was bound to pay her fair share . She paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When her savings were all gone , she went to Frank and told him that she was going to insist on paying him back as soon as she could save the money . There would be ways of her saving money , in the Summer . Oh , lotsp91of ways for a woman that was at all smart and knew how to cook . The Summer people could be depended on . Menhaden had lots of Summer people . Most of the eastern side of the island was covered with cottages . Cottages even in the deepest spruce woods , though why people wanted to live like Indians in the shade that way was more than the natives of Menhaden knew . People did n't use to live like that . Or go half naked and tan themselves up like Indians . Will 's mother had a little account book hung up in the kitchen . She itemized the cost of everything they bought , found what was two-thirds , and set the figure down , and kept it all straight . Uncle Frank wanted to burn the little book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought up in the same code . He knew the rules . Uncle Frank was as set in his ways as any of the unmarriedmen in the large Menhaden houses . And there were lots of them . But he did n't have any trouble gettingused to having three under his roof instead of one . It was n't as if he had to give up much of anything. he newcomers were his own people and his own kind . They knew how to keep quiet for a whole evening at s time . There was no useless talking to do . They all had rooms of their own upstairs . They had many other rooms , too , in their different kinds of pride and sadness . They knew how to go into those rooms by themselves and keep the doors closed tight . There were two . rsons nobody ever mentioned the name of . One was p on the hill in the bright sun and wind that swept Menhaden . The other was going his lonely rounds of lobster traps by the mile-long waves that curled up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , month after month . Two of the people in the Prince house had every appearance of being contented and happy . It seemed as if they had lived under the high cupola together for half a hundred years . Will 's mother had changed in a number of ways . She never got excited or spoke in the thin and flat , tired voice as Will remembered she so often had , when they lived on Whaleboat and she had had cheap dishes and tin cups to wash up and a small kitchen to do it in . She did not seem to be so dragged out when night came around . She seemed ten years younger . She was different towards Will , too . That was the thing Will noticed most . Since that terrible minute that afternoon when he went by her in the front hall without looking at her , to overtake his father and see if he could n't go with him  --  since then , she had not attempted to mother him , or come very near him any more . It seemed as though another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will felt sorry , in some ways . But in many other ways he was very glad of it . He liked his mother ten times better this way . Will had taken many days to get over the last few hours on Whaleboat . He woke up in his sleep often , because he was afraid of some of his dreams . When hisp93eyes were closed , every feature of the house and the island stood out with tremendous clearness in his memory . The dingy , blue flowers in the kitchen wall paper , the geranium boxes full of half-dead , yellowed plants his mother had tried to keep alive out there . The flowersthat came up in the Spring around all the little runletsof clear spring water . They were n't all drab memories . Every bluet and anemone there always seemed to have sparkles of light on them . He saw the white violets starring the mossy sod . He could almost smell their piercing fragrance where his feet had brushed them . And of course the breakers that came up dark , turned apple-green in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile of thunder and coolness . But it was the evil , deep look of the sea , when he looked down into it under the kelpy ledges , that made him afraid of what he saw in his sleep . There were many things on Whaleboat , he discovered in puzzled surprise , which he missed . One was the taste of the water from the boiling spring . Another was the feeling of evening coming up cool on every side from the sea , the minute the sun got down low in the west . The warmth of the great hill above the house here on Menhaden bothered him a little after the nights began to become Springlike . He missed the sound in the Whaleboat spruces even when there was hardly a breath of wind . It would have been better with him , Will thought , if he could have gone to school at once . But there wasp94a lot of work to be done before he could do that . UncleFrank had taken him to see some of the teachers in the Menhaden school . The year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be advisable for the boy to take some books out and do some work by himself , towards next Fall . Uncle Frank was willing and glad to help him get his bearings . He set aside an hour every evening and helped Will with sums and spelling and grammar . He was n't a very skilful teacher . And he was apt to get off on a tack that took them miles off their course . But it was pleasant for Will , having that hour to fill in with in the long evenings . They used the office at the west side of the house . Where the old Princes had kept their log-books and hull models for ships . It was soon light enough so they did not need to light up the lamp . The windows they sat by faced the sunset . The afterglowcame in upon them like a strange dawn . It made Uncle Frank 's ragged moustache and bushy eyebrows into golden wire . It made his face like a bronze and beautiful mask . What he was saying did not matter , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Will felt when the hum of bees made him feel good , when it was getting late and the dew beginning to fall , and the bees going home heavy with honey in the sleepy air . It was wonderful just to be in a house like the Prince house then . The old convex mirror over the mantel shone with the twin fires of the two western windows.  |p95And  all the room reflected in it swam with golden dust . The pictures on the wall receded into the shadow . Outside , under the hill , the hylas were going like quick , tiny bells . Will could smell the spice of the bayberryleaves and the sweet-fern . If there was a breeze , the smell of apple blossoms might come in , along with the smell of the ocean that started under the hill and went off dark under the deepening sky to Spain . The smell of the ocean always made Will think of Whaleboat . He wondered what his father was doing out there now , as the dark came on . Will even climbed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem as strange as it had seemed to him once , to sit in the midst of stars . It was just as wonderful . Sitting there with all the soft stars of a May night around him , he felt he had come to be alive at last . All the years of hard and dull work had never meant anything to him . Not what this meant , anyway . He had been living just to get ready for this . Below him was the fine house his own people had lived in and made a part of themselves for over a hundred years . Their bodies were up on the hill . But they themselves were really down here , in the pictures they had hung in the right places and the things that they thought looked beautiful on a mantel . Orderliness and brightness . Things which showed how proud they were of what they had done with their lives . Sextants and log-books , maps with penciled lines where they had gone down the slopes of the earth on hard voyages that meant years of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's life should have been , instead of tarred nets with holes where the rot had spoiled them and gray tangles of slimed codlines washingin the bilge of a foul-smelling dory . It made tears come into Will 's eyes to think of what his father should have been by rights . It made his eyes scald to remember his father 's hands scarred with a network of fine cuts and his bruised knuckles and dirty , broken nails . The boy could feel the drift of the earth up there in the cupola . Menhaden and all the land behind it and all the sea beyond were lifting up like the prow of a schooner when it meets the unseen swell . Going on who knew where , who knew why . His people up there on the hill did not know even now , probably . No more did Uncle Frank . Or any of the people in the books Will had read . But it was wonderful to feel the motion of the voyage . To be a part of something so tremendousand without an end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was too fine a thing to do three times in a lifetime . It was Will 's days that were hardest to get through , not the nights . There was the big barn . But there were no cows to fill the place with work . There was only one driving horse . The harnesses and plows and sleds were rusting away and the woodwork rotting . The chains on the stanchions had rusted on their nails . It made Willp99It came on Will early in May that the best thing he could do towards paying for his keep was to earn some money in the only way he knew how to earn it . There were plenty of spruces around , and laths in the barn . He unearthed an augur and some nails . He was all thumbs at the beginning . He cracked and split the bows . But at last he had something that looked like a lobster pot . He got rope and made a warp . He had the hardest time making the heading the way he knew it ought to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He even found a rotten old lobster head to copy . He got the hang of weaving the thing after an hour or two . One day he let down a lobstertrap all his own making . And there was a count lobster in it when he pulled it bright and early the next morning . It was the happiest morning he had had since he had left Whaleboat . Will went on making more traps . There were twenty-odd that belonged to him out around Whaleboat . But he would n't have touched one of them for the world . David and his father had made them all. hey were n't really his . These he was working onere . By May 's end , the boy had a string of twenty traps , nd had gotten a customer for all the lobsters he could tch . He knew just where to set his traps and what it was best . He was saving his money in a biscuit tinp100in his room . When there got to be ten dollars , he took it down and gave it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet when she knew what he had done . Uncle Frank had known all along . But he had never breathed a word to the woman . It was a great surprise . Will 's mother did n't seem able to say anything at all . She just stood there with the bills in her hand . But the next day Will noticed that ten dollars had been subtracted from the total in the little brown account book which hung by the side of the stove . After that first time , Will left the money on the kitchen table , where his mother would be sure to find it . Will had never felt so close to being a man as he felt now . He came home tuckered out , with rowing hard and pulling in traps . But he slept sound , and he was n't afraid of dreams any more at all . It was good to have something to tide him over the months till school began . He could drop the fishing when the time came to . But perhaps he might be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school , too . There 'd be the afternoons after school let out . He might go on catching lobsters till the snow flew , now he knew everything was going to come out well . It was just a job for a little while , before he went into the business of studying and books . It was odd . But the smell of the dead fish he used for bait did not bother him any more , now he was stringing the fish on his own traps . He stuck the skewerp101through the rotting cunners and flounders without thinking about the fish at all . It was dirty work . He knew that just as much as he 'd always known it . But it did n't interfere with that other part of him that liked to think about the sunrise and sunset , and watch the clean gulls flying and look up at the clean white house where the great men of his kind had lived . One thing , though . Will scrubbed his boat out clean as a whistle every night when he was through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed . He never went around the house in his fishing clothes , either . He changed in his room the minute he got in . Fishing clothes and the Prince house did not go together . That white house meant the years ahead for Will . P102IT WAS SUMMERTIME before Will knew it . He went down to his skiff and his lobster traps one morning and found Summer all around him . That was the way with Maine Summers . One day the ice on the bays broke up into floes in a southeast wind . The next , there was n't a cake of ice to be seen anywhere in all the blue ocean , and almost at once the spicy cups of pink mayflowers were burning hot in the woods and maple buds swollen up red . The leaves came out on all the trees in a night . It was hot , fierce Maine Spring , and violets all up everywhere in the matted , dead grass , and spikes of Canadian mayflowers filling the woods with the scent of burning cloves . And the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new grass had spread like a ground fire all over the side of the hill and right off into the woods . The woods had an echo in them that came only with leaves . The thrushes sounded double there . Dandelions came out thick enough to blind you , and next day went grayheaded . Dandelions ran into daisies and buttercups . The fields were buttered deep and sprinkled with sparkling sugar . Will carried some of the first daisies up to the house . They looked good on the white mantels . There was no , P103body around to laugh at him for picking flowers . His father out on Whaleboat and David up on the hill . There was nobody around to make him blush for bringing in a bunch of flowers . Out on Whaleboat he had never dared to do it unless they were all away from the island . He had had to watch his chance to smuggle them in . Uncle Frank was different . He sometimes brought in flowers , too . Not saying anything about them , but just leaving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to putting them into water  --  for that was the Maine way . And he did n't talk about how nice they looked in the parlor or the office . But you could tell by the way his face lighted up that he noticed them . The grass along the path down to the shore was up to Will 's knees in no time . And the Summer people were opening up their cottages in the spruce thickets and going around smelling of citronella when they came to get their mail and their breakfast oatmeal and bacon strips in the post-office-grocery at the cross-roads . Will had all the customers he could handle . The Prince house was handier to the Summer colony than the lobster places down at the Menhaden landing . UncleFrank and Will fixed up the shed into a sort of store . Neither he nor Will , though , felt like putting a sign out . Somehow , a sign did not go with the Prince place at all . They had no need to . Everybody soon told everybody else where clams and lobsters could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rusticators looked at the kitchen ladder-backs that had found their way out there into the shed , and they asked if those were for sale , too . They cast longinglooks into the kitchen when the door was open . Some of them even went up the two steps and looked in . They seemed to think everything was for sale . They were dying , they said , to see the inside of the house . Will and his mother  --  who sometimes tended to customerswhen Will was not on hand  --  never gave them much encouragement . They did not think of customers as visitors . When the same people got to calling in at the front door of the house , they had to let them in that way . But they were uncomfortable about it . It did n't seem fair to the house to dicker over the price of lobsters a pound with these people . The customers raved about everything . Everything was quaint . They wanted to know just which tables and mirrors Mrs. Prince would consider parting with . Mrs. Prince , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting to live on the bounty of her husband 's brother , did not consider selling any mirrors or tables at all . It was awkward all around . Will had taken to supplying the people with clams as well as lobsters and crabs . The cove was full of them , and he could turn them out three or four bushels a tide without interfering with his lobstering much . He was making a good bit of money . He ought to be able to buy a boat with one of the new naphtha engines thatP105fishermen were beginning to hear talked up to them now . He was happier than he had been for years . Yet underneath this new peace he had suddenly stumbled on , as he had often stumbled on unexpected mayflowers in the dead leaves of early April , there was a thing Will did not dare to think of much . No amount of pride he took in making money fast for himself and his mother could hide the thing quite away . No amount of maps and books to pore over in the Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office . The trouble came upon him most just as he was falling off to sleep for the night . In the daytime , when he was up to his elbows in work , he could put the trouble right out of his mind . But nights , he could n't . It was like the pang of being terribly hungry out in the woods with no chance of finding anything to eat . Just when he thought he had buried that bright , windy March day away for good , it came back to him . Those people going off by themselves the other way down the hill . The man up there with a spade handle of livid silver . The look his father had had in his eyes all that day long . The end of the day , most of all , and his father 's dory a small speck far out on the ocean . He could not feel it in him to be sad about his dead brother . He could not feel sad about David . For Davidhad always been so much alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could n't connect him with sadness . Any more than you could be sad about a dead and stillP106brilliant dragonfly . David had enjoyed himself right up to the last week . There had never been a shadow on him . The last of it had been just a bad dream . David was still somehow the cheerful , spunky , strong and handsome David . He always would be . It was his father that bothered Will . He was the , one to be sad about . Sad so that it made his eyes scald with dark tears all at once , when Will was falling off to sleep , or when he woke up suddenly in the lonely middle of the dead of night . Sometimes he would lie awake for hours and think of his father out there alone on Whaleboat . Outside all this Summer and the people who went about laughing and having a good time . Outside all the beautiful things in this house , the pictures , the books , the flicker of a hearth fire on the ceiling , and the thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was the one who had to do with the high hill with the March wind and sun on it and the figure with the silver spade high over the cupola of the Prince mansion . Living alone on an outlying Maine island did things to a man . Will knew . He had seen lots of men who had lived that way for years . They were n't like men much , towards the last . More like some kind of an in-between thing . Will saw his father as he had looked that day under the hill . Not the way he had looked that other day on Whaleboat when the sun was coming up out of the sea . Will did his level best to think of the man he had seenP107then , his face calm as God 's face might be  --  if God had a face  --  as he held his son up to the light . But that differentman from under the hill and the other face alwayscame in between . The boy set his lobster traps all up and down the reaches of Menhaden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out into the open Atlantic . But he never set them towards the southwest where the lonely reefs of Whaleboat whitened in the long groundswell and the gulls made small snowstorms over mackerel pounds and ledges . Time and time again , Will thought he might row out there . He would sit and think of it by the hour with a pounding heart . But he never could get up the courage . He remembered his father 's words when he rowed away from Menhaden the last time . Will tried to think of an excuse for going . If only his father got sick and needed someone to come out ! One day in August , Will happened to be down at the Menhaden landing with his boat . He looked up from what he was busy at and saw his father 's dory goingpast up the bay . His father was rowing up to Bornbazeenwith his week 's catch . He might be gone for hours . A sudden idea came to Will . It fairly took his breath . He waited till his father 's boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped to the oars and rowed away for Whaleboat as fast as he had ever rowed in his life . The tide was with him , and he made good time . Inp108a very short while he was looking over his left shoulder at the familiar reefs . He grounded his skiff and beached it in the cove he knew by heart . He made a bee line for the shack . But Will slowed down as he approached it . There were no geraniums in the boxes under the windows . Only writhed skeletons of dead plants . The door was wide open , and that made Will 's heart fall . The open door sagged at a lee-lurch . One hinge was broken and half of it gone . Net corks and wreckage of lobster pots were scattered all around the place . A herring net was spread out where his mother 's flower garden had been last year . Will took a long time going in . He almost did n't go . He felt as if he was spying . And he was afraid of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the hot tears he had felt only in the night rushed into his eyes and half blinded him in the broad daylight . The house was dirty beyond all words . There were shavings of kindling strewn around the stove . The sink was full of dirty dishes . Every dish in the place was caked with the yolks of old eggs and the fat of rancid bacon . The teapot was full of sodden , mouldy tea grounds . The air was fetid and close . It smelled shut up and not lived in much , except at night . Will took one look at the bed , which had been brought out into the kitchen . The sheets were gray and terrible . The beddingP109was tumbled , and the bed unmade . He did not look at the thing again till he had to . Will could see how his father was living . He had taken all the short cuts to cooking and eating and sleeping . The bed was dragged up close to the stove , for warmth 's sake . Kindling was being split right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other rooms were closed up . His father was living in the kitchen . It was plain his father did not live in the house any more than he had to . It was like an animal 's living , this living that was going on here . Will felt numb all over at first . Then he sprang at things . He got water and built up a fire in the stove . The lining was gone in one place , but he got up a roaringfire . He stacked the dirty dishes . Then , when his water was hot , he washed them . He could n't find a dishcloth . He used his own hands . He found a piece of a clean sheet and dried them . He had to work fast . He put the dishes back on the table in neat piles . He got the broom and swept everything in the room right out into the shed , away into one corner . He made the bed up last . He had to take hold of himself before he could bring himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will had had to hang up things wherever he could find a nail to , withoutsorting them out . A pair of trousers thrown over a chair-back had the shape of his father still in its folds . Will did not touch them . Somehow he could n't . It would have been like touching his father.  |p110When  everything was done that he could do , the boy hurried out and softly pulled the door to . He had to lean it , on account of the lost hinge . He felt less sorry and miserable . He looked up the bay for a sign of a boat . Then he went quickly down to the cove , launched his own skiff , and rowed away as fast as he could row . He circled to the east to avoid the chance of running into his father . As he rowed , Will 's heart ached as it had not ached since that bitter day in March , and since that hour he had sat out in the chill of the coming night after his father had gone away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sunlit day spread around him , in spite of everything . Two different times drops from his eyes spattered down on his hands as he rowed . His own father !  --  living like that ! His father would come back , and get his supper . He would leave the dishes unwashed again and let the ashes clog up the stove . He would tumble the bed . In a day or two , the place would be almost as bad as it had been before . You 'd never know anyone had cleaned it up . Will thought of the things his father must have to think about there in that disorderly , smelly , poor little room . He must think sometimes about things before he keeled over dog-tired on that bunk . He must feel the strangeness of no voices , ever , in that room and the odd and dreadful silence walling him round . The strangenessmust be beginning to get into him now . A house unlived in by day could do things to a man at night . Oh , P111terrible things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on your mind after a while , with the wind in them making the only sound there was to hear That and the slow boom of the surf , never changing , never letting up , hour after hour , night after night . Year  --  Will knew how it would be  --  after year . Fighting for breath and not finding it  --  that was , nothing to living like that . David had not been called on to face anything like that  --  living the way his father was living . Going odd , thinking queerly . Growing old . And then , perhaps , not thinking at all . Growing old , with a dull , senseless oldness . Like an old tree . That afternoon was like a shadow on Will for days . It was like the turning point of the whole Summer . After that , things began to die . There was dying in the air . The goldenrod was out . The little asters spread a blue frosting over everything ahead of the white frost to come . All the other blossoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were through with mating and through with singing . Flocking up , thinking of going south . Suddenly , the sumac was red as blood over all the hills . And the maple tree by the landing place one morning was standing in its own leaves . Will never breathed a word to his Uncle Frank orhis mother about that visit to Whaleboat . He locked thelooks of the little rundown shack inside himself tight . But what he had seen there had done something tohim . Something bad . From now on , things he had lovedP112so that he ached all over were not anywhere near as bright . And some of them were finished with for good . He could never return to them again . There would have to be new things to cling to . And he would have to make them all by himself . One morning , the spruce woods to the east were strangely quiet . The Summer folks had gone . The Summerwas gone . P113SCHOOL BEGAN IN the middle of September . Will could n't sleep the Sunday night before . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . It was big and full as it went across his window . The checkerboard of his window panes moved from the lower end of his quilt to his pillow . It was unearthly still . Even out on Whaleboat it must be very light and very quiet , except for the surf . He tried to put Whaleboatout of his mind . But then he would think of school and how it would seem to be there again after so long a time out , and his head filled up with odd ideas . He saw the moonlight pale out into the dawn and into the day . It seemed strange to him to be wearing his best clothes on a Monday . He had been growing fast this Summer , and there was a great deal of each wrist below each coat sleeve . He was really too tall for short trousers still . He felt tight and wrong all over . At the schoolhouse it was even worse . He had looked forward to this day even in his sleep . Now it was here , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothingat all . It made him think of a cunner he had caught once when he was very small . The fish had looked as if it were made of jewels in the sunshot water and among the swaying rockweed . But when Will had hooked it113 and gotten it to shore and was holding it in his hand , the blue and silver and golden light had melted out of its body , and left it gray and dull . The schoolhouse was not the place he had seen at a distance . It did n't shine inside the way it did outside . It was a dingy , dirty little room . He would n't have minded that so much , but the boys and girls inside it were dingy and everyday boys and girls , too . He knew many of them by sight and had talked with some of them . He knew many of their names . They were Orrs and Trefethens and Merry -- mans . They had names that belonged with his name back years ago . Names that belonged to old sea captains and ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his , and great-grandfathers to live up to like his own . But nobody would ever know it to see them here . Freckle-faced , and raw-handed from handling lobster warps and codlines and fingers scarred with clamshells . Their collars were soiled along their necks . They had their best clothes on , too . But they did n't act so , indoors or out . They did things in the schoolyard that children living on a place like Whaleboat might do . They shied stones at a tree . The boys got into knots and talked about things with their heads all together and grins on  --  things it was nasty even to think about . Will heard them . He blushed once or twice to his hair roots . He had thought of those things , lots of times . But he had never talked about them . Never like that . He might have , perhaps , if he had had other boysP115around him on Whaleboat besides an older brother . He had only thought about things like that before . He was shocked to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind to do himself . He was left outside of all the knots of boys . The others had known each other and been together for years . They had made their friends . They looked his way , but only because they were curious about an outsider . He had started in too late . He would always be an outsider . He was glad of it , too . He did n't see how he would have been anything but an outsider even if he had gone to school there on Menhaden all his life . None of these boys seemed to be getting ready to be anything . Anything more than fishermen , when they grew up . Anything more than their own fathers were . Will was n't made the way these boys were . He never could have fitted in with them . They did n't like to think about what flowers were coming next . They never noticed clouds and the looks of the sea . He knew . He had heard them talk before . He had listened to them down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right off the reel . He would n't have hung back the way Will was doing . He would have liked these boys , at their age , and he would have been one of them before recess was over . David on the hill . In the wind and sun . Will could see the white stones high above the schoolhouse top . You could see them wherever you were . They wereP116above everything on Menhaden . No matter where you went , you had them overhead . Maybe Will did not take to people -- any people . That may have been the reason . Will 's father had gone to this same school . Had gone here until he was old enough to tub a trawl . He had left off young . Younger than Will was himself now . Likely enough , Will might have become friends with these freckled boys , if he had had it in him to turn out what they were going to be . If he were going to be a lobstering man , he might be one of them , and do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in a shack full of dirty dishes and unmade beds , for the sake of being near his traps . Most of these boys came from houses just as good as Will 's . Their people had sold off lots of their old furniture , and let their clapboards go without paint . But their houses were just as big . They could be fixed up in no time . They never would be , though , not while their people owned them . Some of the boys might even have the kind of uncles Uncle Frank was . But uncles were n't fathers . Maybe , Will 's own father , if he had n't had those spells of his , might have let the Prince house go downhill the same way these boys ' fathers did theirs . Will did not like to think of such a thing . He had been surprised to find there were so many men who went without neckties on Menhaden . So many men like his father . Men who lived in houses with cupolas on them . P117Lots of the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . The lessons were n't like the lessons Will had done with Uncle Frank in the evening glow in the office . It was just figuring sums and reading about manufacturingtowns and naming counties . Just naming everything . There was nothing to think about behind . It might be better when he got to studying Latin and algebra next year . But the few older boys he heard saying Latin verbs did not seem to think they were doing anything wonderful . They had agreed to keep on with school a year or two longer , to please their mothers . All but one or two of them would stop and go back to digging clams and catching lobsters after that . It was the girls , mostly , that finished all the classes there were in school . Some of them wanted to go to normal school and become school teachers . That was why they kept on . Or were too homely to get a fellow . There was one boy who was going on to be a school teacher , too . Going to college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , and he did n't speak to anybody , either . His hair did not look like a boy 's hair . Or a girl 's . It was more like a dog 's . Will felt he would rather go without friends at all before he would try to make friends with him . The school teacher himself was not what Will had supposed a teacher would be like . He seemed tired to death before the morning was half over . He seemed to be paying very little attention to anything . His face wasP118thin as a hatchet and had pimples on it . And a mole with three black hairs . Will could n't tell why , but his voice sounded gray . Will 's mother and Uncle Frank had talked of Will 's becoming a teacher , maybe . There must be much better things Will could find to be , once he got away from Menhaden . School did not get any better after the first few days . It got duller as it went along . Will lived for the Saturdaysand Sundays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lobster traps . He made a bee line for the cove the minute he got his best suit off . Uncle Frank did not say anything , or his mother . But Will somehow knew they knew he was not taking to school as he ought to . Uncle Frank sounded him out on his lessons a few times . But Will closed up and did n't have anything much to say . Uncle Frank knew better than to ask him right out what was the matter . Uncle Frank never did things like that . Will 's mother seemed worried , though . She showed it in little ways , like fussing over his food . One night she came right out and said Will probably ought to have studied longer and gotten into the high-school classes , with older scholars . But then , the high-school subjects were n't very well taught at the Menhaden school , folks said . It might be they might find a way for Will to go to Darmouth , and board in town and go to a regular high school . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday nights . Next year , they 'd have toP119see to it . She had a cousin in Darmouth who might be glad of three dollars a week to look forward to . Uncle Frank thought it might be a fine idea . Perhaps even this coming Winter . He could get the Menhaden teacher to drill Will in algebra and Latin , this Fall , in the evenings . Will did not say anything . The Fall was going by . Three days of wind came , and all the leaves disappeared from Menhaden as fast as they had come . They were n't even under the trees . You could not see a one . You found them gathered about lobster buoys in the bay and drifted among the thatch stalks on the shore . One morning , Will saw the frost crystals pushing up the loam in small cushions along beside his path to the boat . He had hardly any daylight left to work in , when school was out . In the long evenings under the lamp in the parlor , when his mother and uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Will . Not nearly so bright as they had been once . Not all the same ones . Some had never gone on after that visit at his father 's house on Whaleboat . The hopes came back only in the evenings . There was something about the quiet wide rooms with their white mantels all dimly lighted up , something that brought dreams buck to Will . They had nothing to do with the school . He thought once of climbing up into the cupola again some night . But he never did go . He could n't bring himself to . The place might make himP120afraid of what was ahead of him , now that school had not turned out what he had hoped . He was going to leave Menhaden . He was bound he would go . There would be something or other he could find to do in Darmouth , or some bigger place beyond . He might as well be on Whaleboat still , as far as gettingahead any so far . But his time was coming . He would show those boys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But every time Will thought of going away , he rememberedWhaleboat and the man on it who ate out of dirty dishes and slept on soiled bedding . And when he thought of his father , he wondered if he could ever get up the courage to go away . If his father would come around to living over here , in the house where he belonged , he 'd go in a minute . It must be wicked cold out there on the little island now . The rockweed was frozen underfoot . When Will walked on it , he left footprints of fire . He could have tracked his father going up to the cold , dark house . There would be driftwood enough out there . His father would get up a good blaze in the cookstove and sit with his thighs spread out in front of it . The firelight would be dancing on the ceiling , where the front draft was broken and let the light out through the stove . Not a sound anywhere but the mice in the wall . No one to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father would doze off , keeping his head up straight as he always used to do when he was napping . His fine stiff headPI2Inot bowing even when he was sound asleep . His hair was getting gray . No life for a man growing old . He would look good in front of the fireplace here . He might come home . When the weather got too cold . He might . Deep down in him , Will knew he never would . He might have , for David . If David had wanted him to , bad enough . David 's being up there on the hill was like turning a key in a door . Something had happened to Will 's father . Something bad . Bad enough to make him not worry any more , the way he used to , about Will 's mother looking at other men . Even his father 's being jealous had been something that made his father seem very real and alive . Made Will love him more , even though it made him very much ashamed . That part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , an important and vital part of his father had gone for good . It must have . A part of him dead . Will was not old enough to know entirely what lovinga woman was like . But he knew what jealousy was . He knew it meant turning hot and cold and wanting to go off by oneself , and thinking of dying . He knew because he had felt that way about David , and his father 's making of David and not of him . If only his father knew how well he could build a lobster trap now . It might make him have a soft spot in his heart for Will . Perhaps some of the fishermen his father met now and then and talked to might tell him how well his son was doing at lobstering . SomeoneP122must have mentioned it to him by this . His father might have a different feeling about him already . Will wondered what his father had thought when he came home to a clean house that afternoon in August . He must have guessed who it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't Will 's mother . Not after what she had said that March afternoon at the foot of the hill . He must know it was his son who 'd done it . His father might have done something to show that he knew . Sitting in front of the broken stove , dozing off . And what if a spark flew out through the broken draft and struck among the rags thrown about on the floor ? His father asleep , and the blaze rising higher . Smoke and a man strangling in the dark . People had been burned to death that way . The boy went over the ways he might find an excuse to go out there again . He might go without an excuse . But a boy could n't talk to a man the way a man could . As a boy might , even , to a man who was n't his own father . Will might take out some extra bedding for him . There were chests of patchwork quilts upstairs . His father must need more quilts now in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His father 's being out on Whaleboat still would be the hardest part when it came time for Will to go to Darmouth for good . A thought came to Will now and then . One that made him afraid . Maybe , families had just so muchP123energy in them , and no more . There might be just so many Princes who amounted to something , and then they were done . Just so many potatoes to a hill . When they were grown , that was all . Maybe he did n't have it in him to grow and become something . Maybe his father had n't had it in him . Look at all the descendants of the sea-faring people around Menhaden now . Uncle Frank was different . He took natural to wearing his best clothes every day and sitting and reading in his big house . He took natural to not getting his hands and feet mucky with the mud of clamflats . And , anyway , he had n't done anything but sit there . He had n't built ships or made money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get married and have sons to raise . Uncle Frank would never have a son . Nobody of his to wear good clothes after him . Will loved Uncle Frank , but he knew he was n't like the old Princes . Too bad , but he was n't . Perhaps all the gimp had gone out of the Prince family . Run-out . Getting married and having sons was about the last thing . Even Will 's father had done that . When a man did n't do that , he was really done . Will wondered what he could do if it were n't teachingschool . Once it had been books . Going to make books up out of what he saw . But it might take years to learn how . Oh , well , he could go into a factory and work up . But that would take years , too . He was n't good among people . Liked to be all by his lonesome . And he was n't quick at learning new ways to use his hands . It probably ought to be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind and think things out . Sometimes , he guessed , he used it too much . Made himself miserable and lonely . He lived a good deal inside his mind , he knew . He had always done so . It was what had made him so much alone all the time . It was the reason why David and his father had sided togetheragainst him . They had no use for him because he never had much to say and had to be told what to do . And bungled what he was at because his mind was somewhere else , woolgathering . " Put your hand out , and see if you are asleep . " He remembered David 's saying that as plain as day . Sayingit a dozen times a day . Maybe , he ought to have been a girl , as his father had said more than once . Might not be so bad for a girl to live that way . Inside . Perhaps girls were made the way he was . Getting away from the sea and doing something  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once he had discovered , long ago , that his father thought more of David than he did of him . He would have to go into something where he could use his mind and not his hands . That was plain . When he was making his own lobster pots and setting and pulling them , Will 's mind was always at work on something else . On the way the clover leaves were all closed in together after the dew had fallen . He had noticed it one night when he set the lantern down inP125the grass . Some little thing not very important to other people . But important to himself , all right . A thousand things like that about the clover . The way mackerel hawks looked like the mackerel they lived on . Same shaped bodies , pointed sharp at each end . Same light and dark markings . Other things were like that , too . Butterflies like the flowers they lived off . Felt the same as flower petals on their wings . What on earth good was it noticing things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world as the old Princes had done ? Well , they might not earn him his bread and butter , but they meant life to Will . Meant living . There was Cousin Rupert Prince . One of the family still making a stir . Cousin Rupert was a writer . Maybe that was somethingWill could be , after all . Some kind of a writer . Will loved books , anyway . Perhaps he would be able to write books some day . Not geographies and histories . He did n't know enough for that . It might be stories . Books you made up . Out of things you noticed . Cousin Rupert wrote novels . Will had read one of them that Uncle Frank had in the house . Rupert 's name was written in it . To Frank , who keeps the home fire burning  --  Rupert Prince . Big and scrawly . That book had puzzled Will . It was about two men and one woman . The woman loved both the men  --  for different things . She loved the one she was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for his body.  | That was exactly the way Rupert Prince had written it . It made Will flush all over . To think of a woman 's wanting and having two different men at the same time ! Having both their minds and their bodies , too . ... Making comparisons . . . . There was a baby , too , that mixed it all up . It belonged to the other man  --  the one with the body . The husband found that out , and he soured on the baby , and never took it up in his arms any more . He had thought it was his own baby , before . Uncle Frank had not given Will the novel to read . He said it was too old for him . Time enough to read his relation 's books later on , Uncle Frank said . But Will knew where he put the book , and he got it out of the bookcase and read it in his own room at night . It was the way his uncle said that about its being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It was n't too old for Will to read . He had heard things that sounded like the things that were said in the book , before he was even twelve years old . Through the wall between his room and his father 's and mother 's . Will sided with the man who was the woman 's husband . He talked like his own father , maybe that was why . He felt the shame the husband felt in the story . It made what his father believed about his mother seem real and terrible . It was hard to believe . But such things might be true sometime . Even though they were n't true about his mother . There might be women like that . Bad as that . Will hated his cousin all throughp127the novel because his cousin was all the time trying to make out that the woman had a right to want to do what she did  --  take the other man for his body . The author was on the woman 's side . Will was glad the book ended as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dark , deserted house . He laid his plans for days . And the husband killed himself also , afterwards . That seemed the right thing to do , too . If Will ever did write books , he was sure he was not going to write a book like that . Never in the world . The days drew in shorter and shorter . There were longer nights to think things over and plan out what he would do when he got off Menhaden . Will got used to school , though he still hated it , and he got used to being alone in the schoolyard . He did his lessons , but he did n't take much interest in them . He got good ranks without putting much of himself into them . The wild geese drove southwards in wide arrowheads . The winds began to spit snow . Another Winter , Will would not be there to see the geese going over.  |p128THE  SNOW WAS flying good and plenty fairly early inNovember . Will was out in one blinding snow squall after school , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to feel his way home along the ugly rocks of Sabre Point by the sound of the slushy breakers smashing against Maine granite . He was chilled to the bone , and wet as sop . It took him till midnight to make the Princes ' cove . His mind got to running on his father and his being out there in the midst of this dark storm roaring over Whaleboat . His father might be out in this , too , and there was no chance of feeling along the reefs out there in the open sea . The reefs were too ragged and wide . They would stave in the best Hampton dory made . Break her ribs like so many matches . Will did not want to think of that , but he kept thinking of it all the time he threw his weight upon his oars . The snow hissing like hot filings of steel into the black water around him . If a boat bottom stove in , there would be no chance to swim . Being strong like his father would only lengthen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down where the slimy kelp ribbons reached out like the arms of octopuses and terrible shelled creaturesslid down swiftly through perpetual night . His father 's fine body might sometime lie down there.  |p129Arms  out and hands clenched into claws . Like the man Will had seen and had n't wanted to look at until David made him look . Will had seen the man for years in dreams , the same stiff , reaching-out arms bent at the elbows , hands up  --  what was left of them  --  as if they had tried to ward off what had eaten off his face . Will thought of that and his father all the wild hours he fought the stinging steel filings of snow and the long breakers that leaned with him and his boat against the shore and broke horribly somewhere so near his starboard oar that he could hear the sucking sound of the rockweed . He thought of his father till he was safe . He took in his farther traps for good next day . He could see Whaleboat from the place where he was pullingthem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild light of the clear , cold November morning . The storm had left snow on it and picked it out along the edges of the spruce woods . The island hung sharply on the edge of the ocean . And the edge of the ocean ran up into uneasy saw-teeth , ever changing and confusing . The saw-teeth crept along the sea 's rim from the east to the west . Whaleboat was solid and firm , but every so often it rose up from the water , keeping only one stem planted in the ocean , and became a flat oak tree , sucking up its life through its single trunk from the bitter blue water . It was hard to look into such troubled mirages as those of a Maine November . Will sat for half an hour looking at Whaleboat tillp13o his eyes hurt him . He had made up his mind to start over , when he saw that he did n't have to go . A thread curled up into the sky . It was so thin , it was almost not there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again to be sure he saw it . It looped back upon itself and frayed out into nothing . There was a fire in the stove out there . He rowed home humming a hymn to himself all the way : " Light after darkness , sailor , Day is at hand .... " It was that day Will made up his mind to start on the Latin . His mother had never mentioned Will 's going to Darmouth , to high school , again . She went around the house keeping things shining and the kitchen smellingof pies , just as though everything was all right and Will on the way to doing something grand and something she would be very proud of some day . She did n't seem to be worrying any more about anything . That was the way Will 's mother had always been . No matter how hard she worked or how often Will 's father had his spells and said his bitter words to her , at night when the boys were supposed to be asleep , she got all over her troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she 'd been going . She never could make up her mind to take a , stand and stop the things that went on . She could have put a stop to hisp131father 's talk once and for all . She could have ended it . She could have told him not to dare to say such things to her or she would walk right out of the house and never come back . But she had let things slide . And the bitter words had gone on . She did n't have any gimp in her . It might have gone on the same way all her life long . They might have gone on living in the threeroomshack on Whaleboat , with the gulls crying foreveroverhead , and the rotted kelp smelling in the wind . The wind that always kept on blowing on their house and shaking it . The wind that always blew out of some quarter of the sky and rushed down on Whaleboat . And the endless sound of the surf , even on a sunshinyday , that got inside your mind . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to your mind . Like lying too long and sleeping out in the sun . Till you felt groggy and sick , and gone in the knees . It might have gone on that way . And the wind burningon inside after you had gone to bed . The same kind of days , the same kind of nights . The same things to eat , the same feeling of icy water on your hands and salt crystals sprinkled on your skin . Your face parched brown , and your hair bleached out here and there into light strands . It was none of Will 's mother 's doing , their leaving Whaleboat . It was David 's . If David had n't gone so suddenly and terribly , they would be out there even now . It took that day with the sunbeams like arms reaching down between the clouds and the man with the solemn silver rod high up on the sky . It took that to put an end to the monotone of days and years on Whaleboat . No thanks to Will 's mother . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for himself in Darmouth , he would have to be the one who made it . His mother was soft and let things go . She might have stopped his father 's talking about other men looking at her . She let him go on . Till he believed it . Till he would n't let them live where other people lived , but kept them on Whaleboat . In the sun , in the scorching sun . In the wind . In the middle of the great sound that made the whole island tremble . Till the surf got into their brain . Uncle Frank was altogether different . He kept at Will to get him started . Oh , not ever in anything he said directly . Not a word of that . But in the way he looked and the way he acted . In what was behind the things he did say . He had begun to be quite talkative often in the long evenings . Sat up with Will and was , only too glad to tell him things he had always wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially . He talked suddenly one night about the change that had come over Will in the past months and made his voice go down deep as his father 's every so often . He talked about the change in Will 's body that made him wake up flushed and angry with himself at night . That made him shy and awkward before people in the daytime . That made him remember words his father hadp133used when he was alone with David and Will . Ones he had used sometimes when he talked angrily with Will 's mother , on the other side of the wall , when he thought they were alone . " See here , Will . There 's something I 've had on my mind . A long time . Been meaning to talk to you about . " " What 's that , Uncle Frank ? " " It 's about  --  about you . You know . How you 're growing  --  growing . Different from the way you were when you were just a boy . You 'll be turning into a man most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need n't think  --  you need n't be  --  er  --  ashamed if sometimes you  --  your body seems to  --  to  --  to get the best of you . It will come out all right . Come out all right in the end . Your body will get over being a bother to you . Maybe it does bother you now . Nights . Bound to . Natural . Developing . That 's nothing to be ashamed of . Every young man has to go through it . You see . Men are  --  are made  --  are built for women . Marriage , you know . Bodies a part of it . Grow prepared for it . That 's the  --  the way children  --  er  --  er  --  come . Children . That 's what it 's all about . Children ! " Uncle Frank stopped all red and breathless . He had not been looking at Will all through it . Will knew what it cost his uncle to say all he had said . The man had never done such a thing before in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beads of perspiration standing on his uncle 's forehead when he was talking.  | His father ought to have done this . His uncle should n't have had to . Long ago . It was too late now . Will had pieced out the whole thing for himself . From things he had heard . Things his father spoke of as if they were a joke . When he was around with other men . Things he said to Will 's mother that were not a joke at all . From things Will had picked up here and there from fishermen he sold lobsters to . They thought it was all a joke , too . They laughed and talked about it , as if everybody knew the joke . Told the reasons why this or that woman took up with this or that man , even though the woman was a married one . And this man with that woman , though she had babies already and did n't need any new ones . The difference in two men who looked just like each other outside , but were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry had to be away a lot . His wife was afraid of being cold . Nights . Damned cold month , December ! " Well , Sam , he figured out how Hen 's wife prob- , ably did n't have blankets enough . He was a thoughtful man , Sam . Not half enough blankets . Needed a good thick one . " So while Henry was gone , Sam called on the little woman and offered his  --  his services . He did what he could do . He was pretty good at helping out . Hen 's missus , she appreciated a good man when she saw one . She did n't want to catch no cold , sleeping in a bed without enough blankets ! " Sam was a first-rate one . A warm one.  | " So Henry will be apt to have something running around his place besides the fence , next September , when he 's getting in his potatoes . " Best of blankets will shed wool , you know ! " And all the men around the wharf would move their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poke each other in the ribs . " Shed wool !  --  That 's a good one !  --  That 's great ! " They 'd all start off laughing again . Leaned against each other and laughed till their eyes were damp . Uncle Frank was too late . Cousin Rupert 's book had got ahead of him , too . But Will was grateful to his uncle just the same , for wanting to help him . Uncle Frank was like nobody else in the world . Good as gold . Will tried to thank him . He did n't make out very well . They never talked about it again . Will was getting so he thought it was more of a joke , too . He had to . Or it might do something to his mind he 'd be sorry for . It might keep him awake at night and hurt his mind bad . Better joke about it . Or it might do what it had done to Will 's father . That was no joke . And so Will joked about it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father had joked about it  --  hurt him bad . Better laugh it off . " Shed wool !  --  that was a fine one ! " Will put away his short-pants suit at Thanksgiving time . He never wore that suit again . It was hardly beginning to show signs of wear . But he was through with it , through with sleeves that were so far up on his wrists . Uncle Frank helped him out . He seemed to know what was on Will 's mind . He said to Will , out of a clear sky , he had a suit of clothes he had worn only a little bit . Will was welcome to it . He brought it to Will 's room . He said he had a lot of extra pants , too . Will could have them as well as not . He had brought them along with the suit . He left them all and went out as if it was the most natural thing in the world . Will packed the short pants away at the bottom of a trunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Uncle Frank was a rather stocky man . Much stockier than Will 's father . His father 's trousers would fit Will now . Will wished his father knew that . He put the trousers on and stood in front of the big looking-glass . He felt dressed for the first time in months . He walked round and round . It was like the first step on stairs that led up somewhere . Somewhere where there would be lots of light and people  --  fine people  --  talking and laughing , and Will feeling good most of the time . Doing something important . Far away from the smell of dead kelp in the sun . He knew what had made him take this first step up those stairs . It was a thing that had burned into his mind and left a mark like a red-hot iron . It was seeing the dirty dishes and bedding in his father 's house on Whaleboat . That was the thing.  |p137Will  wore Uncle Frank 's trousers at breakfast next morning . His mother never said a thing about them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through breakfast . The old look of Whaleboat Island came back into her face for a moment . The look she had had that night she had tried to mother him . The night before David had died . But by night the look had gone . Will was glad of it . He went into Darmouth on the stage the very first Saturday afterwards , and bought himself a new suit of clothes . The Latin was the next step up the stairs . Will borroweda First-Year Latin Book of the schoolmaster and went to work . He did not breathe a word about it to his uncle . He never took the book out till after Uncle Frank had gone off to bed . He worked hard , and he learned fast . He did n't know a thing about how to pronounce the words . But he knew how to write them . Will started the algebra , too . That was harder to get on to than the Latin . But he finally got the hang of it . And then it was easier than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ahead of the class in algebraat the school . He listened to them recite and made sure . He could have gone into the class there just as well as not . But he wanted to keep his studying a secret from Uncle Frank and his mother . And he could go faster by himself . It was much pleasanter doing it all by himself . With no snickering boys and girls not pay- ing attention and slowing things up . He went at it every night , alone in the office , where his people had done their figuring for many years . He burned a candledown every night . He would more than make up for this year he had lost by being in the grammar grade . He was beginning where the old Princes had begun . Figures in small columns that had grown longer and longer until they had gone out around the earth . Until they reached out to the Celebes and down under the purple mountains of Borneo , where night came like a velvet curtain dropped in an instant , and great fireflies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen and the groves were full of wandering stars . Down to Batavia , looking like a cloud of white and pink butterflies which had settled on the edge of a blue velvetland reaching up to the white clouds . Will knew how Batavia looked . His uncle had heard his father describeit . Will had looked at it plain in his dreams for , many years . The figures that had been added up in this room had meant mahogany logs from swamps like bad dreams , and alligators coughing like lost devils under skeletons of strange trees . The figures had meant chests of tea , and a thousand dusky men , agile as sleek monkeys , with wide moustaches on them , bending down in grass hats shaped like little umbrellas , all day long in the sun . They had meant people once , people like painted butterflies , wearing every color of the rainbow on thep139silk scarves wound around their heads . Men built like flowers , with unfamiliar pistils and sudden , undreamtofstains dyed into them deep . Men with mouths full of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted into their hair . Not walking like most women , but drifting like uprooted flowers . The figures had meant rice fields and showers coming like veils dragged across a world made out of diamonds . Will knew Java as well as he knew Whaleboat . Whaleboat , and his father in dirty , faded trousers , bending over and picking cold , dull crabs out of traps , and putting his slim hands down into rotten fish . The old people had walked their clean decks in white linen and watched the brown monkey-men of Malasia stowing in the chests of fragrant tea . In days of sunlight , in days like the inside of a rainbow . The showers forever hanging on the mountains , making triple rainbows that covered half the sky , and the melting feet of the rainbows turning the mountains where they touched them into mists of melted gold . Great colors and great nights . Great businesses , great men . They had lived in the heart of a rainbow . Once , some of the Prince sea captains had been entertainedin a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs and five hundred dancing girls , crusted with jewels on their arms to their fingertips , till they looked as if they had dipped their arms in frost , movinglike Summer grasses in a wind , acting out a dream .   A garden like an opened daisy . Uncle Frank had told Will about that . Another year , some of the captains had walked a whole night out , and had seen the sun come up at last and put out thousands of paper lanterns which had bobbed all night through under the mulberry trees . It was like walking through a land inhabited by big lightning-bugs . Flowers giving out light along the narrow streets . Luna moths that had caught on fire and become fireflies and were lighting their own way among unheard-ofblossoms . Cherry trees covered over to every last twig with all the clouds of the morning . They started it all by adding figures at this desk . And Will was starting on his way , making his A-squares and B-squares . Not towards China and Java . Not the road they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own to some other kind of life , just as bright as theirs had been and just as fine . He would have the things Uncle Frank had only talked about all his life . He would have sons . He would treat them all the same . The younger ones just the same as the older ones . He would get married right away , as soon as he had got started out on his road . He would have lots of sons . Some day he would bring them all back here and show them the house that had belonged to them before they were born . The house where their father had started . They would live in the house in the Summer . When he himself got old , heP141would live in it all the time . He would be in it when he died . His sons would always keep the place . It would be a fine place to be buried , on a hill that looked down on this house . Uncle Frank did not know about the algebra and the Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked so much about Rupert Prince . Rupert Prince was the one in the family who was doing well now . Uncle Frank told Will about him every chance he got . What a handsome , big , strapping fellow he was . With a vandykebeard like a college professor and clothes a millionairemight wear . He knew as much as lots of collegeprofessors . His books made a big stir . Thousands of people read them , fast as they came out . He had written nearly twenty of them . Folks knew about Menhaden , all right . Rupert had put it on the map . They knew it was the island where the author had been born . Rupert Prince knew famous people . He travelled around with rich people and artists , and he talked just the way they did . He had made money , all right . His books brought him in enough to buy and sell Menhadenevery year . He had been abroad many times . He had been in Africa and Asia . He got around , Rupert Prince did . All Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking , was the woman in Rupert Prince 's novel who had two men 's bodies to serve her . He could n't for the life of him say anything about his relation to his uncle . The woman 's name was Mari . Her name may have had something to do with the way she carried on . Uncle Frank kept on talking about Rupert Prince all the more because Will did n't have anything to say . Uncle Frank was n't a man who had much to say . Not in the daytime , or when there was a woman around . He said hardly a thing then . But when he was alone with Will at night , he got warmed up and talked by the hour . It was either Rupert Prince he talked about , or else the old Prince people who had done big things in their day . He had n't talked so much in years . It was because his nephew was there with him now , and he did n't want him to give up the idea of getting ahead in life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for night after night , till all hours . If he did n't talk , it might be the boy would sit back and not try to get ahead at all . Just as he had done himself . Just as his own brother had done . His nephew was spending altogether too much time down in the cove with his lobster traps , in his opinion . If he 'd had his way , the boy never would have touched one of the things . Will had rigged up a boat out of kilter for years . He had taken to lobstering and tinkeringwith boats too easily . It was bad . It was his father coming out in him , all over . Uncle Frank had to do something . He was afraid of what was ahead . He 'd fight the father in him with the grandfather and greatgrandfather . With his own Cousin Rupert . He 'd wakep143the boy up , if talking could do it . So he talked to Will far into the night . Till morning , more than once . The birds would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Uncle Frank . Every word he said about the ambitious old Princes was like something said against himself . He had sat back and taken it easy . That was n't what the old fellows had done . Not by a long shot . He did n't have something the old Princes had in them . Gumption . Get-up-and-go . Stick-to-itiveness . Some modern folks called it guts . There were different names for it . They all meant the same thing . Whatever it was , it had died in him . It had died in his own brother , Dan . Daniel did n't know it had , and he kept on doing something every minute of his time . All day and all the part of the night he was awake . He had more work than you could shake a stick at . But it was n't the work that got him ahead . Not the right kind . Did n't get him anywhere . He was dead and done for . Perhaps Will did n't have that thing . Maybe it had died in young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Frank would see . If he had it in him , he 'd find it out . P144IT WAS A Winter from way back . The snow covered Menhaden and made Prince 's Cove look black below the drifts of white . The raccoons ' fur was longer and thicker that December than Seth Judkins had seen it in seventy years . It was going to be a hard Winter . Sure enough , Will went down to his boat one morning , and found it frozen into the bay solid . He cut away the ice around it and pulled it out on the beach to wait till the ice broke up again . It did n't break up . So at last he hauled it up on the bank and covered it with fir boughs . Every morning , the edge of the still part of the bay was farther out towards the skyline . Will borrowed a boat at the landing and took in the last of his traps . It was a tough job , but he finished it . One day in early January when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , and the white new shore to Menhaden had gone out so far that the ocean looked like just a narrow , wicked dark blue edging away out on the sky . Even from high up the hill . They said down at the post-office that it had frozen right out to Whaleboat . Will 's father could walk ashore home , if he wanted to , now . Will knew he would n't come near the house . Before the week was out , he heard down at the storep145that his father had been there and gone . He had a drag made out of peeled spruce boughs , and he had loaded her down with a big supply of provisions . Will went down to the wharf , when nobody was looking . His father 's tracks were there all right . It was just after sunset . The light was clearer than day had been . The tracks went straight out into the evening glow and disappeared in the haze . He would have given anything to follow the tracks out there to the island . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile until the evening glow was gone , and the blazing Winter stars had begun to come out . That night Will mastered the whole fifth conjugationof Latin verbs . Will 's mother found ears of popcorn hung up in the attic loft . It had been hanging there by its braided husks Lord knew how many years . But it popped all right . She made a bowl of popcorn for Will and Uncle Frank . That was the night of the big snowstorm . A wall of dry , powdery snow , miles high , was moving offshore with the sound of a thousand seething kettles . It had begun at noontime . It went on steadily without a let-up . By dusk , the white earth had risen up almost to the windowsills of the house . Uncle Frank and Will sat by the hearth fire and ate the popcorn , and Uncle Frank told about the night the Ariadne had been lost . Just another such a night as this . Not ten miles from here . On the Whaleboat South Ledges .   Whaleboat had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred tons . She was the pride of Samuel Prince 's heart . There was n't a prettier or faster ship between Belle Isle and the Horn . Samuel Prince polished even the yard-arms . Loaded with tea from Inner Mongolia , she was . White Dew on the Mountain . Tea had fancy names then . They had alwaysremembered it in the family . Samuel had sworn it tasted like its name . He had opened up one chest of it on the way home . Only one . He never allowed himself more than nine cups a day . He was a moderate man . That tea was going to make his eternal fortune . Samuel was the tallest and strongest of four generationsof sea captains . The pick of the lot . The handsomestman that ever walked a Menhaden ship . He had his way with the women . Six-feet-four , in his stocking feet . He never let a rib go into any ship of his till he had run his big hands over it and felt out the grain . He used his own trees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did most of the finer part of the ironwork for them himself , to make sure it was done right . He was a stout man with a hammer at an anvil . Handsome as the day was long . Uncle Frank remembered him clearest that way . Stripped to his waist , golden with his sweat , and his dark beard full of golden sparks . The Ariadne had been the last of the real Prince ships . In the 8o 's , it was . Sailing ships petered out after that . Stubby , little hit-or-miss schooners . For lumber-P147lugging and ice . Coasters . New York and back . Not good for standing the gaff of the open Atlantic . Little shavings of ships to the older ones . The last shavings . Not worth the launching . Petered out . Cap'n Samuel no need to have laid his bones there under Whaleboat 's South Reef . He could have been one of them up there on the hill , just as well as not . But the Ariadne 'd broken her white heart on the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . He sent Mr. Winters , the mate , off in the last boat . There was room in it for him . The Ariadne was done . There was no doing anything for her . She was breakingup already . But Samuel would n't budge . He stayed with her to the end . Mr. Winters ' boat was the only one that got in safe . The others never lived to get through the black hell of the blizzard . They had broken their own record from the Horn . They were two days inside of it . They were off the Isle of Shoals in a cold sunshiny January day , and happy as cows in clover to be so near the end of their voyage , and home and wives . They had their bags all packed up and stowed on the after deck . All their duds packed . Almost home . Cap'n Sam did n't like the looks of the sky . It was full of high frost clouds . Like ribs in a pork carcass . The cap'n was crowding her canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow that was coming . The sun had n't gone out for good until round two bells . They could see the evergreen woods of Menhaden with the glass . P148It was sudden when it took them . Began to spit snow and grew dark quicker than any twilight that ever was . Mr. Winters said he 'd never forget to his dying day the sound in the shrouds as everything went dark . He had heard an aeolian harp once . It was most like that . Sad . He knew they were in for it . Cap'n Samuel made the only mistake he had ever made in his life . He thought he could get in even now , in the dark . Maybe they would n't have lasted if he had n't tried it . No telling . He was willing to take the chance . He thought he could take her through the blizzard . He knew every inch of the Bay of Menhaden . In his sleep . Every rock that humped too near the surface . He thought he could hold his course and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no holding a ship of the Ariadne 's burden in what hit them now . It was the blizzard of the century . It came thick with snow that was like sugar . Like blind tons of sugar being dumped out dry from hogsheads . Ten thousand hogsheads . It came at them with a gale behind it . The wind veered around and came at them from astern . The hell came up along the line of the coast . Captain Samuel used the anchors too late . They did n't last five minutes . They might have got past South Reef if there 'd been any chance for a man to live on deck . It was like trying to stand up to crumbling mountains . Their bags went with the first combers that came aboard . They knew what they were in for when the first combersP149came over them . They were in so close that the water had no steadiness in it anywhere . There was nothing to hold the keel true . The waves were rolling to the bottom of the bay . Mr. Winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oak ribs crack above the roar of the storm . The Ariadne 's ribs went like an eggshell . The mate told the people on Menhaden what they went through that night . It was hell at fifteen below zero . Men froze solid into their clothes and went off the sheet ice of the deck like icicles when the breakers came aboard of them . Like brittle icicles . Mr. Winters never forgot the looks of those breakers as they curled over in the light from the cabin windows and came down like sledge hammers and stove them in . They lifted the Ariadne at first  --  lifted her as easy as a baby . They kept setting her down in a new place , on rocks nearer the surface . Setting her down with a crunch that rattled their spines . The light on Brown Bull went out of commission that night for the first time in one hundredyears . It would n't have done any good , though . There was no seeing anything through that black wall of blizzard . You could n't have heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shut up insidean organ with all the stops pulled out , Mr. Winterssaid . Mr. Winters had got his gray hair that night . Some of the men went off the deck when they were trying to get the boats free . They were the luckiest ones . Mr. Winters ' hands were frost-bitten to his wrists . The waves made matchwood of the masts and the buckling deck timbers . The first boat lived hardly long enough to get into the water . What was left of it came over the deck in the light of the window like a smashed pumpkin . Mr. Winters saw one poor fellow 's head all out of shape and covered with blood before the next black mountain folded down over it . One boat got clear . But never so much as an oar from it was ever found . Mr. Winters tried to get the captain into the last one . A wave had crushed in the wheel-house , and the last lantern went with it . There was something left of the sides of the house still standing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate could not unlock the cap'n 's hands . The cap'n yelled into his ear for him to go . He was staying . He made the mate understand . Mr. Winters had been working all the time to loosen the captain 's hands . If he could have loosened them , he would have taken the man bodily . It was no use . It was like trying to break bars of new steel . The mate gave up at last , and slid into the boat in the roaringdark . They never knew how they got under the lee of Whaleboat . Two of the men were frozen dead by the time they got there . Frozen to the seats they sat on . Four others lost fingers and toes from the frost . They got a fire lit somehow under the ledges and huddled there till morning . When they crawled out of theP151drifts and staggered down along the island in the clear morning after , where the Ariadne had been there were only high hills of white foam piled up on the blue sky . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had mixed with the brine of Menhaden Bay . The painted tin chests washed ashore for months . Almost every house on Menhaden had one of Samuel 's tin boxes for a breadboxor a cake-tin . It was a superior kind of tin to stand up under the salt water . It would have broken Samuel'sheart to know . Some of the men of Menhaden came ashore that way , too , from under the waves . Came home late , that way . They washed ashore for months . There were graves being dug on the hill all Winter long . Never so many before or since , at any one time . Somehow , that was the end of things for the ship people . The end of the sailing ships . The end of the kind of men Menhadenhad been famous for . Better to end that way , though , all at once , when things were still in flower . Samuel Prince had n't washed ashore . The tallest monument up there on the hill had his name on it . But Samuel himself was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out like a hidden knife from the southern tip of Whaleboat . Down in the dark forests of kelp . They found the figurehead of the Ariadne years after in a cleft of the rocks on Whaleboat . Samuel Prince had carved out the Greek lady the ship was named for himself . They put it at the base of his monument , the highest and whitest on the hill . The snow of the blizzard that Uncle Frank had told his story in lay three feet deep on Menhaden all that Winter . It was still up almost to the windowsills in middle March . The geese came late that year . Will was reading Caesar by the time he heard them honking northward over the house in the night . Cousin Rupert had written a new book , Uncle Frank said . He was an up-and-coming man . He 'd made his mark in the world . He 'd write a whole library full before he got through . There were many other famous members of the Prince family . Uncle Frank filled the Winter up with tales about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were beaten out of a bride , as John Prince had been . Failures were so few and far between in the family that John Prince 's name had become sort of a by-word . It was nice to have that lost bride to take the wind out of some Prince 's sails , when he got too toplofty . One of the family even got elected to the legislature . He did n't want the honor , but his friends thought he would look well in the State House . He did . He never made any laws , but he made some famous speeches . They were full of the lingo of the sea-faring man . He was always advising economy and bellowing that they ought to batten down their hatches and hullP153it out till the wind set fair again . He despised most of the legislators as landsmen . He voted against all their bills as regularly as sunrise . He got into hot water with his big voice . Once , he broke up a whole day 's governingby proposing that his opponent be hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his anatomy , on a yard-arm . Keel-hauling , he said , was much too good for the Governor . The Governor had been born inland , and had never so much as set foot even in a yawl . After his one term , James Prince came home to look after the steaming of the oak knees for his ships and to prophesy the rest of his life that the state and nation were going to the dogs because they did n't have sailors to run things . Another earlier Prince was a man apart , even among his own people and friends on Menhaden . He had been second officer on a bark that was lost off in the middle of the South Atlantic . He and some others of the crew knocked around in a long-boat for some . weeks , with nothing to look at but waves . The provisionsgave out , and slow starvation set in . Two or three of the men went crazy and jumped over to the sharks . They finally drew lots and ate one of their number . Isaac Prince was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigate . He got his head cleared of the fogs it had been in for some weeks , and got back home by several stages . He got back into sailoring after a year or two . But people never felt the same about the man again . Even his own relations gave him a widep154berth when they met him on the Menhaden roadways . Children would n't go within ten fathoms of him . He got so he did not come home much . Stayed at sea . He was called Cannibal Prince to his dying day . Isaac Prince did n't do much to make friends , either . Kept to himself . When a Prince got to living to himself , he did a good job at it . Like his own father , Will thought . Some old Prince kink coming out in him . Then there was Cain Prince . He was the first of the clan to broaden out and draw his pencil lines down in under and up again into the Pacific . He was the first to go around the world in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to name children . He and his brother Abel did not mix any more than oil and water . That was odd , too , because they were twins . They fought like cats and dogs , all the time they were growing up and after . Abel got the Prince house  --  both shares of it  --  and Cain flew the coop and built himself a new shipyard of his own on the north end of Menhaden . They had to dredge a mile of channel each time they launched a ship there . But they launched them . Cain could have built a ship on the hill , and gotten her off somehow . He was that way . Cain watched his brother , and each time he laid down a keel down here in the cove , he laid down one up there a little longer . They hated each other . The way only brothers can do it . Cain got on Abel 's nerves . His brother got ahead of him in everything . Abel finally took to drinking hard . That would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrimony . He picked out the worst kind of woman . Slack . And he went downhill fast . Cain bought what was left of this shipyard down in the cove , and the Prince house , after Abel died . Abel got pneumoniafrom lying out in the wet bayberries all one night , after a spree . Cain never came nigh the house , the day they buried Abel . They had n't spoken for six years . There was something about Cain 's name . Parents ought to be more careful about giving their children certain names . It might mean harm . There was FaithlessCondon . His mother did not know what Faithless meant . That ignorant . It sounded pretty to her . But when her son was man-grown , he lived right up to that wrong name he 'd been given . Cain had something in him . Maybe it was the name . Folks down on the Princes  --  and there were lots of them , naturally , on Menhaden  --  said it was the Old Boy in the stink of onions . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made Jem White go aloft when he was blind-sick , and he a father of six , and Jem fell and spattered his brains on the after deck . A lot of his men Cain never brought home . And one came home raving and had to be kept in bull-chains in his attic the rest of his life . People heard him bellowingall over the island , night-times , when the moon was at the full . What Cain did to him , nobody ever found out . Could n't make head or tail of it . Not with the man that way . But the fellow kept saying some- thing about a mark of fire that came out right on the middle of Captain Cain 's forehead on dark nights at sea . Said he 'd seen it plain as plain , blazing like the morning star . It sounded crazy . But there must have been something or other . Something bad . Cain had left the Prince name on the maps of the world . He stumbled on a strait nobody knew was there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cain Prince probably made it with his own keel . When he had his heart set on going through something , he went through , that was all there was to it . Anyway , there it was , Prince Strait , on the map of the southern hemisphere . Cain died of a stroke . It began in a quarrel with a mate who was new to Cain and dared to stand up for his rights . It was in the South Pacific . He was buried down in under there . There was something queer about his burial at sea . The Prince people at home never did get a clear versionof what happened . The new mate was closemouthed . He did n't have much to say , naturally , to the family . But they heard stories from the fo'castle and pieced them together . There was nothing in the log . Just the note that it was a bright , clear day , and the wind east-northeast . In the mate 's firm schoolboy 's hand . But from the bits of talk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an appearance on the ship an hour or so after the service of burial . Had stowed away until then . Maybe . Anyway , it was aP157wickedly cross tom-cat , and it turned things upside down for two weeks . Lots of the men got clawed . They gave it a wide berth . Even the mate hardly dared to go into the captain 's cabin , where the cat bunked . ' The mate slept on a mattress outside . They put the creature ashore , first chance they got . On some island of the Fiji group . A terrific thunderstorm swept down on them when they were doing it . The ship 's boat was nearly swamped . Lightning almost dripping from all their noses . None of them liked to talk about the businessmuch . Of all the Princes , though , Will liked best to rememberCap'n Samuel . Perhaps what was left of the ship 's wheel was still held fast in the bones of his great hands , down under the reef off Whaleboat . P158WILL WAS IN the middle of the Gallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a clear , cold day , the sun out bright all the time . Just before the sun went down , something happened . Without a sign of warning , the sky was suddenly full of hollow wedges made up of hundreds of thin wedges with wings on each one of them . They were all headed north , and all the little wedges kept time with their wings . The hoarse voice of Spring came down to Will 's ears as he went along under the elms , in a thousand faint trumpets . The backbone of Winter was broken . It would n't be long before there would be white anemones in place of white piles of snow in the woods . They took away the brush around the house two nights later . Will made a bonfire of it . The evening was calm , and the long feather of smoke stood up almoststraight into the sky . It was getting dark , and after a little it was hard to tell the new stars from the rising sparks . The smoke leaned over and lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of wild geese , and Will could hear them crying out their warnings as they edged away from the sight of the flames he was tending . After that evening , the spears of green began to come up through the dead grass . P159Will did not seem to himself the same person of a year ago . It was hard to think he was the same one who had come down the hill with his father and . mother in the wind . It seemed half a lifetime away . He had shot up an inch or two . He had got his whole growth now . His hands and feet did not bother him the way they used to be doing all the time . His voice had settled down low for good , and it did not surprise him sometimes by going squeaky . But that was n't the main thing . His voice would n't have made so much difference to him , anyway . Will did not do much talking . No more now than he used to out on Whaleboat . Uncle Frank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was something very much deeper than his voice . Will felt good to be alive , as he had not felt in all the years he could remember . His mind did not keep on going so much by itself when he was working or when he had gone to bed . Will could lie on his bed for an hour and listen to the peepers outside the house , and not once slip down into the black seaweed , even when he was going downhill into sleep . Will had put the things that used to bother him out of his head . The monotone of the surf on Whaleboat , his father 's angry words to his mother . They were like things out of somebody else 's family history . Some family he had read about in a book . His father was still out there on Whaleboat . But he was beginning to be unreal to Will . He had been long enough outside Will 's life to begin to fade . Will didP160not think of him more than once or twice a week , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . It was coming good weather . His father had got through the Winter all right . He would get through Winters and Winters to come . He did n't want anybody to trouble about him . He would live out there by himself for years . Will knew of other lobstering men who had done that . He would be there just the same , only dirtier and grayer and more stooped , in the years to come , when Will would return in the Summers . Perhapswith his own sons . " Yes , your grandfather lives out there on Whaleboat . All sole alone . Always has done it . Yes , catches lobsters  --  he 's always done that for a living . Likes to be alone . " Will 's sons would wonder and puzzle their small heads about him . His father had dropped Will and his mother like a red-hot iron . There was n't any call for them to waste pity on him at all . He never wasted any on them . Somehow , Will 's getting ready to go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his father . Will knew he would n't worry nearly so much about how things were going on Whaleboat once he got out of sight of the low island lying like a black wall on the Winter sunset . Even the gulls left it alone in the Winter . They stuck close to Menhaden , and the silence of the middle ocean moved in and included the island where his father lived . The silence would grow , P161when Will got away , and cover over all the year . That was all . Will 's mother would not go up on the hill to have a look for the thread of smoke out there in the midst of the silence each night . Will had done that up until lately . He did n't do it any more . Spring was here , and the gulf between him and his father was widening out , for the years to come . His father might finish by drowning . Many of the lonely-livers of the coast did . Got careless as their hands and legs got stiff with age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened after a day 's work  --  they did n't look sharp . There was just an empty dory bobbing on the swell , and the oars drifting away . Like James Alexander . He had gotten old and too much in the habit of being sure of himself . They all did . He went that way . He had an enormous moustachethe color of cornsilk . Bleached by the wind . Moustaches on Menhaden often got that color . James Alexander 's should have been snow white . His hair was . But the bleaching wind made it turn yellow . The moustache was all Will could remember of his face . There was n't anything much of the face left , after it happened . But the moustache was there just the same . Will remembered he had his arms up over where his face had been . David made Will look at it . Oh , well , Will did n't think about things like that so often now . He had n't thought of James Alexander for over two months . That was a good sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nine days in the water . Will used to think of him every night , on the way down into deep sleep . It would get so he might go for whole years without thinking of those lifted arms . His father would join James Alexander in his memory . Only to be remembered now and then . Suddenly , and without hurting his mind as it used to do . Some old hold his father had had on him was broken now . Only to be remembered as something that was finished . Drowned . James Alexander . His father . He would like to recall his father as he looked at just one time  --  if he could . Not the way he looked at the cove when he had told Will to stay behind with his mother . He would like to remember him as he stood gazing into the sun with David in his arms . Nobodyin the world could have a brighter or better memory of his father than Will might . It was only a year ago , and already it was like somethingthat he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill , dead and gone before his time . All of it . A whole year since Will had seen his father 's face . He had n't seen it that day last August . He wondered if it had changed much . He probably would n't see it before he left Menhaden . Perhaps his mother did not see the change in him . But Will felt new all over , inside and out . He did not find himself stopping in the middle of doing somethingand thinking and thinking , without getting ahead . He had put on weight . Uncle Frank 's old pants wereP163not loose on him now . There was a new calmness about every move he made and everything he thought about . The business of his body had cleared up . He knew all about men and women . It did n't worry him any more . lie did n't have to think of it all as a joke to keep his mind from being hurt by it . His mind did not run on it any more . He knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe . One of the reasons why he wanted to get to Darmouth was the chance to get ahead fast enough so he could get married and make use of what he knew . Get ahead and make a living . Get married . And he was sure he 'd pick out a woman he would n't have to twit with looking other men 's way . Not one who would want a second man for his body 's sake . No Mari ! Uncle Frank had n't noticed the change in Will . That was certain . Will knew Uncle Frank was worried about the chance of his staying native and sticking to Menhaden and turning out to be a lobsterman , like all the other Menhaden boys . Uncle Frank had been worriedall Winter long . He had n't ever come right out and said anything . But he had talked all the time of what great things the Princes had always done in the old days . Oh , Will knew what his uncle was up to . He was bound he would wake Will up . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uncle . Perhaps there 'd been a month or so when Will had hung back and had n't gone ahead with his idea at all. things had gone on that way , there would have been a great risk . But that afternoon out on Whaleboat , cleaning up the cabin there , fixed all that . There was n't any risk any more . Uncle Frank had been good as gold . He had really helped Will a lot . Will would never forget this past Winter and the stories . They had given him a look into a lovely world he had n't known much about before . They had built up a family pride in him he would never lose . But it was that dirty little house where his father lived that had really done the most . His uncle did not know what had happened . He went right on with his talking about the great things that had been done in the old times . Will loved him for it . He smiled inside , but he never let Uncle Frank know he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he used to feel about his father , but a deep way , too . Maybe that might not really have been only love he had felt for his father . It might have been a kind of jealousy . With David there . " What would you say to it , if I invited my Cousin Rupert down here this Summer , Will ? " Will was taken by surprise . It was at breakfast , and they had the windows open for the first time in the Spring . The good smell of green grass was coming in . " You 'd like Cousin Rupert , Will . You two would hit it off great together . " " Have you invited him to come , Frank ? " Will 's mother was the first to speak . " Well , no . But I 've been sounding him out in my last letters . It would do him good . He says he needs aP165rest . No Europe for him this year . He wants a real rest . I believe he might think of coming . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could come ! " Will smiled to himself . His mother did not guess that Rupert Prince was another move in the game Uncle Frank was playing at . To keep Will from going native . " It would do Will all sorts of good , " Uncle Frank said , " to have a look at one of us who 's made somethingof himself in life . Got on . We do n't all of us take a back seat . And Cousin Rupert might know of some particular school where Will could go and learn to do some particular thing he 's best suited for . What do you say to it , Will ? " Will wanted like anything to say , " Yes , of course . " But he was afraid his uncle would find out he was smiling inside . He did n't say a word . " Will would love to get acquainted with Rupert , " Mrs. Prince spoke up , " I 'm sure . It would do them both good . It 's dull for Will in the Summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will ? " " Oh , I do n't know . It is n't so bad , Mother . " " Rupert has a little sloop somewhere or other . Martha'sVineyard , or some place like that , " said Uncle Frank . " He might want to bring her down here and get in a little sailing . Try out our piece of the ocean . Take Will for some good trips . " " That would be fun , would n't it , Will ? "   " Yes . " It was all Will trusted himself to say . His uncle manoeuvring to get him away from his lobster pots ! And thinking all the time he was so smart about it ! " Guess I 'll write Rupert , and ask him to bring his boat along , too . " It was all settled , easily as could be . Uncle Frank went around the house beaming all over . Will could see that his mother was excited also . " Rupert can have the other front room . " " He insists on paying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays all Summer , we might let him pay something towards the house . But we should n't want him to think he was just a Summer boarder . " " No , of course not . He 'll have to get used to the idea of being a visitor . " " Funny we never thought of taking a Summer boarder . Lots of Menhaden people do . " " Yes . It 's one way to get something to pay the taxes with . We might do that another year , Louise . " Will was really excited himself about having Rupert Prince visit them . Having a writer around the house , when he might be going to be a writer , too . He might pick up some ideas that would help him . Will was making dozens of new traps this Spring . He was hard at it , away into the long twilights . He was going to make sure he had enough money to start in on next Fall . He 'd be able to sell the whole lot of traps in September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the boat he had fixed up . Uncle Frank never would have any use for it . You could always get a pretty fair amount for a boat . Even an old one . He sang more that Spring than he had ever sung in his life . Not loudly . Not when people were around . But low and to himself , as he rowed from trap to trap , as he nailed the slats on his spruce bows and whittled out pine buttons for the trap doors . The bluets spread up over the hill behind the cove , like frosting sugar spilled over the new grass . Then the dandelions took their place and covered half the world up to the blue sky and the Prince cupola with gold coins . A few days later , and they were grayheaded ghosts . Small bubbles the first light wind carried away . Next , it was daisies , the minute the dandelions had gone . Their heads knocked against Will 's feet as he went up the hill in the dusk . Their whiteness startled him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded in wherever there was a little gully . Daisies and buttercupscame right down to Will 's traps piled up on the shore . He found that columbines had grown up through the slats of his traps one morning . Purple wild sweetpeas , too , all wound through them . Every hour of daylight he could find Will pegged away on his traps . He was doing well with his lobsters . He had to build two new cars to hold them and keep them alive till the Summer people began to come . Will was feeling good all over . Uncle Frank went around with a smile on his face.  |p168He  broke the news one noon that Cousin Rupert had written to say he was coming . Sloop and all . Will 's mother began on Rupert 's room that very afternoon . She was going to paper it and paint it . But Will himself sat for an hour or so that same evening with his chin in his hands and his mind full of the thoughts which had bothered him a year ago . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corningmade him think of the old things he thought were buried over . David and his father . He looked off to sea now and then . Whaleboat seemed to have come nearer to Menhaden in the spreading twilight . One or two stars were coming out up over the hill where the man with the burning spade had stood a little over a year ago . It was a fine June evening , warm as Summer . Yet Will shivered . P169WILL 'S MOTHER WAS all of a twitter with excitement . She had put on the new silk dress she had made , the first thing in the morning , and she had been so afraid of getting a spot on it she had n't dared to do anything natural . She ran back and forth from the kitchen up toRupert 's room , making sure of the last things . She had it changed some of the pictures around . She had put two of the oldest portraits of Princes up in the bedchamber Rupert was going to occupy . One was Will 's greatgrandfather , and Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't anything left to dust anywhere . She had even used shoe blacking on the fire tongs . It came off on Uncle Frank 's hands when he took them up . He had smooched some of the blacking on his new shirt . Will 's mother had made Will hunt out the whitest birch chunks in the woodshed , ones with the bark still on but peeling . She had folded up white paper and made little fans to go in the fireplaces that were n't going to have fires lit in them . She had given Uncle Frank a start . He had come into the south sitting room when she was kneel-ingin front of the fireplace there . She had one of the , paper fans she had made in her hand . " Louise ! " " What , Frank ? "   " The fan  --  the paper fan ! " " What 's the matter with it ? " " Good Lord !  --  Do n't you know the old supersti-tion ? " " No . What superstition ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to make away with yourself ! " " For goodness ' sake , Frank , what are you talking about ? " " Why , did n't you know the people who committed suicide in the old days used to have a paper fan handy and clutch it in their hands the last thing they did , to let the world know they had taken their own lives ? " " No , I never heard tell of such a thing . " " Well , they did . That 's what they say . " " My goodness ! " The woman dropped the little pleated piece of paperon the hearth as if it was something hot . Then she laughed and wrinkled up her nose . She stooped down and picked the thing up and put it in place across the andirons . Frank began to laugh , too . It was a good joke on Louise . She had smudged her nose from the fireplace . He had to tell her to go and take a look at herself in the looking-glass . Uncle Frank was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kept pulling out his old-fashioned stem-winding watch and looking at it . It was big as a turnip and made a huge bulge in the lower pocket ofP171his vest . Frank had n't worn that vest or that watch since the day Louise and his brother had gotten married . " Do you think the stage will be on time ? " " I think so , " said Uncle Frank , " unless there are a lot of Summer folks also coming down today . That would slow Lem Toothaker up . Getting in their duds and tackle . " Uncle Frank had put on his best **25;2868;TOOLONG coat and his striped trousers , to go with his gold watch and heavy chain . It was a regular oxchain , he said , but he was very proud of it . Uncle Frank was nervous about Will 's still being down at the cove . He had told him what time they might look for Cousin Rupert . He went out and called to Will , though it lacked a quarter of an hour to eleven o'clock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had gotten to be very good at it . He answered his uncle 's hail and went on sliding the big wooden needle in and out the cord and drawing the knots tight . A bumble bee was blundering through the purple clusters of the wild sweetpea blossoms . They were heavy with honey . It was very still . Oh , well , he 'd better be thinking of goingup to the house . " William ! " His uncle 's voice was right over him . Will looked up and saw the striped trousers . He raised his eyes higher and saw Uncle Frank 's hair still show- ing the watermarks of the comb where he had carefullyplatted it spank down over his bald place . " You ought to be all dressed , Will . Cousin Rupert will be here any minute now . You 'd better shake a leg and come right up . " " All right , Uncle Frank . I 'm coming . " Will got to his feet . He put the needle away and started up the bank . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot was disappearing over the ridge . Will took his sweet time climbing the hill . When he got to the house , his mother and his uncle were alreadyout front by the road . He went upstairs . He had n't really meant to dress up this morning . He had deliberately decided not to , in fact . Something about all his mother 's bustle had made him stubborn . But if Uncle Frank said he ought to , he would . He changed his clothes and washed his hands . He could n't get all the tar off them , though , or the smell of new codline he had been using . His hands did not look much like a future author 's ! He scrubbed and scrubbed . No use . He took much more time than he needed to . He did it on purpose . While he was still at it , he heard the grinding of wheels on the road below . He went over to the window and looked down . The stage had arrived . Lem Toothaker was flying around . Lem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the stage was piled high with baggage . Lem was taking down bag after bag . P173They were almost covered over with white and blue labels . Too many bags for one person . A big man was getting out of the vehicle on the side towards Will . He made the whole rig look small . And the Menhaden stage was n't any baby buggy . It would hold six people easy . This big man was the only passengerthis morning . He was getting out backwards , the door was so small for him . Will could see only the man 's back so far . It was an enormous back . The shoulderswere wider than the carriage door , and the man 's thighs were gigantic . It struck Will that there was too much to the man . Too much body . That was his first impression . It struck him so that he stood there staring down on the new arrival without making a motion . The man got to the gravel at last and turned around , facing the house . The front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigness even more than his back . He had an immense face , covered over top and bottomwith golden hair . Golden was the word . It was full of glints . His eyes were almost lost in the masses of it . They were very small eyes , anyway . His vandykebeard put them out . His hands were golden and hairy , too , all over their backs . It may have been the checks in his trousers , but he seemed wider in his legs than any man Will had ever seen . His coat did not fit tight . It was shaggy and loose and big as a blanket on him . " Ah ! this is Louise , I suppose . " The man 's voice boomed like a foghorn close by in thick weather . " How are you ? " He made a business of shaking hands hard with Will 's mother . " It 's a great pleasure to meet Dan 's wife . I 've heard a good deal about Dan 's good-looking wife ! And here she is !  --  Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Will 's mother was blushing and flustered . Uncle Frank was trying to say something easy and pleasant . But his voice was drowned out in the rolling , golden voice that filled the whole road and hillside and came up and filled the room Will was in . It was a paralyzingthing . " And where 's the lad you wrote so much about , Frank ?  --  Where 's the lad ? " Will felt every muscle in him stiffen . Lad ! The word made him feel sick . And he was the subject for Cousin Rupert to work on . His Summer 's subject ! He threw the towel down he was holding . Threw it blindly without looking . It hit the pitcher and draped itself around it , one end trailing in the bowl of used water . Uncle Frank was hopping about down below , stumblingover the piles of Rupert 's luggage . " Will 's right around here somewhere . He 'll be here in a minute . He 's  --  " " Here , Frank ! I 'll shoulder some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Too much for you . I 'm used to toting my own stuff . I have n't lived in Africa for nothing . Here ! " P175Rupert bent down and took up a mountain of luggage . He was even more gigantic now as he came down under the elms towards the house , ahead of Will 's mother and his uncle . Uncle Frank had an armful of things . Even Will 's mother had a bag in each hand . Will felt something cold as the ocean water when you put your hand down into it deep on a Summer day . All through him . He went down the creaking stairs . The newcomer could not see very well where he was going for so much in his arms . Will 's mother was trying to get ahead of him to show him the way . Rupert almost ran head on into Will . Will reached up and picked two of the biggest bags off the man 's shoulders . Rupert stopped in his tracks . Ile towered over Will . He had to look down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . The stranger looked at Will for a quarter of a minute , without saying a thing . And Will looked back at him . It seemed half an hour . Will tried to say something , but he could n't open his mouth . He just stood there staring . " Well , well ! So this is the lad . Let me see . Let me see . . . . Hm ! He 's an up-and-coming boy , all right . He 's pretty well filled out his pants ! Not much more room ! " Rupert 's voice was booming so the whole house trembled . Things on the tables . Things on the walls . " Takes after his daddy , he does . Chip off the old block . Off the old Prince block ! Those old pirates never 'll be dead while he has that pair of eyes in his head ! " He tipped his beard back and laughed . " No , Sir-ee ! " He took a long time to take Will all in . Finally , he had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Pm not glad to see you , Will !  --  Or is it Bill they call you ?  --  You do n't mind what they call you , do you , so long as they call you to dinner  --  eh ? " He burst into deep belly-laughter again . " I 'm tickled to see you . I 've been wanting to see you for months . How d'ye do ! Put her there , Bill ! " The man threw down his bags , and his big , golden , hairy paw came out . Will did not want to shake hands with him . But he was dazed through and through . He set down his bags , and his hand went out weakly , to meet the man 's halfway . Rupert Prince crushed all of Will 's fingers in a grip that swallowed up Will 's whole hand like a gunny sack . Will thought he was never going to let go . It was over at last . And Will carried up all the luggageto Cousin Rupert 's room . There were about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks . Between things , he said he ought to keep in form . He could knock some golf balls around up on the hill . The turf up there around the graveyard would be just the right sort of place . " Bully !  --  bully place ! " It struck Will that this was the worst thing the man had said so far . Up on the hill . Will had never been up there since that day , with his father and mother . The last day the family had allP177been together . David and all . The last day they probably would be together . Until there was another silent one of them to go beside David . Perhaps not even then . Not if it happened to his father . In the deep water around Whaleboat . Bodies did not often come up out of the kelp forests out there . The hill up above was really their parlor now . The only parlor they had , where they could all come together . Knocking golf balls around in the best room they had . The older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tall men , tough as bronze , who played their game of sendingships around the globe . A silly little rubber ball knocked around over their graves . Cousin Rupert never would feel the way Will did about it . You could n't expect him to . He was n't going to go up there himself some day . He would be buried anywhere he happened to be when he died . He belonged to the outside . It did n't matter where they put him . Any place in the world would do . He did n't belong to Menhaden . He belonged to the people who read his book about one woman having the best of two different men , at the same time . Mari ! Cousin Rupert said he had n't a chick or a child . " That is , " he added with a wink at Uncle Frank , " not a regular one ! Not a right-hand one ! " And he laughed so he shook the slim marble hand holding the bouquet of everlasting roses on the mantelpiece . Will knew what he meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Will 's mother . Will went scarlet . P178He could tell from the looks of Uncle Frank 's face , that Uncle Frank did not think so , either . Will could n't get the thought of the graveyard out of his mind all through their dinner . There 'd be nobodyto take the trouble to bring Rupert Prince back to the old family burying ground when his time came . It would n't be right , anyway , for a man like him to lie up there . With his ideas of wives . Wives with samples of men , collections of men . They were n't the ideas the Prince men had about wives at all . Not the ideas of Will 's own father . It occurred to Will that it was lucky for Rupert his father had not heard him say what he had just said . Rupert Prince did not belong up there . " When are you going to get married , Rupert , and settle down ? " Uncle Frank asked the question more to fill in than anything else . Cousin Rupert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of buying up a spring when you have a whole lake to drink out of ? What 's the use of it , Frank ?  --  Tell me that , you old woman-hater , you ! " Not the kind of a man to be put up on a hill . From the looks of the labels on Cousin Rupert 's luggage , he must have been pretty nearly everywhere . There were one or two countries or cities Will had never even heard of in geography . When he got the chance , Will asked politely about those places . It was n't easy to get a word in edgewise . Cousin Rupert was talking so most of the time .   " Oh , Casablanca ?  --  That 's a city in Morocco , Bill . West Coast . A nice enough little town . But beastly cold  --  beastly ! Gets all the cold winds off the Atlantic . 1 f you want to be cold good and proper , go to the West Coast of Morocco . Greenland is n't in it , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill . And devilishly good-looking women . Mm-mm-mm ! " He puckered up his lips and made a sound like a kiss . Will noticed Rupert 's lips for the first time . He could n't help staring at them . There was an immense lot to them , for all Rupert 's beard came up to their edges . They were thick and curved-out . They made Will think of very unpleasant things . Fungi with red edges on the dead spruce stumps  --  the ones that were a livid color and curled over . It was surprising that lips could show so much on a bearded man . Now the beard was near to , Will could see that it had a pinkish tinge to it . The color on red ants . Obscene-looking . Damplooking . And awfully alive . Will had to look away even when Rupert was speaking to him . Cousin Rupert had stayed in Casablanca four months , finishing up his last novel . Not many white men there to talk to . " Some Britishers , though . Jolly tine fellows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And there was one Britisher 's wife  --  ! " Rupert did n't go on . Maybe , he caught the expression on Uncle Frank 's face . The boat ? Uncle Frank was asking . " Oh , yes  --  the sloop . That 's taken care of all right , P18o Frank . I 'm having her sailed up by a good man of mine in Gloucester . He looks after her for me in the Winter . A-Number-one fellow . Knows his rigging and his keels as well as he knows his own . He 's bringing the boat up next week . She 's a pretty little piece of pine . Smart ! sits up saucy in the water and shows a pretty stern and pair of heels to all the sloops in her class at Gloucester and Nahant and Marblehead . Had to break the bank to buy her . I got her from a millionaire who knows sail from A to Z , as he knows women ! Wait till you see her ! " Rupert talked as if all he had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba and South America for him . Men made of money would come running over to sell him things . He talked about everything . There was nothing he did n't know about . Food he had eaten and liked , in odd places . He had a weakness , he said , for good food . Food you can find in only one place . That was the kind . Bouillabaisse ?  --  But only that made by Baptiste in the Three Mullets in Juan des Pins , on the Coast of the Moors  --  not the dishwater on the rest of the Riviera . Snails , of Nantes . The chitterlings of Stow-onthe-Wold , in the Cotswolds . All other chitterlings were mere guts  --  so many guts ! Nowhere else on God 's green earth but Stow-on-the-Wold . Worth a rainy Summer in England . Some unpronounceable messes of North Wales , at Betwys-Coed . Some sort of hash made out of parts of pigs people did not mention withP181women around , in Hongkong . There was only one city in the world where you could find decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something about the waste of the grapes fed to the cows made the miracle . Everywhere else in France  --  even in Balzac 's country  --  they cleaned the tripe out too much , and ruined the flavor . Hearing Rupert talk , Will got the impression that this cousin of Uncle Frank 's had done nothing but eat his way around the earth . And eat parts of animals the clean folks on Menhaden would call just plain guts . The older Prince people had gone around the world looking for clean , lovely treasures . Teak and amber from the Baltic and snowy marble of Carrara , beads , and bright prints from Leghorn . To fill their parlor mantels , not their bellies . " Oh , come now , Rupert . A Maine cods ' - head chowderis n't a thing to turn your nose up at ! " Uncle Frank put in . " That 's right , Frank . Say , do you know , I 've been hankering for one of those chowders for years ! Yes , Sir !  --  hankering is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A man hankers for a woman , and he hankers for good food . Yes , Sir !  --  a cods ' - head chowder I must have ! " " I 'll cook you one tonight , Mr. Prince , " said Will 's mother . She was carried away at the prospect . " Fine !  --  But no Mr. Prince , I say . You can jolly well call me Rupert ! No Misters in this house . I am atp182home here . You 're Louise to me , and I 'm Rupert to you and Bill and Frank . " He was a man who took your breath away . There were n't any fences or stonewalls in the world for him . He wanted a boy he was old enough to be the father of to call him by his first name . " I 'm Will , not Bill , " said Will . " All right , Will !  --  Will it is ! and no harm done ! " There was no riling the man up . He was goodnaturedabout everything . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that his mother 's face was lit up with excitement and pleasure . She hung on everything Cousin Rupert said . She did n't mind his coarseness . She tipped her head to one side and looked up at her strange new cousin with shining eyes . She 'd never heard a man talk the way he did . Never in all her life . She took to him as though she had always been listening to such a man of the world , who 'd been everywhere and done everything . She was hungry for something like this . She had never heard or seen the likes of Rupert before . She said so before the meal was done . Rupert was holding forth about the peasant women of Haute Vienne , below Limoges . Looks ?  --  Greek coins of Syracuse right out of the artist 's hands could n't hold a candle to them ! And bodies ?  --  Well , he 'd been around a bit , and seen bodies . But these were the only big ones that could move the way a poem moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P183Will felt the blood rush to his face , and he bent over and examined the lacework of the bones of the shad on his plate . Lace , or else it was a little fir tree after all its spills had gone . A Christmas tree ready to be burned , the July after . Shad bones . Cousin Rupert talked on about the peasant women . The sunlight flickered in through the elms ' leaves and made green and gold lace of the white tablecloth and his mother 's face . The windows were open . Robins were singing beyond the stonewall that slanted down the hill to the bay . The clean smell of fresh white daisies was coming in , like the smell of new butter . The man who had come to spend the Summer with them was telling all about the wonderful life that reached around the world . Full of glittering , groomed women and men . Women and mountains . The cobalt color of the Mediterranean when you looked straight down into it from the Tir-aux -- pigeons at Monte Carlo . The haze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girdled cork oaks twisted into storybook things in the strangely still mountain glens of the Pyrenees . Daffodils climbing wild up through a Rivieraforest . Flowers blossoming whiter than the snow itself at the edge of a glacier in the upper Alps . Men who sailed yachts into Mentone and San Remo . Men who were men built like Uncle Frank and Will 's father but who lived at ease among Old Etonians and Old Blues of Oxford and Cambridge , living correctly and wearing the right clothes in houses in Borneo and villas in South Africa . People painting pictures of naked women . Writers putting what they heard in a strange city into books . Full of life and going where life bubbled and sparkled , glittered and shone the brightest , like waves in the sun . A wonderful world . The one Will was going to live in some day , maybe . The one he wanted to live in . The one people on Menhadendid n't know about . Not now . The same one the old Princes had moved out to in their tall-masted ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Carved clocks of France , colored prints of Venice , tables of eighteenth-century English Georgian houses . And yet , all through Rupert 's talking , Will was seeingthe bleak , white gulls of Whaleboat , seeing the fierce little violets beside a Whaleboat spring , a sandpeep'snest with three minute eggs , a single marsh-hen standing black against the low moon . A light in a lighthouse . Lonely , little northern things . The only things he had had to put away deep in his memory . Some of them he had hated , some of them he had loved . But they all were his . He clung to them hard , hating Rupertwith all the power there was in him . Standing up for the things he had known and learned to love . His things . Rupert Prince went on , telling what lay ahead for Will in the life to come . He jumped from women 's gowns in Paris to thatched cottages of Berkshire , from the East to the West . Politics and history and geography . Colleges and shops where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of their bare feet . Guns  --  shotguns  --  built in London to fit not only a man 's right arm and shoulder , but his character and temper , too . Codes of manners . Women 's bare shoulders . Wonderful words  --  the words of life . And still , during all the man 's brilliant talk , Will had been feeling an odd doubt creeping up into his mind and spreading out like a stain . He was hearing what he had always wanted to hear . What he had expected to hear , and talk about , too , himself , sometime , years ahead . Yet now he was actually hearing about the world ahead of him , it seemed there might be something false and hollow in it . Something rotten and had . Like the dark rot in the pith of a beautiful pine tree that had stood where he had looked at it for years , so firm and sure . But the wind had found out about what was really at the tree 's heart . It had come upon the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its center all dead and dark , from the ugly sore laid open to the daylight . The things that kept men going , out there in the world outside Menhaden , that kept people like Rupert Prince going  --  they might be dark and rottenand full of emptiness . Here was Rupert himself . Thinking of women 's bodies all the time , and pursing up his thick , red lips . 1 le knew about all the clean , hard , shining things , and still he loved the soft and dark things people thought about in bedrooms , at night . Will found himself wanting to stand up for theP186plain people of Menhaden . For the plain , everyday way they talked and lived . For lobster fishing , for diggingclams . For the way Menhaden people sat at a church sociable , without saying much of anything exceptsomething about the weather , feeling they were all hands . Will wanted to stand up and shout out that this way of living was just as good as Rupert Prince 's . Just as full of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . The sound of the Maine robins and the smell of the Maine daisies out there in the hot sun were just as wonderfulas flamingoes like flying islands , mimosas , and avenues of palms . Rupert Prince no need to come back here and tell them what living was like . No need to tell them they did n't have things just as good as the things he had put into his novels , the things he had gone to the other side of the earth to see . These men of Menhaden were just as full of life as the Summer visitors that came each year to rusticate . Just as full of life as the men who gave themselves to the women in Rupert 's books . When they went courting , they sat silent and bashful , but they were just as full of life and the children that were to come . They did n't talk Rupert 's way , but they lived just as hard and did just as important things . Will thought of his father out on Whaleboat . He would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping his balance with one foot up on the gunwale and the other on the boat 's bottom , keeping erect as theP187swell came up in under him and tipped his dory this way and that . Hauling away at the slanting rope . He was just as sure of himself as Rupert Prince was . He was doing something just as good . Something alive . Will wanted to get up and shout , and stop his cousin 's talking . But he could n't say a word . His mother was like a new being altogether . She was alive with light . Light Will had never seen on her face . But Uncle Frank did n't seem to Will to be having a good time at the dinner at all . He was like a little boy who had set off a piece of fireworks he had n't expected to be so bright . Will could tell that lot of the things his cousin talked about shocked his uncle . It was easy to tell when Uncle Frank was shocked . He picked up things on the table he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knife , and put them right down again . They sat at the table a long time . It was clear it was going to be a very different Summerfrom any one that any of them had had in the past . Will thought of the two months ahead of him . I laving Rupert here would be like having all the windowsand doors open in the house , day and night . Peoplehad no right to change things in other people 's houses . That other people had got used to . People got so they had little ways that meant everything to them . And nobody had any right to change them . Uncle Frank had a right to go off by himself as soon as he had left the table . Will had a right to go and be by himself . Will could see there was not going to be much chance of him or anybody else being by himself , this Summer , with Rupert around . Cousin Rupert in his first hour in the house was full of plans for all of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of daisies still came in through the open window . The things on the mantel were just as they always had been . But a great change had come over everything else . P189THAT FIRST TWO-HOUR meal with Rupert doing all the talking was only the beginning . Cousin Rupert took everything into his hands . He even went into the kitchen and cooked up French and Italian sauces to go with plain Maine haddock . He was up at crack of day , and down the hill into the ocean for his cold plunge . He sang at his dressing and shaving , when he came back . He routed out the whole house with the sound of his bigness . Will could hear his feet pounding up and down the stairs . His humming went through all the walls . His voice was always going even when his body was still . He felt so good at breakfast , lie made Will feel out of sorts and dull . He had the answer to every question . He never ran out of stories . The prints on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been to all the places the old people had gone to . And new ones . He had seen more than any of them had seen . The evenings Will loved so well were done with . There was no chance of sitting quiet and being alone when the others were still there in the room . Rupert sat up late and kept everybody paying attention to everybody else . When he went to bed , he made it clear it was time for everybody to go . Night owls did n't catch the early worms , he said .   " Time to turn in ! Pipe all hands below ! " He angered Will by using phrases of the old sailing ship days . He felt he had to live up to the house . If he could have , he 'd have had them go by bells instead of clocks . Sailing words seemed out of place in this man who played at sailing and did not make a living by it . Will got to going down after supper and staying down at the cove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be quiet and not have to listen to anybody talking . He wanted to lie on his back and look at the millions of July stars , with quick little thousands of stars of the fireflies around him . As he used to lie last Summer . But Rupert would miss him at the house and come down and sit beside him and smoke his big pipe . The stars put him out of loud talking , but he talked low and on and on . He spoiled the whole night and the fireflies with his glowing pipe . He smoked a big Germanmeerschaum always in the evenings . A man-sized smoke , he called it . It lasted three-quarters of an hour at a filling . He might smoke three pipes on end . And when he got up , he made it clear Will was to come up to the house , too . It was odd to see what was happening to Uncle Frank . He seemed to shrink up as the days went by . Will used to feel that his Uncle Frank filled up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much to say . Just being there was enough . Now he seemed curiously small , and just another listener in a corner . Sometimes he tried to talk , when before he had n't feltP191a call to . But his words got confused , and sounded wrong and flat . He knew it himself . He often went off to bed and left Rupert booming away at Will and his mother . He seemed to have grown small and unimportant . But it was just the other way round with Will 's mother . Where Uncle Frank had shrunk , she had expanded . She seemed suddenly to have become the most important person in the room . Rupert always asked her opinion first . Will got to feeling that Rupert Prince was really talking to her when he was speaking to UncleFrank and him . She was the one who mattered . Rupertmade her the center of the house . It was strange . She had never been at all like that out in the little house on Whaleboat , or even here this past year . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new way . She seemed surer of what she said . Talked more to the point . She did not remain , as she used to , on the fringe of her men folks ' life . She was in the midst of it . She was the midst of it . And she showed surprising good sense , and was full of ideas . She talked more than Will had ever heard a woman talk before . She was the only one who could compete with Rupertin talking . Will had never thought so much of his mother 's good looks before . She was good-looking , no getting around it . Her nose and chin were fine and delicate in the lamplight . She seemed young to be the mother of a grown-up son .   She blossomed out in new dresses Will had never expected to see her wear . She had been dressmaking for months , all the Spring long . She looked good in her dresses . Her skirts swept through the rooms in a way to make you take notice . Will could not recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince 's being there had made a great change in her . Will had never seen his mother wearing a light blue before . It was pretty on her , too . Will and Uncle Frank were both astonished when she settled the status of this Summer visitor one night at the end of the first week of his stay . She was brusque and business-like . They had never expected it of her . " We want it clearly understood , Rupert , that you are not to pay for your room but only for your board . After all , the room is no use to us and would be empty all Summer if you were n't in it . But it is fair for you to pay for your victuals . And we will take money from you for that . But only that . So that 's settled . " " Could n't be fairer , " said Rupert . " Suits me to a T ! " And he planked down the money with a laugh . " You 'd make a rattling good business woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " As if running this big house were n't a business ! " " Yes , by George ! I had n't thought of that . Of course it is ! But what I mean is managing men in an office and telling them what 's what , and keeping them all toeing the line . Straightening out their accounts . " " I might try my hand at that very thing , some day . "   " Well , trust me , you 'll make a smashing success at it . And give me the tip , and I 'll know where to come to find a person to look after my royalties , buy me my tickets , plan my itinerary , attend to my yacht and the hiring and firing of my men . Especially the firing !  --  Put her there , Louise ! Shake on it ! " Rupert Prince was always shaking hands , even when there was n't any call for it . And Will 's mother took his hand without a second 's hesitation . They seemed to have known each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excitement all day long . She would run in from the kitchen with a smudge of flour on her nose , and ask all their advice about the filling for a pie . She put them all at work around the house . She packed them all off with a basket apiece or a lard pail to get her some raspberries or blueberries . She was full of life and fun . She seemed to be making up for all those quiet years she had spent sweeping rooms on Whaleboat and picking up driftwood for kindlingalong the shores . Making up for lost time . Will was astounded , and he was very much pleased , too . Rupert was some good . He had never known he had such a woman for a mother . She was like a person who had been hungry and now suddenly had all she wanted to eat . She deserved her good time . It was worth putting up with Cousin Rupert to have his mother getting so much fun out of the Summer . Rupert was some use , anyway . Rupert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a program for every day , and he carried it out . He kept them rushing from one thing to the next . Uncle Frank hung back , but it was no go . He had to come along when Rupert got after him . Rupert was up on the hill with his golf clubs before breakfast . Then he was at the table , and getting up to open windows and letting in the morning breeze . He liked to eat in a wind best . Then he was out in the kitchen helping Will 's mother put up the lunch in the big , two-handled basket and in bottles . He insisted on eating out every noon if the weather was fair , or nearly fair . Every day was a picnic . A cloth spread out under the apple trees , and ants getting into the sandwiches and the sugar bowl . Millers dropping into the teacups . Coffee that cooled off too quick in the wind . Or it was a clambake on the shore , and Rupert bossing everybody , doing everything his way , building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making spoons out of clamshells and split sticks and making everybody use one whether he wanted to or not , makingUncle Frank and Will stand around . Talking and singing . Like most Maine coast folks , Uncle Frank and Will disliked eating outdoors . But it was no use to fight against Rupert . Will 's mother had n't ever cared to do it before , but now she seemed to think eating outdoors was a new kind of adventure . Rupert would pack them and the baskets into his sloop and have them eat under sail , or sail out and findP195an outer island to picnic upon . For the sloop had arrived . She was a slim , lovely thing . She stood up like anything in the briskest blow . Will never had gone so fast in his life before . And Rupert was all over her . His big body was supple as a cat 's . He was like quicksilver when his sail was up . He tested every rope and stay himself . He ran from the stern to the prow and out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half overboard tinkering the rudder post one minute . He was up the mast the next . He gave exactest orders , and the others had to do things exactly so . He gave everybodysomething to do . Even Will 's mother . And he saw to it that everything was done right . He was alwaysfull of life . But when he was out sailing , and a good breeze blowing , he was more alive than anything Will had ever seen . When Uncle Frank and Will got their feet on land , they felt like dropping down where they stood , they were so tuckered out , with Rupert 's energy . It got so Will used to hope that the wind would be ugly or the rain pouring down , every morning when he woke up . The bathing , though , was the worst of all . Rupert fairly lived in the water . He dove off the sloop into the open ocean water . It was like cracked ice , but he loved it , he said . He made Will go in , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor swimmer . He hated the water , and he was always all of a tremble with chill all the time he was in it . But Rupert would n't hear to his not going in . He kept at him . Will 's skin would be all gooseflesh , but he 'd have to dive in again . Rupert liked company in the water . He seemed to be dripping wet half the time . He 'd dry out all salt crystals on his body in the sun , and then back he would plunge . He could swim as fast and as easy as a frog . Will hated the water all the more because Rupert liked to be in it so much . He never got used to seeing Cousin Rupert in his bathing suit . The first time he saw him , he blushed red as a beet all over . The man did not wear the kind of suits other men among the Summer people wore . He did n't have any covering for his upper body at all . Will had thought the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any clothes on , he thought of him as too big for anything . He was huge . The only thing Rupert wore were short trunks . Uncle Frank never said a word , but Will could see he was awfully upset . Uncle Frank could no more have gone naked that way than he could have flown . He suffered all the time he was around where Rupert was swimming . Will was angry clean through . He was ashamed to have his mother there to see it . He was ashamed for himself , too . His mother did n't seem to notice anything wrong at all . She loved to see Rupert swim . Rupert went around almost naked half the day . He even ate lunch in his trunks . It got so Will saw Rupert 's hairiness when he was lying with his eyes closed and getting ready to go top197sleep . And it was Rupert who brought back to him troubled dreams . Will thought he had put all those secretand shamed nights out of his mind and his sleep . But now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed of himself . Even in the daytime he would catch himself slipping off into thinking of things that were like slime . Those things and Rupert Prince seemed somehow to go together . It was n't just the talk Rupert would get off into , although that made Will blush often enough . It was the idea of Rupert 's big body , too . His hairy nakedness bothered Will all the time . It was hard to find time to fit in his lobstering . Will had to get up early before the picnics Rupert planned to get the chance to attend to his traps . Or he might have to do his work by twilight , after he had been out in the sun all day and felt groggy and slow and dull . It was hard on him . He missed the right time of tide . His traps ran out of bait . He was n't doing nearly so well with his lobstering as last Summer . Half the traps he pulled up had nothing in them but worthless female crabs or the poisonous-looking sea-anemones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not , Rupert would take it into his head to go along with Will . He loaded the boat down so it was hard to row . He sat to one side of the stern seat and never thought of trimming ship to make it easier for Will to go fast . In his own sloop he was after them all to make them sit just so . In Will 's boat he never thought of minding the boss . It was hard to pull a trap with him sitting on one side , and with his great thighs lolling in the way of the drip of the trap . Worse still , he was bound he 'd take a hand at pulling the traps , too . He learned something about the trick , but he was slow at it and held Will up . He was a wizard at handling the ropes on his sloop . But he never could get on to pulling a lobster pot the right way . Will showed him over and over . But he got the slack of the warp in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He let up on the tension as he pulled , so that what lobsters there were in it slid out through the rings in the heading before the slats of the trap broke water . He 'd never learn how to do it Will 's way in a thousand years . He had n't begun as a boy . That was the trouble . No grown man can hope to learn the knack . The worst of it was , Rupertthought he was as good at it as Will himself . He thought so , and he said so . There was n't anything he could n't learn to do , he declared . That was his business  --  pickingup new tricks of all trades . That made Will angrier than everything else . But Will could n't say anything to him . That was the trouble with Rupert . He was a boaster . Nothing he could n't do better than the folks in the business . He could show South American Indians how to smoke rubber . He could give pointers to Central Americans on the art of raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollock . He was always bragging of the tight places he hadP199been in and how he had got out of them by the skin of his teeth . He had had close shaves all right . " It will take a smarter thing than a Tanganyika bullcrocodileto get your Uncle Dudley ! The crocodile that gets me for his meat shelf will have to get up early in the morning ! My name is n't written on any crocodile'steeth in the continent of Africa . " I know those babies . I 've been in the same river with them after dark . Like a lot of giant pigs gone crazy . Grunt just like pigs . But go ?  --  They can jolly well get through the water ! They come after you like an express train when they get to hankering for a leg of yours . " I had warned those black bastards of mine not to load my canoe so heavy . But there 's no arguing with a kinky-headed boy who does his hair up in curl-papers with mutton fat and bone hairpins and has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only argumentyou can use on them is the butt end of a rifle . " They had put about ten boxes too many into my boat . She was down to the water 's edge . But it was coming on dark and no light to transfer things . So I had to chance it . I gave the word to the boys , and they hoed in with their paddles and lit out . " We heard the crocks going it everywhere around . Must have been an Old Home week or something . Or a sparking party , more likely . A lot of she-crocks needinghe-attention . Needing it bad by the hullabaloo they were raising .   " I was n't hankering on interfering in any lovers ' relaxations . You do n't get any thanks from the interested parties . No , Sir-ee ! Not I ! I just sat there and kept my hair parted in the middle and tried to keep the tub trimmed . I left my finger marks in the wood every time one of those black beauties dipped too deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the mouth of that river all right , if it had n't been for one young crock getting inquisitive . He was damned inquiring , if you ask me . He 'd finished off all the love making he wanted to do , and now he was thinking about refreshments . He could smell those black boys of mine , and he came over . He thought the apple pie was all ready and the tea all turned out . " Maybe , we 'd have made that last twenty yards even then . But one of my boys had poor nerves . The crock nosed him over a little , and he let out a yell that could have been heard on the other side of Lake Tanganyika . That would n't have been so bad , but he also stood up . Got right up on his hind legs . " He learned by his mistake , though . He did n't have any hind legs to walk on in another second . The canoe turned over , and the crock sliced him in two clean as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Henry Crock over me , between me and the moonlight up above , as he turned over to try a piece of white meat after the dark . He came over fast . He almost got me . But I rammedp201my rifle into what I took to be an eye . Godfrey ! I never hope to hear such a Niagara as happened then . The crock turned that river mouth into white foam . I do n't know how many revolutions he made . But it was plenty . I did n't stop to count them . I was going ashore as fast as the Lord would let me . " All the other crocodiles in Tanganyika heard the commotion , and they came right over to see what it was all about . They came from every direction like a lot of locomotives let loose . " My boys were good swimmers , but they lacked technique . They could n't keep up with me . I was first up the bank and into the handiest tree . Two others made it , and a half . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the rushes . I hope to die if I ever hear such a bellow as that poor sinner let out of him . He was n't any good , what was left of him . We had to finish him off afterwards with a bullet . " The rest of them the crocks got . That whole river was like a boiling kettle with the steam coming off it in the moon . There were too many picnickers for the refreshments . Not enough to go round . And those of them that did get a bite or two must have got those bone skewers in their teeth , for I tell you they bayed the moon like good fellows . And they all got to taking bites out of each other in the excitement . It was hell out there for a good half hour . They carried on Old-Boy-like ! " No , they did n't get a taste of your Uncle Dudley.  |p202But  they got awful close to it . I felt the scales of that crock when he turned over on top of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's born to be hung will never be drowned ! " Will and Uncle Frank and Will 's mother seemed to be camping out all Summer . They were together all the time . Will did not have a chance to sit down and look at the clouds or the stars all by himself , the way he liked to do . No chance to think about the things he loved most  --  the way the sun 's beams marched over the sea and the far islands , the wings of mackerel hawks that seemed to think and act for themselves , the early stars that were white and blue as dewdrops are in the morning , the songs of robins when daylight was coming on . Will had no time for such things . Cousin Rupert was always beside him , or in his mind . Even in the dead of the night . Rupert filled up every place , covered everything up with his huge body . Drowned everything out with his huge voice . Nobody had any right to be so full of life and bother other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Frank and him out of their house and out of their thoughts and old ways . Will wished to see the end of the Summer . It came to Will with a start one morning that he had not looked at a Latin book since Rupert Prince had got down from Lem Toothaker 's stage . The visitor had absorbed him as he had absorbed everybody in the place.  |p203I   --  r WAS A sizzling hot day in middle August . The sun had beaten down on the four of them all the forenoon . There had been no chance to get out of the coppery fire that covered the ocean . The sail gave no shadow to speak of , the sun was so high . It was as if they had been sailing through a fire for miles and miles . There was barely enough breeze to keep them going , and what there was did not cool them off one bit . It only made the sun more unbearable . It was Rupert 's doing . He had set his heart on having a picnic on Crag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far out at sea . They were all on board of Rupert 's sloop now , and nearly there at last . They had been sailing through the blisteringheat for three hours . Will 's head ached deep inside . There was thunder in the air . As they came up to Crag Island at last , and got underthe lee of its high cliffs , the wind dropped completelyand the air became as hot as an oven . Behind the spruces which fringed the dark wall of the island , glints of bright flame showed by the million in clusteredcrescents high up in the west . When his eyes got used to them , Will saw that they were the scalloped edges of gigantic clouds . Clouds had built themselves up quietly and were leaning over upon them . " We 're going to get a shower . "   " Yes , Will , " said Uncle Frank , " a rip-snorter , too . I felt it all along . " " Good ! " said Rupert . " That will be bully ! It will cool things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get dinner over first . " They went ashore in the tender and came into a wild cove . Rocks white as salt and crowned with glistening bayberry towered over them and went down into the dark depths under the boat 's bow . They found a small beach and pulled up the boat . They got driftwood together . There was plenty of it . It sparkled with salt like studs of diamonds . Will 's mother came back from her look around the land above with a bayberry bough and a bunch of everlasting roses . The fire crackled . The flame stood straight up in the still air . The coffeepotwas on . Rupert was dropping thick steaks into a frying-pan half full of melted butter . Rupert wasted butter awfully . Uncle Frank was smoking and watching the coffee-pot . He had a green spruce limb shoved through the handle to hold it in case the embers collapsedand it should tip . They were all in the shade of the cliffs , out of the sun . The green glint of the sea came up and played on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hot bayberry and sweet-fern came down to them . It was boiling hot up there . Will could look out into the sunlit sea from where he sat . He could see the sun playing on the granite and green rockweed at the other side of the cove . Everything was very bright and sharpP205and full of glint . It was like sitting on the edge of a world made out of mica and isinglass and crystals of salt . The waves had fire running along the wrinkles in them wherever they moved . It was very quiet . Will could hear an ember under the coffee-pot strike a minutetreble chord as it snapped . But there was beginning to be a great sound far away . It was thunder behind the island . Deep in under the clouds they had seen as they came in . It was becoming almost continuous . A low mutter of sound like an organ tremendously far away . Suddenly Will felt that something was going to happen . A thing he had dreaded all his life , without knowingwhat it was . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do with his father . It was as if his own whole life had been getting ready for this instant . He sat there with his eyes on the livid , sparkling coals of the fire . He saw the pulses beating in the incandescentdriftwood . He saw a small spray of marsh rosemary growing up through the pebbles near the fire , clear as something seen in a dream , every twig on it stitched full of minute purple stars . He saw the blue whorls in a mussel shell . He wondered how he could he looking at these things so carefully and calmly . He saw every pebble between him and the fire , green , gray , white , blue , brown  --  laid there like jewels in a casket of jewels . It was coming . He did not dare to raise his eyes . He felt a shiver run slowly from the back of his headP2o6 down along his body and spread out to every fibre in him . He did not want to lift his eyes . It might mean everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to do was lift his eyes . But he did n't dare . Will closed his eyes and waited a second . He had to decide . Now . He would dare to look  --  in a minute . He raised his eyelids . Then without another instant 's hesitation , he turned and looked at Rupert Prince . The man 's back was towards him . He was tending the steaks with a fork . Looking down . Will 's eyes went on and touched his mother . The shiver went down him once more . Slow and sure , to every part . His mother was looking at Rupert Prince . She was unconscious of everything else in the world . She was looking at Rupertas Will had never seen any woman look at any man . Her eyes were full of light  --  a strange light like that he had seen on the edges of the thunderclouds . And then something seemed to strike Rupert . He stiffenedand gripped his fork without a sign of motion . He slowly lifted his head and looked at Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had never seen such a look as came into his mother 's eyes then , as Rupert looked at her . It was not a smile . It was more like something to do with agony . It was a nakedness . It was as if Will had seen his mother undressed . He shut his eyes again . The whole world seemed to spin . He had to clutch at the stones around him . After a while , the earth stopped wheeling . And Will opened his eyes . His mother was ladling out the sugar into theP207cups as if nothing had happened . Rupert was turning over a blackened piece of meat . " You like yours well done , do n't you , Frank ? " Rupertsaid . " Yes . Well done . " " Well , this will fill the bill . " But Will knew something had happened . Nothing would ever be just the same again . He knew something had happened that would change all of their lives . They ate their beefsteaks and mushrooms in the twilightthat came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last of the sunlight swept off the eastern sea . By the time they were drinking their coffee , a few big drops of rain were spattering the blue stones around them . Will thought how strange it was that he could sit there and go on eating and drinking so well . They all got under the shelving cliff . The rain came down in sheets . They were shut in together for an hour , so close their bodies touched . Rupert 's big thigh pressed on his own . He could not draw his away . The ocean and the other islands disappeared . They sat there touching . Rupert talked to Uncle Frank about a thunderstormhe had been in , in Borneo , that made this one seem like child 's play . Lightning struck far away on the mainland , and somewhere close behind them on the rocky spine of the island above . The green flares lit up all their faces . His mother was smiling in the light of it . She never was troubled by lightning at all.  | " Pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . " " Getting it somewhere heavy . Hear that one . " " Never seen but one man hit . Funny thing , " said Rupert , " about that man . His body was black as a hat but not a blemish on it . Clothes just as good as ever . Only one shoe burst open like a tulip . " It was over at last , and the sun came out . The rocks around them ran fire with the sunlight on the wet places . They stowed their dunnage and got into the boat . They rowed out to the sloop . Everything was all right . Rupert got the anchor up , and then shook out the wet sails . A breeze was coming up . It caught their sail and filled it . The sail bellied out big . The sloop picked up speed . Soon she had a pretty bone in her mouth . They were going home fast . The east , on their starboard side , was still dark with twilight . The storm was still grumbling there . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low sunshine , a vast and lovely rainbow came slowly into being on the purple sky at the east . It covered half the earth with arches of liquid fire . Where its two ends stood on the sea , the air was misty with flaked gold . " Pretty , is n't it ! " said Rupert , puffing at his big meerschaum . " A good time ahead ! " It was the loveliest rainbow Will had ever seen . He looked at it as long as it was there . And inside him there was a feeling he had never known before . TheP209feeling he had had when he looked at his dead brother lying in his father 's arms was an easy and gentle one compared to this . It had nothing to do with tears or any crying . It was like a solemn and terrible hymn . A hymn that might be heard even down under the sea . P210THE MORNING AFTER the Crag Island picnic , Will woke up saying over and over to himself that it was a bad dream . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other thing in between was something sleep had added . Yet when he came down to breakfast where his mother was , he found himself alert and full of a strange clearness of mind . He felt like a cat watching a bird . He was surprised to hear his voice steady and calm as could be . There was only one thing to do . He knew that as plain as could be . But he would give them one day . And watch . Then it was two days , and he was still watching every time his mother and Rupert looked at each other . Three days . Four . They did not see him watching . He did not let them . He knew how it would end . Uncle Frank knewnothing of what was going on . Will had a feeling thatgot to be like a prayer . He felt that if five days couldbe gotten over , the tension would let up in him , andeverything would be safe . He counted the days passingover into safety . Four gone . Five would be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at suppertime . Will seemed to know it was coming . TheyP211had a bowl of oxheart daisies on the table . His mother had never missed having flowers once since Rupert had come . Will had been going back in his mind and piecingtogether all the little new things his mother had done since the first day of Rupert 's being there . The flowers were n't the only thing . She had done other Sunday things all along , every day in the week . Her dresses . She had been dressing as if every day was a special one . It happened like quicksilver . Rupert looked up and said , " Nothing prettier than black-eyed Susans on a suppertable . " That was n't their right name . Will had his mother 's face in the corner of his eyes . Her eyes flooded with the light that was the light before the shower on Crag Island . They gave out a beam . He could see them doingit . " Oxheart daisies is their right name . " But his words came too late . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rupert 's eyes had met his mother 's full and had widened . Will could see . And his full red lips twitched above his pinkish beard . " Sorry , Will . I suppose you Menhaden people ought to know what your own things are . " Rupert 's voice had a strange sharpness in it , and the secret light went out of his eyes as he spoke . Will was n't hearing what Rupert said . He was thinking of what was ahead of him tomorrow . Uncle Frank mumbled something . He sensed something in the air . But he did n't know what it was . Or how to go about coming between these two . He had felt the last few days that he 'd have to come between them . Somethingwas going to happen , he did n't know what . He had been uneasy ever since the Crag Island trip . Will had been odd on the way home and that night . Uncle Frank had gotten to know his nephew well this past year . There was some subtle bond between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something was wrong . It was like feeling a southeaster in his bones . For once Rupert did not get to talking that night . They all went to bed early . Will slept soundly for the first time in nearly a week . He got up at crack of day and got out his old clothes . He had gotten into the habit of wearing his good clothes every morning since Rupert came . He had slipped on overalls to tend his traps . But this morningit was his oldest trousers and his faded flannel shirt . They felt good on him , after so long a time . He went downstairs to the kitchen and washed up , not making any noise about it that might wake anybody up . He was painfully quiet . " Will ! " Will swung round to see . It was Uncle Frank . He had come down in his nightgown . Will could see his bare feet on the floorboards . His uncle 's hair had not been combed . He 'd got down without making a sound . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? "  |p213The  boy stood there quite overcome by surprise . He had never seen his uncle look so worried before . Not even at the time of David . He knew instantly how foolish he 'd been to think he could keep the trouble he was in these last days from this man who said so littic but knew all the people in his family like a book . Not just the dead and gone ones . The living ones . Will 's father . Will 's mother . Will . " Oh , nothing . " Will 's voice sounded like somebody else 's voice to him . " I 'm just going to take a long row down the bay . There are some things I 've  --  I 've got to tend to . About my traps , I mean . " He knew Uncle Frank did not believe one word of it . " See here , Will . You and I are good friends . If there 's something on your mind worrying you , I want to know about it . Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter with my mother ? " " I know you 've got something on your mind about her . I 've noticed the way you 've acted lately . Will , you  --  you  --  " His voice trailed off and he stopped . But he began again in a loud tone : " You must n't jump at things too quick . You 've no right to . Your mother 's your mother . She 's done a lot for  --  " " Uncle Frank , " said Will , " I do n't want you to interfere with me . I know what I am doing . I know you mean well . But I 've decided I  --  I must tend to some things for myself . You 're awfully good to me , Uncle Frank  --  I ca n't tell you how much I thank you . But I 've got to go on this trip . You tell them , will you ?  --  Tell them I wo n't be back till suppertime . " " All right , Will . I 'll do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . I 'm not the kind that interferes . You know that . " The man was apologetic . His eyes had shifted down to his wrinkled bare feet . " You know best what to do . " He turned around and closed the door . Will heard him going back upstairs very quietly . For an instant Will had it in his mind to shout out to him and say how sorry he was he had hurt his feelings . His uncle was hurt badly . Will could see that . And it would be better to have a friend on his side . Have Uncle Frank with him . But Will stayed there with his jaws set . He finished washing , went to the doughnut jar and took four or five doughnuts out . He ate three . It was all he could eat at the time . He put the others into his coat pocket , and went out into the cool , early morning . The dew was still on the grass . The cobwebs were hung with it . They looked as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove-gray with little high lights in them . It was like thousands of yards of Spanishlace , like that rolled up in bundles in the Prince attic . Thousands of yards of Valencia lace strung out between the flat cushions of the wild-carrots . The lace went floating off down the hill , keeping just so far above the ground , following the dips in the land . A bee was making a lonely sound somewhere . It was clearP215as a bell . Will could see Halfway Rock lighthouse like a piece of chalk sticking up through the sea almost on the edge of the sky . A crow suddenly cawed five or six times fast in the woods to the west . A mist was clearing off the cove and melting into the dark spruces . Above Will the Prince stones stood out sharp on the yellowingsky . It was going to be a lovely day . Will sopped his feet in the clover along the path down . The heavy red heads of it bumped his ankles as he went . He launched his skiff . It was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , at dead-low-water mark . It was about ready to turn . He would have the tide against him , going out . He did not know at all what he would say . He tried to think of that as he rowed away . He looked at the cupola of the house as it grew smaller and smaller . He was glad he had n't tried going up there in that house of eight windows . He could not think of the words he ought to say . The sun was almost up now . The whole quiet ocean was full of clear , cold light . His wake flowed off on both sides and turned into two silver furrows . Suddenly all the seagulls were on the move . They came out over Will in a steady stream . They never let up . They were already in the sun . Their wings were steeped in an amber color . They tipped their beaks over sidewise and looked down at the boat with beady eyes . But their wings went on independentlytaking them out to sea . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will 's right hand , and a dusky gilt pathway reached out from it over the water to touch the boat . The path moved with him as he rowed . The sun slid clear of the sea . Yes , a fine day , all right . The better the day , the better the deed . It was one of Uncle Frank 's pet sayings . He had a lot of them . Always had one ready to take the sting out of things . Uncle Frank was like that . He was always makingit his business to take the sting out of things . Nobodylike him in the world ! Will changed his course to the southwest . The big new sun swung slowly around and stopped over the skiff 's stern . He was making good time , in spite of the flooding tide setting inshore . There was no wind to speak of . Just the swell that tipped the boat every so often . A bell-buoy was making a lonely sound that filled all the morning and the sky around him . It was lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It always had been . There was n't a sail in sight . Will made the cove without once turning around on the seat to take his bearings . He knew the place by heart . He pulled the boat high up out of the tide 's way , and made the painter fast to a long , smooth rock he found . He sat down for a moment on the boat 's gunwale , to get strength into his knees . There was the roof and the tile chimney . The chimney had a feather of smoke at its end . His father was stirring all right . Will went up the little clay path he knew so well . Nothing had changed . The pennyroyal blossomsP217brushed his ankles . He was glad he had thought to wear his old clothes . That ought to help him and make it easier to get started . He suddenly wished he had never gone away from here . The spruces were quiet and prim all along the sky . Will knew where every clump of goldenrod was . The goldenrod was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew close to the ground . Not the tall spikes of Menhaden . There was the same small trickle of water which came down between the mica stars of the graniteledge by the house . He remembered every star that twinkled there with the sun . The shells of clams he had shocked so many Summers were spread out bleachingbelow the rock . He hoped the door would be open . It would be awkwardto have to knock , and then go in . He did n't know what his father would say to let him know when to come in , in case the , door was closed . The door was open . Wide . Just as he came up the last rise , a man came out of it . Will stopped in his tracks . The blood ebbed out of his heart . It was a stranger . The man had a full beard on him . But Will saw in a second it was his father . The beard made his eyes look deeper than Will had ever seen them . Deep and wild-like . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaked thick with gray.  |p218The  man stood still at the door . He looked steadily at Will . He did not say a thing to help out . " Hello , Father . How are you getting along ? " It sounded like the foolishest thing Will could have thought of . " All right . What do you want here ? " If his father had used his name , it would have made things easier . " I thought I 'd come out and  --  and  --  see how you were . " It was a lie . His father knew it as well as he did . " What did you come out for ? " The deep eyes were boring into Will like two gimlets . His father 's bluntness , though , made it lots easier . " I came out to see if you would n't think about comingover to Menhaden to live . " " You had better mind your own business . I 'm all right where I am . I ai n't complaining . " Will went two or three steps nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Menhaden , Father . Iwould n't come out here and trouble you if it was n't so . You ought to . I 'm not talking foolish . I mean it . " " I suppose you know my business better than I domyself . " His father stepped back against the doorpost . A seagull 's shadow ran across the yard between them . Will saw how patched and shabby his father'sclothes were . There was a safety-pin holding his trouserstogether at the top of the front flap . One of thebuttons was gone . Both straps of his suspenders wereP219hooked to one button on one side . It almost made tears come up into Will 's eyes . " Yes . It 's your business to come back . It is for your own good , I 'm telling you . You had better come . Please do n't think I 'm telling you this for my own sake , Father . I shall never do that . I would n't have come nigh you on my own account .  --  Oh , I know what you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after it was over on the hill on Menhaden . I knew it before that , too . I 've known it all my life , I guess . It was always David with you . Always David . I know what you  --  " " Do n't you dare to start talking about David ! " The man 's eyes were blazing in his head , and he took a step towards Will . " You keep your mouth  --  " " All right . I 'm sorry . " Will 's voice had grown hard . " But you listen to what I 've got to say ! " Will felt something hot beginning to spread out inside him . " You listen to me ! I 've come out here to warn you that there 's going to be trouble if you do n't come back and live with my mother . Where you belong . You have no call to stay out here and let things slide as you 've been doing . You have n't a right to live as though you were camping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't come back where you belong ! " The man fairly hissed the question : " Did your mother put you up to this ? " " No , she did not . She did n't say a word about myp220coming . I came out unbeknownst to her . She does n't know I 'm out here . " " You stand there and lie !  --  This is your mother 's doing . I can hear her in every word you say . She put you up to this . You ca n't tell me any different . Youyou  --  you  --  haven'tgot gumption enough to come out here unless somebody sent you !  --  What 's she whining about now ? She 's got what she wanted . She 's got the house she wanted to live in . She 's got you . You !  --  you dumb-gutted calf ! You half-bottomed moon-calf ! You and your girlish ways ! She 's got you where she can make what she wants to out of you ! " " You 've got no right to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man as you are . " " Well , I want to know ! You  --  a man ?  --  God damn me if you are ! " His father burst into a low laugh . The laugh did not sound good out there in all the stillness of that bright morning . It sounded bad . It sounded as bad as anythingWill had ever heard . " She wants me to come and live with her again , does she ?  --  Who knows after how many others !  --  She wants me to live with her ?  --  Well , you can go back home and tell your mother she can go on wanting . I 'm through with her . And I 'm through with you . You make me sick , the two of you . A fine pair ! " His hand was on the door . Will knew he would go in and slam it in another instant . He heard his ownP221voice going on almost of its own accord . Clear and low and deep : " My mother would be angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleading with you . She would call me worse names than you have called me . She 'd like to have you stay out here until you died . She has got over wanting you . Stay out here till you are dead . You are dead to her , I can tell you that . As much as if you were rotting under the ground . That 's your fault . It 's true , though . You can go on being dirty and holding your pants together with a safety-pin and eating off dirty dishes and sleeping in a dirty bed  --  you can go on for all of her . She 's not worrying about you . She 's got something else on her mind . She 's up to something that 's going to make you a laughing-stock of everybody on Menhaden . She 's going to do something that will make you worse than as if you were dead . You are goingto be dead as a doornail right in your clothes . There 's going to be trouble . I 'm giving you fair warn-ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was saying . A great tingling was running the length of his spine . He knew what words he would be saying a minute more . He knew he was going to say things he had never dared to put into words . Oh , Cousin Rupert had put them into words ! About woman and her hankering for men 's bodies . For two different men 's bodies , at the same time . " Tell me what trouble you mean ? " His father 's voice had a new sound in it . The anger  |p222and  hatefulness had gone . The man had turned around and was facing his son again . There was something in his looks which showed Will that his words had hurt his father and made him afraid . Will knew , then , that he would never dare to say the words . He wanted to do what he had in his mind to do . But he knew he never would . He would have to say the things only in his mind . He could hear his voice beginning to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he was not speaking them : You know how you used to talk to my mother , at night . When you thought we boys were asleep . About hankering . Yes , that was the word  --  hankering . Hankeringfor every well-built man that came along . Oh , I heard you . I heard you say what you would be , if you let her out of your sight and gave her a chance at the men . . . . Cuckold . . . . I know that word . I learned it from you . . . Well , you are going to be that now , if you do n't come back and look after your wife . You were wrong before . But you guessed what was going to happen sometime . You guessed what you were going to drive her to do . And now you are going to be what you were afraid you were going to be . Things no son could ever say to his father , no matter what happened . Not even though it was life or death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father came right up to Will and stood over him . He knew he had gotten the upper hand of him again.  | " You tell me . Or I 've a good mind to strike you , big as you are , for what you 've said to me . " Will did not know how he got there . But he was on his knees and holding fast to his father 's knees . They were woefully thin and sharp , those knees . Will could feel the bones of them through the cloth of his father 's trousers . Never what he had imagined his father 's knees were like . No bigger than a boy 's . Under the dirty cloth . Will was shaking like a person in a great blow . He had not touched his father so since he was a small boy . He tried to speak out , but the tears were choking up his eyes . He saw the wet places they made on his father 's trousers . He realized at last that his father was talking . Talking low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were soft and weak . Soft as a girl . Crying !  --  Man-grown , and crying ! " Will felt his eyes go dry . He put all the strength he had into his last try . He knew clear as anything , it was his last chance . It was for himself he was talking now . He would never plead again . It was the last time . " I have never asked you for anything since I was a small boy , Father . This is the first thing I have asked you for , for years . I would n't be asking you to come and live with mother again if I could help it now . It is n't easy for me to do . I am doing it because I  --  I  --  I love you . " I know that sounds soft to you . Saying such a thing when I am man-grown . But it 's so . I am not lying . I have always loved you best . It was n't my mother , ever.  |p224It  was you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as David ever did . I 'd have given anything to make you see it . You never did see it . And I 'm not asking you to feel any different about me now . All I 'm asking is for you to live with mother . You can make it up to me that way . That 's all you have to do . " I wo n't hold any hardness if you go on disliking me just as much as you ever did . I am thinking of goingaway to town to school this Fall . I would n't be around . I have studied by myself , so I am all ready to go into the second year of high school . I would n't be there in the house . Wo n't you come , Father ? That 's all I ask . Wo n't you ? " Will waited for his father to answer . He was still on his knees . But he had dropped his hands to his side . On the dirt by the stone doorstep . His fingers made little marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blood beat in his temples . He heard his father speaking at last , as if he was a good ways off . " Too bad . I always knew you were a soft one . But I did n't know you was this soft . You have always loved me best !  --  That 's the way a girl talks . Girls talk about loving people . David never had any girl in him . He never felt that way about me . And I did n't about him . Soft ! It is something you get from your mother . I 'm sorry I have a son that ought to be a girl by rights . I never expected to see you come here and act foolish this way . Shed tears ! "   " Will you come for  --  for David 's sake ? " Only a small whisper of Will 's voice was left . " I had one strong son . But he 's gone now . David was what I had . All I had . " The man seemed to be talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of a light like that of a sunrise , deep and low light . He was looking straight away over the spruce tops and out over the wide sea . " David was all I had . He is the reason why I ca n't do what you want me to do . It would n't be fair to him . Fair to what he was and the way he lived . " I want to be by myself now . I do n't want to have anything to do with you . Let me alone . " It was something to know for sure what was ahead now . Will got to his feet . His father was still looking away at the sea . Will turned around and started back down the path . At the first bend in the pathway , he looked back . His father was still paying no attention to him . Will looked at him for a long time . The gray did not show in his beard from this far away . There was still something handsome about his father . Handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . He turned at last to go on . Then he thought of something more . " Goodbye , Father . " Will waited only for a moment . There was no answer . He put his head down and walked quickly down to his boat . He did not look back again.  | The tide was well up . He got the boat into the water easily . He put the oars in place in the tholepins , and rowed away from the island . He never looked up at it again until it was a low mass of evergreens and granitefar off behind him . Will rowed till he came to his outermost lobster trap . He pulled it . There was nothing in it . It had no bait on the string . He had neglected his lobstering badly . He put the trap across the bow . He went on and took in all the five outer traps . He took his time and heaped them one on top of the other . He took out the flat stones that weighted them down and threw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the slime was all cleared off . He took hours at the work . He waited till the sun had set before he went in . Then he carried up the traps and piled them up carefully on the shore , one after another . The stars were out when Will got up to the house . Nobody was around . He went quietly up to bed . He felt the doughnuts in his pocket when he took off his coat . He ate them one after another in the dark . He lay very still in bed . It was a long time before he fell asleep . His father 's face kept coming up before him . His father 's face looking off out to sea.  |p227NOBODY  ASKED WILL where he had been the day before . His mother noticed his old clothes , though . " Why , Will , you 've got on your old work clothes ! " " Yes . I 've got some work to do . " Rupert was rather quiet for once all through breakfast . Will 's mother had most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company coming that afternoon . They were some people Rupert knew . They had taken one of the cottages on the point . One of the places in the spruce woods . The man was an artist . Too good a man , Rupert said , to be able to sell any of his stuff . The woman was an actress of some sort . Bohemians , Rupert had called them , when he announced their coming . He also said he was n't at all sure if they were married to each other or not . Lots of the very nicest people were n't , Rupert said . Too fond of each other . Will 's mother had not had any regular company for years . What on earth should she do with them ? " Oh , give them tea , " said Rupert . " That is , give Sheila some . I 'll look after Walter . He likes whiskey . " " But they ca n't drink tea and whiskey all the after-noon ! " " Well , show them over the house . Show them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways while there 's time ! Show them the family skeletons , Louise . " Will 's mother laughed a long time at the joke . Will thought of the people up there on the hill , lying quiet with crossed hands . And the one who lay under the Whaleboat reef with the grips of the wheel in the bones that were left of his hands . " What are you thinking of doing this Winter , Will ? " Rupert had changed the subject abruptly . The tone of his voice had changed considerably . It was cold and rather disagreeable . The question came as a complete surprise . Rupert was looking at Will with eyes that were n't smiling for once . " I do n't know . Why ? " " Oh , I was just wondering . Seems to me , it would be a jolly good thing for you to start thinking about doing something . You ought to get away from lobstering and go to school in town . You wo n't get far here . You 've got to be thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fish for lobsters all your life , do you ? " Will had never heard Rupert speak like this before . It was a new Rupert , a new , hard man . His eyes were as cold as sea water . " Lobstering 's not so bad . There 's good money in it . " " Maybe so . Chicken feed . But it wo n't get you anywhere in the world . You 've got to get around and meetpeople . The right people . When I was your age , I'dbeen knocking around New York on my own and makingmoney to put me through college . You do n't wantp229to go native and be just another fisherman , just becauseit 's easy . Look at your father . He was a smart man . He could have been anything . But he  --  " " See here ! " Will 's face had gone pale and an odd sound had come into his speaking . " Do n't you run down my father . He is as smart a man as anybody is . You have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will does n't know yet what he wants to be , " Uncle Frank broke right in , louder than Will had ever heard him speak before . " He 's got time enough to make up his mind . " " But you wrote me yourself that the boy was wasting his time here . " " Well , I guess I may have . But I guess I meant  --  I mean  --  I may have changed my mind . There are worse things than lobstering . Lots worse . " " Oh , that 's how you feel about it . Changing your tune a little bit , are n't you ? Well , I think you 're making a mistake . I think  --  " " We all change our minds . We have the right to . " Uncle Frank was flushed all over . He was angry with Rupert for telling what he had no right to tell . Right before Will . Will was angry , too , for Rupert 's tellingtales out of school . " Uncle Frank knows better than most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides a cup of tea , Rupert ? Should n't we have something to go with it ? , Should n't I bake some cookies ? "  |p230Both  Will and Uncle Frank were glad Will 's mother had broken in that way . Later on , Rupert came down to the shore where Will was landing another load of lobster pots . Some from nearer in shore . He watched Will tiering them up on the pile on the bank . " You 've brought in a lot of your traps . Mustered out ? " " No , " Will answered , " they are pretty waterlogged . Need to be in the sun for a while . " Rupert did not invite Will to go along out to the sloop with him . He usually did . He probably saw that Will was busy . All through dinner , Will expected it . He had his eyes on his plate most of the time . But he would have known instantly if Rupert and his mother looked that way at each other again . He was sure they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . It would n't be five days again . He was right . Cousin Rupert was around the house most of the afternoon getting spruced up for the party . Will stayed around , too . He might have missed dozens of such moments when the man and his mother could have looked that way all through the Summer . But he was pretty sure he had n't . That time on the island at the picnic seemed so strange , it must have been the first time it happened . He kept close watch this afternoon . He made believe he was weaving a lobster head . He did knit away at one , too , part of the time . Hep231looped his work over a chair post and put his ball of cord in his lap . His hands went in and out of their own accord . He did n't need to watch them . He could weave so well by now that he did n't need to look . He could weave a lobster heading almost as fast as David used to . His eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to show Sheila how you do that , Will . She 'd be interested . " Rupert startled him with his booming voice . He had come up behind Will in his rubber soles . " All right . Be glad to . " Will 's hands were shaking , but he went on weaving . Rupert bent over and tried the meshes with his big fingers . " Pretty strong business , is n't it ?  --  It would take a lot to break that . " " Yes , " said Will . " It 's brand-new codline . It 'll hold , all right . " It happened when Will 's mother came in from the kitchen with a batch of caraway-seed cookies to show Rupert . Rupert started it this time . Will had sort of expected he would , he could n't say just why . Rupert looked around first just before he did it . Will never lifted his eyes from his work . Then Rupert turned and looked at Will 's mother . Will knew , even though Rupert'shead was back to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . His mother raised her eyes slowly from her plate of cookies , as she sensed what Rupert was doing . Her eyes came up slowly . Then she seemed to take a little deep breath and hold it . She looked at the man for as much as half a minute . Will made five whole meshes while she was looking into Rupert 's eyes . And he drew the knots tighter than any in his life . The way she took in her breath gave Will the clue to something that had been in the back of his mind ever since the day on Crag Island . There was something that had been helping him to tell what was coming each time . Now he remembered in a flash . He remembered now that he had read about a woman looking at a man that way . He had been trying to put his finger on it for days , ever since it first happened . Now he had it . It was in that book of Rupert 's . The wife in the story had taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the man whose body had gotten on her mind so . She had started with just such a thing as had happened out on Crag Island . And the later looks she had given the man had come at about the time these had . And it had been only about two weeks from the time she caught her breath that way before she had gone with the man to that room in the hotel . Will could remember every detail of the afternoon in that room . It had horrified Will , but it had fascinated him , too . It was as real as if it was actually happening . It was so matter of fact  --  that was why it had made such a terribleimpression on Will . When he came to think it over , he knew it must have happened just like that to thousands of men and women really alive . Cousin Ru-P233pert had knocked around . He knew . He did n't have to make things up . He just put down what he had found out about people . Even about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rupert himself might have gone through such an afternoon in that hotel . When the man and woman had gotten through with the room late in the afternoon , they went out as if nothing had happened . They went right back to living the way they had always done . That made a big impression on Will . The woman loved her husband just as much as she ever did . Oh , Rupert made that very clear . The only thing was , she got a chance to look at the new man that way again , or he would look at her , and then she could not rest until she was alone with him again and repeated the afternoon . Every so often . She loved her husband just as much after all the other times , too . She thought of her husband , Tom , every time , and loved him just as much . She even thought of Tom when it was happening to her . Rupert made it clear to his readers . He must know what he was talking about . It happened twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whiskey and tea . Will 's mother was back and forth all the time , arranging the table . And Cousin Rupert was giving her the benefit of his advice . He told her just where the doilies were to go . They came close together time and time again . P234The second time , it was Rupert 's face Will saw , instead of his mother 's . It was funny , but you could tell beforehand just when it was going to take place . It got so it was a kind of game . Rupert did not draw in a breath , but his lips moved just the way Will had seen them move the day before yesterday . The same sudden twitch . The look was almost as long as the other one . It seemed that neither one of them could tell how long it was going to last . Any more than they could tell just when it was going to come . A third person could . Will could . But they could n't . It ended this time by turning into a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his eyes , like a lustre . The smile beganat his lips and spread up over his face . The light lasted in his eyes for an instant . Then his eyes got usual again and looked as they did most of the time . Another odd thing about it was that they were solemn all through it . They did not seem to be enjoyingit at all . It was as though it was outside of them . Beyond their power to control or get away from it . There was no fun in it for them . It was an interesting thing to watch . It was like a queer , breathless game . One thing was sure , while they were looking at each other that way , Will could raise his face and stare full at them . They were too much in a kind of trance to catch him looking . Will came to the last row of meshes of his lobster head before the guests came . He was too absorbed to break off and start a new one . He might miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth between the dining room and the kitchen all the time . An idea came to Will suddenly . It made him bend low over his work with its startling suddenness , and clearness . He went right on with his piece of weaving . He unrolled more of his ball and began a new row of meshes . They were out in the kitchen the third time . Will could just see them through the door . And they were closer together than they had ever been before . They were almost touching . Rupert was bent over with his broad back Will 's way . He was looking at something Will 's mother had on the table . Will knew it was coming . His mother was bent over , too . She looked up slowly as it started . She could n't help herself . She had to . She caught her breath the same way . It was the longest one of all so far . And it was so different , somehow , that Will knew there was going to be something more to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to come in past Rupert , Rupert moved ever so slightly , and his big thigh touched her as she came by him . A person who had not been looking at the other thing would never have noticed it . But Will did . It was very light . Maybe his mother had not felt it , even . Will could not be sure . She did not look as if she had . Something like this had happened in the book , Will remembered now , too . And it was only a short time after that that the wife and the man new to her hadP97lonesome to go out there . There was nothing to do in the woodshed that had once kept two or three men busy , with a houseful of children to keep warm inside the house beyond . Uncle Frank had a small , one-horse garden . But he could spade up the whole thing in three afternoons and plant all the rows he wanted to plant without planning much about it at all . It was cheaper to buy potatoes than raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parsnips and string-beans , that was all . A turnip or two . Will wandered down to the cove often . He was more at home there . He did n't admit it to himself , but the crinkly mussels showing their edges among the thatch roots down there and the skeletons of baby horseshoe crabs pleased him more than many things around the barn and house . They were like old friends . At one place in the cove , it looked as if there might be clams . He saw jets of water going up there at the ebb . Will found an old skiff under some dead brush . It had been on the bank for years . It was pretty well rottedaway . You could break off pieces of the cleats in your hands . But for the want of something to do Will went at it . He found some oakum up in the shed , and some new boards . His father and brother had never allowed him to help on a boat . Not even with the calking . But he had often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted for a long time . Somehow or other , that old boat was like a dare to Will . He would show them what he could do !  |p98Not  David , of course , now . He was up there on the hill . But his father . Will spent a week down in the cove , with a wedge he had made and a hammer . And one fine twilight he put his boat into the water . He had partly rebuilt it . It leaked some , but not enough to mean much . He stole up to the barn and got the pair of oars he had seen there . The stars were coming out by the time he was ready . He rowed out on the bay , and sat quiet for a long time . It was good being out there with the stars coming out around him . In the sky above , in the still ocean below him . It was his boat . He had really made it . He felt akin to the old ones in his family who had floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same cove . After that , he went out every day . One evening , Will got an old rusted clam hoe and dug a peck of clams and carried them up to the kitchen . His mother did n't say a word when she saw what Will had brought in . They had clams fried in batter for supper . The first since Whaleboat . His mother had shocked the clams . She knew how to do it fast , from long practice . The batter clams tasted good . Uncle Frank asked about them . Will 's mother told him . It seemed to Will as though there was a strange expression on his uncle 's face . Kind of sad . Uncle Frank did n't say anything , though . After that night , there always was a rocker of clams by the kitchen stoop , where it went down into the shed.
