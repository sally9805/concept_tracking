In 1930 , although every U. S. State had laws requiring that all children be schooled , some 800,000 U. S. children of elementary school age had no school to go to . Most of them were in poor farm areas that could not maintain a school . Hard times and a slump in real-estate tax collections ( still the public schools ' chief source of support ) increased the number of unschooled children . The nation 's public education system rallied from Depression three years ago , but this year was struck again by the backlash of the 1937 Recession . By last week so many distress signals flew over U. S. schoolhouses that educators were thoroughly alarmed . <P> In Ohio , where the State school fund was $17,000,000 in the hole , several cities knew not how long they could keep schools open . School funds were low in Colorado , Michigan , Illinois , the Dakotas . The most desperate S. 0 . S. came from schools in Georgia and Pennsylvania . <P> Georgia owes its schoolteachers $5,000,000 , sees no way of paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect because of a State law prohibiting debt carry-overs to the next fiscal year . Unofficial calculations were that 200 Georgia schools , with 20,000 pupils , were closed . In many a Georgia village and town , worried citizens met to talk of ways &; means of educating their children . Some decided to keep the public schools open by charging tuition . In Lamar County , white children 's school term was shortened to eight months , Negro children 's schools were closed . At Villa Rica , a mass meeting raised $2,000 to keep schools open four weeks . Among the contributions : from the Villa Rica high-school senior class , $25 that its members had saved for their annual trip to the Georgia seacoast . <P> In Pennsylvania , a Philadelphia Record reporter , David Greendrug Wittels , recently toured the schools of eight coal counties , returned with a grim tale . With mines shut down and coal operators owing millions in local taxes ( Philadelphia &; Reading Coal &; Iron Corp . alone owes $3,000,000 ) , about one-fourth of the school districts could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received no pay for one to ten months . Hundreds were on relief . To support their families , others worked after school hours as undertakers , night watchmen , store clerks , life-insurance salesmen , coal bootleggers . <P> While the Pennsylvania Property Owners Association warned that " Pennsylvania 's public school system is doomed to early collapse , " Pennsylvania 's educators pleaded with economy-minded Governor Arthur H. James to replenish the special State fund for schools in distressed areas , now exhausted . Having pleaded in vain , nearly 200 teachers last week marched out of 27 schools in Northumberland and Schuylkill Counties , declared they would not go back until they were paid . <P> Meanwhile , in Spokane , Wash. , National Education Association 's President Reuben T. Shaw lamented : " The U. S. is farther from universal education , to which the public looks for preservation of the fundamental traditions of democracy , than it was 100 years ago .
