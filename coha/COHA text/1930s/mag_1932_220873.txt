Commodities . Wheat touched 41 ? in Chicago last week , making the 42 wheat tariff more than 100% protective . Cotton broke below 6 in Manhattan for the first time since late summer . Corn broke to 23 ? lowest since 1897 . Race for Richfield . Up a notch last week went the big bidding for possession of Richfield Oil Co. of California , an insolvent company deeply entrenched in the rich Pacific Coast gasoline market . The bidding has been between Harry Ford Sinclair 's Consolidated Oil Corp . and Standard Oil Co. of California , with Henry Latham Doherty 's Cities Service Co. ( a big Richfield stockholder ) sitting ominously silent at the table . Bid No. 1 was last June when Consolidated offered $18,000,000 in securities . Standard offered $17,000,000 , believing the greater popularity of its securities made the bid more attractive . Then in July the Consolidated offer was boosted to $22,250,000 . Standard raised that $250,000 . Last week Consolidated again took the lead with an offer equivalent to $27,600,000 . Consolidated offering $10,000,000 cash to provide for dissenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week directors of General Motors Corp . weighed a $4,464,000 third-quarter loss-first since 1921-against $209,098,832 of cash &; marketable securities still remaining in G. M. 's fat coffers , then declared the regular 25c dividend . Chrysler Corp . directors , too , balanced a $5,346,146 third-quarter loss against the company 's cash &; marketable securities of $51,000,000 , voted the regular 25 payment . Next day in a radio salesmeeting over a national network Chairman Walter P. Chrysler told his 75,000 dealers and salesmen that the new Plymouth was base priced at $495 , that price reductions averaged $60 . Frisco Turnabout . The sprawling St. Louis-San Francisco ( " Frisco " ) Railway Co. , which owns rail enough to double-span the distance between Berlin and Bagdad , averted a receivership action two months ago . Last week it performed a turnabout . Its management went to Federal Judge Charles Breckenridge Faris of St. Louis , the judge who gave the Frisco " another chance " in the first action , and told him a tale of depleted cash , crippled borrowing power , pressing creditors . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , biggest yet to fall this Depression and third in the past year to meet its receivership in St. Louis . There was no consternation in railroad circles at this turnabout . For the receivership is both a buffer against further Frisco disaster and a doorway to future success . Other receivership suits were pending against the Frisco last week and this friendly Federal action lessened the possibility of separate receivers in several States operating at chaotic cross purposes . But complications threatened when the attorneys who had been seeking receivership for their clients protested that Judge Faris had acted beyond his jurisdiction . Judge Faris again took the problem under consideration with the observation that the Frisco had " gotten itself into an unholy snarl . " Later he appointed John Gerdes Lonsdale , president of Mercantile-Commerce Bank &; Trust and 1929-30 president of A. B. A. , as a co-receiver with Mr. Kurn.
