Dr. Louis Caryl Graton , professor of mining geology at Harvard , last week issued the following statement : <P> ' ' A new microscope developed at Harvard incorporates such novel features of design as to permit a new step forward in the scientific investigation of the extremely minute . Somewhat paradoxically , the instrument itself is of great size and massive proportions , weighing about one ton , in order to insure utmost precision and stability . " <P> Blue-eyed , white-haired , courtly Dr. Graton was aware that news of his microscope had created something of a furor among authorities in optical science , because it was upsetting to optical theory . Late in the 19th Century , Ernst Abbe , a great optical physicist who worked for Carl Zeiss of Jena , laid down a theory fixing the upper limit of useful magnification at 1,500 diameters . Microscopists have sneaked considerably beyond the Abbe limit with an instrument called the ultramicroscope , in which very small particles are strongly illuminated from the side . This enables them to be counted , if they are widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also the use of ultraviolet light , too short to be seen , makes it possible to photograph submicroscopic objects . <P> But for straightforward magnification in visible light , said Professor Graton , Abbe 's 1,500-diameter limit " has ever since been generally accepted as reliable . " The Harvard microscope , however , is reported to have a useful range up to 6,000 diameters . In specimens of ore it can spot flecks of gold so small that 40,000,000,000 of them are worth only one cent . <P> To reduce vibration to an absolute minimum , the one-ton instrument is housed in an underground chamber and set in 15 tons of concrete . The parts were machined with the utmost possible precision by a Cambridge instrument maker . The lenses are ordinary high-grade lenses such as are manufactured by Zeiss or Bausch &; Lomb . The focus , however , is geared down 100 times finer than in any stock microscope . To change the focus by one millimetre would require 25 minutes of hand turning on the focusing knob . Such tedious labor is avoided by driving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is running the focusing position is indicated on a calibrated dial whereon one unit represents 2 millionths of an inch . <P> Dr. Graton achieved his high magnification on mineral specimens polished to mirror smoothness in a grinding machine of his own devising . He believes the instrument would be equally useful for biological work . By no means a publicity seeker , he had the microscope in operation for a long time before first publishing a description of it last month .
