With a soldier 's contempt for the feelings of the Anarchist , Communist and assorted Marxist adherents of the Valencia Cabinet of Premier Largo Caballero in Spain last week , White Generalissimo Francisco Franco let his radiorating General Queipo de Llano appoint as Military Governor of Mlaga , just captured from the Reds ( TIME . Feb. 15 ) , a soldierly Bourbon , the middle-aged Duke of Seville , onetime Colonel in the Spanish Infantry of King Alfonso XIII . <P> Set up was a court-martial to try all more or less authentic Reds on whom the White victors could get their hands , much as the defenders of Mlaga set up after the civil war began a " people 's court " to crack down on any Spaniard who seemed to be more or less Monarchist or even middleclass . That an orgy of Spanish vengeance did not at once erupt in Mlaga last week , as it has erupted after almost every previous White victory in Spain 's civil war , seemed to be due to the fact that decisive in taking Mlaga fortnight ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local enthusiasm for Spanish fratricide but quietly did all they could to restrain the acts of General Queipo de Llano , though no one could restrain the words of Spain 's hottest-headed " Radio General . " By week 's end the Spaniards tried , condemned and actually executed in Mlaga numbered only 200 , this first batch being mostly officers and men of Spain 's pre-civil war regular Army who had sided with the Reds . <P> With the victory at Mlaga , which deprived the Valencia Cabinet of their last seaport on the south coast of Spain , came a tough problem for the Italian press . As yet Il Duce does not choose to make it official that Italian forces are fighting in Spain , but also last week Benito Mussolini did not choose to keep his people fror glorying in a victory won largely by Italia arms . The solution : Italian papers printed nothing from their own correspondents about Mlaga , reprinted under banner headlines stories in which London , Paris , Berlin and other papers had spilled the facts . <P> Significantly meanwhile British Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to " vacation " on the French Riviera , although Mr. Eden has only just finished enjoying the long English Christmas and New Year holidays . In London foreign policy was thus in full charge of Sir Robert Gilbert Vansittart , a leading figure last year in " The Deal " which sealed the fate of Haile Selassie ( TIME , Oct. 14 , 1935 et seq . ) . Last week such veteran correspondents as the New York Times P. J. Philip scarcely veiled their overwhelming hunch that the French , Italian and German Ambassadors and Sir Robert were sealing the fate of Valencia .
