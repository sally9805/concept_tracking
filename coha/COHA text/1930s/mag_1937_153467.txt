In September 1864 , General William Tecumseh Sherman finally succeeded in taking Atlanta . After surveying his well-equipped army in the Georgia city , he proposed a bold plan which he thought would be so destructive to military resources and civilian morale that the exhausted Confederates would throw up the sponge and end the Civil War . In November , after General Grant had reluctantly sanctioned this maneuver , General Sherman assured everyone that he would " make Georgia howl , " and began his historic March To The Sea . A month later , when the March ended at Savannah , Georgians had ample reason to howl and howl they did . By the tough general 's own conservative estimate , the damage done amounted to $100,000,000 . It was South Carolina 's turn to howl next . General Sherman headed his troop : north and began destroying things right &; left . By the time the capital city of Columbia was sacked and burned , South Carolinians were howling as loud as their Georgia neighbors . <P> Last week General Sherman had South Carolina and Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going forth as an engraved image on a harmless new 3 stamp with likenesses of his old accomplices , General Ulysses Simpson Grant and General Philip Henry Sheridan at his side . But to many Georgians and South Carolinians , General Sherman is still repugnant in any form . At Columbia , where an indignant legislator heatedly recalled that the west wall of the State Capitol still bears scars made by Sherman 's cannon balls , the South Carolina House oi Representatives passed a resolution calling upon South Carolina 's national Senators and Representatives to demand that the Post Office Department stop the memoria issue because the military career of General Sherman " is a history of rapine , carnage , destruction and murder waged principally against defenseless women and little children . . . . " At Atlanta , the Georgia Senate considered a similar resolution while the House argued a proposal to approve the stamp only if the Government at this late date admit and pay for the damage Sherman 's army did in Georgia . <P> The Post Office Department nevertheless announced that the stamp would go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert E. Lee and Thomas Jonathan ( " Stonewall " ) Jackson would be memorialized on a 4 stamp next month .
