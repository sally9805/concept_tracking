That women who expect to develop cancer of the breast should have their ovaries destroyed by knife , X-ray or radium was a suggestion which Dr. Wallace Edgar Herrell of the Mayo Clinic last week proposed in the American Journal of Cancer . His theory : female sex hormones affect the breast ; mice deprived of their sex hormones do not develop cancer of the breast ; cancer of the breast improves in some women after ophorectomy ( castration ) . <P> Dr. Herrell 's facts : among the women patients of the Mayo Clinic , breast cancer is rare among those who have been castrated , common among those who have not . <P> Tied up with fact and theory is the dictum of Prof. Maud Slye , Chicago mouse-breeding geneticist : that cancer of the breast runs in families . Also tied up with all this is the probability that , if castration actually prevents mammary cancer , the operation must be performed at least three years before the disease is expected to break out .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
