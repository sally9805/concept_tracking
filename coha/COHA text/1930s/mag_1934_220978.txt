Last week the whole cinema industry seethed with the kind of undercover excitement that theatregoers never see on the screen . Producers and exhibitors called in their lawyers , talked of stopping license fees to sound-recording equipment makers until the situation was clarified . Sound technicians wondered if they would have to dust off obsolete recording methods for emergency service . Reason was that bald , long-nosed William Fox , armed with a U. S. Supreme Court patent decision , was out of the well-lined hole into which he was cudgeled four years ago . This half-forgotten ex-newsboy and shoe-polish hawker was bent on raising as much hell as possible in the industry from which he had been exiled . In October 1929 , William Fox celebrated the Silver Jubilee of his film enterprises . Frenzied buying and frenzied borrowing had made him the undisputed grand panjandrum of cinema , ruling a $200,000,000 empire . He had just got control of Loew 's , Inc. for some $75,000,000 . He paid another $19,000,000 for a string of Gaumont theatres in Britain without ever looking at them . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market crash caught him amidships , his creditors hemmed him in , charged him with mismanagement . Even his able right-hand man , Winfield ( " Winnie " ) Sheehan , turned against him . When the smoke of battle cleared , William Fox had been beaten and ousted by a group headed by Utilitarian Harley Lyman Clarke of General Theatres Equipment Corp. , Harold Leonard Halsey of Halsey , Stuart &; Co. , and John Edward Otterson of Electrical Research Products , Inc. , subsidiary of A. T. &; T. William Fox got $21,000,000 for his stock and a salary of $500,000 a year for five years . These tidy sums he called meagre consolation . He had always , he said , preferred action and achievement to money . Mr. Fox retired to his lairs-the apartment on Manhattan 's Park Avenue where he collects antique musical instruments , his Long Island Estate adjoining a golf course where he plays in the low 80 's . There he turned his keen mind to the matter of patents . R. C. A. Photophone and A. T. &; T. 's Electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " double print " method of recording , the " sprocket " method of reproduction . Other systems were obsolete . But William Fox was sure those processes infringed on patents which he had acquired from three Germans and transferred to American Tri-Ergon Corp. , his personal holding company formed in 1928 . He sued Paramount Publix , the Wilmer &; Vincent circuit and a Paramount Publix subsidiary . In effect he was suing R. C. A. Photophone and Electrical Research Products , both of which leaped to defend the defendants . <P> Fox contended that his patents were so broad he could rightfully claim tribute from virtually everyone who made sound equipment or produced or exhibited talking pictures . A Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his claim . The defendants scoffed . claimed the court 's opinion was muddled and divided , appealed to the Supreme Court . Last fortnight the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeals . That meant that , on the strength of the lower court 's decision , William Fox was a potential dictator of sound-recording.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
