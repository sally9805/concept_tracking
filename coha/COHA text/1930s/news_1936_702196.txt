txt Speaking in the city in which the Federal Constitution was written and in the convention hall in which his opponent was renominated , Governor , Landon accused President Roosevelt tonight of extravagance , of ignoring the checks and balances on spending , provided by the Constitution , and of " open and impudent use of public money for political purposes . " He said that the costs must come out of the pockets of the " little fellow . " " We forget that the waste of this administration is waste of the people 's money  --  our money , " the Republican nominee declared . " The extravagance of this administration is extravagance with the people 's money  --  our money . And it is the people 's money  --  our money ? that has been used to create the most sinister political machine of our history . " No words of idealism , no claims of good intention can shift responsibility for this machine . The responsibility rests upon one man and one man alone . It rests upon the President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since August in the supposedly doubtful State of Pennsylvania , the Governor was told by party leaders that he would carry the State by several hundred thousand ; in talks with them he expressed confidence of his own election . Speaking earlier in the day at Baltimore and Wilmington , he again charged that the President was attempting to substitute a planned economy for the American form of government , and quoted from a 1931 speech by Rexford G. Tug-well , Under-Secretary of Agriculture , to support his contention that the President 's advisers were trying to remake America according to a pattern derived from abroad . The Convention Hall was filled with an enthusiastic crowd of 20 , - 000 , with several thousand outside unable to get in . Introduced by M. Harvey Taylor , State Chairman . as " a native-born Pennsylvanian , " Governor Landon received a tremendous ovation . Mr. Taylor did not have a chance to present him by name , as the men and women in the audience saw the Governor and broke out into a storm of cheering , at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demonstration three men dressed to represent " The Spirit of 1776 , " and two Civil War veterans , bearing a placard inscribed " We Fought to Save the Nation ; You Do the Same , " stepped to the front of the platform , bringing more cheers . The demonstration , which lasted nearly four minutes until checked by the Governor , was one of the most enthusiastic he has received . When Governor Landon asked a series of questions beginning with " Who is going to pay the bill for all this spending ? " the audience soon caught up the refrain , " We are , " and the response was particularly emphatic to a question , " Who is going to put an end to this ex-travagance ? " Applause interrupted the Governor frequently . Cries of " it wo n't work " followed his assertion that scores of millions of New Deal dollars had been thrown into Pennsylvania to carry the State . There was great applause when he began a sentence " When I take office as President . " The audience cheered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the hall . Pledges Efficiency on Budget Governor Landon told the audience that it was not the wealthy who would " pay the piper " on New Deal costs , for if every penny of incomes above $5,000 last year had been confiscated , it would not have been enough to pay the cost of the Federal Government . He criticized Congress as having abdicated its constitutional function to protect the public purse , said that a new word , " boondoggling , " had to be invented to characterize the Roosevelt methods of spending , and promised to end the use of relief and other public funds for political purposes . He pledged himself , if elected , to appoint an independent and efficient Director of the Budget and Controller General . Governor Landon said that President Roosevelt , speaking as a candidate in 1932 , had said , " Taxes are paid in the sweat of every man who labors , " but speaking as a candidate for re-election this year would have the American people believe that taxes were paid only out of the coffers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " he commented . The Republican nominee added that the President , speaking at Worcester last Wednesday , had made a statement that consumers ' taxes , hidden taxes which fell much more heavily on the poor man than on the rich , had been reduced during his administration . Charges Congress Surrendered " This is an amazing statement , " said Mr. Landon . " It is an amazing statement because only a year ago in a public letter dated Sept. 2 , 1935 , he said exactly the opposite . This was the famous letter in which , he offered a ' breathing spell ' to American business . In this letter he wrote these words : ' In 1929 consumers ' taxes represented only 30 per cent of the national revenue . Today they are 60 per cent . ' " The Governor declared that one of the most important constitutional safeguards was the provision that all revenue legislation must be initiated in the House , the branch of government closest to the people , and added : " But under this administration revenue bills have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drafted by the executive branch of the government and driven through Congress without adequate debate . " The President had demanded that Congress transfer to him its control over the spending of public funds , he charged , and Congress , surrendering , had granted blank checks totaling more than $13,000 , - 000,000 . " And what happened when Congress surrendered this responsibility ? " the Governor continued . " Public money was spent to count the trees in the capital of your State . " Public money was spent to measure the cubic contents of buildings . " Public money was spent to build a giant concrete checkerboard . " It seemed to matter little so long as public money was spent . " Resettlement Project Assailed The Governor asserted that " taking up a water main on one side of the highway and laying it down again on the other side of the highway " was not so bad as " taking up people from one part of the country and putting them down in another . " " Two hundred and seventy-five million dollars was allotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It cost more than the whole standing army of the United States last year . All the new soak-the-rich taxes of 1935 could not pay for this one piece of extravagance alone . " No government could afford such waste , least of all when its people were struggling out of a great depression , he commented . Mr. Landon went on to say that no one knew better than the people of Pennsylvania the brazen manner in which the Roosevelt administration had used money in the name of relief . " The unemployed have been told that if they do not support the President they will be thrown off the relief rolls , " he charged . " Scores of millions of public money has been poured into Pennsylvania in a desperate effort to carry the State in the coming election . " No one knows better than the people of Pennsylvania the growing resentment of the public against an administration so callous to public decency that it tries to force people to sell their votes for bread . " Chairman Taylor 's Remarks In his speech introducing Governor Landon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience if they were going to elect a man who approved of such known Communists as Dubinsky and Hillman as candidates for the electoral college . " Are you going to elect a man who encourages his satellites to say to the hungry and distressed , ' You vote for our ticket or you get no bread ? " he said . " Are you going to vote for a man who has his heel on your neck and his band in your pocket and at the same time calls you ' my friends ' ? " We became the greatest nation in the world because the people supported the government . Now we are in reverse . The government supports the people . The banks must support the government and the people support the banks . " Before Governor Landon 's arrival , while City Chairman Edwin R. Cox was speaking , a Roosevelt supporter in the galleries caused a brief disturbance by shouting something which brought cries of " put him out . " The galleries called for " The Sidewalks of New York , " but Mr. Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rain prevented a turnout as large as expected when Governor Landon arrived here early this afternoon . In the center of the city the crowds were rather large , and cheered him , but the spectators , clad in raincoats or carrying umbrellas , were rarely more than one or two deep as they lined up on the curbs . There were a few boos for the Governor , but many more cheers . In some places there were cheers for President Roosevelt , as Mr. Landon 's automobile parade passed . On one occasion such cheers brought the retort , " Back to Russia , " from a Landon supporter . The Governor was met at the railroad station by Mayor Wilson , nominally a Republican , but a neutral so far in this campaign , and drove with him to Independence Hall . He looked at the Liberty Bell and sat for a moment at the table at which the Declaration of Independence was signed . A large and enthusiastic throng in front of the Bellevue Stratford Hotel cheered him as he left his car and went to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party leaders Mr. Landon was told by G. Mason Owlett , national committeeman , that he would carry Pennsylvania by a minimum of 250,000 . " And I would n't be surprised if the Landon plurality in this State goes to four or five hundred thousand , " said Mr. Owlett . Mr. Cox , the city chairman , agreed with this prediction and I offered to bet " any amount of money " that the Republican national ticket would carry Philadelphia . Henry P. Fletcher , general counsel of the Republican National Committee , quoted Governor Landon as saying , when asked if he was satisfied with the outlook for his election : " Absolutely , I am going to win . " Talks to Republican Women A delegation of students from Bryn Mawr , Temple , Swarthmore , Pennsylvania , Drexel , Princeton and Haverford , among whom was Miss Eleanor Taft , granddaughter of the President , saw Governor Landon on behalf of the People 's Mandate to Governments to End War . He shook hands with them but made no comment . The Governor attended a luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the hot dog man who applied to " Professor Rugwell " for a loan of $100 to extend his business . The hot dog man obtained the loan when he raised his request to $26 , - 000,000 . " Then the hot dog man says after he received the loan , " Mr. Landon said , " Will you make out two checks , one for $100 and one for $25,999,900 ? ' " When asked why he wanted it that way , the hot dog man replied : ' Well , I want the $100 for my hot dog stand and the remainder to pay my taxes . ' " Just after 5 o'clock , Governor Landon 's advisers forbade him to see more callers , and he went to bed for a rest before his speech . He left tonight for Pittsburgh , regarded as a New Deal stronghold , where he will speak on the " spoils system . "
