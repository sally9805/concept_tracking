txt Commutation Fares . To the Editor of The New York Times : The increase in commutation rates at present in force on the lines of the New York Central has resulted in a decrease in the number of commuters traveling to stations beyond White Plains . My own case , for example . Last , year I commuted to Golden 's Bridge from May to November , six full months , at a rate of $12.87 , a total of $77.22 . This year I will commute only three months , which , at 25 per cent increase in rates , will total $48.24 , a loss to the railroad of $28.98 . ' If the rates were to be increased 40 per cent there would still be a loss to the railroad of $22.99 . The loss would be further increased by the fact that many people would cease to commute . The rates of 1931 should be restored for all points beyond White Plains . Would suggest also that in addition to the regular commutation tickets special tickets for either the first or second half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many who would prolong their stay in their Summer homes for two weeks if it was not necessary to pay the full monthly rate .
