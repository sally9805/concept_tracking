With high hopes one evening last week hundreds of earnest music-lovers went to Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House , prepared to listen in all respect to a long-neglected masterpiece . Gluck 's Orjeo et Eurydice , missing from the Metropolitan repertoire since 1914 , had been promised as one of the highlights of the Popular Spring Season ( TIME , May 25 ) . The production was to be in a way experimental , with the singers placed in the orchestra pit while dancers from the American Ballet mimed their roles on the stage . Even among purists such a prospect aroused little concern . A similar device had worked successfully with Rimsky-Korsakov 's Cog d'Or , seemed ill-suited to the 18th Cen-tury Gluck , whom Isadora Duncan consistently referred to as the greatest of dance composers . <P> What Ballet Master George Balanchine and his collaborator Paul Tchelitchev offered was the most inept production that present-day operagoers have witnessed on the Metropolitan stage . The bereaved Orpheus was personified by Lew Christensen , a tall , strapping young man from Portland , Ore. , who wore black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyre on his back , expressed his sorrow by thrusting his fists into the air , swaying before a funereal mound which could easily have covered scores of Eurydices . Muscular William Dollar , a native of St. Louis , leaped into the picture as Amor ( Love ) , wearing white tights and great white wings . Dancer Dollar 's function was to lead Dancer Christensen to the entrance of Hades , a giant cage contraption which housed furies and scarlet demons who proved no more terrifying than Punch &; Judy puppets . <P> The performers in the pit were no better than average . The Orpheus was Contralto Anna Kaskas from Bridgeport , Conn. ; the Amor , Maxine Stellman from Brattleboro , Vt. ; the Eurydice , plump Jeanne Pengelly , a native of Toronto , whose part was danced by pretty , half-clad Daphne Vane . Conductor Richard Hageman , rejoining the Metropolitan after an absence of 14 years , did his best by the stately , sculptured score . But only those , who were smart enough to close their eyes could reap its full benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air suspended by wires . When Orpheus and Eurydice were peacefully reunited , he climbed on top of them , suggesting nothing so much as a Japanese tumbling act . The finale brought laughter which would have driven the hulking , pock-marked composer into one of the rages for which he was famed . Fair-minded critics spared the dancers , who had merely followed their instructions , concentrated their blame on Choreographer Balanchine and his bogus conceptions .
