The long awaited White Paper , disclosing how much His Majesty 's Government will spend in 1938 on " The Empire 's Greatest Peace Time Armaments Program " ( TIME , May 3 ) was issued last week in London , debated for just one day and passed 347-to-133 . <P> Before trying to digest any of its unpalatable , stupendous totals , an average taxpayer in any of the seven Great Powers might well ask : " How much per capita are we all paying for defense ? How much did we actually pay in 1937 ? " <P> Governments do not make it easy to arrive at such figures , and some of them deliberately lie , but experts of the League of Nations think their researches , costing thousands of dollars yearly , have produced figures worthy of some credence , except in the case of Germany where no figures have been released . Using the League 's figures for the other Great Powers , and taking for the Reich 1936 estimates which the British Statesman 's Year-Book presents , the latest statistics show total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that per capita : <P> The German paid $5.57 <P> " Italian 6.19 <P> " Japanese 6.20 <P> " Frenchman 6.93 <P> " U. S. Citizen 7.69 <P> " Russian 23.02 <P> " Briton 27.24* <P> Sir John Simon , Chancellor of the Exchequer , showed in his White Paper last week planned expenditures of $1,758,750,000 for the coming fiscal year which begins April 1 , whereas the total for the previous fiscal year was $1,417,500,000 . <P> The new British national defense tax ( TIME , June 28 ) , a five-year super tax on business organizations , is expected to yield $100,000,000 . The Chancellor will borrow $450,000,000. + Income-tax yield , Sir John Simon hopefully announced , is now running 13% above last year in the United Kingdom , but his White Paper is frank in showing that the Chancellor has not planned as yet where he will get some $275,000,000 of the $1,758,750,000 he is sure Mother Britain is going to spend on Safety First . <P> Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain recently sounded fair warning that rearmament expenditure by Britain will continue to increase each year at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's White Paper said : " The paper proceeds on the assumption , now almost universally accepted , that the steps taken by His Majesty 's Government to make good our defense are unavoidable and that they furnish a steadying influence in the present state of international relations . " <P> " I Would Fight ! " As debate on the White Paper opened in the House of Commons this week , Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain digressed to rebuke all who think he is not for the League of Nations ( see p. 17 ) , then explained that Britain is " spending till it hurts " to build up " almost terrifying power . " This " will not be used for aggression " he promised , will have " a sobering effect on world public opinion . " Until the United Kingdom is secure , the Dominions , he hinted , could fend for themselves , be rescued later .
