txt Yesterday 's session of the trial of James J. Hines , Tammany district leader , came to an abrupt halt with a demand for a mistrial , which Supreme Court Ferdinand Pecora decided to study over the week-end . The third such motion in this case , it was the first that Justice Pecora deemed to necessitate more than a minute 's scrutiny . The demand , based upon a question in which District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey linked the name of Hines and the phrase " poultry racket , " was shouted by Lloyd Paul Stryker , defense counsel , bringing to a halt the cross-examination of Lyon Boston , who had been an assistant district attorney under William Copeland Dodge . Mr. Boston testified for the defense that Mr. Dodge had instructed him in the Spring of 1935 to investigate fully reports that Hines was connected with the policy racket . Mr. Dodge let this investigation ? which finally centered on a vain attempt to make J. Richard ( Dixie ) Davis talk after he had received immunity ? go on without any interference at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dodge and Harold Hastings , then chief assistant , in the grand jury room when Davis was questioned on July 10 , 1935 , was at the request of the young Assistant District Attorney , who wanted their expert= enced advice , the witness added . Did Not Learn Gang Names Mr. Boston 's story showed that he had been put in charge of the investigation of the policy racket within three months of the time he was made an Assistant District Attorney on January 1 , 1934 , and that by midsummer of 1935 he had not learned the names ' of Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer 's gangsters who were in control of the racket . On direct examination , Mr. Boston said that one of the reasons , the grand jury of that Summer " ran away " under the leadership of Lee Thompson Smith and demanded a special prosecutor was that the grand jurors had demanded the indictment of Hines on what the District Attorney considered sufficient testimony . This he described as being partly responsible for the split . He mentioned specifically the testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coiltempt charge for refusing to reveal the source of his information . On the cross-examination , Mr. Dewey asked : " I understand you to say the only reason for the grand jury 's desire to indict Hines was the Mooney testimony about Hines being in policy ? " " I did not mean to imply that , " Mr. Boston answered . " There was other mention of Hines , but I felt that it was equally incompetent . " " William Fellowes Morgan , the Commissioner of Markets , discussed the subject at length in the grand jury , did n't he ? " " I do n't recall that , " Mr. Boston said .

Boston said that desiring to et " was prejudicial and that if Justice Pecora did not sustain the motion it could be argued as a repersible error on appeal , in the event of a conviction . The matter will be decided at the opening of court tomorrow . This dramatic closing capped the testimony of Mr. Boston . Had Worked Against Dodge Under Mr. Stryker 's examination he had testified that Mr. Dodge sent for him to offer him an appointment as assistant district attorney . He added that , although a Democrat , he had not been very active politically , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Gould Schurman Jr. , now Chief City Magistrate , who was one of Mr. Dodge 's opponents ' in the 1933 election , the other being Mr. Pecora . Three months after the appointment , he testified , he had been assigned to investigate policy cases . He conceived the idea that since lawyers represented policy runners and controllers on their arrests , but were not known to these defendants , they must be hired by the policy bankers , and he worked out a plan whereby these lawyers might , by pressure of prosecution for contempt , perjury or disbarment proceedings , be made to testify as to the identity of the bankers . Mr. Boston testified that he made a test of this plan on Harry A. Vogelstein , who represented a great number of policy defendants  --  and who was later convicted in the restaurant racket case  --  and succeeded in having Vogelstein given a thirty-day sentence for contempt . His investigation of policy from this angle , in which a number of runners and controllers , and a few " small independent " bankers were convicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , in the Spring of 1935 , Mr. Dodge assigned him and Maurice Wahl , a Republican assistant district attorney , to go into policy again . " Mr. Dodge , " Mr. Boston related , " told me that he wished me particularly to investigate the connection , if any , of Mr. Hines with the policy business . He told me that he had known Mr. Hines for a number of years and that he believed that Mr. Hines was innocent of any wrongdoing , but that there was a great deal of talk about Hines being connected with the policy racket and particularly with lay a firm foundation ' for the cow templated action against Davis th and Mr. Wahl went to Mr. Hastinga and Mr. Dodge . " We all of us asked Hastings tee , present this , and so lay the teeter nical foundation . and for that ' reason it was Hastings that c ducted the questioning on June Judge Dodge was present as a stander and asked a number questions of Davis . It so happe that I was present as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't ask any questions , ccording to the stenographer 's rn utes , and I assume that I did n't . " These were the two parts of Mr. Boston 's direct testimony most directly affecting the case that Mr. Stryker was putting in for his client  --  to show that there was no interference on the part of Mr. Dodge with the grand jury investigation and to contradict the testimony of Davis on that point . Says Gamblers Were Reticent Mr. Dewey , on cross-examination , showed how the present case had been built up in his office . Under his examination Mr. Boston testified that he had not ever succeeded in getting runners to testify against controllers , controllers to- testify against the policy bankers , and the bankers in turn to testify against the gangsters . In this case it is the gangsters who have testified against Hines . Mr. Boston testified that the aim had been to accomplish something like that .

" Mr. Dewey then brought out that when Davis appeared before the grand jury he had received immunity , so that any testimony he sisted , " that Davis , when he withheld information , was protecting only Iv.nes and others , not him ? self ? " Over Mr. Stryker 's objection , the witness was permitted to answer ; " I should say that if these other people , as they have now testified , with the exception of Mr. Hines were in that game that they . would be the people that Davis was protecting , and not himself , except ht have given would not have Heated himself , except on rges of perjury in the event that lied , or disbarment proceedings . the basis of the grand jury rec . So that when Davis said , for exple , that he did not know nder , Davis was not protecting self from criminal prosecution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prating , " Mr. Boston replied . his back on it and walked awa qwq Mr. Stryker was on his feet split second after his client , viri a swift jerk of his head and movement of his elbow , had nudg Joseph Shalleck , also of couns sitting next to him at the coun saying , " Mr. Dewey has made intentional prejudicial stateme not predicated on any evidence er revelations of the sort , proAlted a large amount of public inrest and the grand jury went ter evidence .
