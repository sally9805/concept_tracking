txt The second place St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in the first game of a double-header yesterday , 4 to 2 , but lost the second game , 8 to 7 , when the Dodgers hammered Dizzy Dean for three runs in the seventh and final inning . This put the Cardinals 21A games behind the Cubs . BY IRVING VAUGHAN . The Cub juggernaut rolled on again yesterday , crushing the New York Giants and carrying the relentless league leaders to the fourteenth successive triumph in their pennant dash . The score was 5 to 3 , the flattening blow coming in the sixth Inning when 30,239 superheated spectators had a chance to roar at the sight of three members of the league leading brigade ( Merging across the plate . The fourteenth sireighI victory did more than equal the season 's high run recently established by the world champion Cardinals . Linked with the even break handed out to the titleholders by the Brooklyn Dodgers. the victory added a half lap to the margin by which Charley Grimm 's club is pacing the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the second placers . And the Giants are about ready to chuck their pennant hopes . They 're 51 : : games from the top . Schumacher 's Arm Injured . For quite a stretch yesterday it appeared the Cubs would be forced to abandon their winning streak . They could do nothing with the right handed ace of the enemy slat , Hal Schumacher . Five innings of swinging against his fireball delivery had netted only two singles , one of them producing a run . His own manager , Bill Terry , had presented him with a 2 to 1 edge by driving a homer far into the bleachers with an employe on base . Then Schumacher 's working arm suddenly went dead because of a strained shoulder muscle . The Giant star had two man out of the way in the fifth , and while pitching to Bill Jurges something snapped in Ahis right shoulder . could n't get the ball over and purges walked , whereupon time was called . Schumacher threw a few practice balls , decided he could continue , and concluded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Angie Galan , who led off in the sixth , so Manager Terry ordered him to retire . Allyn Stout dashed to the rescue , but the Cubs promptly hit him , and the Giants erred , Three runs went home and that was enough . French Shaky at Start . Larry French , although winner of his season 's 16th game , was no nerve soother , either for his mates or the assembled multitude . The southpaw workman insisted on flirting with trouble . The Giants had him rocking with the bases full after one was out in the first . He continued to escape despite more hits in the next three innings . The New Yorkers added three more hits in the fifth when they finally scored , making a total of nine hits up to this point . But from then on he did better . There were only two hits and one run off him in the four concluding innings . Unlike the Cubs , who aside from one inconsequential error carried French along with their brilliant defense , the Giants either were jittery or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opening inning . They did it again in the third , and it did n't annoy Schumacher . But a blunder behind Stout in the decisive sixth helped pave the way to one run and possibly two . Then they put on another comical miscue behind Leroy Parmelee in the seventh and the Cubs made use of it to score their final run . Jackson Too Slow . Jackson 's ailing leg was all that kept the Giants from scoring during the excitement they stirred up for French in the first inning . After Moore had fouled to Hartnett , Jackson singled to center . Terry 's drive went to the left center field wall for a double and normally Jackson could have scored with case , but preferred to stop after limping to third . Leiber was purposely passed , filling the bases , and it turned out to be excellent strategy . The dangerous Ott ' fouled to Hartnett and relief came when Demarce caught Mancuso 's fly . One hit was enough to lead the Cubs into their one run advantage in their half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an every day grounder to Critz , but the ball took an unexpected hop and pulled Critz so far off balance that he could n't make the throw to Terry . On what was planned as a hit and run play , Herman stole second and continued to third on Mancuso 's bad throw . Lindstrom 's fly to Ott scored him . French Escapes Again . The Giants were after French again in the second and again nothing happened . Schumacher doubled to right center after two were out and moved to third when Moore caromed a single off French 's glove . Jackson 's fly to Lindstrom cleaned up this threat . In the third Leiber singled with one gone , but was doubled in an attempted steal as Ott fanned . While all the above items were be- ' ing staged as a matter of torment for French the Cubs were 100 per cent helpless before Schumacher 's lire ball pitching . He dropped three of them in a row in the second . He also restricted them to three batters in the third , although one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three again in the fourth . Terry Smashes One . After their numerous futile threats the Giants finally came charging through in the fifth . Schumacher led off with a slow roller toward third and it hopped past French for a hit . Moore spanked a fly to short center and Lindstrom dropped it , but saved himself an error by recovering in time to throw out Schumacher at second . Jackson flied to Lindstrom and is looked as if French was going to escape for the fifth time , but Terry was still to be heard from . The manager let French pitch himself into a 3 and 1 hole and then waited for the cripple . It came and Terry sent it on its way into the center field end of the right field bleacher for a home run , Moore preceding him across the plate and putting the New Yorkers ahead , 2 to 1 . Leiber tried to sustain the attack by singling through short , but French fanned Olt for the second time . Schumacher Taken Out . After retiring the first two men to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was where his right shoulder began to bother him and he asked for time out while he made a few practice tosses . He decided to continue and managed to get French on a popup for the third out , but when he came back In the sixth he started off by walking Galan . Out he went , much against his wishes , and the Cubs promptly assembled for their big three run parade . Stout was summoned to fill in for the departed Schumacher . The hit and run was called for and Herman sent a bounder over Jackson 's head for a single , Galan scooting to third . He scored and Herman went to second on Lindstrom 's deep fly to Leiber . Hartnett was purposely passed , the idea being that Gabby 's lack of speed might contribute to an easy double play . Demaree crossed up the strategy . He knocked a single into left and Moore , hustling to make a throw to the plate , let the ball roll to the wall . By the time he captured it and heaved it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on third with one out . He never reached home . Parmelee rushed in to relieve Stout and fanned both Cavarretta and Hack . Leiber Lets One Go . Leiber was the guilty one in the fourth defensive slipup by the Giants , thus assisting the Cubs to the run registered in the seventh . French singled through short with one out . Galan lined a single to right center and Leiber , in what appeared to he a clumsy effort , inadvertently permitted the ball to roll on its way . French skipped around to the plate and Galan took third on the blunder . Parmelee then fanned Herman and Lindstrom fouled to Terry . With a little encouragement from Hartnett , the Giants crept up by scoring once in the eighth . Leiber opened with a pass and took second on a passed ball by Gabby . Ott lined a single to left and Leiber moved to third . Then Mancuso tapped to French , who preferred to let Leiber score and take a chance on a double play . Ott was forced at second , but Mancuso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly by Bartell and a force play on Pinch Hitler Da nning 's grounder concluded the inning .
