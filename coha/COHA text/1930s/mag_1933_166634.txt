When an interviewer asked Publisher Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis what piece of music he would like to listen to on his deathbed , he promptly replied : " Hymn to the Night . " - the hymn written by Organist Hermann Kotzschmar , his father 's friend in Portland , Me . On his deathbed at ' " Lyndon , " his estate near Philadelphia , last week old Mr. Curtis , who would have been 83 on June 18 , heard no music . Comatose , in the last grip of a heart ailment from which he had long suffered , he did not even see at his bedside his only daughter , Mrs. Mary Louise Curtis Bok ; his stepdaughter . Mrs. John Charles Martin and her husband , his newspaper-publishing partner . Two days later the great pipe organ downstairs on which Mr. Curtis liked to improvise for a few minutes before breakfast ( sitting on a special stool because he was short ) , breathed the strains of " Hymn to the Night " while the Men 's Singing Club of Portland sang the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my sight away . . . . " Large among the floral pieces which banked the music room was one in the shape of a harp , on which roses marked the notes of the first bars of the hymn . In several cities seven other pipe organs , gifts of Mr. Curtis , whispered the same peaceful melody that afternoon as his body was borne to its grave in West Laurel Hill Cemetery . Cyrus Curtis ' death was a sequel , rather than an end , to a conventional U. S. success story of monumental proportions . About ten years ago he gave authority over his rich magazines . Saturday Evening Post , Ladies ' Home Journal , Country Gentleman , to able Editor George Horace Lorimer . His newspapers , the Philadelphia Public Ledgers , Inquirer and New York Evening Post are run by Stepson-in-Law Martin . Publisher Curtis contented himself in recent years largely with sailing up &; down the Atlantic Coast on his steam yacht Lyndonia , summering at his beloved Camden , Me. , eating simple fare like baked beans and fish cakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of New York Evening Post , invariably stopping at the cigar stand in the lobby to buy a copy of his paper for 3 . As diffidently as an old man who wanted to ask the editor to print a letter about the flower beds in Central Park , he would venture through the editorial offices , exchanging nods with reporters whose names he did not know , looking grateful for their recognition . Hardly ever did he go up to his penthouse on the roof of the Post building in which a French chef prepared luncheon every day in case Publisher Curtis should want it . Since the death of his second wife , Mrs. Kate Stanwood Pillsbury Curtis , in Philadelphia a year ago , while he was gravely ill in the hospital with her , Publisher Curtis had rarely ventured away from home . Most U. S. schoolboys can recite the newsboy-to-tycoon story of Cyrus H. K. Curtis , as told by his son-in-law the late Edward William Bok , * but it is doubtful if he is a hero to many of those boys . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of his career provides a text for a sermon on honesty , thrift , diligence , perseverance , kindliness , charity . But- and it may well be the fault of his biographers-Cyrus Curtis has never been brought as vividly to life as one might expect of a man whose properties were capitalized at $40,000,000 , did better than $100,000,000 business in 1930 , and who in 1925 ,
