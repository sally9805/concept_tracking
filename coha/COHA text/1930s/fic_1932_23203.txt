RED RIDING HOOD AND THE WOLVES A STORY BY R. HERNEKIN BAPTIST T IKE Red Riding Hood , Anna Becker had promised to carry some food to her grandmother 's house four miles away , in the next village  --  two kinds of sausage , a small wedge of cheese , a loaf of rye bread , margarine , and some apples for cooking . Anna was eighteen and rosy and pretty . Yes , in spite of all the poverty and want that followed this terrible nightmare of war , Anna 's youth bloomed triumphantly , just as the primroses were carrying on the business of spring . A proper little Teuton maiden , so fresh was her color , so flaxen her hair , so clear blue her eager eyes . Even her body was not so flat and thin as the bodies of her girl friends . Although they had all been half starved since they were pale and frightened little girls of eleven and twelve , the lack of good food had not affected her looks as it had spoiled the beauty of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually had more figure than was at the moment considered fashionable . The fashion of the day , meant for flat-chested , lean young women , made Anna somewhat too noticeable in the street . Her mother told her friends it was her sweet temper that made Anna so plump ; but secretly she believed plumpness to be the only type of feminine beauty worth considering . At the same time Anna 's attractivecurves often made her mother feel anxious . With all these foreign soldiers around it was no joke having such a pretty daughter to worry about . Ach , but how lovely it had been in her own youth , in the nineties ! She could have walked alone all over Germany . By river , forest , and mountain she had seemed guarded as a nymph is guarded by elemental forces . Now mothers had to say to their daughters at the early age of twelve years , or even ten , or nine , " Do n't take the short cut through the wood . There arc often foreign soldiers about . Even the black troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at certain hours . " And little daughters would stare and say , " Ach , Mtitterchen ! They wo n't murder me if I meet them . " And mothers would hesitate and murmur , " No . . . No . . . not murder , of course . . .. What an idea ! " But when Anna was about sixteen she no longer said , " Ach , they wo n't murder me ! " She listened uncomfortably to her mother 's warnings , shrugged her shoulders , put on the coldest look of indifference , and went her way . Still , the young girls were very careful , although they never admitted it to their mothers . They went about in groups and ran as few risks as possible . And no longer did the forests and the rivers and the mountains welcome the young German maidens as if they were nymphs born of Earth and the Gods . The forests , once so loving , roared , " Enter not , my daughter ! " And the mountains put on a dark , forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the lovely afternoon of spring when Anna set out to walk to the little village of X she had not meant to go alone . It was her friend Elsa who had disappointed her . The two girls had certainly meant to walk together ; but Elsa 's aunt from Berlin had turned up unexpectedly , and the family had to dance attendance . Of course Anna should have gone back to her mother 's house . But on a spring day , when one 's body seems to dance impatiently for exercise . . . Besides , at Granny 's house there lodged a young student who was studying engineering . Sometimes one met him in his dirty overalls , straight from the workshops . He would flush all over with annoyance , and this made it great fun . It was just like teasing him . And then , suddenly , you do not want to tease any more . You simply say , " Will you see me part of the way home ? " And be will say , surprised , " Whet ? Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me change first . " And you look at his agitated face and say very quietly and frankly , " I love to see men in their uniforms  - -  the insignia of their profession , their toil . Is not this grander than any military uniform ? " And you look at each other as if  --  as if you were reading a book . And you both feel so modern and so mature . He walking proudly in his dirty overalls , and you snatch off your hat , if you have one , and swing it contemptuously about . As if it were not your best one . . . . While Anna was hesitating her rebellious feet began to speed very lightly on the way . Yes , while these alluring thoughts sang in her mind her feetautomatically marched Anna on the way to X , alone . At first it was delicious to be walking alone and thinking of the engineer student at Granny 's . Never had spring made one feel so young , so strong , so capable , so full of ambition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tender sky and the fresh scent of young leaves and wet soil almost made one sick with longing for the future : to get at grips with these flying visions . There was not a soul on the road but herself . At her right stretched the wood , part of an ancient forest which not even war had quite sacrificed . Its trees , beeches , birches , and oaks , grew far apart , and this gave an air of space and light . The old stumps of martyred trees were now green and mossy , covered with the young leaves of blueberry and surrounded with springing bracken , stiff with new life . What a. figure of youth was Anna , striding jauntily along in her flat , boyish shoes , her high-belted coat , her green beret , and flying scarf ! If was long since she had been alone . It exhilarated her to be alone with her thoughts  --  to be away from other girls , even from Elsa . Not a soul on the road in front of her . The world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes , the soldier cycled slowly along . He too was enjoying the spring . And because he enjoyed the spring he was glad to see a woman in the landscape . At first lie regarded the woman as part of the scene . The wood , the flying scarf , the trees in the wind had nothing to do with him , a French soldier . He was merely cycling through a strip of enemy country . Enemy trees , enemy spring , enemy  --  enemy woman , ha , ha ! The sly smile sharpened to a point of light in his brown eyes . He peddled faster , steering his cycle through the softer , more silent part of the road . He would have a look at this enemy woman . As far as he could judge from a distance she must be as plump as a partridge . He hated skinny women . Too many of them in Germany , since the War . Not worth a franc , some of them . A fine , swinging walk she had , too . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whistling . At last Anna heard the recurring squeak of the leather saddle , the pressure on the tires , like a faint hiss . Surprised in her reverie , she looked back . The soldier had no time to rearrange his expression . Those sly , smiling eyes met hers , with all that was in his heart nakedly revealed . The War , for him , had not ceased . Anna was plunged into circumstances which , in discussion with her girl friends , she had often had to picture . " What would you do , Marthe , if a French soldier tried to molest you ? " " Yes , or a black soldier ? " A black one ! Ugh ! " There 's no French soldier I 'd be afraid of . A girl always has it in her to escape if she wants to . " " Of course  --  if they want to . It 's only the Other Kind who say they get molested . The fact is , they want to be . " " Of course . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . Just like wild beasts . Like meeting a lion who will spring on you because it is his nature to do so . No question of morals . " " Yes , they say the blacks have no reasoning power , and that is why they 're so dangerous . " q " Yes , and of course no religion to prevent them from pleasing themselves . They say that what the missionaries teach them makes them worse instead of better . Makes them think too much about themselves and then . . . " " Ah , well ! I rather think I 'd be a match for any Frenchman though . I could manage any little French soldier that happened along . " Anna tried to inflate her courage with these girlish ideas . But she had never seen evil looking out from a man 's eye as she had surprised it in this soldier 's . And the landscape so empty . Elsa , her friends , her mother , so far away . She remembered with a stab of fear that odd look in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of which she had discussed with her friends . How they had laughed at their mothers , one summer evening , as they strolled , four of them arm-in-arm , under the fir trees ! One of them had started to sing : Do not stray , at dusk of day , From the gate , my daughter ; Please avoid the juniper-tree And do n't go near the water . They had all joined in , laughing exuberantly in the safety of one another 's company , in the intoxication of the starry darkness . Other men 's eyes always held a friendly smile for pretty Anna . No , she had never feared men , who looked so kindly at her . But here was something new . Here was enmity , ill-will . Here was  --  that evil her mother would not name ? Or might it not even be that other evil which is allowed on the lips of the youngest girl  --  might it not even be murder ? Had there not been quite a number of such crimes in that part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers ? .. . Oh , there had , there had ! Oh , mother , you will not let me be . .. hurt ? Not your Anna , dear mother .. . . While Anna 's feet took her bravely along the road , her heart began to beat in panic . She could have choked with the strange feeling of oppression in her chest and throat . Presently he cycled slowly beside , cruelly watching her feelings . " Have you nothing to give a poor French soldier , Fraulein ? Just one little keepsake ? One little hour of your company , for remembrance ? One little hour of armistice , all our own ? " Poor Anna quickened her pace , until she felt a hand on her left shoulder . " Or must I take it , Fraulein ? " The light touch suddenly became hard pressure . His fingers hurt her . Anger came to her aid . With all her strength that foolish Anna turned to him and pushed . The bicycle wavered wildly . It fell over , so sudden had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as she had done it , she realized her mistake . She should have parleyed , dallied , flirted , made love , gaining time , playing him like a fish while he stalked her like a tiger . Even a scream for help would have been more useful than this senseless angering of the brute . What a childish thing to do ! The distracted girl ran . While the soldier sorted himself out , felt his arm which had hit a stone in the road , recovered a few coins that had fallen from his pockets , Anna ran like the wind . She ran into the wood . Her only hope was the wood with its deep depressions , grassy mounds , patches of scrub , large trees , and baffling sameness . Like a dryad Anna fled to the trees . But what was her loving Earth-Mother doing to let her meet a black man ? She had thought she heard voices or singing not far away . . . Rushing in panic round the base of a hillock which promised a hiding-place , the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all little girls of the district , the Black Man himself . Strange to say , she hardly noticed the man 's color . Humming deeply to himself , he came strolling between the birches swinging his stick like a drum major , the very picture of nonchalant giant strength . The heavy , huge face , dreamy from the reveries of song , was like a mask . It conveyed nothing but brute strength in brute repose . The Black Man was feeling spring too . After a miserable , sunless winter this alien had made the sunlit , secret wood his own . Like Pan , he wandered securely in magic haunts , warm and fertile . He hummed in a voice incredibly deep and rich some barbarous phrase whose very monotony breathed joyous content . Rhythmic as nature , rhythmic as savage drums , he hummed the little phrase . A giant 's child , alone and singing to itself , who could fear him ? Forgetting that he was a bogey , Anna fled to the only protection in the landscape . " Please , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to his arm as if she had a right to that place of sanctuary . Like a startled buck , the black man glared all around him , stiffening to meet action . " Is it a bull ? What is it , Missie Fraulein ? Is it one of those black-trash Senegalese ? " The deep voice reverberated all about her . " A man  --  a French soldier ... he put his hand . . he hurt my shoulder . . . He would n't let me go . . " Anna began to cry with the relief of this huge protective presence miraculously at hand . " Hu ! A French soldier ? Then we need not run . Let him find us . " Madusa despised the French because they treated black men almost as themselves . At the same time he almost trembled with joy at the sensation of a white woman , a young , young white woman , clinging to him for pro-tection . Not since he had rescued his master 's little son from drowning in a half-empty sixty-foot well had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his mistress , the child 's mother , had flung her arms about him and kissed him on the cheek . The bads had patted his shoulders and wept tears while with his own hands he stripped off the wet clothes and carried him in a blanket into the hot sun . Hot , hot sun in Rhodesia . . . For it had been long before a rope could be found to reach the cold , black water where he held up the struggling child . Hot sun , and brandy , and the bans kneeling beside him  --  that was the one oasis of joy which Madusa could look back upon in his life . For , when he was twenty-three and working in the gold-mines .. . Madusa almost brushed off that clinging hand at the thought of what had happened when he was twenty-three and working in the gold-mines ... . " Please , please let us run away ! I think I hear him coming now , " whispered Anna in new panic . " No , Missie Fraulein , no . " Madusa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of whispering . " If we move now , that man will see us . " He pushed her to her knees and dropped on his own . They waited in silence . Twigs snapped in the distance . When the soldier looked down on them , evilly smiling through his rage , from the top of the mound which he had climbed in order to get a better view , Madusa wasted no time . Three lunging strides took him to the top of the mound . He seized the Frenchman 's ankles , pulling his feet from under him , and rolled him down the slope . Then after a moment 's meditation , as an artist looks sideways at hiswork asking " What next ? " he dragged the soldier , helpless as a marionette , to a sharply ridged small bowider and broke one of his ankles across it . Serious , busy , virtuous as he who kills a snake , he performed the brutal act in front of Anna . He was surprised when she screamed at the sight , at the sickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ankles of some smelt-out culprit so that he should not escape before more serious punishment was meted out  --  the ant-heap , or the stake in the sun ? The soldier fainted away , groaning . " That man not follow Missie to-day . Not any more , " said Madusa , with simple pride . But a ferocious act , which had seemed simple and necessary to Madusa , made Anna realize that her protector was a savage . One of the great bogey breed of which young girls had always been warned . She realized that , the white man now being out of action , she was alone with a black man in a lonely place . Yet , strangely , fear did not shake her , as it had shaken her when the French soldier put his hand upon her . There was , surely , something in this black man which inspired trust . Something reasonable , human . Still , she must go carefully . Guile , which Anna had failed to use in her encounter with the soldier , became her instinctive weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arranging her hair , her beret , and scarf neatly . In that moment she became a woman of the world . " How can I thank you for saving me ? " she said , looking up with clear , friendly eyes . " Wo n't you come with me as far as my grandmother 's ? I feel afraid to walk alone  --  now . " And this was very true . Rather walk with the wolf than feel his breath behind you . " Go  --  go with Missie ? To white lady 's house ? " Madusa stared down at her . His gaze was like a high , dark wall . How could such as Anna know what lay behind it ? A generation or two of racial suffering , of rage , and intolerable patience . Fear and bewilderment of the newly tamed creature at each gilded side of civilization , dumb humiliation of the newly caged . Vanished peace of the savage , free to exercise his barbarism with no reminding whip of the white man 's gods  --  conscience and progress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house-boy in the town of many gold-mines . Yes , his good bans had died , and Missis had taken young master away to school across the sea . That was how it was that Madusa had come to work in another baas 's house near the gold-mines . In Rhodesia he had been garden-boy , but in the town he had worked in the kitchen . In the kitchen many very little things , like toys , he had never seen . He had also worked in the room where they ate . Many very little things . No common stew-pot for all . He had worked in a room where his new missis and other white women , old and ugly , played with the cards . A foolish room  --  many very small things that were never used , not even for earrings or for decorating the belt . In another room where he worked were papers , his baas 's papers , many , many papers . When they were dusty his missis spoke harshly to him . When he made them very clean and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possessions . Madusa had , with broken pride , even worked in the sleeping rooms of women . Young women like his master 's daughters , who went away in the tram every morning but did not make their beds . He , Madusa , had been ordered to defile himself touching thebeds and the wash-pots of women . All their secrets which , in the kraal , a young man can not interfere with , nor a young woman speak of without disgrace , were carelessly displayed . Sometimes he met them going to the bathroom half-clad . Their cold , busy eyes ignored him . They swept him aside as if he were a child or blind . Or they would snatch angrily at their clothing to protect themselves from his gaze . As if it were his fault .. . as if all women did not go naked to the waist in his kraal . Why should he wish to see a sight that was an everyday matter to a black man ? He had felt quite sick with longing for his kind first missis in Rhodesia who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , nevertheless , often spoken to him in his own tongue , who had nursed him when he was sick , ' ho had respected his manhood and the greatness of his tribe . Never had a black man made her bed or seen her half-clothed , or angry for unknown reasons . Then , suddenly , he left this new missis . That new missis had said he was to wash clothes , all the clothes of the household . Many garments were thrown down in a heap on the kitchen floor one morning . Yes , they defiled his cooking room with the odor of garments that ought to be washed by the women at a running stream , as in Rhodesia . His clean kitchen stank of white people , so that Madusa went out and spat many times , washed himself at the yard tap , and rolled up his blanket and mouth-organ for immediate departure . And yet , four years later , when he was working underground in the mines . . . Ah , but that was after he had gone back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man is once married he learns impatience , incontinence . He does not , like the young bachelors , spend his time in sweet dreams of the unfulfilled and the rare . Nothing will satisfy him but what is real . Yes , it is easier for the unmarried man to feel virginal , to sing and dance instead of pursuing a woman as he had pursued . . . Madusa walked through the wood with German Anna , flaxen Anna , as round and sweet as a young Zulu woman . His brooding gaze into her clear countenance had been but a flash of time . For the past is like one of those ancient paintings in the caves of Madusa 's country  --  it is seen at a glance . Yes , years and days are woven together as the women weave grass : many days they sit at it and then  --  the eye sees it all in the space of a man 's counting ten cows on his fingers . The doings of a moon , a season , many seasons , appear as a woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white girl , Madusa had seen in a flash of time the day when he had watched another young white girl take a short cut between the mine dumps that rise like pyramids above the gold-mines . Some were , these dumps , in shape like gigantic huts of clay . And on the remote , pointed tops of them small black figures which were men , ceaselessly poured out the endless waste of the mines , which the wind blew into mouth , eyes , nose , and lungs , causing sickness . For months Madusa had lain under the same roof with men . And these not even men of his own tribe , but often dirty , unwarlike Fingoes and Xosa.s . It was of no avail that he dreamed of Mavala , so warm and so soft beside him in the friendly glow of the wood ashes of their hearth in Rhodesia . When he awoke from such dreams there was nothing but the bitter hardness of the cement cubicle , the sighings and groans of a dozen mensimilarly wakeful and , in winter , shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted on a stick the days that still had to run of his time of indenture to the mine . Then , on the very day before he was to return to Mavala and Mavala 's baby and the fire and the mealie-lands , his money , the wages of a year , had been stolen from him by two Basuto thieves . Twenty pounds they stole , the savings of a year 's absence from Mavala , a year of cement beds and the great , exhausting labor in the darkness of the mine . A year of shocks and fears , of rockfalls and earth-tremors that might any day engulf men from the very light of life itself . For every day , in the mines , a man was killed . It was but a few hours after this theft that Madusa , brooding on a bitter winter day among the mine dumps , a day when darkness and incipient snow hung like a pall over the town , saw the young girl with a school-bag alight from a distant tram and turn in between the dumps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a plantation on her way to one of the mine cantonments . His need fora woman , for a moment 's forgetfulness , now that he was again separated from Mavala for countless days and nights of toil and loneliness , overcame him . He rose , heavily groaning , and , as if led by an unseen hand , took a path which would intersect the young girl 's way through the trees . . . Yes , one sees life in a flash . Ten lashes and seven years for the crime of rape . And thus , instead of waiting only one more year for Mavala , he had to wait seven . And that in a place where , as in the mine compounds , there were no women . At the age of thirty Madusa was free . He hurried to Rhodesia , but his wife , they told him , must be dead . She had gone to the gold-mines to find him , and now she had not been heard of for some years . Undoubtedly she must be dead . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not as in the old days , before the white man came , when every life was accounted for by the old women of the tribe , as if , like priestesses , they kept the Rooks of Birth and Death written on the mind . Now the old women were useless , even as recorders of birth and of death . Now Madusa , a black man convicted of rape , walked beside a white woman who had appealed to him for protection . The ineffable balm of that moment almost made him feel like the young boy who had jumped into a well to save his master 's child . Pride , an engine long still , began to thump in his breast . As for desiring the woman , he was able to let his gaze rest on her coated figure without curiosity . He did not connect her fresh , virginal beauty with the white women he had known  --  women of the streets , with their emaciated , scented forms and hateful pallor , as if they had never lain in the sun . Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work , her mother and father , her three uncles and seven cousins all killed in the War . Never could Anna guess how precious was this artless talk to her companion . She could not , deliberately , have thought of anything so comforting to the human being at her side . How often , in Madusa 's life , had white folk spoken to him naturally of their homes , their relations , their work ? Since he was a young man , never . Patronage he had received from " social workers , " offers of religious brotherhood with white clergy , and that tinkling , sly familiarity , which corrodes a black man 's pride , on the lips of prostitutes . What the black folk need of the white is that common frankness in everyday matters . For the only barrier the black man understands is not class , but the color of a skin . Anna became natural , lost her fear . She even became silent and thoughtful as they walked quickly along the edge of the wood . Then she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is your home ? " " 1 am British soldier . African Native Labor Contingent . My home is Africa . " Good heavens , what a voice ! Every vowel brimmed with its full value as in a song , deep and broad and flowing as his native Zambesi . Madusa 's voice resounded in the ancient wood as it had resounded from mountain to African mountain , spreading the news to kinsmen and clan , as it is when young giants walk abroad in the peace of barbarity . Madusa strutted like a drum major . The innocent vanity of the savage warmed him through and through . Anna took several little runs and skips to keep up with this new gait . " When this War was over , my little master from Rhodesia stayed with his regiment near here . He sent long letter to Dieppe saying Madusa could stay with him now until he go back Africa . I am Master Reggie 's batman . Yes , Missie Fritulein ! " Virtue coursed warmly through the veins of Madusa . He would certainly tell Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French soldier . He directed a look of beaming pride at the pretty young missie skipping along by his side , happy and smiling again in her great relief and safety . They came in sight of the village . Madusa stopped and said a peculiar thing . " Safe now , my Missie . Madusa , he safe too . " " Oh , but you must come in and see my grandmother ! She will be so ? " Madusa held up his hand to silence the pretty prattler . " No , Missie Fraulein , " he said gently . " No , ray Missie . That would be  --  a pity . " His eyes rested on hers , unfathomably deep . From something in that long gaze , in which sorrow and pride mingled so richly , Anna felt a strange new wound . Tears flooded her eyes . She seized his band with both of hers , bent her head , and warmly smoothed her check against it . Consolation for she knew not what . Her savior stood dumbly towering above her . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of iron , a Frankenstein creation , felt the shooting pains , the growth of a soul , about to split his universe . And now Madusa was returning through the wood . The French soldier must not be allowed to die of starvation no French soldier was worth murdering . Better carry him to the highway where he would certainly be found before nightfall . And then he , Madusa , must go quickly away , back to Africa , after telling Master Reggie all about it . Intoxicated by this glittering moment of his life , in which he was lord of himself , Madusa broke into a wild tribal war chant . Seizing a handful of bracken , he decorated his cap with upstanding plumes . He broke off a great staff for himself , as big as a chief 's staff . His boots he hung about his waist , trophies of civilization . Prancing and lunging , posturing , mincing and leaping , there came backto him ancient ceremonial steps of the primitive warrior . Not one of Madusa 's easy conquests of women had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather had they left him morose and sullen . Now he knew where his power lay ! Like the mighty chief Samson , he would keep away from women . He would renew his strength like the eagle . He would return to the kraal . He would go to Hamburg and sign on as stoker on the German-Africa line . Yes , he himself would feed the hungry ship . He would feel her , as the result of his strength , speeding to Africa , to the kraal , to the sun . Resolve poured like molten iron through his veins . With powerful , ecstatic monotony he sang one phrase over and over . Motif and refrain , motif and refrain  --  the chant of many men who together lift a great weight . But he , Madusa , had lifted a weight alone . . . The French soldier was conscious again . When he heard the great voice grow louder and louder in its approach he put his hand convulsively in his pocket . It certainly never occurred to him that this extraordinary brute was returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his small terror-sharp eyes he watched between the trees that were laden with spring . .. . The dancing figure appeared , the soldier pulled the revolver from his pocket . He shot the black man through his joyous heart , with all his dreams and his virtue and his energy unshattered and radiant .
