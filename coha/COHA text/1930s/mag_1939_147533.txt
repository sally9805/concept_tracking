September added over $6,000,000,000 to the value of New York Stock Exchange securities . But last week , stock prices marked time , the Dow-Jones average of 30 industrial leaders fiddled &; fussed between the September 12 high of $155.92 and $150 ( August 31 : $134.41 ) . September 's stock buyers wanted to know if they had got ahead of the business procession , if so , how far . One reason why $87.50 seemed a more logical price than $100 for War Baby No. i Bethlehem Steel , was this kind of calculation : the very lowest estimate of September 's gift to U. S. warehouses runs at something like $1,000,000,000 of unconsumed production . Meanwhile , standard domestic consumption indices ( like department store sales ) are doing no booming at all . Even Montgomery Ward and Sears , Roebuck have suddenly lost their 1938-39 oomph . Only a real export boom seemed likely to save the U. S. from some pretty drastic inventory trouble . <P> Alternately the market went to pieces on headlines about 1 ) peace , and 2 ) Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines about i ) long war , and 2 ) Congressional repeal of the arms embargo . But the net result of all this switching back &; forth between war &; peace got the market nowhere . One favorite pastime was restless switching from one fancied war baby to another : Wall Street Journal 's , Broad Street Gossip Column noted that Sept. 26 one broker got 60% of his commissions from switches , that one customer had switched 15 times in the last two weeks without getting anywhere . <P> Nor was any money going into World War I 's favorite commodities . Earlier in the month knowing speculators in copper had been stung by the price being pegged at 12 a Ib. ( 1918 high 26 ) . Europe was showing no signs of needing U. S. copper . Another World War II flop was wheat , which boomed to 92 first week of September , ended the month at 87 ( 1918 high : $2.25 ) . Reason : for the week ended Sept. 23 , U. S. grain exports totaled 366,000 bushels against 2,779,000 bushels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got somewhere for some specs was sugar . But this exploded too when Secretary of Agriculture Wallace took the lid off all marketing restrictions . <P> One place where money was going was into such ordinarily dead issues as coal stocks , which nothing short of a World War could volatilize . This World War , by pushing Germany and England out of the world coal market , was bringing U. S. coal companies some pretty fair export business . In addition , if anybody stood to profit momentarily from industrial forward buying , they did : they could n't fill their orders . Pittsburgh Coal was traded at $8 ( up almost 300% from $2 ) , Consolidation Coal at $6 ( up over 500% from $1 ) . <P> Another favorite stunt was buying behind the inventory boom : buying pipe-line companies which have n't yet reflected profits from increased oil production ; buying chemical stocks like Union Carbide , Air Reduction and Allied Chemical in order to cash in on the inventory boom in the steel and textile industries these companies supply ; buying rail equipment companies like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuel and Iron which seem sure to get the profit booming carloadings should be bringing the unprepared U. S. railroads.
