SCENE : The verandah-living room of the Frothingham estate . Bay Cottage in Northern Maine . It is a charmingly furnished room with beautiful old distinguished pieces . A chintz couch and chairs give the room an air of informality . Beyond the door back you see a spacious , more formal room . Through the series of glass windows over the curving window seat on the right wall you see the early budding lilac and sumach . Woodbine and Virginia creeper are sprawling over the fence of native stone . Silver birch and maple are beginning to put out their leaves . The tops of red pine and cedar are visible over the rocks which fall away to the sea . Time : The present . A lovely afternoon in May . At Rise : MRS . WYLER , a very old lady and WILL DEXTER , an attractive , serious boy , are engaged in conversation . MRS . WYLER is knitting . WILL DEXTER When you were a young girl in Cleveland , did you see much of Mr. Rockefeller ? MRS . WYLER Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the office . But he never came to our house . We were young and worldly . He was strict and religious . WILL DEXTER Did you suspect , in those days , how rich you were going to be ? MRS . WYLER Mercy no ! We debated a long time before we moved up to Cleveland from Oil City . My mother thought Oil City was no place to bring up a young girl . She finally persuaded my father to let us move up to Cleveland . But there was a lot of talk about the expense . p. 3 WILL DEXTER Was Oil City lively ? MRS . WYLER ( Demurely ) It was pretty rough ! I remember the celebration when they ran the first pipe-line through to Pittsburgh . That was a celebration ! WILL DEXTER The oil just poured , did n't it ? Gushed out of the ground in great jets , and the people swarmed from every-where to scoop it up . MRS . WYLER I remember we had a gusher in our backyard . We put a fence around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL DEXTER Were you excited ? MRS . WYLER Not by the oil . WILL DEXTER I should think you would have been ! MRS . WYLER ( Dryly ) We were n't . Oil was smelly . We wanted to get away from it . We discovered bath-salts . WILL DEXTER You did n't know it was the true fountain of your  --  dynasty ? MRS . WYLER We left it to the men  --  as I look back over my life the principal excitement came from houses  --  buying and building houses . The shack in Oil City to the mansion on Fifth Avenue . We had houses everywhere  --  houses in London , houses in Paris , Newport and this  --  and yet , it seemed to me , we were always checking in and out of hotels . p. 4 WILL DEXTER It seems strange to think  --  MRS . WYLER What ? WILL DEXTER This golden stream  --  that you stumbled on so accidentally  --  it 's flowing still  --  quenchless  --  and you on it  --  all you dynastic families  --  floating along in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read these books about the early days of oil  --  these debunking books , you call them  --  they make me smile . WILL DEXTER Do they ? Why ? I 'd like to know that . MRS . WYLER They 're so far from the truth . WILL DEXTER Are they ? MRS . WYLER Of course they are ! WILL DEXTER Why ? MRS . WYLER Because they 're written from a foreign point of view  --  not our point of view . We did as well as anybody could have done according to our lights . WILL DEXTER Yes , but what sort of lights were they ? MRS . WYLER ( Tolerantly ) There you are ! WILL DEXTER How lucky you were ! MRS . WYLER ( Teasing him ) Our young men did n't moon about . They made opportunities for themselves ! p. 5 WILL DEXTER Or did the opportunities make them ? All you had to do was pack your week-end bag and pioneer . MRS . WYLER Is the world quite exhausted then ? WILL DEXTER Possibly not , but our pioneering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . WYLER Yes , yes . ( Benevolently ) I suppose you 're one of those young radicals our colleges are said to be full of nowadays . Tell me , what do you young radicals stand for ? WILL DEXTER I have n't decided exactly what I 'm for , but I 'm pretty certain what I 'm against . MRS . WYLER ( Pumping him ) Most young people are bored by the past . You 're full of curiosity . Why is that ? WILL DEXTER ( Not committing himself ) I 'm interested . MRS . WYLER At my age to be permitted to talk of one 's youth is an indulgence . Ask me anything you like . At my age also one has no reason for restraint . I have had the bad judgment to survive most of my contemporaries . WILL DEXTER I love talking to you , Mrs. Wyler . I think you 're very wise . MRS . WYLER ( with a sigh ) Go on thinking so  --  I 'll try not to disillusion you ! ( A moment 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 6 WILL DEXTER Oh , no , I have to go back to Amherst to get my degree . MRS . WYLER And after that ? WILL DEXTER ( Humorously ) The dole ! ( The old lady laughs ) MRS . WYLER My daughter tells me she 's invited your father here . WILL DEXTER Yes . MRS . WYLER I shall be so glad to meet him . He 's an inventor , is n't he ? WILL DEXTER He 's a physicist . Specializes in  --  MRS . WYLER Do n't tell me  --  in spite of my great wisdom I ca n't keep up with science . Whenever anybody makes a scientific explanation to me I find there are two things I do n't know instead of just one . WILL DEXTER ( Cheerfully ) Anyway , Dad 's been fired . MRS . WYLER I am very sorry to hear that . WILL DEXTER He 's been working on a method for improving high-speed steel . MRS . WYLER Did he fail ? WILL DEXTER He succeeded . ( MRS . WYLER is surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketed , might increase the technological unemployment . They have decided therefore to call a halt on scientific discovery  --  especially in those branches where it might have practical results . That is one of the differences , Mrs. Wyler , between my day  --  and yours  --  in your day , you put a premium on invention  --  we declare a moratorium on it . ( The old lady gives him a shrewd look ) p. 7 MRS . WYLER Yes , yes . I am perfectly sure that you 're in for a hard time , Will . WILL DEXTER ( Lightly , shrugging his shoulders ) As I have been elected by my class as the one most likely to succeed , I am not worrying , Mrs. Wyler . All I have to do is bide my time . MRS . WYLER ( Amused ) I am perfectly certain you 'll come out ! Paula tells me you and your friend , Dennis McCarthy , want to start some kind of magazine . WILL DEXTER Yes . A national magazine for undergraduate America . You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , college men were supposed to live exclusively in a world of ukuleles , football slogans , and petting-parties  --  College Humor sort of thing . But it was never entirely true . Now it is less true than ever . This magazine  --  if we can get it going  --  would be a forum for intercollegiate thought . It would be the organ of critical youth as opposed  --  to the other . MRS . WYLER What other ? WILL DEXTER The R.O.T.C. , the Vigilantes and the Fascists  --  the Youth Movement of guns and sabres  --  MRS . WYLER I see . Well , I wish you luck , Will . p. 8 WILL DEXTER Thank you . ( PAULA FROTHINGHAM comes in , a lovely young girl in gay summer slacks ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( To WILL ) Are n't you swimming ? Hello , Granny . WILL DEXTER Your grandmother and I have been discussing life . PAULA FROTHINGHAM With a capital L , I suppose ? WILL DEXTER Enormous ! I 've been getting data on the pioneer age . Your grandmother thinks the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're lazy . MRS . WYLER ( Mildly ) Lazy ? Did I say that ? WILL DEXTER In a way . MRS . WYLER If I said it , it must be so . Everybody over seventy is infallible ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Nestling to her ) Darling ! MRS . WYLER Survival is quite a knack . You children do n't realize it . WILL DEXTER Oh , do n't we though ! It 's getting harder every day . MRS . WYLER Nonsense ! At your age you ca n't help it . WILL DEXTER In your stately opulence that 's what you think , Mrs. Wyler . You just do n't know ! p. 9 MRS . WYLER Nonsense ! Do you think your generation has a monopoly on hard times ? WILL DEXTER Now please do n't tell me we 've had depressions before ? MRS . WYLER ( Rising to go ) Paula , your young man is impertinent . Do n't have anything to do with him . ( She goes out ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM What a conquest you 've made of Granny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEXTER That undistinguished mob ! Who could n't ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM As long as you admit there is a mob WILL DEXTER Why would n't there be ? Everybody loves you for your money ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Confidently ) I know it ! And of all the fortune-hunters I 've had dangling after me you 're easily the most WILL DEXTER Blatant ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM That 's it ! Blatant ! Like my new slacks ? WILL DEXTER Love ' em . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Love me ? WILL DEXTER Loathe you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Good ! Kiss ? ( They kiss quickly ) p. 10 WILL DEXTER Funny thing about your grandmother PAULA FROTHINGHAM Now I wo n't have you criticizing Granny WILL DEXTER I 'm crazy about her . You feel she 's been through everything and that she understands everything . Not this though . Not the essential difference between her times and ours . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Oh , dear ! Is it the end of the world then ? WILL DEXTER The end of this world . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Goes to window seat right , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points through windows at the garden and sea beyond ) Look at it ! Too bad it has to go ! Meantime before it quite dissolves let 's go for a swim . ( She starts for door ) WILL DEXTER ( Abstracted ) All right . ( Following her to window seat ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( She turns back ) What 's on your mind ? WILL DEXTER Wanted to speak to you about something . PAULA FROTHINGHAM What ? p. 11 WILL DEXTER ( Embarrassed slightly ) Er  --  your mother . PAULA FROTHINGHAM What 's Mother gone and done now ? Out with it . Or is it you ? My boy-friends are always in love with Mother . I 've had to contend with that all my life . So if it 's that you need n't even mention it . come on . WILL DEXTER No , but really , Paula . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Well then out with it ! What is it ! WILL DEXTER This . ( He gives her note ) Found it on my breakfast tray this morning in a sealed envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , rather bewildered ) " To give my little girl a good time with . Leonie Frothingham . " WILL DEXTER And this ! ( He hands her check . PAULA takes it and looks at it ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM A hundred dollars . Does Mother think her little girl can have a good time with that ? She does n't know her little girl ! WILL DEXTER But what 'll I do with it ? How 'll I get it back to her ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Over my dead body you 'll get it back to her ! You 'll spend it on Mother 's little girl . Now come on swimming ! p. 12 WILL DEXTER Does your mother put one of these on every breakfast tray ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Argue it out with her . WILL DEXTER I ca n't . It would seem ungracious . You must give it back to her for me . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Catch me ! Do n't take it too seriously . She slips all the kids something every once in a while . She knows my friends are all stony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a convenience , that 's all . You 've got a complex on it . WILL DEXTER I have ! I 've got to have . It 's all right to be dainty about money when you 've lots of it as you have . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Rotten with it is the expression , I believe . WILL DEXTER I repudiate that expression . It is genteel and moralistic . You ca n't be rotten with money  --  you can only be alive with it . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You and the rest of our crowd make me feel it 's bad taste to be rich . But what can I do ? I did n't ask for it ! WILL DEXTER I know . But look here I 've got a brother out of college two years who 's worked six weeks in that time and is broke and here I am in an atmosphere with hundred-dollar bills floating around ! p. 13 PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( With check ) Send him that ! WILL DEXTER Misapplication of funds ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Warmly ) Mother would be only too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the point . You know , Paula  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM What ? WILL DEXTER Sometimes I think if we were n't in love with each other we should be irreconcilable enemies  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM Nothing but sex , eh ? WILL DEXTER That 's all . PAULA FROTHINGHAM In that case  --  ( They kiss ) WILL DEXTER That 's forgiving . But seriously , Paula  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM Seriously what ? WILL DEXTER I ca n't help feeling I 'm here on false pretences . What am I doing with a millionaire family  --  with you ? If your mother knew what I think , and what I 've let you in for in college  --  she would n't touch me with a ten-foot pole . And you too  --  I 'm troubled about the superficiality of your new opinions . Is n't your radicalism  --  acquired coloring ? p. 14 PAULA FROTHINGHAM I hope not . But  --  so is all education . WILL DEXTER I know but  --  ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM What are you bleating about ? Did n't I join you on that expedition to Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigner ? My back aches yet when I remember that terrible bus ride . Did n't I get my name in the papers picketing ? Did n't I give up my holiday to go with you to the Chicago Peace Congress ? Did n't I ? WILL DEXTER ( Doubtfully ) Yes , you did . PAULA FROTHINGHAM But you 're not convinced . Will darling , do n't you realize that since knowing you and your friends , since I 've , as you say , acquired your point of view about things , my life has had an excitement and a sense of reality it 's never had before . I 've simply come alive  --  that 's all ! Before then I was bored  --  terribly bored without knowing why . I wanted some-thing more  --  fundamental  --  without knowing what . You 've made me see . I 'm terribly grateful to you , Will darling . I always shall be . WILL DEXTER You are a dear , Paula , and I adore you  --  but  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM Still unconvinced ? WILL DEXTER This money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 15 PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 'll turn it over to you . Then you can give me an allowance  --  and save your pride . WILL DEXTER I warn you , Paula  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM What ? WILL DEXTER If you turn it over to me , I 'll use it in every way I can to make it impossible for anyone to have so much again . PAULA FROTHINGHAM That 's all right with me , Will . WILL DEXTER Sometimes you make me feel I 'm taking candy from babies . PAULA FROTHINGHAM The candy is no good for the baby , anyway . Besides , let 's cross that bridge when we come to it . ( ROBERT , the butler , enters ) ROBERT I beg your pardon , Miss Frothingham . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes , Robert ? ROBERT Telephone for you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Thank you , Robert . ( She crosses to table back of sofa for telephone ) ( At phone ) Yes  --  this is Paula  --  Dad !  --  Darling !  --  Where are you ? but how wonderful I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . Will you stay the night ? Oh , too bad ! I 'll wait right here for you . Hurry , darling ! Bye ! ( She hangs up ) Imagine , Dad ! He 's motoring up to Selena Bryant 's at Murray Bay  --  I 'm dying to have you meet him . He 's the lamb of the world . p. 16 WILL DEXTER Not staying long , is he ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM No . He wants to see Mother he says . I wonder . oh , dear ! WILL DEXTER What ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I was so excited I forgot to tell him . WILL DEXTER What ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM That a new friend of Mother 's is coming . WILL DEXTER The Russian ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM The Russian 's here . He dates from last winter . You 're behind the times , Will . WILL DEXTER Who 's the new friend ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 'm not sure about it all yet . Maybe Mother is n't either . But I 've had some experience in watching them come and go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEXTER Who is Dr. Rice ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Psychoanalyst from New York . ( Burlesquing slightly ) The last word , my dear  --  ( At this point the object of PAULA 'S maternal impulse comes in , running a little and breathless , like a young girl . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM , as she has a daughter of nearly twenty , must be herself forty , but , at this moment , she might be sixteen . She is slim , girlish , in a young and quivering ecstasy of living and anticipation . For LEONIE , her daughter is an agreeable phenomenon whom she does not specially relate to herself biologically  --  a lovely apparition who hovers intermittently , in the wild garden of her life . There is something , for all her gaiety , heartbreaking about LEONIE , something childish and child-like  --  an acceptance of people instantly and uncritically at the best of their own valuation . She is impulsive and warm - hearted and generous to a fault . Her own fragile and exquisite loveliness she offers to the world half shyly , tentatively , bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a drop must be spilled . A spirituelle amoureuse she is repelled by the gross or the voluptuary ; this is not hypocrisy  --  it is , in LEONIE , a more serious defect than that . In the world in which she moves hypocrisy is merely a social lubricant but this myopia  --  alas for LEONIE !  --  springs from a congenital and temperamental inability to face anything but the pleasantest and the most immediately appealing and the most flattering aspects of things  --  in life and in her own nature . At this moment , though , she is the loveliest fabrication of Nature , happy in the summer sun and loving all the world ) p. 17 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM My darlings , did you ever know such a day ? WILL DEXTER ( He is a shy boy with her ) It 's nice ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Nice ! It 's . ( Her gesture conveys her utter inadequacy to express the beauties of the day ) It 's  --  radiant ! It knows it 's radiant ! The world is pleased with herself today . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely young girl in blue and white . WILL DEXTER In green and white . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Agreeing  --  Warmly ) In green and white !  --  It depends where you look , does n't it ? I 'm just off to the station to meet Dr. Rice . Will , you 'll be fascinated by him . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Cutting in  --  crisply ) Sam telephoned . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Sam ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Your husband . My father . Think back , Leonie . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Darling ! Where is he ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM He 's on his way here . He telephoned from Miller 's Point . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is he staying ? p. 18 PAULA FROTHINGHAM No . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Why not ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM He 's going on to Selena Bryant 's . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What is this deep friendship between Sam and Selena Bryant ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Now Leonie , do n't be prudish ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Appealing for protection to WILL ) She 's always teasing me . She 's always teasing everybody about everything . Developed quite a vein . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In their heart of hearts men do n't like it . Do you like it , Will ? Do you really like it ? WILL DEXTER I hate it ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( In triumph to PAULA ) There you see ! He hates it ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Tersely ) He does n't always hate it ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Her most winning smile on WILL ) Does she bully you , Will ? Do n't let her bully you . The sad thing is , Paula , you 're so charming . Why are n't you content to be charming ? Are you as serious as Paula , Will ? I hope not . WILL DEXTER Much more . p. 19 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm sorry to hear that . Still , for a man , it 's all right , I suppose . But why are the girls nowadays so determined not to be feminine ? Why ? It 's coming back you know  --  I 'm sure of it  --  femininity is due for a revival . PAULA FROTHINGHAM So are Herbert Hoover and painting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia the women ( She turns again to WILL whom she feels sympathetic ) It is n't as if women had done such marvels with their  --  masculinity ! Have they ? Are things better because women vote ? Not that I can see . They 're worse . As far as I can see the women simply reinforce the men in their  --  mistakes . WILL DEXTER ( To PAULA ) She has you there ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( With this encouragement warming to her theme ) When I was a girl the calamities of the world were on a much smaller scale . It 's because the women , who , after all , are half of the human race , stayed at home and did n't bother . Now they do bother  --  and look at us ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Well , that 's as Victorian as anything I ever  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'd love to have been a Victorian . They were much happier than we are , were n't they ? Of course they were . p. 20 PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Defending herself to WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me  --  ( To LEONIE ) When you 're not around I 'm not like that at all . Am I , Will ? ( But WILL is given no chance to answer because LEONIE is holding a sprig of lilac to his nostrils ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Smell . ( WILL smells ) Is n't it delicious ? WILL DEXTER It 's lovely . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Here . ( She breaks off a sprig and pins it into his lapel . While she is doing it she broaches a delicate subject quite casually to PAULA ) Oh , by the way , Paula . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes , Mother ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Did you mention to Sam that  --  that Boris  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM I did n't , no . It slipped my mind . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It does n't matter in the least . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Father is n't staying anyway . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well , why should n't he ? You must make him . I want him to meet Dr. Rice . He 's really a most extraordinary man . p. 21 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Where 'd you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party at Sissy Drake 's . He saved Sissy . PAULA FROTHINGHAM From what ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM From that awful eye-condition . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Is he an oculist too ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( To WILL ) She went to every oculist in the world  --  she went to Baltimore and she went to Vienna . Nobody could do a thing for her  --  her eyes kept blinking  --  twitching really in the most unaccountable way . It was an ordeal to talk to her  --  and of course she must have undergone agonies of embarrassment . But Dr. Rice psychoanalyzed her and completely cured her . How do you suppose ? Well , he found that the seat of the trouble lay in her unconscious . It was too simple . She blinked in that awful way because actually she could n't bear to look at her husband . So she divorced Drake and since she 's married to Bill Wilmerding she 's as normal as you or me . Now I 'll take you into a little secret . I 'm having Dr. Rice up to see Boris . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAULA FROTHINGHAM What 's the matter with Boris ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm not sure . I think he 's working too hard . p. 22 WILL DEXTER What 's he working at ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Do n't you know ? Did n't you tell him , Paula ? His father 's memoirs . He 's the son , you know , of the great Count Mirsky ! WILL DEXTER I know . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I must show you the photographs of his father  --  wonderful old man with a great white beard like a snow-storm  --  looks like Moses  --  a Russian Moses  --  and Boris is sitting on his knees  --  could n't be over ten years old and wearing a fur cap and boots  --  boots !  --  and they drank tea out of tall glasses with raspberry jelly in  --  people came from all over the world , you know , to see his father . ! WILL DEXTER Is n't it strange that Count Mirsky 's son should find himself in this strange house on this odd headland of Maine  --  Maine of all places ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( With some malice ) Is Dr. Rice going to help you acclimate him ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I hope so . You and Paula will have to entertain him  --  you young intellectuals . Is n't it a pity I have no mind ? ( She rises and crosses to table right to arrange lily-of-the-valley sprigs in a vase ) p. 23 PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( To WILL ) She knows it 's her greatest asset . Besides she 's a fake . WILL DEXTER ( Gallantly ) I 'm sure she is . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Thank you , my dears . It 's gallant of you . ( She crosses to PAULA  --  embraces her from behind ) But I 'm not deceived . I know what Paula thinks of me  --  she looks down on me because I wo n't get interested in sociology . There never were any such things about when I was a girl . The trouble is one generation never has any perspective about another generation . WILL DEXTER That 's what your mother was saying to me just a little while ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of WILL ) I 'm sure though Mother and I are much closer  --  that is , we understand each other better than Paula and I. Do n't you think so , Paula ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Considering it ) Yes . I do think so . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I knew you 'd agree . Something 's happened between my generation and Paula 's . New concepts . I do n't know what they are exactly but I 'm very proud that Paula 's got them . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Laughing helplessly ) Oh , Mother ! You reduce everything to absurdity ! p. 24 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Innocently ) Do I ? I do n't mean to . At any rate it 's a heavenly day and I adore you and I do n't care about anything so long as you 're happy . I want you to be happy . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Helplessly ) Oh dear ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What 's she matter ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 're saying that ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is that wrong ? Will  --  did I say something wrong ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me to be eight feet tall and to sing like Lily Pons . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is it like that ? Why ? Will . WILL DEXTER ( Gravely feeling he must stand up for PAULA , but hating to ) Paula means . ( Pause ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes . ? WILL DEXTER ( Miserable ) She means  --  suppose there is n't any happiness to be had ? Suppose the supply 's run out ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But , Will , really . ! On a day like this ! Why do n't you go swimming ? ( Rises ) Nothing like sea-water for  --  morbidity ! Run out indeed ! And today of all days ! Really ! ( Gets gloves ) I 'm disappointed in you , Will . I counted on you especially . p. 25 WILL DEXTER ( Abjectly ) I was only fooling ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Of course he was . ( Sits on arm of sofa beside WILL ) Will , I rely on you . Do n't let Paula brood . Ca n't she drop the sociology in the summer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braced  --  for things like that . Keep her happy , Will . WILL DEXTER I 'll do my best now that  --  thanks to you  --  I have the means . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh . ( Remembering ) Oh , you did n't mind , did you ? I hope you did n't mind . WILL DEXTER ( Embarrassed ) Very generous of you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Generous ! Please do n't say that . After all  --  we who are in the embarrassing position nowadays of being rich must do something with our money , must n't we ? That 's why I 'm helping Boris to write this book . Noblesse oblige . Do n't you think so , Will ? Boris tells me that the Russians  --  the present Russians  --  WILL DEXTER You mean the Bolsheviks ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes , I suppose I do . He says they do n't like his father at all any more and wo n't read his works because in his novels he occasionally went on the assumption that rich people had souls and spirits too . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because I 'm rich I 'm just not worth bothering about at all  --  No , you could n't ! ( The appeal is tremulous . WILL succumbs entirely ) p. 26 WILL DEXTER ( Bluntly ) Mrs. Frothingham , I love you ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Rises from arm of sofa and sits in sofa beside WILL . To PAULA ) Is n't he sweet ? ( To WILL ) And I love you , Will . Please call me Leonie . Do you know how Mother happened to name me Leonie ? I was born in Paris , you know , and I was to be called Ruhama after my father 's sister . But Mother said no . No child of mine , she said , shall be called Ruhama . She shall have a French name . And where do you think she got Leonie ? WILL DEXTER From the French version of one of those Gideon Bibles . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( As breathless as if it happened yesterday ) Not at all . From a novel the nurse was reading . She asked the nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper book and Mother opened it and found Leonie ! WILL DEXTER What was the book ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Everyone wants to know that But I do n't know . Mother did n't know . She kept the book to give to me when I grew up . But one day she met M. Jusserand on a train  --  he was the French Ambassador to Washington , you know  --  and he picked up the book in Mother 's compartment and he read a page of it and threw it out of the window because it was trash ! You see what I 've had to live down . p. 27 WILL DEXTER Heroic ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I hope you stay all summer , Will . I wo n't hear of your going anywhere else . WILL DEXTER Do n't worry . I have nowhere else to go ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Tell me  --  that magazine you and Dennis want to start  --  will it be gay ? WILL DEXTER Not exactly . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , dear ! I know . Columns and columns of reading matter and no pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't he ? I am so looking forward to meeting him . I love scientific men . They 're usually so nice and understanding . Now , I 've really got to go . ( Rises and starts out ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Dennis will be on that train . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , good ! I like Dennis . He makes me laugh and I like people around who make me laugh , but I do wish he 'd dress better . Why ca n't radicals be chic ? I saw a picture of Karl Marx the other day and he looks like one of those advertisements be ore you take something . I 'll look after Dennis , Will  --  save you going to the station  --  ( To PAULA ) And Paula , tell Sam  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes ? p. 28 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Forgetting the message to SAM ) You know , I asked Dr. Rice if he would treat me professionally and he said I was uninteresting to him because I was quite normal . Is n't that discouraging ? Really , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ) WILL DEXTER But what was the message to Sam ? ( He sits ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Helplessly ) I 'll never know . Neither will she . ( WILL laughs ) What can you do with her ? She makes me feel like an opinionated old woman . And I worry about her . WILL DEXTER Do you ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes . She arouses my maternal impulse . WILL DEXTER ( Who feels he can be casual about LEONIE now that she is gone ) She relies rather too much on charm ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Turning on him bitterly ) Oh , she does , does she ! ( Goes over to sofa and sits right of WILL ) You renegade . You ruin all my discipline with Mother . You 're like a blushing schoolboy in front of her p. 29 WILL DEXTER ( Protesting sheepishly ) Now , Paula , do n't exaggerate ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM You are ! I thought in another minute you were going to ask her to the frat dance . And where was all that wonderful indignation about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pride ? Where was your starving brother in Seattle ? Where ? Where ? WILL DEXTER I do n't know but somehow you ca n't face your mother with things like that . It seems cruel to face her with realities . She seems outside of all that . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Conceding that ) Well , you 're going to be no help to me in handling Mother , I can see that ! WILL DEXTER ( Changing subject  --  a bit sensitive about having yielded so flagrantly to LEONIE ) This Russian  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM What about him ? WILL DEXTER ( Gauche ) Platonic , do you suppose ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Do n't be nave ! ( Enter SAM FROTHINGHAM , PAULA 'S father , a very pleasant-faced , attractive man between forty-five and fifty ) SAM FROTHINGHAM Oh , hello . ( WILL rises ) p. 30 PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Flying to him ) Darling !  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM ( They meet center and embrace ) Hello , Paula . Delighted to see you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM This is Will Dexter . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEXTER I 'm delighted to meet you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( To WILL ) Wait for me at the beach , will you , Will ? WILL DEXTER No , I 'll run down to the station and ride back with the others . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Okay . ( SAM nods to him . WILL goes out ) SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Crosses to front of sofa ) Nice boy . ( Follows her ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Like him ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Do you ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I think so . SAM FROTHINGHAM Special ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Sort of . p. 31 SAM FROTHINGHAM Very special ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Sits right end of sofa ) Well  --  not sure . SAM FROTHINGHAM Wait till you are . You 've lots of time . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Oh , he 's not exactly impulsive . SAM FROTHINGHAM Then he 's just a fool . PAULA FROTHINGHAM How are you , darling ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Uneasy . PAULA FROTHINGHAM With me ! SAM FROTHINGHAM Especially . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Darling , why ? SAM FROTHINGHAM I 'll tell you . That 's why I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , fine . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Mystified ) Then . ? SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Switching off ) How 's Leonie ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Fine . Delighted you were coming . SAM FROTHINGHAM Was she ? p. 32 PAULA FROTHINGHAM She really was . She 's off to Ellsworth to meet a doctor . SAM FROTHINGHAM Doctor ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Psychoanalyst she 's having up to massage her Russian 's complexes . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Laughing ) Oh  --  ( With a sigh ) What 's going to happen to Leonie ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Why ? She 's on the crest ! SAM FROTHINGHAM She needs that elevation . Otherwise she sinks . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Well  --  you know Mother . SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes . ( A moment 's pause ) Paula ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes , Dad . SAM FROTHINGHAM The fact is  --  it 's ridiculous I should feel so nervous about telling you  --  but the fact is PAULA FROTHINGHAM What ? SAM FROTHINGHAM I 've fallen in love . I want to get married . There ! Well , thank God that 's out ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my age . It 's absurd , is n't it ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Selena Bryant ? p. 33 SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes . PAULA FROTHINGHAM She has a grown son . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Smiling at her ) So have I  --  a grown daughter . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 'll have to divorce Mother . SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Poor Leonie ! SAM FROTHINGHAM Well , after all  --  Leonie  --  you know how we 've lived for years . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Has Leonie hurt you ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Not for a long time . If this with Selena had n't happened we 'd have gone on forever , I suppose . But it has . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You know , I have a feeling that , in spite of every-thing , this is going to be a shock to Leonie . SAM FROTHINGHAM Paula ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes . SAM FROTHINGHAM Do you feel I 'm deserting you ? ( She turns her head away . She is very moved ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM No  --  you know how fond I am of you  --  I want you to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Happy . ( A silence . She is on the verge of tears ) SAM FROTHINGHAM I must make you see my side , Paula . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Vehemently ) I do ! SAM FROTHINGHAM It is n't only that  --  you 're so young  --  but somehow  --  we decided very soon after you were born , Leonie and I , that our marriage could only continue on this sort of basis . For your sake we 've kept it up . I thought I was content to be an  --  appendage  --  to Leonie 's entourage . But I 'm not  --  do you know what Selena  --  being with Selena and planning with Selena for ourselves has made me see  --  that I 've never had a home . Does that sound mawkish ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I thought you loved Bay Cottage . SAM FROTHINGHAM Of our various menages this is my favorite  --  it 's the simplest . And I 've had fun here with you  --  watching you grow up . But very soon after I married Leonie I found this out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always her house you live in . ( A moment 's pause ) p. 35 PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 'm awfully happy for you , Sam , really I am . You deserve everything but I ca n't help it I . SAM FROTHINGHAM I know . ( A pause ) Paula PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes , Dad ? SAM FROTHINGHAM You and I get on so well together  --  always have  --  Selena adores you and really  --  when you get to know her PAULA FROTHINGHAM I like Selena enormously . She 's a dear . Could n't be nicer . SAM FROTHINGHAM I 'm sure you and she would get on wonderfully together . Of course , Leonie will marry again . She 's bound to . Why do n't you come to live with us ? When you want to PAULA FROTHINGHAM Want to ! SAM FROTHINGHAM All the time then . Leonie has such a busy life . PAULA FROTHINGHAM It 's awfully sweet of you . SAM FROTHINGHAM Sweet of me ! Paula ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Where are you going to live ? SAM FROTHINGHAM New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's terribly clever , is n't she ? p. 36 SAM FROTHINGHAM She 's good at her job . PAULA FROTHINGHAM It must be wonderful to be independent . I hope I shall be . I hope I can make myself . SAM FROTHINGHAM No reason you ca n't . PAULA FROTHINGHAM It seems to take so much  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM What sort of independence ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Leonie 's independent , but that independence does n't mean anything somehow . She 's always been able to do what she likes . SAM FROTHINGHAM So will you be . PAULA FROTHINGHAM That does n't count somehow . It 's independence in a vacuum . No , it does n't count . SAM FROTHINGHAM Maybe it is n't independence you want then ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes , it is . I want to be able to stand on my own feet . I want to be  --  justified . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Understandingly ) Ah ! That 's something else : ( A little amused ) That 's harder ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM I mean it , really I do  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this makes me feel . As if something vital , something fundamental had smashed . I wonder how Mother 'll take it . I think  --  unconsciously  --  she depends on you much more than she realizes . You were a stabilizing force , Sam , in spite of everything and now . p. 37 SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Seriously ) You are the stabilizing force , if you ask me , Paula PAULA FROTHINGHAM I do n't know . SAM FROTHINGHAM What 's worrying you , Paula ? Is it this Russian ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Oh , I think he 's harmless really . SAM FROTHINGHAM What then ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM That one of these days  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM What ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM That one of these days  --  now that you 're going  --  somebody will come along  --  who wo n't be harmless .  --  You know , I really love Leonie . ( LEONIE comes running in just ahead of Dr. KENNETH RICE , DENNIS and WILL LEONIE is in the gayest spirits . Dr. RICE is handsome , dark , magnetic , quiet , masterful . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a strange , genius-like intuition . DENNIS is a flamboyant Irishman , a little older than WILL , gawky , black-haired , slovenly , infinitely brash . SAM and PAULA rise . LEONIE comes down to center with KENNETH at her left . WILL remains back of sofa . DENNIS follows down to right center ) p. 38 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , Sam , how perfectly This is Dr. Rice  --  my husband Sam Frothingham  --  and my daughter Paula ! Sam , Dennis McCarthy . DENNIS MCCARTHY How do you do ? ( No one pays any attention to him . Dr. RICE shakes hands with SAM and PAULA . LEONIE keeps bubbling , her little laugh tinkling through her chatter ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's courageous of me , do n't you think , Dr. Rice , to display such a daughter ? Does she look like me ? I 'll be very pleased if you tell me that she does . Sit down , sit down , everybody . DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Holding up his pipe ) You do n't mind if I  --  ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits center chair , PAULA sits on right end sofa , DENNIS sinks into chair , right , by table ) Sam ! How well you 're looking ! Are you staying at Selena 's ? How is Selena ? SAM FROTHINGHAM She 's very well . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Dr. Rice knows Selena . DR . KENNETH RICE Yes , indeed ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I envy Selena , you know , above all women . So brilliant , so attractive and so self-sufficient . That is what I envyin her most of all . I have no resources  --  I depend so much on other people . ( Turns to RICE ) Do you think , Dr. Rice , you could make me self-sufficient ? p. 39 DR . KENNETH RICE I think I could . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM How perfectly marvelous ! DR . KENNETH RICE But I should n't dream of doing it ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But if I beg you to ? DR . KENNETH RICE Not even if you beg me to . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But why ? DR . KENNETH RICE It would deprive your friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very grateful . You see , Sam , there are men who still pay me compliments . SAM FROTHINGHAM I ca n't believe it ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You must keep it up , Dr. Rice , please . So good for my morale . ( To PAULA ) Oh , my dear , we 've been having the most wonderful argument  --  ( To DENNIS ) Have n't we ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Yes . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM All the way in from Ellsworth  --  ( To RICE ) Really , Doctor , it 's given me new courage PAULA FROTHINGHAM New courage for what ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 've always been afraid to say it for fear of being old-fashioned  --  but Dr. Rice is n't afraid . p. 40 DR . KENNETH RICE ( Explaining to SAM ) It takes great courage , Mr. Frothingham , to disagree with the younger generation . SAM FROTHINGHAM It does indeed . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Well , what was it about ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes  --  what was it about , Dennis ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Statistics and theology . Some metaphysics thrown in . SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a symbol . WILL DEXTER Dr. Rice still believes in the individual career . DR . KENNETH RICE I hang my head in shame ! DENNIS MCCARTHY He does n't know that as a high officer of the National Student Federation , I have at my fingers ' ends the statistics which rule our future , the statistics which constitute our horizon . Not your future , Paula , because you are living parasitically on the stored pioneerism of your ancestors . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Forgive me , Reverend Father ! DENNIS MCCARTHY I represent , Doctor , the Unattached Youth of America  --  p. 41 DR . KENNETH RICE Well , that 's a career in itself ! ( They laugh ) DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Imperturbable ) When we presently commit the folly of graduating from a benevolent institution at Amherst , Massachusetts , there will be in this Republic two million like us . Two million helots . ( Leaning over LEONIE ) But Dr. Rice pooh-poohs statistics . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Arranging his tie ) Does he Dennis ? DENNIS MCCARTHY He says the individual can surmount statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Rice got in just under the wire . DR . KENNETH RICE I 'd never submit to statistics , Mr. Dexter  --  I 'd submit to many things but not to statistics . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Such dull things to submit to  --  DENNIS MCCARTHY You must be an atheist , Dr. Rice . DR . KENNETH RICE Because I do n't believe in statistics ?  --  the new God ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well , I 'm a Protestant and I do n't believe in them either . p. 42 DENNIS MCCARTHY Well , Protestant is a loose synonym for atheist  --  and I , as an Irishman  --  and a  --  DR . KENNETH RICE Young man  --  DENNIS MCCARTHY Yes ? DR . KENNETH RICE Have you ever heard Bismarck 's solution of the Irish problem ? DENNIS MCCARTHY No . What ? DR . KENNETH RICE Oh , it 's entirely irrelevant . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Please tell us . I adore irrelevancies . DR . KENNETH RICE Well , he thought the Irish and the Dutch should exchange countries . The Dutch , he thought , would very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish would forget to mend the dikes . ( They laugh ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM That 's not irrelevant  --  DENNIS MCCARTHY It is an irrelevance , but pardonable in an adversary losing an argument . DR . KENNETH RICE ( To PAULA ) Miss Frothingham , you seem very gracious . Will you get me out of this ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM No , I 'm enjoying it . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Whatever you may say , Dennis , it 's an exciting time to be alive . p. 43 DENNIS MCCARTHY That is because your abnormal situation renders you free of its major excitement  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM And what 's that , Dennis ? DENNIS MCCARTHY The race with malnutrition . DR . KENNETH RICE But that race , Mr.  --  ? DENNIS MCCARTHY McCarthy . DR . KENNETH RICE Is the eternal condition of mankind . Perhaps mankind wo n't survive the solution of that problem . WILL DEXTER ( With heat ) It 's easy to sit in this living room  --  and be smug about the survival of the fittest  --  especially when you 're convinced you 're one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't concede you that superiority , Dr. Rice . There are millions who are so outrageously demanding that they actually insist on the right to live ! They may demand it one day at the cost of your complacency . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Will ! We were just chatting . WILL DEXTER I 'm sorry ! The next thing Dr. Rice 'll be telling us is that war is necessary also  --  to keep us stimulated  --  blood-letting for the other fellow . DR . KENNETH RICE Well , as a matter of fact , there 's something to be said for that too . If you have n't settled on a career yet , Mr. Dexter , may I suggest evangelism ? p. 44 DENNIS MCCARTHY But Dr. Rice  --  ! DR . KENNETH RICE And now , Mrs. Frothingham , before these young people heckle me too effectively , may I escape to my room ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Rising ) Of course . Though I do n't think you need be afraid of their heckling , Doctor . You say things which I 've always believed but never dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ) Why not ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I do n't know  --  somehow  --  I lacked the  --  the authority . I want to show you your rooms myself . ( Leaving the room , followed by RICE ) I 'll be right back , Sam  --  ( RICE nods to them and follows her out . As they go out she keeps talking to him ) I am giving you my father 's rooms  --  he built the wing especially so that when he wanted to work he 'd be away from the rest of the house  --  you have the sea and the garden  --  ( They are off . A moment 's pause ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Well , that 's a new type for Leonie ! DENNIS MCCARTHY There 's something Rasputinish about him . What 's he doing in Maine ? p. 45 WILL DEXTER What , for the matter of that , are you and I doing in Maine ? We should be in New York , jockeying for position on the bread-line . Let 's go to the beach , Dennis . Pep us up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks angry . I ca n't face life today . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Swim 'll do you good . DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Starting for garden ) It 's not a swim I want exactly but a float  --  a vigorous float . Lead me to the pool , Adonais  --  WILL DEXTER All right . ( As he starts to follow DENNIS , Dr. DEXTER , WILL 'S father , comes in ushered by ROBERT . He is a dusty little man with a bleached yellow Panama hat . He keeps wiping his perspiring face with an old handkerchief . He does n't hear very well ) DENNIS MCCARTHY Ah , the enemy  --  ! ( PAULA and SAM rise ) WILL DEXTER Hello , Dad . You remember Paula ? DR . DEXTER Yes yes , I do . WILL DEXTER ( Introducing SAM ) My father  --  Mr. Frothingham . SAM FROTHINGHAM Very glad to see you . p. 46 DR . DEXTER ( Shaking hands ) Thank you . DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Pointing dramatically at DEXTER ) Nevertheless I repeat  --  the enemy ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Dennis ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . DEXTER ( Wipes his forehead ) Yes , and besides it was very dusty on the road . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Wo n't you sit down ? ( DEXTER does so , in center chair . The others remain standing ) WILL DEXTER How long did it take you to drive over , Dad ? DR . DEXTER Let 's see  --  left New Brunswick at two . WILL DEXTER ( Looks at watch ) Three and one half hours  --  pretty good  --  the old tin Lizzie 's got life in her yet . DR . DEXTER You young folks having a good time , I suppose ? ( He looks around him absent-mindedly ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Dennis has been bullying us . DR . DEXTER He still talking ? ( Mildly ) It 's the Irish in him . p. 47 DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Nettled ) You forgot to say shanty ! DR . DEXTER ( Surprised ) Eh ? Why should I say that ? WILL DEXTER Dennis is a snob . Wants all his titles . DENNIS MCCARTHY You misguided children do n't realize it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent-seeming man  --  sits the enemy . DR . DEXTER ( Turning as if stung by a fly  --  cupping his hand to his ear ) What ? What did he say ? DENNIS MCCARTHY The ultimate enemy , the true begetter of the fatal statistics  --  Science . You betray us , Paula , by having him in the house ; you betray us , Will , by acknowledging him as a father . DR . DEXTER ( Wiping his forehead ) Gosh , it 's hot ! SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Sensing a fight and urging it on  --  solemnly ) Can all this be true , Dr. Dexter ? DR . DEXTER What be true ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Dennis 's accusation . DR . DEXTER I am slightly deaf and McCarthy 's presence always fills me with gratitude for that affliction. p. 48 DENNIS MCCARTHY It 's perfectly obvious . You 've heard of technological unemployment . Well , here it sits , embodied in Will 's father . Day and night with diabolical ingenuity and cunning he works out devices to un-employ us . All over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar of Science . We Catholics understand that . We Catholics repudiate the new Moloch that has us by the throat . WILL DEXTER Do you want us to sit in medival taverns with Chesterton and drink beer ? ( DEXTER turns to DENNIS ; as if emerging suddenly from an absent-minded daze , he speaks with great authority , casually but with clarity and precision ) DR . DEXTER The fact is , my voluble young friend , I am not the Moloch who is destroying you but that you and the hordes of the imprecise and the vaguely trained  --  are destroying me ! I have , you will probably be pleased to learn , just lost my job . I have been interrupted in my work . And why ? Because I am successful . Because I have found what , with infinite patience and concentration , I have been seeking to discover . From the elusive and the indeterminate and the invisible , I have crystallized a principle which is visible and tangible and  --  predictable . From the illimitable icebergs of the unknown I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called practical men may put to a use which will make some of your numbers unnecessary in the workaday world . Well  --  what of it , I say ?  --  who decrees that you shall be supported ? Of what importance are your lives and your futures and your meandering aspirations compared to the firmness and the beauty and the cohesion of the principles I seek , the truth I seek ? None  --  none whatever ! Whether you prattle on an empty stomach or whether you prattle on a full stomach can make no difference to anybody that I can see . ( To PAULA abruptly , rising ) And now , young woman , as I have been invited here to spend the night , I 'd like to see my room ! p. 49 PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Crossing to him ) Certainly ! Come with me . I 'll have Robert show you your room . ( They go to door back . She calls ) Robert ! ( ROBERT enters ) Will you take Dr. Dexter to his room ? ( DEXTER follows ROBERT out ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL DEXTER He can hear when he wants to ! ( To DENNIS ) Now will you be good ! DENNIS MCCARTHY I 'm sorry  --  I did n't know he 'd lost his job or I would n't have WILL DEXTER Oh , that 's all right . Well , Dennis , how does it feel to be superfluous ? DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Sourly ) The man 's childish ! ( He goes out , door right through garden ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Is n't he marvelous ? Do n't you love Will 's father ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Crazy about him . He 's swell . WILL DEXTER He 's a pretty good feller . He seems absent-minded but actually he 's extremely present-minded . If you 'll excuse me , I 'm going out to soothe Dennis . ( He follows DENNIS out ) ( A pause ) p. 50 SAM FROTHINGHAM That young man appears to have sound antecedents . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Oh , yes  --  Will 's all right , but  --  oh , Sam  --  ! SAM FROTHINGHAM What ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM With you gone  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of the foolish marriages Leonie would have made if not for you ! SAM FROTHINGHAM It 's a useful function , but I 'm afraid I 'll have to give it up ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( With new determination ) Sam SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes , Paula . PAULA FROTHINGHAM If Leonie goes Russian  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM Well ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Or if she goes Freudian  --  ? SAM FROTHINGHAM In any case you and this boy 'll probably be getting married . PAULA FROTHINGHAM That 's far from settled yet . SAM FROTHINGHAM Why ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will 's scared . SAM FROTHINGHAM Is he ? p. 51 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Of getting caught in Leonie 's silken web . SAM FROTHINGHAM That 's sensible of him . ( LEONIE comes back , half running , breathless ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well ! Is n't Dr. Rice attractive ? SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Rising ) Very . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Rising ) And so depressed about himself ! ( She goes out  --  door right ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is n't it extraordinary , Dr. Rice having achieved the position he has  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , Sam  --  not yet forty . SAM FROTHINGHAM Anybody under forty is young to me ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM How old are you , Sam ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Forbidden ground , Leonie . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I should know , should n't I , but I do n't . I know your birthday  --  I always remember your birthday SAM FROTHINGHAM You do indeed ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's June 14 . But I do n't know how old you are . p. 52 SAM FROTHINGHAM Knowledge in the right place  --  ignorance in the right place ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Meaning it ) You 're more attractive and charming than ever . SAM FROTHINGHAM You 're a great comfort . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's so nice to see you ! SAM FROTHINGHAM And you too ! ( He is not entirely comfortable  --  not as unself-conscious and natural as she is ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Sometimes I think Paula should see more of you . I think it would be very good for her . What do you think of her new friends ? SAM FROTHINGHAM They seem nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical . They look on me  --  my dear , they have the most extraordinary opinion of me SAM FROTHINGHAM What is that ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm fascinated by them . They think of me as a hopeless kind of spoiled Bourbon living away in a never-never land  --  a kind of Marie Antoinette ( She laughs ) It 's delicious ! SAM FROTHINGHAM Is Paula radical too ? p. 53 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I think she 's trying to be . She 's a strange child . SAM FROTHINGHAM How do you mean ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well , when I was a child I was brought up to care only if people were charming or attractive or SAM FROTHINGHAM Well-connected LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes These kids do n't care a hoot about that . SAM FROTHINGHAM I think the difference between their generation and ours is that we were romantic and they 're realistic . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is that it ? SAM FROTHINGHAM I think so . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What makes that ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Changes in the world  --  the war  --  the depression . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What did people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Smiling ) Oh , on the tariff and on the Republicans  --  and on the Democrats ! Leonie  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes , Sam . SAM FROTHINGHAM I  --  I really have something to tell you . p. 54 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Looks up at him curiously ) What ? ( Pause ) SAM FROTHINGHAM I am in love with Selena Bryant . We want to get married . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Pause  --  after a moment ) Human nature is funny ! Mine is ! SAM FROTHINGHAM Why ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I know I ought to be delighted to release you . Probably I should have spoken to you about it myself before long  --  separating . And yet  --  when you tell me  --  I feel  --  a pang . SAM FROTHINGHAM That 's very sweet of you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM One 's so possessive  --  one does n't want to give up anything . SAM FROTHINGHAM For so many years our marriage has been at its best  --  a friendship . Need that end ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM No , Sam . It need n't . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paula ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Did you tell Paula ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Did she ? p. 55 SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Rising ) Leonie LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Pauses ) Yes , Sam . SAM FROTHINGHAM A little while ago you said  --  you thought Paula ought to see more of me . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes I did . ( She is quite agitated suddenly . The thought has crossed her mind that perhaps PAULA has told SAM that she would prefer to go with him . This hurts her deeply , not only for the loss of PAULA but because , from the bottom of her being , she can not bear not to be loved ) SAM FROTHINGHAM Do n't you think then for a time at least LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Defeatist in a crisis ) Paula does n't like me ! ( It is a sudden and completely accepted conviction ) SAM FROTHINGHAM Leonie ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM She 'd rather go with you ! SAM FROTHINGHAM Not at all  --  it 's only that LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I know what Paula thinks of me . p. 56 SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FROTHINGHAM It 's only that what  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM Well , for instance  --  if you should get married  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What if I did ? SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Coming to stand close to her left ) It would mean a considerable readjustment for Paula  --  would n't it ? You can see that . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Rising ) But it would too with you and Selena . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Taking step toward her ) She knows Selena . She admires Selena . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Rising and walking down to front of sofa ) What makes you think she would n't admire  --  whomever I married ? SAM FROTHINGHAM ( After a moment , completely serious now ) There 's another aspect of it which I think for Paula 's sake you should consider most carefully . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What aspect ? SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Coming down to her ) Paula 's serious . You know that yourself . She 's interested in things . She 's not content to be a Sunday-supplement heiress  --  floating along  --  she wants to do things . Selena 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I know . I 'm useless . SAM FROTHINGHAM I think you ought to be unselfish about this . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Paula can do what she likes , of course . If she does n't love me SAM FROTHINGHAM Of course she loves you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM If she prefers to live with you and Selena I sha n't stand in her way . ( Her martyrish resignation irritates SAM profoundly . He feels that really LEONIE should not be allowed to get away with it ) SAM FROTHINGHAM You 're so vain , Leonie . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Refusing to argue ) I 'm sorry . ( This makes it worse . SAM goes deeper ) SAM FROTHINGHAM After all , you 're Paula 's mother . Ca n't you look at her problem  --  objectively ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Where my emotions are involved I 'm afraid I never know what words like that mean . ( He blunders in worse , farther than he really means to go ) SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Flatly ) Well , this sort of thing is n't good for Paula . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What sort of thing ? ( A moment 's pause . He is annoyed with himself at the ineptitude of his approach ) Be perfectly frank . You can be with me . What sort of thing ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Well  --  Leonie  --  ( With a kind of desperate bluntness ) You 've made a career of flirtation . Obviously Paula is n't going to . You know you and Paula belong to different worlds . ( With some heat ) And the reason Paula is the way she is is that she lives in an atmosphere of perpetual conflict . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Conflict ? Paula ? SAM FROTHINGHAM With herself . About you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Rising ) That 's too subtle for me , I 'm afraid . SAM FROTHINGHAM Paula 's unaware of it herself . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Where did you acquire this amazing psychological insight ? You never used to have it . Of course ! From Selena . Of course ! SAM FROTHINGHAM I 've never discussed this with Selena . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM No ? SAM FROTHINGHAM She 's told me she 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's extremely generous of her  --  to offer withou discussion . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( She has him there ; he loses his temper ) It 's impossible for you to consider anything without being personal . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I am afraid it is . I do n't live on this wonderful , rarefied , intellectual plane inhabited by Selena and yourself  --  and where you want to take Paula . I 'm sorry if I 've made Paula serious , I 'm sorry she 's in a perpetual conflict about me . I 'm sorry I 've let her in for  --  this sort of thing ! I 'm sorry ! ( She is on the verge of tears . She runs out ) SAM FROTHINGHAM Leonie ! ( He follows her to door back , calling ) Leonie ! ( But it is too late . She is gone . He turns back into room ) Damn ! ( PAULA comes in  --  from beach , door right ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Where 's Leonie ? SAM FROTHINGHAM She just went upstairs . PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 've been showing Dr. Rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Hard to say . He 's almost too sympathetic . At the same time  --  p. 60 SAM FROTHINGHAM What ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM At the same time  --  he is inscrutable ! I ca n't tell whether I like him or dislike him . You say Selena knows him . What does she say about him ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Selena is n't crazy about him . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Why not ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Brilliant charlatan , she says  --  also a charmer . PAULA FROTHINGHAM I gather that , and I resent him How 'd you come out with Leonie ? SAM FROTHINGHAM I 've made a mess of it . I 'm a fool ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM My going with you , you mean ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Sam SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will you mind very much SAM FROTHINGHAM What ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM If I do n't go with Selena and you ? SAM FROTHINGHAM But I thought you said  --  and especially if she marries somebody  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Slowly ) That 's just what I 'm thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FROTHINGHAM There 's no way out of it , Sam  --  I 've got to stay . SAM FROTHINGHAM But why ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Simply , looking up at him ) Somebody 's got to look after Leonie . ( KENNETH enters ) DR . KENNETH RICE My first glimpse of Maine . A masculine Riviera . PAULA FROTHINGHAM It 's mild now . if you want to see it really virile  --  come in the late fall . DR . KENNETH RICE You 've only to crook your little finger . I 'll be glad to look at more of Maine whenever you have the time . ( Sits , facing her ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Of course . Tomorrow ? DR . KENNETH RICE Yes . Tomorrow . ( To SAM ) You know , from Mrs. Frothingham 's description  --  ( Looking back at PAULA , intently ) I never could have imagined her . Not remotely . ( ROBERT enters ) SAM FROTHINGHAM What is it , Robert ? ROBERT Mrs. Frothingham would like to see Dr. Rice in her study . p. 62 DR . KENNETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walks to door back ) Excuse me . ( He goes upstairs . PAULA and SAM have continued looking front . As KENNETH starts upstairs they slowly turn and look at one another . The same thought has crossed both their minds  --  they both find themselves looking suddenly into a new and dubious vista ) @x SCENE : The same . Time : Midsummer  --  late afternoon . At Rise : KENNETH is at a bridge table working out a chess problem . He hears voices and footsteps approaching . Gets up , unhurried , and looks off into garden . Sees BORIS and LEONIE approaching . As they come in he strolls off  --  they do not see him . LEONIE 's arms are full of flowers . She is looking for KENNETH . COUNT MIRSKY follows her in . COUNT MIRSKY , a Russian , is very good-looking , Mon-goloid about the eyes . His English is beautiful , with a slight and attractive accent . He is tense , jittery  --  a mass of jangled nerves  --  his fingers tremble as he lights one cigarette after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a dark scarf he wears around his neck . BORIS ( Stopping center ) It appears he is not here either . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM He ? Who ? ( Crossing to table behind sofa to put some flowers in vase ) BORIS When you 're in the garden with me you think  --  perhaps he is in the house . When you are in the house you think perhaps he is in the garden . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Boris , darling , you have the odd habit of referring to mysterious characters without giving me any hint who they are . Is that Russian symbolism ? There will be a long silence ; then you will say : He would not approve , or they ca n't hear us . It 's a bit mystifying. p. 64 BORIS ( Crossing to stand near her ) You know who I mean . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Going to table right to put flowers in vase ) Really , you flatter me . I 'm not a mystic , you know , Boris . I 'm a simple extrovert . When you say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite  --  and if possible to someone I know . BORIS ( Crossing to back of table , facing her across it ) You know him , all right . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM There you go again ! Really , Boris ! BORIS ( Moving closer to her around table ) You 've been divorced now for several weeks . You 're free . We were only waiting for you to be free  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Moving away , sitting in chair , right ) Now that I am free you want to coerce me . It 's a bit unreasonable , do n't you think ? ( BORIS walks to end of window-seat and sits ) ( Enter KENNETH , door back ) DR . KENNETH RICE ( Strolling across stage toward LEONIE ) Hello , Leonie . Count Mirsky  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Kenneth  --  I have n't seen you all day . p. 65 DR . KENNETH RICE I 've been in my room slaving away at a scientific paper . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM My house hums with creative activity . I love it . It gives me a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DR . KENNETH RICE Shadow-neurosis . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Shadow-neurosis . How marvelous ! What does it mean ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( Looking at BORIS ) It is a sensation of non-existence . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is it common ? DR . KENNETH RICE Quite . The victim knows that he exists and yet he feels that he does not ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM In a curious way I can imagine a sensation like that  --  do you know I actually can . Is n't it amusing ? BORIS The doctor is so eloquent . Once he describes a sensation it becomes very easy to feel it . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM That 's an entrancing gift . Why are you so antagonistic to Kenneth ? He wants to help you but you wo n't let him . I asked him here to help you . DR . KENNETH RICE ( To BORIS ) Your skepticism about this particular disease is interesting . Count Mirsky , because , as it happens , you suffer from it . p. 66 BORIS ( Bearing down on KENNETH ) Has it ever occurred to you that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not mentioned you in my article I have described you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Rising and crossing left to table behind sofa ) You should be flattered , Boris . BORIS I am ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Another case history ! I 've been reading some of Kenneth 's scientific text-books . Most fascinating form of biography . Who was that wonderful fellow who did such odd things  --  Mr. X. ? You 'd never think you could get so interested in anonymous people . I 'd have given anything to meet Mr. X.  --  though I must say I 'd feel a bit nervous about having him in the house . DR . KENNETH RICE How is your book getting along , Count Mirsky ? BORIS Very well . Oh  --  so  --  DR . KENNETH RICE Far along in it ? BORIS Quite . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm crazy to see it . He 's dedicating it to me but he has n't let me see a word of it ! DR . KENNETH RICE For a very good reason . p. 67 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . There never has been a book . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( She lets flowers drop ) Kenneth ! DR . KENNETH RICE Is n't that true , Count Mirsky ? BORIS It is not ! DR . KENNETH RICE Then why do n't you let us see a bit of it ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , do ! At least the dedication page . DR . KENNETH RICE A chapter  --  BORIS Because it is n't finished yet . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well , it does n't have to be finished . We know the end , do n't we ? The end belongs to the world . DR . KENNETH RICE Let us see it , Count . BORIS I ca n't . DR . KENNETH RICE What are you calling the book ? BORIS I have n't decided yet . DR . KENNETH RICE May I suggest a title to you  --  ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , do ! What shall we call it , Kenneth ? p. 68 DR . KENNETH RICE " The Memoirs of a Boy Who Wanted to Murder His Father . " LEONIE FROTHINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a hysterical woman , Doctor  --  and I 'm not your patient ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But Kenneth  --  Boris worshipped his father . DR . KENNETH RICE No , he hated him . He hated him when he was alive and he hates him still . He grew up under the overwhelming shadow of this world-genius whom , in spite of an immense desire to emulate and even to surpass  --  he felt he could never emulate and never surpass  --  nor even equal  --  Did you worship your father , Count Mirsky ? BORIS It 's true ! I hated him ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Boris ! BORIS I hated him ! DR . KENNETH RICE Now you can let us see the book , ca n't you  --  now that we know the point of view  --  just a bit of it ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm more crazy than ever to see it now . I can tell you a little secret now , Boris . I was afraid  --  I was rather afraid  --  that your book would be a little like one of those statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really exciting . You hated him . But how perfectly marvelous ! I ca n't wait to see it now . Do run up to your study and bring it down , Boris  --  do ! p. 69 BORIS No . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM That 's very unpleasant of you . BORIS You might as well know it then . There is n't any book . There never will be . Not by me . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But I do n't understand  --  every day  --  in your room working  --  all these months ! BORIS ( Facing her ) One wants privacy ! Possibly you ca n't realize that . You who always have to have a house full of people . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Goes back to flowers at table ) Boris ! DR . KENNETH RICE ( Rising ) Why do n't you write the book anyway , Count Mirsky ? There is a vogue these days for vituperative biography . BORIS I am not interested in the vogue . DR . KENNETH RICE We are quite used nowadays to children who dislike their fathers . The public  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing myself to recall the atmosphere of saintly sadism in which my childhood was spent  --  I can still smell that living room . I can still smell those stinking , sexless pilgrims who used to come from all over the world to get my saintly father 's blessing . I used to sit with my mother in a room no bigger than a closet to get away from the odor of that nauseating humanitarianism . There was no privacy in the Villa Mirskovitch . Oh , no  --  it was a Mecca  --  do you understand  --  a Mecca ! p. 70 DR . KENNETH RICE Yes , I think I understand . BORIS Well , I have been paying the haloed one back . I have been getting privacy at his expense at last . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Why have you never told me before that you felt this way about your father ? BORIS I never said anything about him . It was you who did the talking . You always raved about the great man with that characteristic American enthusiasm for what you do n't know . LEONIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great man . The books are there to prove it . There they are . You ca n't write books like that without greatness  --  no matter what you say . You are a petulant child . Your father was a great man . BORIS It makes no difference how great he was  --  those pilgrims stank ! ( LEONIE turns away ) DR . KENNETH RICE I suggest that to write that book , even if no one ever sees the manuscript but you , might amuse you  --  a kind of revenge which , when you were a boy , you were in no position to take . BORIS Are you trying to cure me , Doctor ? Please do n't trouble . I do n't need your particular species of professionalism . I do not need any help from you . ( He goes to door back , turns to LEONIE . LEONIE looks bewilderedly at KENNETH . BORIS goes out ) p. 71 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM How did you know ? You 're uncanny ! DR . KENNETH RICE All in the day 's work . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaker than myself ? I certainly am no tower of strength . DR . KENNETH RICE Possibly not  --  but you are generous and impulsive . You have a tendency to accept people at the best of their own valuation . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I want to help them . I do help them . After they get used to my help , after they get to count on my help , I get impatient with them . Why , I ask myself , ca n't people help themselves ? DR . KENNETH RICE And very natural . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I seem to attract people like that ! DR . KENNETH RICE Leonie  --  you are the last woman on earth Count Mirsky should marry . He would only transfer his hatred of his father to you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I do n't think I understand you , Kenneth  --  really I do n't  --  and I do so want to understand things . DR . KENNETH RICE Well  --  your charm , your gaiety , your position , your wealth , your beauty  --  these would oppress him . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is himself , it is to reveal his nonentity , his inferiority  --  again the secondary rle  --  Leonie Frothingham 's husband  --  the son of Count Mirsky  --  the husband of Leonie Frothingham . Again the shadow  --  again , eternally and always  --  nonexistence . Poor fellow . ( Pause ) p. 72 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm so grateful to you , Kenneth . DR . KENNETH RICE Nonsense . You must n't be grateful to me because I  --  exercise my profession . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I want to express my gratitude  --  in some tangible form . I 've been thinking of nothing else lately . I ca n't sleep for thinking of it . DR . KENNETH RICE Well , if it gives you insomnia , you 'd better tell me about it . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I want to make it possible for you to realize your ambition . DR . KENNETH RICE Ambition ? What ambition ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Ah ! You 've forgotten , have n't you ? But you let it slip out one day  --  you pump me professionally  --  but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KENNETH RICE You terrify me ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM That night last winter when we went to dinner in that little restaurant where you go with your doctor friends you told me your dream . DR . KENNETH RICE My censor must have been napping . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM He was . Or she was . What sex is your censor ? DR . KENNETH RICE That 's none of your business . p. 73 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm sorry . DR . KENNETH RICE Which of my dreams was I so reckless as to reveal to you ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM To have a sanatorium of your own one day  --  so you can carry out your own ideas of curing patients . DR . KENNETH RICE Oh , that ! Out of the question . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Why ? DR . KENNETH RICE To do it on the scale I visualize would cost more than I 'm ever likely to save out of my practice . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'll give you the sanatorium . I 've never given anyone anything like that before . What fun ! DR . KENNETH RICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Christmas morning ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes . You will ! You will ! We 'll have a suite in it for Mr. X.  --  for all your anonymous friends  --  we 'll entertain the whole alphabet ! DR . KENNETH RICE You see , Leonie ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What do you mean ? I thought you 'd be  --  DR . KENNETH RICE Of course , it 's terribly generous of you . I 'm deeply touched . But p. 74 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But ? DR . KENNETH RICE I 'm a stranger to you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Kenneth ! DR . KENNETH RICE Outside of my professional relation  --  such as I have with scores of patients  --  little more than that . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I thought  --  DR . KENNETH RICE And yet you are willing to back me in a venture that would cost a sizeable fortune  --  just on that . Leonie ! Leonie ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It would be the best investment I 've ever made . Paula 's always telling me I have no social consciousness . Well , this would be .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do feel useless , Kenneth . Please ! DR . KENNETH RICE I 'm sorry . I could n't hear of it . Of course , it 's out of the question . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It is n't . I can afford it . Why should n't I ? It would be helping so many people  --  you have no right to refuse . It 's selfish of you to refuse . DR . KENNETH RICE I distrust impulsive altruism . You will forgive me , Leonie , but it may often do harm . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM How do you mean , Kenneth ? p. 75 DR . KENNETH RICE I gather you are about to endow a radical magazine for the boys  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Will and Dennis ! I thought it would be nice to give them something to do ! DR . KENNETH RICE Yes . You are prepared to back them in a publication which , if it attained any influence , would undermine the system which makes you and people like you possible . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But it never occurred to me anyone would read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literacy in this country . Unfortunately it is much easier to learn to read than it is to learn to think . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well , if you do n't think it 's a good idea , Kenneth , I wo n't do it . But this sanatorium is different . DR . KENNETH RICE Why ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Because , if you must know it , it would be helping you  --  and that means everything in the world to me . There , I 've said it . It 's true ! Kenneth  --  are you terrified ? DR . KENNETH RICE You adorable child ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's extraordinary , Kenneth  --  but you are the first strong man who 's ever come into my life  --  ( Enter PAULA , DENNIS , WILL , door back ) Oh , I 'm very glad to see you ! Will ! Hullo , Dennis . You all know Dr. Rice . Mr. Dexter , Mr. McCarthy . Sit down , everybody . Well , children , how is New York ? ( DENNIS crosses down front of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL DEXTER Stifling , thank you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Any luck yet ? WILL DEXTER I am available , but New York is dead to its chief opportunity . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Then you can stay here for a bit . You can both stay here . DENNIS MCCARTHY That was all right when we were in college , Mrs. Frothingham . Ca n't do it now . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , you 're working . I 'm so glad ! DENNIS MCCARTHY I beg your pardon . Did you say working ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well , then ! I do n't see why you ca n't stay here and take a holiday . WILL DEXTER From what ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Since none of you are doing anything in town , you might as well stay here and do nothing and be comfortable . DENNIS MCCARTHY Yes , but it 's an ethical question . When we 're in New York doing nothing , we belong to the most respectable vested group going ! The unemployed . As such we have a status , position , authority . But if we stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DR . KENNETH RICE No jobs about anywhere , eh p. 77 WILL DEXTER Extinct commodity . DENNIS MCCARTHY I did pretty well last week . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Really ? DENNIS MCCARTHY I was rejected by seven newspapers  --  including the Bronx Home News and the Yonkers Herald  --  six magazines and trade papers  --  a total of twenty-eight rejections in all , representing a net gain over the previous week of seven solid rejections . I submit to you , gentlemen , that 's progress  --  pass the cigars , Will . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Could n't you stay here and be rejected by mail ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Does n't give you that same feeling somehow  --  that good , rich , dark-brown sensation of not being wanted ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You know , Kenneth , in a curious way , Dennis reminds me a bit of Mr. X. DENNIS MCCARTHY And who 's X. ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM A sporting acquaintance . DENNIS MCCARTHY There 's one thing I 'd like to ask Dr. Rice . Do you mind ? DR . KENNETH RICE At your service . DENNIS MCCARTHY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychoanalytic hierarchy Freud is the god , is n't he ? p. 78 DR . KENNETH RICE Of one sect , yes . DENNIS MCCARTHY Well , the original sect  --  DR . KENNETH RICE Yes . DENNIS MCCARTHY Now , every psychoanalyst has to have himself analyzed . That 's I understand it , the highest prices go to those nearest the Master himself . DR . KENNETH RICE This boy is irreverent DENNIS MCCARTHY I know whereof I speak . I prepared an article on the subject for Fortune . WILL DEXTER Rejection number three hundred . DENNIS MCCARTHY I am afraid , Will , that you are a success worshipper ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Dennis is an enfant terrible , and he exhausts himself keeping it up ! DENNIS MCCARTHY I have examined the racket with a microscopic patience and this I find to be true : at the top of the hierarchy is the Great Pan Sexualist of Vienna . To be an orthodox and accepted Freudian , you must have been analyzed by another of the same . Now , what I am burning to know is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tell his repressions to ? Why , the poor guy must be as lonely as hell ! p. 79 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What would you do with him , Kenneth ? He has no repressions whatever ! DR . KENNETH RICE He needs some badly . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I wonder what Dennis would confess to his psychoanalyst that he is n't always shouting to the world ? DENNIS MCCARTHY I 'd make the psychoanalyst talk . ( To KENNETH . Beckoning ) Tell me , Doctor , what did you dream last night ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( Behind his cupped hand ) Not in public . DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Rises and crosses straight right ) You see  --  he 's repressed ! I tell you these psychoanalysts are repressed . They 've got nobody to talk to ! I 'm going swimming . It 's pathetic ! ( He goes out ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm going too . He makes me laugh . How about you , Kenneth ? DR . KENNETH RICE Oh , I 'll watch . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( To others ) Come along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dinner . ( KENNETH starts out with LEONIE  --  stops on the way ) p. 80 DR . KENNETH RICE I suppose you and your Irish friend edited the comic paper at college ? WILL DEXTER No , we edited the serious paper . DR . KENNETH RICE Just the same it must have been very funny . ( He goes out after LEONIE ) WILL DEXTER Do n't think that feller likes me much . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 're psychic . WILL DEXTER Well , for the matter of that I 'm not crazy about him either . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Do n't bother him . Concentrate on me ! WILL DEXTER How are you , darling ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Missed you . WILL DEXTER ( Pulls her to sofa and sits with her . PAULA left end sofa ) And I you . Pretty lousy in town without you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Oh , poor darling ! WILL DEXTER Although my star is rising . I did some book-reviews for the New York Times and the New Masses . PAULA FROTHINGHAM What a gamut ! WILL DEXTER I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The student most likely to succeed in the first four months since graduation has made eleven dollars . p. 81 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Wonderful ! WILL DEXTER My classmates were certainly clairvoyant . As a matter of fact , I should n't have told you . Now I 'll be tortured thinking you 're after me for my money . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 'll never know ! WILL DEXTER ( Putting arm around her shoulders and drawing her to him ) What 've you been doing ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Lying in the sun mostly . WILL DEXTER Poor little Ritz girl . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Wondering what you do every night . WILL DEXTER Forty-second Street Library mostly . Great fun ! Voluptuary atmosphere ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Is your life altogether so austere ? WILL DEXTER Well , frankly no . Not altogether . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Cad ! WILL DEXTER What do you expect ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Loyalty . WILL DEXTER I am loyal . But you go around all day job-hunting . You find you 're not wanted . It 's reassuring after that to find a shoulder to lean on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public library closes at ten . You have to go somewhere . If I 'm ever Mayor of New York , I 'll have the public libraries kept open all night the flop-houses of the intellectuals ! p. 82 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Is it anyone special ? WILL DEXTER Just a generalized shoulder . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Well , you 're going to have a special one from now on  --  mine ! You know , the way you 're avoiding the issue is all nonsense . WILL DEXTER You mean my gallant fight against you ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 've decided that you are conventional and bourgeois . You 're money-ridden . WILL DEXTER Eleven dollars . They say a big income makes you conservative . PAULA FROTHINGHAM I do n't mean your money . I mean  --  my money . It 's childish to let an artificial barrier like that stand between us . It 's also childish to ignore it . WILL DEXTER ( Rising ) I do n't ignore it . That 's what worries me . I count on it . Already I find myself counting on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an office for some big-wig who wo n't see me or for some underling who wo n't see me I think : " Why the Hell should I wait all day for this stuffed shirt ? " I do n't wait . Is it because of you I feel in a special category ? Do I count on your money ? Is that why I do n't wait as long as the other fellow ? There 's one consolation : the other fellow does n't get the job either . But the point is disquieting ! p. 83 PAULA FROTHINGHAM What a Puritan you are ! WILL DEXTER ( Sitting beside her again ) Will I become an appendage to you  --  like your mother 's men ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 're bound to  --  money or no money . WILL DEXTER ( Taking her into his arms ) I suppose I might as well go on the larger dole  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM What ? WILL DEXTER Once you are paid merely for existing  --  you are on the dole . I rather hoped , you know  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's thinking when you 're in college and when you 're out  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM How do you mean ? WILL DEXTER Well When I was in college , my interest in the  --  " movement "  --  was really impersonal . I imagined myself giving my energies to the poor and the downtrodden in my spare time . I did n't really believe I 'd be one of the poor and downtrodden myself . In my heart of hearts I was sure I 'd break through the iron law of Dennis 's statistics and land a job somewhere . But I ca n't  --  and it 's given a tremendous jolt to my self-esteem . p. 84 PAULA FROTHINGHAM But you 'll come through . I 'm sure of it . I wish you could learn to look at my money as a means rather than an end . WILL DEXTER I 'd rather use my own PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 're proud . WILL DEXTER I am . PAULA FROTHINGHAM It 's humiliating but I 'm afraid I 've got to ask you to marry me , Will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see no way out of accepting you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You submit ? WILL DEXTER ( Kisses her hand ) I submit . PAULA FROTHINGHAM After a hard campaign  --  victory ! WILL DEXTER You are a darling . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Getting up and crossing to center ) I ca n't tell you what a relief it 'll be to get away from this house . WILL DEXTER Why ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I do n't know . It 's getting very complicated . WILL DEXTER Leonie ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM And Boris . And Dr. Rice . Funny thing how that man p. 85 WILL DEXTER What ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Makes you insecure somehow . WILL DEXTER Supposed to do just the opposite . PAULA FROTHINGHAM He answers every question  --  and yet he 's secretive . I 've never met a man who  --  who  --  WILL DEXTER Who what ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Really I ca n't stand Dr. Rice . WILL DEXTER I believe he fascinates you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM He does . I do n't deny that .

WYLER You 're the boy who was always so curious about my youth . WILL DEXTER Yes . MRS . WYLER I 've forgotten most of it . Now I just live from day to day . The past is just this morning .

PAULA FROTHINGHAM What ? MRS . WYLER Your father 's coming . PAULA FROTHINGHAM No ! MRS . WYLER Yes . PAULA FROTHINGHAM But how  --  ! How do you know ? MRS . WYLER Because I 've sent for him , and he wired me he 's coming . He 's driving from Blue Hill . He should be here now . PAULA FROTHINGHAM That 's too  --  ! Oh , Granny , that 's marvelous ! Will , let 's drive out to meet him , shall we ? Does Mother know ? MRS . WYLER I only had Sam 's wire an hour ago . p. 88 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Granny , you 're an angel . MRS . WYLER Not quite yet . Do n't hurry me , child . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Come on , Will . ( Exit PAULA andWILL ) MRS . WYLER I can see you are interested in Paula . You are , are n't you , Dr. Rice ? DR . KENNETH RICE Yes . She 's an extraordinary child . Adores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would you cure that , Doctor ? DR . KENNETH RICE It 's quite healthy . MRS . WYLER Really ? I was hoping for something juicy in the way of interpretation . DR . KENNETH RICE Sorry ! MRS . WYLER What an interesting profession yours is , Dr. Rice . DR . KENNETH RICE Why particularly ? MRS . WYLER Your province is the soul . Strange region . DR . KENNETH RICE People 's souls , I find are , on the whole , infinitely more interesting than their bodies . I have been a general practitioner and I know . MRS . WYLER These young people  --  do n't they frighten you ? p. 89 DR . KENNETH RICE Frighten ! MRS . WYLER They are so radical  --  prepared to throw everything overboard  --  every tradition  --  DR . KENNETH RICE Paula 's friends have nothing to lose , any change would be  --  in the nature of velvet for them . MRS . WYLER What do you think of Will ? DR . KENNETH RICE I 'm afraid I 've formed no strongly defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see  --  That is a comment in itself . DR . KENNETH RICE He 's nondescript . MRS . WYLER Do you mean to point that out to Paula ? DR . KENNETH RICE I do n't think so . That wo n't be necessary . MRS . WYLER Why not ? DR . KENNETH RICE Blood will tell . MRS . WYLER That 's very gracious of you , Doctor . ( Pause ) And what do you think of Leonie ? DR . KENNETH RICE Very endearing  --  and very impulsive . MRS . WYLER For example  --  I mean of the latter  --  DR . KENNETH RICE She offered to build me a sanatorium  --  a fully equipped modern sanatorium . p. 90 MRS . WYLER Did she ? Convenient for you . DR . KENNETH RICE Except that I refused . MRS . WYLER Was n't that quixotic ? DR . KENNETH RICE Not necessarily . ( PAULA and SAM enter , door back ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Here he is ! MRS . WYLER Sam ! SAM FROTHINGHAM Louise ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM He would n't come if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know Dr. Rice ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Of course . DR . KENNETH RICE Excuse me . ( KENNETH goes out ) SAM FROTHINGHAM Well , Louise ! MRS . WYLER Hello , Sam . ( SAM kisses her ) SAM FROTHINGHAM How 's she behaving ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Incorrigible . Dr. Prentiss tells her to rest in her room . You see how she obeys him . She 'll obey you though . SAM FROTHINGHAM Well , I 'll sneak her away from Dr. Prentiss and take her abroad . p. 91 MRS . WYLER I want to go to Ethiopia . Run along , dear . I want to talk to Sam . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Keep him here , Granny . Pretend you 're not feeling well . MRS . WYLER I 'll try . ( Exit PAULA door back ) Well , Sam  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM I got your wire last night . Here I am . MRS . WYLER It 's nice of you . SAM FROTHINGHAM Oh , now , Louise . You know you 're the love of my life . MRS . WYLER Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Flourishing . MRS . WYLER You 're all right then ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Unbelievably . MRS . WYLER I knew you would be . SAM FROTHINGHAM And you ? MRS . WYLER I 'm dying , Sam . SAM FROTHINGHAM Not you  --  MRS . WYLER Do n't contradict me . Besides , I 'm rather looking forward to it . SAM FROTHINGHAM Is Dr. Prentiss  --  ? MRS . WYLER Dr. Prentiss soft-soaps me . I let him . It relieves his mind . But that 's why I 've sent for you . p. 92 SAM FROTHINGHAM You know , my dear  --  MRS . WYLER Yes , Sam . I know I can count on you . I 'm dying . And I 'm dying alone . I have to talk to somebody . You 're the only one . SAM FROTHINGHAM Is anything worrying you ? MRS . WYLER Plenty . SAM FROTHINGHAM What , dear ? MRS . WYLER The future . Not my own . That 's fixed or soon will be . But Leonie 's  --  Paula 's  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am surrounded by aliens . The house is full of strangers . That Russian upstairs ; this doctor . SAM FROTHINGHAM Rice ? Are you worried about him ? MRS . WYLER What is he after ? What does he want ? He told me Leonie offered to build him a sanatorium  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM Did he accept it ? MRS . WYLER No . He refused . But something tells me he will allow himself to be persuaded . SAM FROTHINGHAM I do n't think Rice is a bad feller really . Seems pretty sensible . Are you worried about this boy  --  Dexter , and Paula ? p. 93 MRS . WYLER Not in the same way . I like the boy . But Paula  --  I 'm worried about what the money 'll do to her . We know what it 's done to Leonie . You know , Sam , in spite of all her romantic dreams Leonie has a kind of integrity . But I often wonder if she 's ever been really happy . SAM FROTHINGHAM Oh , now , Louise , this pessimism 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built our lives on  --  it used to symbolize security  --  but there 's no security in it any more . SAM FROTHINGHAM Paula 'll be all right . I count on Paula . MRS . WYLER In the long run . But that may be too late . One ca n't let go of everything , Sam . It is n't in nature . That 's why I 've asked you to come . I want you to remain as executor under my will . SAM FROTHINGHAM Well , I only resigned because  --  since I 'm no longer married to Leonie  --  MRS . WYLER What has that got to do with it ? SAM FROTHINGHAM All right . MRS . WYLER Promise ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Certainly . MRS . WYLER I feel something dark ahead , a terror  --  p. 94 SAM FROTHINGHAM Now , now , you 've been brooding . MRS . WYLER Outside of you  --  Will is the soundest person I 'll leave behind me , the healthiest  --  but in him too I feel a recklessness that 's just kept in  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown was the West , land  --  physical hardship  --  but he 's hard and bitter underneath his jocularity  --  he is n't sure , he says , what he is  --  Once he is sure , what will he do ?  --  I want you to watch him , Sam , for Paula 's sake . SAM FROTHINGHAM I will . MRS . WYLER They 're all strange and dark . And this doctor . A soul doctor . We did n't have such things  --  I am sure that behind all this is a profound and healing truth . But sometimes truths may be perverted , and this particular doctor  --  how are we to know where his knowledge ends and his pretension begins ? Now that I am dying , for the first time in my life I know fear . Death seems easy and simple , Sam  --  a self-indulgence  --  but can I afford it ? ( She smiles up at him . He squeezes her hand ) SAM FROTHINGHAM Everything will be all right . Trust me . MRS . WYLER I do . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 SAM FROTHINGHAM Of course . MRS . WYLER Now I feel better . SAM FROTHINGHAM That 's right . ( Pause ) MRS . WYLER I 'd like to live till autumn . SAM FROTHINGHAM Of course you will . Many autumns . MRS . WYLER Heaven forbid . But this autumn . The color  --  the leaves turn . ( Looking out window . SAM looks too ) The expression seems strange . What do they turn to ? SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Softly , helping her mood ) Their mother . The earth . MRS . WYLER I 'm happy now . I 'm at peace . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Puts arm around her and draws her to him ) That 's better . MRS . WYLER ( Smiling up at him ) It 's very clever of me to have sent for you , Sam . I 'm pleased with myself . Now , Sam , let ' em do their worst  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Smiling back at her and patting her hand ) Just let ' em ! CURTAIN p. 96 Act 2 , Scene 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time : A few hours later  --  before dinner . LEONIE is standing in doorway looking out . BORIS center ; he is fatalistically quiet at first . BORIS What it comes to is this then ! You 're through with me . You want me to go ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm no good to you ! I can no longer help you . BORIS Frustrated altruist ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You hate me ! BORIS That would be encouraging ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM We have nothing more for each other . BORIS Less than we had in the beginning ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Less than I thought we had . BORIS ( Walking toward her ) And the man of science ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What ? BORIS ( Still bearing down on her ) This intricate man of science . You fluctuate so , Leonie . ( Facing her ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Please , Boris . I 've failed . Ca n't we part  --  beautifully ? p. 97 BORIS What do you want to do ? Go out on the bay and say farewell before the villagers in a barge drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little orchestra to play  --  with the strings sobbing  --  and the bassoon off key ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You are bitter and cruel . Why ? I 've tried to help you . Why are you bitter ? BORIS ( Moving close to her ) At least I 'm honest . Can you say the same ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Breaking away from him ) I do n't know what you mean by that . BORIS ( Getting in front of her ) Yes , you do . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You 're eating yourself up . You 're killing yourself . There 's the great lovely world outside and you sit in your room hating  --  BORIS What do you recommend ? Cold showers and Swedish massage ? What does the man of science prescribe for me ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Why do you hate Kenneth so ? BORIS I 'm jealous , my dear ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Poor Boris . You 're beyond a simple emotion like that , are n't you ? BORIS I envy you , Leonie . All like you . p. 98 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high principle . It makes all your diversions an exercise in piety . You 're sick of me and want to sleep with the man of science . ( LEONIE turns away . He seizes her arms and turns her to him ) Does this suffice for you ? No . It must be that you can no longer help me . ( Little silent laugh ) My sainted father was like that ! God ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM This is the end , Boris . BORIS Of course it is . I tell you this though : Beware of him , Leonie . Beware of him . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Your hatred of Kenneth  --  like all your hatreds  --  they 're unnatural , frightening . I 'm frightened of you . ( Turning from him ) BORIS ( Crossing before her , closing door so she ca n't escape ) Much better to be frightened of him . You know what I think . What does he think ? Does he tell you ? Do you know ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes , I know . BORIS You know what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transparent . ( Enter KENNETH , door back ) p. 99 DR . KENNETH RICE Your mother would like to see you , Leonie . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is she all right ? ( BORIS goes upstage to small table . Gets cigarette ) DR . KENNETH RICE Oh , very chipper . Mr. Frothingham is with her . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM She sent for Sam , did n't she ? I wonder why . BORIS Perhaps she felt the situation too complicated  --  even for you , Dr. Rice . DR . KENNETH RICE I do n't think so . BORIS You are so Olympian , Dr. Rice . Would it be possible to anger you ? DR . KENNETH RICE Symptoms , my dear Count , never anger me . I study them . BORIS Really , you are in a superb position . I quite envy you . One might cut oneself open in front of you  --  and it would be a symptom . Would n't it ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Boris , please  --  what 's the good ? BORIS ( Crossing slowly to LEONIE ) You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in the world . Give your mother this message for me . Tell her that under the circumstances I shall simplify the situation by withdrawing . p. 100 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You make me very unhappy , Boris . BORIS How agreeable then that you have Dr. Rice here  --  to resolve your unhappiness . ( Crosses quickly to table behind sofa and puts out cigarette ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Following him ) Where will you be in case I  --  in case you  --  Boris ? BORIS Do n't worry about me . A magazine syndicate has offered me a great deal for sentimental reminiscences of my father . Imagine that , sentimental ! They have offered me  --  charming Americanism  --  a ghost-writer . It will be quaint  --  one ghost collaborating with another ghost . ( Raising hand like Greek priest ) My blessings , Leonie . ( Kisses her hand ) You have been charming .

LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Light reed ! Fragile ! Fragile ! DR . KENNETH RICE Pliant but unbreakable . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM No . Do n't think much of myself , Kenneth . Really I do n't . My judgment seems to be at fault somehow . Paula thinks so too . She 's always lecturing me . ( Sits right end of sofa ) DR . KENNETH RICE Paula ca n't abide me . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's not true ! DR . KENNETH RICE You know , Leonie , I have an instinct in these matters  --  so , also , has your daughter . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Do n't you like Paula ? DR . KENNETH RICE I love her . Everyone connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Of course Paula and I are poles apart . Look at her friends ! p. 102 DR . KENNETH RICE Raffish ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( A little taken aback by this ) Oh , do you think so ? All of them ? Do n't you like Will ? DR . KENNETH RICE Nice enough . Clever in his way . With an eye to the main chance . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Really ? DR . KENNETH RICE Naturally  --  penniless boy . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 've always encouraged Paula to be independent . I 've never tried to impose my ideals or my standards on her . Have I done wrong to give her her own head this way ? She 's such a darling , really . She 's killing , you know . So superior , so knowing . The other day  --  the other day , Kenneth I took her to lunch in town and she criticized me  --  now what do you think about ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( Sitting on arm of chair ) For once my intuition fails me . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't it delicious ? DR . KENNETH RICE Not more specific than simply lousy ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM She said I threw myself at men instead of reversing the process . p. 103 DR . KENNETH RICE But I should think she would have approved of that . She makes such a fetish of being candid ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM That 's just what I said  --  exactly . I said I could n't pretend  --  that I could n't descend to  --  technique . I said that when my feelings were involved I saw no point in not letting the other person see it . I reproached her for deviousness . Strange ideas that child has  --  strange ! DR . KENNETH RICE I 'm afraid her generation is theory-ridden ! ( Pause ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Kenneth ? DR . KENNETH RICE Yes , Leonie ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's true of course . DR . KENNETH RICE What ?

You know how useless I am ! DR . KENNETH RICE I know only that you are gracious and lovely  --  and that you have the gift of innocence . p. 104 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I hate my life . It 's been so scattered  --  emotionally . DR . KENNETH RICE Whose is n't ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You are such a comfort . Really it 's too much now to expect me to do without you . Kenneth ? DR . KENNETH RICE Yes Leonie . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Will you be a darling  --  and marry me ? DR . KENNETH RICE Leonie ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Returning his gaze ) Yes , Kenneth . DR . KENNETH RICE Have you thought this over ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's the first time  --  the very first time  --  that I 've ever been sure . DR . KENNETH RICE You are so impulsive , Leonie .

LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Paula dear , have you been with Mother ? p. 105 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes . Granny wants to see you , as a matter of fact . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , I forgot ! Is she all right ? Cheerful ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Oh , very . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'll be right there . Stay and talk to Kenneth , Paula . He thinks you do n't like him . Prove to him it is n't true . Do you think you could be gracious , Paula ? Or is that too old-fashioned ? ( Exit LEONIE door back . In the following scene PAULA determines to get rid of the tantalizing and irritating mixed feelings she has about KENNETH , her sense of distrusting , disliking and simultaneously being fascinated by him  --  she feels he has something up his sleeve ; she is playing a game to discover what it is and yet she becomes increasingly conscious that game is not unpleasant to her because of her interest in her victim ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Leonie 's all a-flutter . What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she envies you your poise . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Your intentions are honorable , I hope . DR . KENNETH RICE Old hat , Paula . PAULA FROTHINGHAM I beg your pardon . p. 106 DR . KENNETH RICE Undergraduate audacity . Scott Fitzgerald . Old hat . PAULA FROTHINGHAM We do n't like each other much , do we ? DR . KENNETH RICE That 's regrettable . PAULA FROTHINGHAM And yet  --  I 'm very curious about you . DR . KENNETH RICE What would you like to know ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Your motive . DR . KENNETH RICE Ah ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM And yet even if you told me  --  DR . KENNETH RICE You would n't believe it ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Facing him ) No . Now why is that ? Even when you are perfectly frank your frankness seems to me  --  a device . Now why is that ? DR . KENNETH RICE I 'll tell you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Why ? DR . KENNETH RICE Because you yourself are confused , muddled , unsure , contradictory . I am simple and co-ordinated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You would like such simplicity for yourself . But , as you are unlikely to achieve it , you soothe yourself by distrusting me. p. 107 PAULA FROTHINGHAM You say I 'm muddled . Why am I muddled ? DR . KENNETH RICE You 've accepted a set of premises without examining them or thinking about them . You keep them like jewels in a box and dangle them . Then you put them back in the box , confident that they belong to you . But , as they do n't , you feel an occasional twinge of insecurity  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM Do you mind dropping the parables  --  ? DR . KENNETH RICE Not at all  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM Why am I muddled ? For example  --  DR . KENNETH RICE You 're a walking contradiction in terms  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM For example ? DR . KENNETH RICE For example  --  for example  --  your radicalism . Your friends . Your point of view . Borrowed . Unexamined . Insincere . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Go on . DR . KENNETH RICE You are rich and you are exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to face her ) Because your forebears were not moralistic but ruthless . Had they been moralistic , had they been concerned , as you pretend to be , with the " predatory system "  --  this awful terminology  --  you 'd be working in a store somewhere wrapping packages or waiting on querulous housewives with bad skins or teaching school . Your own origins wo n't bear a moralistic investigation . You must know that . Your sociology and economics must teach you that . p. 108 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Suppose I repudiate my origins ? DR . KENNETH RICE That takes more courage than you have . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Do n't be so sure . DR . KENNETH RICE But why should you ? If you had a special talent or were a crusader there might be some sense in it . But you have no special talent and you are not a crusader . Much better to be decorative . Much better for a world starving for beauty . Instead of repudiating your origins you should exult in them and in that same predatory system that made you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( Pause ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM What were your origins ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( Lighting cigarette ) Anonymous . PAULA FROTHINGHAM What do you mean ? DR . KENNETH RICE I was discovered on a doorstep . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Really ? DR . KENNETH RICE Like Moses . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Where were you brought up ? DR . KENNETH RICE In a foundling asylum in New England . The place lacked charm . This sounds like an unpromising beginning but actually it was more stimulating than you might imagine . I remember as a kid of twelve going to the library in Springfield and getting down the Dictionary of National Biography and hunting out the bastards . Surprising how many distinguished ones there were and are . I allied myself early with the brilliant and variegated company of the illegitimate . p. 109 PAULA FROTHINGHAM You do n't know who your parents were ? DR . KENNETH RICE No . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Did you get yourself through college ? DR . KENNETH RICE And medical school . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Did you practice medicine ? DR . KENNETH RICE For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would let me  --  to their noses and throats . It was a starveling occupation . But I gave up tonsillectomy for the soul . The poor have tonsils but only the rich have souls . My instinct was justified  --  as you see . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 've gone pretty far . DR . KENNETH RICE Incredible journey ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Having come from  --  from  --  DR . KENNETH RICE The mud  --  ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Well  --  I should think you 'd be more sympathetic to the under-dogs . DR . KENNETH RICE No , why should I ? The herd bores me . It interests me only as an indication of the distance I 've traveled . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will would say that you are a lucky individual who  --  p. 110 DR . KENNETH RICE Yes , that is what Will would say . It always satisfies the mediocrity to call the exceptional individual lucky . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You do n't like Will ? DR . KENNETH RICE I despise him . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Why ? DR . KENNETH RICE I detest these young firebrands whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detest radicals who lounge about in country-houses . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 're unfair to Will . DR . KENNETH RICE I have no interest in being fair to him . We were discussing you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You are too persuasive . I do n't believe you . DR . KENNETH RICE My advice to you is to find out what you want before you commit yourself to young Mr. Dexter . PAULA FROTHINGHAM But I have committed myself . DR . KENNETH RICE Too bad . PAULA FROTHINGHAM For him or for me ? DR . KENNETH RICE For both of you ; but for him particularly . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Why ? DR . KENNETH RICE I see precisely the effect your money will have on him . He will take it and the feeling will grow in him that in having given it you have destroyed what he calls his integrity . He will eve come to believe that if not for this quenching of initiative he might have become a flaming leader of the people . At the same time he will be aware that both these comforting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of nor any initiative to speak of Knowing they are lies he will only proclaim them the louder , cling to them the harder . He will hate you as the thief of his character  --  petty larceny , I must say . p. 111 PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Jumping up , taking several steps away from him ) That 's a lie . DR . KENNETH RICE Will is an American Puritan . A foreigner  --  Boris , for example  --  marries money , feeling that he gives value received . Very often he does . But young Dexter will never feel that  --  and maybe he 'll be right . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You hate Will . DR . KENNETH RICE You flatter him . PAULA FROTHINGHAM How did you get to know so much about people ? About what they feel and what they will do ? DR . KENNETH RICE I began by knowing myself  --  but not lying to myself . ( A silence . He looks at her . He takes in her loveliness . He speaks her name , in a new voice , softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixedly ) What ? DR . KENNETH RICE Paula  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM What ? DR . KENNETH RICE Do you know me any better now ? Do you trust me any better now ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I do n't know ( Enter WILL ) p. 112 DR . KENNETH RICE Paula , Paula , Paula  --  ( PAULA starts toward door back ) Do n't go , Paula ! WILL DEXTER Ought n't you to be changing for dinner ? ( PAULA stops upstage ) Hello , Doctor . What 's the matter ? DR . KENNETH RICE May I congratulate him ? WILL DEXTER What 's he been saying ? DR . KENNETH RICE Paula told me she is going to marry you . PAULA FROTHINGHAM The doctor is a cynic . DR . KENNETH RICE We were discussing the European and American points of view toward money marriages  --  There 's a great difference . The European fortune-hunter , once he has landed the bag , has no more twinge of conscience than a big-game hunter when he has made his kill . The American  --  WILL DEXTER Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KENNETH RICE ( To PAULA amiably ) You see . He resents the mere phrase . But my dear boy , that is no disgrace . We are all fortune-hunters  --  PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Pointedly ) Not all , Kenneth  --  ! DR . KENNETH RICE But I see no difference at all between the man who makes a profession of being charming to rich ladies  --  or any other  --  specialist . The former is more arduous . p. 113 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Are you defending Will or yourself ? DR . KENNETH RICE I am generalizing . ( To WILL ) Congratulations ! I admit that to scatter congratulations in this way is glib , but we live in a convention of glibness . Good God , we congratulate people when they marry and when they produce children  --  we skim lightly over these tremendous hazards  --  Excuse me . ( Exit KENNETH ) WILL DEXTER God damn that man ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will ! WILL DEXTER I ca n't stand him  --  not from the moment I saw him  --  because he 's incapable of disinterestedness himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of cynical , sneering  --  He 's a marauder . The adventurer with the cure-all . This is just the moment for him . And this is just the place ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 've never seen you lose your temper before , Will . WILL DEXTER You know why , do n't you ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Why ? WILL DEXTER Because he 's right ! While he was talking I felt like hitting him . At the same time a voice inside me said : Can you deny it ? When I came in here he was saying your name . He was looking at you  --  it seems he has n't quite decided , has he ? p. 114 PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 'm worried about him and Leonie  --  WILL DEXTER He 's got Leonie hook , line and sinker . That 's obvious . PAULA FROTHINGHAM She must n't ! Will , she must n't ! WILL DEXTER You ca n't stop it  --  you ca n't do anything for Leonie . Nobody can do anything for anybody . Nobody should try . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must stay and help me . WILL DEXTER Sorry . Nothing doing . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will ! WILL DEXTER I have a feeling you 'll rather enjoy saving Leonie from the doctor . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will ! That 's not fair , Will ! WILL DEXTER It may not be fair but it is obvious . Also , it is obvious that the doctor wo n't mind being saved . PAULA FROTHINGHAM It 's lucky for both of us that one of us has some self-control . WILL DEXTER No , I wo n't stay here . I hate the place , I hate Dr. Rice , I hate myself for being here ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Do n't let me down , Will  --  I need you terribly just now  --  p. 115 WILL DEXTER ( At white heat ) I have n't quite the technique of fortune hunting yet  --  in the European manner . Which of the two is he after  --  you or Leonie ? Will he flip a coin ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I hate you ! I hate you ! WILL DEXTER Well , we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do ! ( LEONIE comes running in . She wears an exquisite summer evening frock . She is breathless with happiness ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Paula ! Why are n't you dressed ? I want you to wear something especially lovely tonight ! Do you like this ? It 's new . I have n't worn it before . ( She twirls for them ) I 've a surprise for you , Will . You 'll know what it is in a minute . I was thinking of you and it popped into my mind . You know , Will , I 'm very , very fond of you . And I think you are equally fond of me . I ca n't help liking people who like me . I suppose you think I 'm horribly vain . But then , everybody 's vain about something . ( BUTLER comes in with cocktails and sandwiches , to table right of fireplace ) If they 're not , they 're vain about their lack of vanity . I believe that 's a mot ! Pretty good for a brainless  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes cocktail ) Paula  --  what 's your pet vanity ? She thinks mine 's my looks but it 's not . If I had my way I should n't look at all the way I look . ( Enter Dr. DEXTER , door back . He wears a sea-green baggy dinner-suit ; he looks as " hicky " and uncertain as ever ) p. 116 DR . DEXTER Good evening , Mrs. Frothingham . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Dr. Dexter  --  how good of you to come . Delighted to see you . DR . DEXTER Good evening . Hello , Will . WILL DEXTER Dad ! DR . DEXTER Mrs. Frothingham invited me . Did n't you know ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Takes DEXTER 'S arm and goes to WILL ) You told me you had to leave tomorrow to visit your father in Brunswick so I just called him up in Brunswick  --  DR . DEXTER She sent the car all the way for me . Nice car . Great springs . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( To WILL ) Now you wo n't have to leave tomorrow . You can both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little right ) Awfully nice of you , Leonie . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Following him ) ( DEXTER sits on sofa ) You see , Will , I leave the big issues to the professional altruists . I just do what I can toward making those around me happy . And that 's my vanity ! ( Enter DENNIS , door back ) p. 117 DENNIS MCCARTHY Well ! Well ! Fancy that now , Hedda ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , hello , Dennis , just in time for a cocktail . ( LEONIE leads him over to sofa . WILL is isolated down right center ) DENNIS MCCARTHY ( To DEXTER ) How are you ? DR . DEXTER ( Not friendly ) I 'm all right . DENNIS MCCARTHY Complicated week-end ! You and the Healer ! Faraday and Cagliostro . That 'll be something . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Takes DENNIS 'S arm ) Everybody tells me to like you , Dennis . I 'm in such a mood that I 'm going to make the effort . DENNIS MCCARTHY I 've been waiting for this . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage front ) Something tells me you could be very charming if you wanted to . Tell me , Dennis , have you ever tried being lovable and sweet ? DENNIS MCCARTHY For you , Mrs. Frothingham , I would willingly revive the age of chivalry ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But there 's no need of that . I just want you to be nice . Here , have a cocktail . Give you courage . p. 118 DENNIS MCCARTHY Just watch me from now on , Mrs. Frothingham . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I will . Passionately . ( Hands him cocktail ) I 'll be doing nothing else . ( BUTLER crosses back of sofa , offers DEXTER and PAULA cocktails . Dr. RICE comes in ) DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Stage sigh ) Ah-h-h ! The doctor ! Just in time to look at my tongue , Doctor . DR . KENNETH RICE That wo n't be necessary , young man . I can tell  --  It 's excessive . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Crossing to KENNETH ) Kenneth  --  you remember Will 's father  --  Dr. Dexter . DR . KENNETH RICE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A second BUTLER has come in and he and ROBERT are passing cocktails and hors duvres . LEONIE keeps circulating among her guests . KENNETH and DEXTER are in the center  --  DENNIS , obeying a malicious impulse , presides over them . Announces a theme on which he eggs them on to utter variations ) DENNIS MCCARTHY A significant moment , ladies and gentlemen  --  the magician of Science meets the magician of Sex  --  The floating libido bumps the absolute ! What happens ? p. 119 DR . DEXTER ( Cupping his hand to his ear ) What ? ( WILL crosses to door and looks out moodily ) DENNIS MCCARTHY The absolute has n't got a chance . Is n't that right , Dr. Rice ? DR . KENNETH RICE I should n't venture to contradict a young intellectual . Especially a very young intellectual . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Crosses front of KENNETH , to DENNIS ) There , you see , I 'm afraid , after all , I 'll have to give you up , Dennis . You ca n't be lovable . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be winsome to everybody , only to you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You really must treat him , Kenneth . He has no censor at all . DENNIS MCCARTHY My censor is the Catholic tradition . We Catholics anticipated both Marx and Freud by a little matter of nineteen centuries . Spiritually , we have a Communion in the Holy Ghost  --  Communion . As for Dr. Rice , he offers confession without absolution . He is inadequate . ( LEONIE returns with tray of canaps ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It seems such bad taste to discuss religion at cocktail time . Try a stuffed olive . p. 120 DR . DEXTER By the time you get your beautiful new world , true science will have perished . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Are n't you too pessimistic , Dr. Dexter ? Too much science has made you gloomy . Kenneth , the depression has n't stopped your work , has it ? Depression or no depression  --  ( WILL springs up ) WILL DEXTER ( Tensely ) That 's right , Leonie . ( Everyone faces WILL ) Depression or no depression  --  war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme ! ( KENNETH stares at him . WILL confronts him ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Will ! WILL DEXTER Yes , Leonie . His is the power and the glory ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Dennis , this is your influence  --  WILL DEXTER I admire you unreservedly , Doctor . Of your kind you are the best . You are the essence . DR . KENNETH RICE You embarrass me . WILL DEXTER Some men are born ahead of their time , some behind , but you are made pat for the instant . Now is the time for you  --  when people are unemployed and distrust their own capacities  --  when people suffer and may be tempted  --  when integrity yields to despair  --  now is the moment for you ! p. 121 DR . KENNETH RICE ( Strolling closer to him so they are face to face ) When , may I ask , is the moment for you  --  when if ever ? WILL DEXTER After your victory . When you are stuffed and inert with everything you want , then will be the time for me . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Will Will ( She follows him out ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Devastated by this strange behavior ) What is it ? I do n't like it when people stand in the middle of the floor and make speeches . What 's the matter with him ? Dennis , do you know ? DENNIS MCCARTHY ( With a look at KENNETH ) I can guess . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Has he quarreled with Paula ? Paula is so inept . She does n't know how to At the same time , if he had a grievance , why could n't he have kept it until after dinner ? ( Enter ROBERT ) ROBERT Dinner is served . ( Exit ROBERT ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well , we 'll do what we can . Sam is dining with Mother in her room . Boris has a headache . Dennis , you and Dr. Dexter  --  p. 122 DENNIS MCCARTHY You 've picked me , Dr. Dexter . I congratulate you . DR . DEXTER Thank God , I ca n't hear a word you say . ( Exit DEXTER , door back ) DENNIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we 'll fight it out on these lines if it takes all dinner . ( He follows DEXTER out ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What extraordinary behavior ! What do you suppose , Kenneth  --  shall I go after them ? DR . KENNETH RICE I would n't . It 's their problem . Give them time . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Reassured ) You are so wise , Kenneth . How did I ever get on without you ? I have that secure feeling that you are going to be my last indiscretion . When I think how neatly I 've captured you  --  I feel quite proud . I guess my technique is n't so lousy after all . ( She takes his arm and swings along beside him as they waltz in to dinner ) @x The same . Time : Late that fall . The trees have turned . The sumach have put out the brilliant red flowers of autumn . At Rise : WILL and DENNIS have just arrived , and are standing at fireplace , back . LEONIE comes in to greet them . SAM strolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you ! ( She shakes hands with each of them warmly ) Will ! How are you ? ( To DENNIS ) It 's so good of you to come . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Shaking hands with WILL ) Very glad to see you . WILL DEXTER Thanks . ( SAM shakes hands with DENNIS ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Sam drove over for a few hours from Blue Hill to talk business to me . He has n't had much luck so far . It 's simply wonderful having you boys here  --  it 's like old times . I did n't tell Paula . ( To SAM ) I did all this on my own . It 's a surprise for Paula . DENNIS MCCARTHY She 'll be overcome when she sees me . Maybe you should prepare her . WILL DEXTER Where is Paula ? p. 124 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is n't it provoking ! She and Kenneth went for a walk . They should have been back long before this . ( Turning back to them ) Paula has n't been at all herself , Will . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be glad to do what I can , of course . Several very stubborn cases have yielded to my charm . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 'm sure ! Do sit down . ( She sits ) DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Taking out his pipe ) Do you mind ? ( WILL sits ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , please  --  I ca n't tell you how I appreciate your coming  --  DENNIS MCCARTHY ( The harassed businessman ) Well , as a matter of fact , Leonie , it was n't easy to get away from the office  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Are you in an office ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Sometimes as many as fifteen in a day . ( LEONIE laughs ) But when I got your appealing letter  --  and the return tickets  --  I 'm chivalrous at heart , you know , Leonie  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I know you are ! p. 125 SAM FROTHINGHAM How 's town ? WILL DEXTER Very hot . SAM FROTHINGHAM I 'm just on my way down . Stopped by to go over several things with Leonie  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Poor Sam 's been having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in escrow . Where is escrow ? DENNIS MCCARTHY It 's where squirrels put nuts in the winter-time . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I see ! Dennis is much more lucid than you , Sam . DENNIS MCCARTHY I have a knack for making the abstruse translucent . Especially in economics . Now , would you like to know why England went off gold ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM No , I would n't . DENNIS MCCARTHY I shall yield to your subconscious demand and tell you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( To others ) Help ! DENNIS MCCARTHY I see that there is no audience for my peculiar gift . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You know , Will , I 've thought perhaps you were angry with us . WILL DEXTER Why ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You have n't been here for so long . ( To SAM ) Since Granny died  --  none of them have been here . Did Paula write you about Granny 's funeral ? p. 126 WILL DEXTER No . She did n't . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Of course I hate funerals  --  I ca n't bear them  --  but this was so  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did . It was a dreaming blue sky and there was that poignant haze over the hills and over the bay , and the smell of burning wood from somewhere . Burning wood never smells at any other time the way it does in Indian summer . And the colors that day ! Did you ever , Sam , see such a day ? SAM FROTHINGHAM It was beautiful . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM They say the colors of autumn are the colors of death , but I do n't believe that . They were in such strength that day . I cried  --  but not on account of Mother  --  that kind of day always makes me cry a little bit anyway . You could n't cry over consigning anyone you loved to an earth like that  --  on a day like that . I put some blazing leaves over her , but when I passed there the other day , they were withered and brown  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Chiding her ) Now Leonie  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Sam thinks I should n't talk about Mother . But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of her with joy . She had a wonderful life . SAM FROTHINGHAM She was a wonderful woman . p. 127 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( To WILL ) Imagine , Will  --  when Sam was here last time  --  you were here that week-end  --  she knew . She asked Sam to be executor of her will . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Very annoyed at her for bringing this up ) Leonie  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Why did n't you tell me , Sam , then ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Seemed no point . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM She did n't want me to know , did she ? SAM FROTHINGHAM No . She did n't want to distress you . ( A moment 's pause ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What can be keeping Paula ? ( She glances out of the window ) Sam , do you want to talk business to me some more ? SAM FROTHINGHAM I 'd like to talk to Will a minute . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh  --  yes . Well , Dennis , would n't you like me to show you to your room ? ( She rises , goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got to answer a chain letter . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I 've given you a room you 've never had . The tower room . p. 128 DENNIS MCCARTHY Is it ivory ? I wo n't be comfortable if it is n't ivory . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Well just this once you 're going to be uncomfortable  --  and like it ! ( She goes out ) DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Tragically ) And for this I gave up a superb view of the gas-house on 149th Street . ( He goes out ) SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Rises and goes up toward fireplace ) Will  --  WILL DEXTER Yes , Mr. Frothingham . SAM FROTHINGHAM Oh  --  call me Sam . WILL DEXTER All right . SAM FROTHINGHAM I 'll have to be pushing off in an hour or so . I rather wanted to talk to you . WILL DEXTER Yes  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Wipes his forehead ) Gosh , Leonie 's a difficult woman to talk business to . ( Sits ) WILL DEXTER I can imagine that . She 's not interested in business . SAM FROTHINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL DEXTER What do you want to speak to me about ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Paula . WILL DEXTER What about Paula ? SAM FROTHINGHAM As I 'm her father  --  I hope you wo n't think me  --  WILL DEXTER Of course not  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM It 's not altogether easy  --  WILL DEXTER Do you want me to help you ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes . I wish you would ! WILL DEXTER You 're worried about Paula and me , are n't you ? So was her grandmother . You think me irresponsible . Less responsible for example  --  ( As if making a random comparison ) than Dr. Rice ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Well , as a matter of fact , I 've rather gotten to know Dr. Rice , and in many respects , he 's a pretty sound feller . ( Rising and going to stand above WILL ) Hang it all , Will , I like you , and I do n't like to preach to you , you know . WILL DEXTER Go on . SAM FROTHINGHAM Well , there are  --  from my point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . I 'd like to point out just one thing to you . Your radicalism and all that  --  Well , the point is this  --  if you marry Paula  --  and I hope you do , because I like you  --  and , what is more imporlant , Paula likes you  --  you 'll have responsibilities . Paula will be rich . Very rich . Money means responsibility . Now , I should n't , for example , like you to start radical magazines with it . I should n't like you to let the money drift through your fingers in all sorts of aimless , millennial directions that wo n't get anywhere . p. 130 WILL DEXTER Who told you that was my intention ? SAM FROTHINGHAM A little bird . WILL DEXTER With a black moustache ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Does that matter ? WILL DEXTER No . SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Putting hand on WILL 's shoulder ) As a matter of fact , I 'm not worried about you at all . Money , I expect , will do to you what getting power does to radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , you mean ? SAM FROTHINGHAM Well , hardly . Mature you . Once you 're rich yourself , I have no doubt you 'll be  --  WILL DEXTER Sound . SAM FROTHINGHAM Yes . Sound . But your friends  --  this McCarthy boy  --  WILL DEXTER Well , I can easily cut Dennis  --  all my poor and unsound friends  --  SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Quietly ) I 'm sorry you 're taking this tone with me , Will . I 'm the last person in the world to ask you to drop anybody . I 'd be ashamed of you if you did . Only  --  WILL DEXTER Only ? p. 131 SAM FROTHINGHAM I must tell you that I am in position  --  by virtue of the will left by Mrs. Wyler  --  to keep Paula 's money from being used for any purpose that might be construed as  --  subversive . WILL DEXTER From whose point of view ? SAM FROTHINGHAM ( Quietly ) From mine . WILL DEXTER I see . SAM FROTHINGHAM Possibly you may not believe this  --  but I trust you , Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry . Paula seems to have other interests apparently . SAM FROTHINGHAM What do you mean ? WILL DEXTER Sounder interests  --  ( DENNIS enters , through door back ) DENNIS MCCARTHY The tower room lets in light on four sides , but nothing to look at . Just the sea and the landscape . SAM FROTHINGHAM What did you do with Leonie ? DENNIS MCCARTHY She 's gone to her mother 's room to potter around . SAM FROTHINGHAM Maybe I can get her attention while she 's pottering . Excuse me . ( SAM goes out ) p. 132 DENNIS MCCARTHY Poor Leonie  --  she 's the last of the lovely ladies . The inheritance taxes 'll get ' em soon . You know we were by way of getting our magazine from Leonie when Dr. Rice spiked our guns . So I 'm leaving . My time is too valuable . But the Healer wo n't last forever , and when he goes , I shall return . Take heart , my good man . I know you feel a little tender about doing this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts . Remember what Shaw says : " There is no money but the devil 's money . It is all tainted and it might as well be used in the service of God . " ( A moment  --  WILL is obviously thinking of something else ) What 's the matter ? WILL DEXTER Nothing . DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Bringing down chair to sit left of WILL he imitates RICE 'S manner ) Now you must speak , young man  --  how can I sublimate your subconscious troubles , if you wo n't speak ? Are you unhappy about Paula , my lad ? ( No answer ) Tell me what 's happened between you  --  relieve your soul , and , as a reward , I may make you co-editor of our magazine . ( No response . He rises and walks to opposite side of table ) No ? Assistant editor you remain . I may even fire you . Yes , I think I will fire you . ( Crossing in front of WILL to fireplace ) Dexter  --  you 're through . Go upstairs and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) God , it gives me a sense of power to fire a man  --  especially an old friend ! ( PAULA and KENNETH come in door right from the garden ) p. 133 PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Amazed to see them ) Will ! But how  --  ! Dennis ! WILL DEXTER ( Rather coolly ) Hello , Paula . DENNIS MCCARTHY We came to surprise you . Now that we have surprised you , we can go home . WILL DEXTER Leonie asked me to come . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Oh . Well , it 's very nice to see you . WILL DEXTER Thanks . PAULA FROTHINGHAM When I wired you to come a few weeks ago , you were too busy . It takes Leonie , does n't it ? DENNIS MCCARTHY You should have tried me , Paula . Hello , Dr. Rice . How 's business ? Any suppressions today ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( Significantly ) Apparently not . DENNIS MCCARTHY Well , come on up to my room , Doctor , and we 'll play Twenty Questions . ( He goes out ) WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How are you ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will  --  I 'm awfully glad to see you . I was just going to write you to thank you for the sweet letter you sent me after Granny died . p. 134 DR . KENNETH RICE I 'm afraid it 's my fault , Dexter . I do my best to keep Paula so busy that she finds no time to write letters . WILL DEXTER I was sure I could count on you , Doctor . ( WILL goes out ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM You enjoy hurting Will , do n't you ? DR . KENNETH RICE When there is an obstacle in my path , I do my best to remove it . PAULA FROTHINGHAM What makes you think it is only Will that stands between us  --  That if left to myself I  --  DR . KENNETH RICE Because it is true . Were it not for the squids of idealistic drivel spouted around you by Will and his friends , there would be no issue at all between us . I resent even an imputed rivalry with someone I despise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no reason any longer why I should n't tell you the truth . PAULA FROTHINGHAM What is it , Kenneth ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( After a moment  --  slowly ) Do you know what I feel like ? I feel like a man on a great height , irresistibly tempted to jump over . Do you want the truth really ? ( She says nothing . Somehow his words , his voice , his attitude make her feel that really now he may reveal something which before he would n't have revealed . He is in a trance-like state almost ; she feels it ; she is rather horribly fascinated  --  somehow , though she distrusts him utterly , some instinct tells her that , at this moment actually he is tempted by a force , disruptive to himself , to tell her the truth ) Do n't you know it ? Do n't you feel it ? ( Pause ) Have n't you known it ? Have n't you felt it ? ( A moment 's pause ) I love you . p. 135 PAULA FROTHINGHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A pause . She is too stupefied to speak . She too is under a spell . Size is fascinated by him  --  by the enormity of this . She rises , walks away from him to stand by sofa ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM I suppose I should be afraid of you . I 'm not afraid of you . DR . KENNETH RICE I am afraid of you . You tempt me to venture the impossible . That is impractical . And I have always been eminently practical . PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 'm sure you have . ( She feels herself talking automatically , as if out of a hypnotic state  --  at the same time some vanity and shrewdness keeps pounding inside her : " See how far he will go  --  see how far he will go ! " ) DR . KENNETH RICE I have lived by a plan . The plan has matured . But I have yearned for a face that would give me joy , for the voice that would soothe me . It is your face . It is your voice . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she is caught in a nightmarish fascination ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Very faintly ) Do n't you love Mother ? DR . KENNETH RICE No . ( A moment 's pause ) You are the youth I have never had , the security I have never had  --  you are the home I have hungered for . ( Moves toward her  --  stands over her and a little back ) That I am standing near you now , that I have achieved a share in your life , that you are listening to me , that you are thinking of me and of what I am , to the exclusion of everything else in the whirling universe  --  this is a miracle so devastating , that it makes any future possible  --  Paula  --  p. 136 PAULA FROTHINGHAM What ? DR . KENNETH RICE Paula ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM What is it ! DR . KENNETH RICE ( Bending over her ) Paula ( It is as if he got a sexual joy from saying her name ) I love your name . I love to say your name . PAULA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . DR . KENNETH RICE Do you think me insane ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes . DR . KENNETH RICE Because I am ambitious , because I am forthright , because I deal scientifically with the human stuff around me  --  you think me insane . Because I am ruthless and romantic , you think me insane . This boy you think you love  --  who spends his time sniveling about a system he is not strong enough to dominate  --  is he sane ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I do n't expect you to  --  DR . KENNETH RICE When I hear the chatter of your friends , it makes me sick . While they and their kind prate of co-operative commonwealths , the strong man takes power , and rides over their backs  --  which is all their backs are fit for . Never has the opportunity for the individual career been so exalted , so infinite in its scope , so horizontal . House-painters and minor journalists become dictators of great nations . ( With puckish humor  --  leaning on arm of her chair ) Imagine what a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( He smiles , makes a gesture of modest self-assertion , indicating the room as part of his conquest . She laughs , rather choke and embarrassed . He goes on ) And this I have done alone . From an impossible distance  --  I have come to you , so that when I speak , you can hear . What might we not do together , Paula  --  you and I  --  ( To her surprise , PAULA finds herself arguing an inconceivable point . She loathes the strange fascination she feels in this man , and yet is aware that it might turn to her advantage ) p. 137 PAULA FROTHINGHAM We do n't want the same things . DR . KENNETH RICE You want what everyone wants who has vitality and imagination  --  new forms of power  --  new domains of knowledge  --  the ultimate sensations . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You are romantic , are n't you ? DR . KENNETH RICE Endlessly . And endlessly  --  realistic . ( Staring at her ) What are you thinking ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Shrewd against him  --  against herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're after now ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( Moving toward her ) You do n't believe then  --  that I love you ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Leaning back in chair  --  not looking at him ) You are a very strange man . DR . KENNETH RICE I am simple really . I want everything . That 's all ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM And you do n't care how you get it . DR . KENNETH RICE Do n't be moralistic , Paula  --  I beg you . I am directly in the tradition of your own marauding ancestors . They pass now for pioneers  --  actually they fell on the true pioneers , and wrested what they had found away from them , by sheer brutal strength . I am doing the same thing  --  but more adroitly. p. 138 PAULA FROTHINGHAM Why are you so honest with me ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( With his most charming smile ) Perhaps because I feel that , in your heart , you too are an adventurer . ( A pause . During these half-spell-bound instants a thought has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This man is the enemy . This man is infinitely cunning , infinitely resourceful . Perhaps  --  just the possibility  --  he really feels this passion for her . If so , why not use this weakness in an antagonist so ruthless ? She will try ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM I should n't listen to you  --  ( A moment . He senses her cunning . He looks at her ) DR . KENNETH RICE You do n't trust me ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Have I reason to trust you ? DR . KENNETH RICE What reason would you like ? What proof would you like ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Are n't you going to marry Mother ? DR . KENNETH RICE Only as an alternative . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will you  --  tell her so ? Will you give up the alternative ? DR . KENNETH RICE And if I do ? p. 139 PAULA FROTHINGHAM What shall I promise you ? DR . KENNETH RICE Yourself . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Looks at him  --  speaks ) And if I do ? DR . KENNETH RICE Then PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Taking fire ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  really feel it  --  You have n't been very adventurous for all your talk ! Taking in Mother and Sam ! Give up those conquests . Tell her ! Tell Mother ! Then perhaps I will believe you . DR . KENNETH RICE And then ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Take your chances ! DR . KENNETH RICE ( Quietly ) Very well . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You will ? DR . KENNETH RICE I will . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 'll tell Mother  --  you love me ? DR . KENNETH RICE Yes . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Going to the foot of the stairs , calls ) Mother ! Mother ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Offstage ) Yes , Paula . I 'm coming right down ! I 've the most marvelous surprise for you ! Wait and see ! ( PAULA walks to end of sofa  --  looking at KENNETH . LEONIE comes in . She is wearing an exquisite old-fashioned silk wedding-dress which billows around her in an immense shimmering circle . She is a vision of enchantment ) p. 140 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( In a great flurry of excitement ) Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the dress she was married in . I was poking around in Granny 's room while Sam was talking to me about bonds , and I came upon it . Do you like it , Kenneth ? Is n't it adorable ? Have you ever What 's the matter ? Do n't you like it ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM It 's very pretty . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Overwhelmed by the inadequacy of this word ) Pretty ! Pretty ! ( She hopes for more from KENNETH ) Kenneth ? DR . KENNETH RICE It 's exquisite . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Is n't it ? ( She whirls around in the dress ) Is n't it ? Yes . Exquisite . Can you imagine the scene ? Can you imagine Granny walking down the aisle  --  and all the august spectators in mutton-chop whiskers and Prince Alberts ? We 've lost something these days  --  a good deal  --  oh , I do n't miss the mutton-chops  --  but in ceremony , I mean  --  in punctilio and grace . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Cutting ruthlessly through the nostalgia ) Mother ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAULA FROTHINGHAM Kenneth has something to tell you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Kenneth ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM Yes . He has something to tell you . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Have you , Kenneth ? DR . KENNETH RICE Yes . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What is it ? DR . KENNETH RICE ( Quietly ) I love Paula . I want to marry Paula . ( A pause . Granny 's wedding-dress droops ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Do you mean that , Kenneth ? DR . KENNETH RICE Yes . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Piteously ) This is n't very nice of you , Paula . PAULA FROTHINGHAM I had nothing to do with it . I loathe Kenneth . But I wanted you to know him . Now you see him , Mother , your precious Lothario  --  there he is ! Look at him ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM These clothes are picturesque , but I think our modern ones are more comfortable . I think  --  I feel quite faint  --  is n't it ridiculous ? ( She sways ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 'm sorry , Mother . I had to . But I love you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint ) Thank you , Paula . PAULA FROTHINGHAM You 'd better go up and lie down . I 'll come to you in a moment . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes . I think I 'd better . Yes . ( She begins to sob ; she goes out , hiding her face in the lace folds of her dress . PAULA , having gone with her to the door , rings bell for ROBERT , turns to KENNETH ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM I suppose you 're going to tell me this is n't cricket . Well , do n't , because it will only make me laugh . To live up to a code with people like you is only to be weak and absurd . DR . KENNETH RICE ( His voice is low and even but tense with hate ) You , Miss Frothingham , are my last miscalculation . I might even say my first . Fortunately , not irreparable ! ( ROBERT enters ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Robert . ROBERT Yes , Miss Frothingham . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Still staring fixedly at KENNETH ) Dr. Rice is leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ROBERT Yes , Miss . ( He goes out ) p. 143 DR . KENNETH RICE Forgive me  --  for having over-estimated you . ( He goes out door right . PAULA comes slowly down and sits on sofa . She gets a reaction herself now from all she has been through ; this game has n't been natural to her ; she is trembling physically ; she is on the verge of tears . WILL comes in ) PAULA FROTHINGHAM Will  --  Will darling  --  ( She clings to WILL ) WILL DEXTER ( Worried ) Paula ! PAULA FROTHINGHAM Put your arms around me , Will  --  hold me close  --  ( WILL obeys ) WILL DEXTER What 's happened ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM I 've tricked him . I made him say in front of Mother that he loved me. that he wanted to marry me . Poor Leonie ! But it had to be done ! And do you know , Will  --  at the end I felt  --  gosh , one has so many selves , Will . I must tell you  --  for the  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEXTER ( Curious ) What ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM A the end I felt I had to do it  --  not only to save Leonie  --  but to save myself . Can you understand that ? I felt horribly drawn to him , and by the sordid thing I was doing  --  But it 's over . Thank God it 's over . Will , darling , these six weeks have been hell without you . When I got your letter about Granny , I sat down and cried . I wanted to go right to New York to be with you . And yet I could n't . How could I ? But now , Will  --  I do n't want to wait for you any longer . I 've done what I can . It 's cost me almost  --  Will  --  I need you terribly  --  p. 144 WILL DEXTER And I you , Paula . But listen , darling  --  I 've decided during the weeks I 've been away from you  --  I ca n't marry you now  --  I ca n't face what I 'd become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) But Will , I 'll give up the money . I 'll live with you anywhere . WILL DEXTER I know that , Paula . But I must n't . You must n't let me . I 've thought it all out . You say you 'd live with me anywhere . But what would happen ? Supposing I did n't get a job ? Would we starve ? We 'd take fifty dollars a week from your grandmother 's estate . It would be foolish not to . Taking fifty , why not seventy-five ? Why not two hundred ? I ca n't let myself in for it , Paula . ( A long pause ) Paula , darling  --  do you hate me ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM No . WILL DEXTER Supposing you were n't rich ? Is it a world in which , but for this , I 'd have to sink ? If it is , I 'm going to damn well do what I can to change it . I do n't have to scrabble for the inheritance of dead men . That 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several generations  --  succeeding another . I do n't want this damn fortune to give me an unfair advantage over people as good as I am who have n't got it . ( Torn with pity for her ) Paula  --  my dearest  --  what can I do ? p. 145 PAULA FROTHINGHAM I see that you ca n't do anything . I quite see . Still  --  WILL DEXTER I love you , Paula , and I 'll be longing for you terribly , but I ca n't marry you  --  not till there 's somebody for you to marry . When I 've struck my stride , I wo n't care about Sam , or the money , or anything , because I 'll be on my own . If you feel the way I do , you 'll wait . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Very still voice ) Of course , Will . I 'll wait . WILL DEXTER ( Overcome with gratitude and emotion  --  seizes her in his arms passionately ) Darling  --  darling  --  ( LEONIE comes in . WILL , overcome with emotion , goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie down . " But what happens then ? Thoughts assail you . Thoughts PAULA FROTHINGHAM Mother LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Kenneth 's going . He 's leaving . I suppose you 're happy . It 's the end  --  the end of summer . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Herself shaken with emotion ) Mother  --  ( She wants to talk to LEONIE , to tell her what has happened , but LEONIE is lost in her own maze ) p. 146 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's cold here . I hate this place . I 'm going to sell it . ( She sits , in chair , right of fireplace ) I 've always wanted things around me to be gay and warm and happy . I 've done my best . I must be wrong . Why do I find myself this way ? With nothing . With nothing . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Running to her mother and throwing herself on her knees beside her ) Mother  --  Mother darling  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Not responding , reflectively ) I suppose the thing about me that is wrong is that love is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause ) I suppose I should have been interested in other things . Good works . Do they sustain you ? But I could n't somehow . I think when you 're not in love  --  you 're dead . Yes , that must be why I 'm ( Her voice trails off rather . PAULA drops her head in her mother 's lap and begins to cry ) LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Surprised ) Paula  --  what is it ? What 's the matter ? Are you sorry ? It 's all right , child . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Through her tears ) It 's Will  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Will ? p. 147 PAULA FROTHINGHAM He 's going away . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Why do n't you go with him ? PAULA FROTHINGHAM He does n't want me . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM That 's not true . It must be something else . PAULA FROTHINGHAM The money . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , the money . Yes , the money . The money wo n't do anything for you . It 'll work against you . It 's worked against me . It gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back to yourself . At the end of every journey  --  you find yourself . PAULA FROTHINGHAM What Shall I do , Mother ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You and Will want the same things . In the end you will find them . But do n't let him find them with someone else . Follow him . Be near him . When he is depressed and discouraged , let it be your hand that he touches , your face that he sees . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Breathless ) Mother  --  you 're right  --  he told me last summer  --  " you must have a shoulder to lean on "  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Let it be your shoulder , Paula ; follow him . Be near him . PAULA FROTHINGHAM Thank you , Mother . p. 148 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Ruefully ) I am telling you what I should do . It must be bad advice . PAULA FROTHINGHAM ( Gratefully ) Darling ! ( DENNIS and WILL come in ) DENNIS MCCARTHY Here you are ! We 're off to the boat ! Thirty minutes ! Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leonie ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You know , all these years I 've been coming up here , and I 've never been on the Bar Harbor boat . DENNIS MCCARTHY It may be said , Mrs. Frothingham , if you have never been on the Bar Harbor boat , that you have not lived ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Really ! I 'd always heard it was poky . DENNIS MCCARTHY Poky ! The Normandie of the Kennebec poky ! Mrs. Frothingham ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It 's fun , is it ? But does n't it get into New York at some impossible hour ? DENNIS MCCARTHY At seven A.M. LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Seven ! ( She shudders ) DENNIS MCCARTHY ( The brisk executive ) Seven ! Yes , sir ! At my desk at nine ! All refreshed and co-ordinated and ready to attack my South American correspondence . p. 149 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I must learn not to believe him , must n't I ? DENNIS MCCARTHY I am my own master , Leonie . All day for nine mortal hours I grind out escape fiction for the pulp magazines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slicks and then I doubt very much whether I shall come here . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I shall miss you . DENNIS MCCARTHY Then I 'll come . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I hate to have you go , Dennis . You cheer me up . Why do n't you stay ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Impossible , Leonie . I must go to New York to launch the magazine . But for the moment , good-bye , Leonie . As a reward for your hospitality I shall send you the original copy of one of my stories . Would you like to escape from something ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Smiling wanly ) I would indeed ! DENNIS MCCARTHY Think no more about it . You 're as good as free . The story is yours , typed personally on my Underwood . Those misplaced keys  --  those inaccuracies  --  how they will bemuse posterity ! ( He goes out ) WILL DEXTER ( Awkwardly ) Good-bye , Leonie. p. 150 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Good-bye , Will . ( He goes out without looking at PAULA . In pantomime , LEONIE urges PAULA to go after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL . Left alone , LEONIE walks to the chair in which her mother sat so often  --  she looks through the glowing autumn at the darkening sea . KENNETH comes in . There is a pause ) DR . KENNETH RICE Leonie  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Yes , Kenneth . DR . KENNETH RICE I do n't expect you to understand this . I shall not try to make you understand it . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Perhaps I 'd better not . DR . KENNETH RICE Really I am amused at myself  --  highly entertained . That I should have almost had to practice on myself what hitherto I have reserved for my patients  --  that I who have made such a fetish of discipline and restraint so nearly succumbed to an inconsistency . I must revise my notion of myself . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM And I too . DR . KENNETH RICE Why ? Why you ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I seem to be a survival  --  Paula 's directness  --  and your calculations  --  they are beyond me. p. 151 DR . KENNETH RICE Nevertheless , it 's curious how you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment at least , you seemed to me  --  interchangeable . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Did you know it from the beginning  --  that it was Paula ? DR . KENNETH RICE I was attracted by her resemblance to you  --  for exercising this attraction I hated her . She felt it too  --  from the beginning and she must have hated me from the beginning . Between us there grew up this strange , unnatural antagonism  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What ? DR . KENNETH RICE This fused emotion of love and hate . It had to be brought out into the open . It 's a familiar psychosis  --  the unconscious desire of the daughter to triumph over the mother . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But I do n't understand  --  DR . KENNETH RICE There is so much in these intricate relationships that the layman ca n't understand  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You mean that you  --  felt nothing for Paula ? DR . KENNETH RICE No , I do n't mean that at all . But I saw that what I felt for her was some twisted reflection of what I felt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it  --  to let her triumph over you . I told her that I loved her . But this was not enough . I must repeat it in front of you . You must witness her triumph . I made it possible . I gave her her great moment . Well , you see what it 's done . It freed her so beautifully that she was able to go to Will . They 've gone away together . Perfect cure for her as well as for myself . ( A moment 's pause ) p. 152 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM It all sounds almost too perfect , Kenneth . DR . KENNETH RICE I said I did n't expect you to understand it  --  you have lived always on your emotions . You have never bothered to delve beneath them . You are afraid to , are n't you ? LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I know this , Kenneth . I heard you say that you loved Paula . I heard your voice . No , I ca n't accept this , Kenneth ! It 's not good enough . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everything you did , everything you said , was to cover what you felt . And I 'd end by telling myself that I believed you . I 'd end by taking second best from you . No , I must guard myself from that . I felt this a month ago  --  that 's why I sent for Will . DR . KENNETH RICE Some day , Leonie , you will learn that feeling is not enough . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM But I trust my instinct , Kenneth . DR . KENNETH RICE That , Leonie , is your most adorable trait  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM What ? DR . KENNETH RICE That trust  --  that innocence . If it were n't for that , you would n't be you  --  and everyone would n't love you  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Oh , no , Kenneth  --  ( DENNIS comes in ) p. 153 DENNIS MCCARTHY Oh , excuse me . But I left my brief-case . Oh , here it is . ( He picks it up ) Without my brief-case I am a man without a Destiny . With it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief-case . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Crossing rather desperately to DENNIS  --  this straw in the current ) What 's in it  --  your stories ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Stories  --  no , that would n't matter . I am fertile ; I can spawn stories . But the plans for the magazine are in here  --  the future of Young America is here  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Will you stay and have a whiskey and soda ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Thanks , but if I do , I shall miss the boat . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Suppose you do ? DR . KENNETH RICE Leonie  --  that would delay the millennium one day . DENNIS MCCARTHY The doctor 's night . That would be selfish . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Be selfish . Please stay . DENNIS MCCARTHY No . Once you are enlisted in a cause , you ca n't live a personal life . It is a dedication . p. 154 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Kenneth is leaving . I shall be lonely , Dennis . I ca n't bear to be alone . DR . KENNETH RICE Your need for people is poignant , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After dinner we can talk about your magazine . DENNIS MCCARTHY Oh , well  --  that makes it possible for me to stay . Thank you , Kenneth . ( He goes to sofa , sits , busying himself with brief-case ) ( She goes to console to make highball ) DR . KENNETH RICE Send me your magazine , Dennis . I shall be honored to be the first subscriber . DENNIS MCCARTHY I 'll be glad to . Your patients can read it in the waiting-room instead of the National Geographic . DR . KENNETH RICE Your first subscriber  --  and very possibly your last . ( He crosses to door and turns back ) Good-bye , Leonie . Good luck , Dennis . We who are about to retire  --  salute you . ( She does not look at him . He bows formally to DENNIS 'S back , makes a gesture of " good luck " and exits ) DENNIS MCCARTHY Trouble with that fellow is  --  he lives for himself . No larger interest . That 's what dignifies human beings , Leonie  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FROTHINGHAM ( Coming down to hand him his highball ) Yes ? Here 's your whiskey and soda . I envy you , Dennis . I wish I could dedicate myself to something  --  something outside myself . DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Rising to sit beside her ) Well , here 's your opportunity , Leonie  --  it 's providential . You could n't do better than this magazine . It would give you a new interest  --  impersonal . It would emancipate you , Leonie . It would be a perpetual dedication to Youth  --  to the hope of the world . The world is middle-aged and tired . But we  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Wistfully ) Can you refresh us , Dennis ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Refresh you ? Leonie , we can rejuvenate you ! LEONIE FROTHINGHAM ( Grateful there is someone there  --  another human being she can laugh with ) That 's an awfully amusing idea . You make me laugh . DENNIS MCCARTHY ( Eagerly selling the idea ) In the youth of any country , there is an immense potentiality  --  LEONIE FROTHINGHAM You 're awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DENNIS MCCARTHY Where the magazine is concerned , Leonie , I am a fanatic . p. 156 LEONIE FROTHINGHAM I suppose if it 's really successful  --  it 'll result in my losing everything I have  --  DENNIS MCCARTHY It 'll be taken from you anyway . You 'll only be anticipating the inevitable . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Why  --  how clever of me ! DENNIS MCCARTHY Not only clever but graceful . LEONIE FROTHINGHAM Will you leave me just a little to live on  --  ? DENNIS MCCARTHY Do n't worry about that  --  come the Revolution  --  you 'll have a friend in high office . ( LEONIE accepts gratefully this earnest of security . They touch glasses in a toast as the curtain falls )                                                                 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
