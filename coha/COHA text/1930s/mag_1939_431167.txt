CIRCLING over the California foothills , an airplane suddenly swooped low . The pilot leaned far over and peered down at a black sedan slithering around the curves of a road below ; then he jerked the ship upward and reached for his microphone . Have located ' bandit ' car , heading up Mint Canyon ! " On the skyline , a dozen moving specks veered , fell in line behind the leader , and headed back toward distant Los Angeles . Up nosed a fat dirigible , spotted the fleeing automobile , and paused , motionless , over the canyon . Five miles away , a cruising radio car caught the message from the sky , swung , and headed back toward the mountains . Another , farther up the canyon , drew to the side of the road and two deputies stepped out . As the " bandit " car came careening around the corner , the uniformed deputy behind its wheel saw his fellow officers and pulled up to a screeching stop . The mimic man hunt was over , the " desperadoes " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its worth . Four times a year , practice maneuvers like these train members of the West 's first flying posse for their job . Sixty volunteer airmen ? Army , Navy , Coast Guard , and civilian flyers , test pilots , and movie stunt men ? now aid the sheriff of Los Angeles County in patrolling an area almost as large as Connecticut , nearly half of it mountain and desert . Theoretical flight problems like the Navy " war games " give them practice in spotting lost airplanes , " bombing " rescue camps with parachute loads of supplies , or drawing aerial dragnets to capture fleeing criminals . In one such test , a pilot set down his plane in a secluded spot unknown to the others . then radioed a brief message : " I 'm down in the mountains with engine trouble ? come and get me ! " Within twelve minutes , one of the thirtyseven ships that immediately took up the search had located the lost pilot , thirty  | miles away from the starting point . Again , squadron flyers took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major disaster had theoretically wiped out the desert town of Lancaster and that all communication lines were down . A hurriedly formulated flight plan assigned a given patrol area to each pilot . Before dawn , Red Cross workers accompanied by troops of Boy Scouts had driven to four secretly chosen spots where , stretching strips of white cloth upon the around , they spelled out code messages signaling the needs of " refugees . " Within an hour , all four camps had been ' orated , their needs radioed to headquarters ; . and squad cars were speeding to the rescue ith theoretical food , blankets , and even five theoretical ) boats , as requested in a special message designed to test the accuracy of the spotters . The squadron was organized shortly after the Long Beach earthquake of 1933 . At the time of that disaster , a radio-equipped plane flew over the devastated area by moonlight and brought back a clear picture of the acres of ruined buildings , the crowds of refugees , and the rescue activities being carried on under the glare of Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Biscailuz saw the value of such an organization in future emergencies and had Capt . Claude F. Morgan organize a volunteer body like the old-fashioned western posse ? with wings . Membership is by invitation only . The flyers not only serve without pay , but also furnish their own planes , uniforms , and even the gasoline and oil for squadron flights . A supply officer and a ground crew of six manage the equipment ? blankets , message bags , parachutes , and even a wind sock for emergency larding fields . An engineering officer has tools ready to give quick service , and a parachute technician sees that the ' chutes are kept ready for instant use . Lighter-than-air branch of the squadron is the Goodyear airship Volunteer , a 148-foot , five-passenger dirigible piloted by Capt . A. T. Sewell . Because of its ability to hover over dangerous terrain , the blimp usually takes the lead in searches for lost persons . Since it joined the squadron , it has flown over the waters of a near-by bay to locate victims of a fishing-boat explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was discovered clinging to the side of a cliff whence the other had fallen to his death ; dropped 250 pounds of food , including eggs , and oats for  | the donkey , to a rancher stranded by storms in the mountains ; and frequently helped life guards look for the bodies of swimmers or amateur yachtsmen drowned off the beaches . Once the blimp 's pilot sighted a small boat aimlessly adrift , dropped within shouting distance , learned the occupants had been drifting several days without food or water because of engine trouble , and summoned a Coast Guard cutter to the rescue . Another time , he spotted a stolen car and followed it about until police prowl cars could catch up with the fleeing thieves . The flyers help in policing air meets and races , report air traffic violations , watch for stolen planes , investigate air accidents , and occasionally form aerial escorts of honor for visiting dignitaries . Associated with the squadron is the Aerial Nurse Corps of America , with a local unit of forty trained nurses who have flown much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Avion group , comprising young student flyers of sixteen to twenty-one years , whc , volunteer their services when needed . In emergencies , a communication reserve of radix amateurs cooperates with a short-wave network tying ' up with the central transmitter at squadron headquarters . During the disastrous 1938 flood . when hundreds of persons were marooned in the mountains without food . the aerial squadron set up emergency headquarters at Grand Central Airport . One by one , flyers took off under lowering skies to cruise over the flooded countryside on errands of mercy .  | Down through Big Tujunga Canyon , where torrents had ripped out all roads , a man struggled all night through a wilderness of huge bowlders and tangled debris to report that 150 men were isolated in a camp high up in the hills . Flying over the spot , a pilot dropped a streamered canvas message bag bearing a signal code for establishing communication . With sheets laid out upon the ground , the refugees spelled out an appeal for medical supplies . The pilot radioed the message ahead and returned immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parachute to save the lives of a number of pneumonia-stricken refugees . As the scope of the disaster was realized , Navy and Coast Guard cooperation brought more flyers to help . Big Navy bombers droned over the mountains , their bomb racks loaded with five-gallon cans of milk or kerosene attached to parachutes . Half a dozen times daily , Coast Guard amphibians landed on a rainswollen lake behind one of the big dams , bringing food to hundreds of refugees and carrying but injured persons . Over isolated districts the Aero Squadron cruised , flying up narrow canyons in the face of dangerous downdrafts that at times swept planes within fifty feet of the ground . Men signaled to them with sheets , with mirrors , or waved their arms to attract attention . Food by the truckload was rushed to the airport and packed for aerial dispatch . When parachutes were gone , heavy wrappings of blankets cushioned the packages so that all safely reached their destinations . During the nine days after the- flood , the squadron flew hundreds of miles , dropped tons of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plumbing equipment , aiding rescue workers in saving many lives and proving the value of this modern posse with wings . Organized when a disaster pointed out the great potential value of such a group , these flying cops keep their planes and equipment in trim , and themselves ready at all times , to respond to any emergency call .  |
