Long-wave radio signals spray out from the transmitters in undulations from 200 to 25,000 metres in length . They surge through &; around obstacles or up against and down from the ionized Kennelly-heaviside layer of the stratosphere . Short radio waves are not so fluid . Like light waves , which are very much shorter , short radio waves travel in straight lines only . <P> Guglielmi Marconi , father of radio , Roman Senator , the papal marchese who built Vatican City 's radio station , wants to give his good friend the Pope an inviolable means of communication between the Vatican and the remodeled papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo . A system using extremely short radio waves would suffice . Such waves would be relatively cheap to produce . They may be concentrated into a straight , pencil-like beam like a spotlight . But for utility in signaling there must be no obstacle between transmitter and receiver . Hence the transmitter may not be beyond the receiver 's terrestrial horizon . For the straight , light-like short waves can not pass through the bulge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gandolfo is invisible from the Vatican , to oblige the Pope Signer Marconi was obliged to use reflectors or to develop a system of " bending " short waves or somehow shooting them out in a curve . Last week he announced that he had done so , that he and his collaborator , the Marchese Luigi Salari had communicated over a distance of 167 miles on 57-cm. ( less than 2-ft. ) waves . Other radio engineers read his statement with wonder and respect , awaited details .
