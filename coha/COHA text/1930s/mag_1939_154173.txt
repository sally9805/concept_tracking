A prime part of Protestant worship is the singing of " psalms and hymns and spiritual songs . " On any Sunday throughout the U. S. , among the thousands of hymns which drone toward Heaven are sure to be the following well-beloved four : The Church 's One Foundation ; O , Jesus , I Have Promised ; Onward , Christian Soldiers ; Softly Now the Light of Day . Last week Rt . Rev. Benjamin Dunlap Dagwell , chub-cheeked Episcopal Bishop of Oregon , suggested that these old soldiers be given a rest . Said the Bishop , who has sung them since he was a chub-cheeked choirboy : " They are fine hymns and should be used from time to time , but I get tired of singing them about a hundred times a year .
