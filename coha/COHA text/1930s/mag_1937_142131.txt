You Only Live Once ( United Artists ) . With a smuggled automatic in his hand and the prison doctor as hostage , Eddie Taylor ( Henry Fonda ) is on his way out of the death house when his pardon arrives . Prison officials shriek the news at him . Eddie Taylor thinks their statement is a trick for his recapture . Too vivid in his mind is the manner in which he , innocent , was railroaded into his present plight . When the chaplain comes toward him in the fog , anxious to convince him that the pardon is authentic , Eddie shoots him . The chaplain stays on his feet long enough to call , " I 'm not hit . Open the gates . " Thus is the structure-laid for a crescendo seldom excelled in hoodlum stories since Public Enemy . Within its tighter limits You Only Live Once has a signature of realism no less stark and confident than the famed Warner Bros , story . It presents in addition its own modest problem in sociology : has the State a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure put upon him through a miscarriage of justice ? Producer Walter Wanger leaves the conclusion to the audience , having arranged as a tacit persuader Eddie 's doomed and breath-taking flight toward the Canadian border with his wife , Joan ( Sylvia Sidney ) . Justice works out a satisfactory answer , even though the trooper who marks Eddie with the cross hairs of his telescope sight , never pulls the trigger . <P> Proving that cinematic realism is an international language , Director Fritz Lang , an Austrian , gets an extraordinary authenticity of color into his quick episodic treatment of the life and love of Eddie Taylor . Many scenes , momentary on the screen , are hard to forget : the assault of a bank truck on a rainy day by a bandit with tear-gas bombs ; the warped , animal hatred of the crowd watching Eddie being taken from the courtroom ; the bullfrogs croaking in the pond outside the little inn from which , upon his wedding night , he is tossed out for being an ex-convict ; a demonstration of the " electric eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joan talking through the visitors ' grill in the death house ; the preparations for a transfusion to save Eddie 's life so that he can be electrocuted . For such things and the craftsmanship of Screen Writers Gene Towne and Graham Baker , Yon Only Live Once sets a pace which 1937 cops- &-robbers; sagas may find hard to beat .
