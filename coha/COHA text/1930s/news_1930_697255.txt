Doyle admitted yesterday before the Federal grand jury that he had split fees received in 1929 from applicants for permits whom he had represented before the Board of Standards and Appeals . Although he refused to say whether he had split any similar fees in previous years , a communication sent by him to the supervising internal revenue agent on Jan. 8 , 1925 , disclosed that he had done so as far back as 1922 .

When Mr. Tuttle brought Dr. Doyle before Judge Woolsey he said it had been agreed the grand jury need not be present . He handed Judge Woolsey a copy of a transcript of some of Dr. Doyle 's testimony earlier in the day . From his own copy of this grand jury testimony Mr. Tuttle read the following questions which , he said , Dr. Doyle had refused to an-swer : " What were the circumstances which led you to believe in 1925 that there had been a possibility of under payment ( of income taxes by Dr. Doyle ) for the years 1922 , 1923 and 1924 ? " " Would the circumstances involve in any way the splitting of fees ? " " In making the further payment ( in 1925 ) on the years 1922 and 1923 , was there before you the subject matter of splitting fees ? " " In the year 1922 , in connection with your practice in zoning law applications , did you split fees with anybody ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Prior to May 1 ; 1925 , did you ever split a fee you had received for work done before the Board of Standards and Appeals ? " Then came the question which Dr. Doyle had been ordered by the court to answer : " Did you ever split a fee for work done before the Board of Standards and Appeals ?

Well , I should judge it was  --  that is , it looks like my signature . Q. ? Now- let me quote from this letter , which has just been marked in evidence  --  now I call your attention to the schedule A. ? " Schedule A attached to the said letter " ? it reads this way : " Analysis of all income from services , showing each appeal-cases handled and completed during each year .

I say , does n't that refresh your recollection that you were in that year splitting your fees ? A. ? I 'm not positive that this is mine  --  that ' the contents of this is mine  --  I am not positive of that ; I refuse to answer . You did ask me the question  --  did I split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was in compliance with the judge 's statement . Now I want to consult counsel as to the propriety of my answering that ; I do n't know that this is mine , excepting that you have a photostat here with my caption on there . Q. ? Well , suppose I asked you now , inasmuch as you have examined the photostat  --  suppose I asked you now the question which I asked you a little while ago ? whether in 1922 or 1923 you did split your fees ; would your answer be the same as you gave a little while ago  --  that you declined to answer on the ground it would tend to incriminate you ? A. ? Yes , it would be . Rules on 1929 Fees . I " It appears abundantly , " Mr. Tuttle told Judge Woolsey , " that Dr. Doyle , split his fees for a consider , able period prior to 1929 . It is a ' moral certainty that persons he split with did not include such payments in their income tax returns . One of the prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split his fees , when and with whom , so that the ' Government might know to whom to look for a proper return . " " I will rule , " said Judge Woolsey , " that he must answer whether he split any fees in the years prior to 1929 . " " Mr. Tuttle says . " interposed Mr. Talley , " that there is a moral certainty that some persons with whom Dr. Doyle split fees did not include them in their income tax returns . ' There is no evidence of that . That was taken out of the air . All the circumstances here indicate that the District Attorney is trying to get ' something on Dr. Doyle . " Mr. Tuttle contended that the Federal statute of limitations in such cases as this one ran in three years . Mr. Talley interpreted the law otherwise and argued that the statute did not run for six years in such matters . For that reason , he said , Dr. Doyle should not answer questions about his amended income tax re turn of January , 1925 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about his income tax prior to Jan. 1 , 1924 . He asked both sides to submit briefs with respect to their positions about the running of the Federal statute of limitations . These briefs are to be in before noon tomorrow . Judge Woolsey will then rule on the 1925 income tax return . Arguing against his client giving the grand jury any , information about split fees , particularly with respect to the persons with whom he split them , Mr. Talley said : " How easy it would be for him ( Mr. Tuttle ) to spell out a possible conspiracy against the government between this witness and some one with whom he split fees . " Judge Woolsey said  --  the questions with respect to how much had been split and with whom Dr. Doyle had split had not been asked and would be ruled upon as they came up . " I can inform your honor now , " said Mr. Talley , " that counsel will direct the witness to answer the question as to whether he split fees with any member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amell of the Eastern District of New York was in. court ' throughout the argument . - Mayor Not to Act Now . Mayor Walker was asked yesterday if he would suspend further sittings by the Board of Standards and Appeals , which is scheduled to sit today , as a result of the two grand jury investigations under way .

He made it clear that ? he would act promptly if an indictment should be returned . District Attorney Crain said yesterday that Mr. Talley had sent him the names of two banks with which Mr. Doyle had transacted business .
