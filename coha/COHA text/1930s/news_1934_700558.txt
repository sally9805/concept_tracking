txt It was natural that the Senate Banking Committee should be impressed by Mr. UNTERMYER:S emphatic dissent from some of the provisions of the bill to regulate the New York Stock Exchange . It is a measure which he might be pardoned for thinking of as his own foster-child . For many years , in season and out , whether men would hear or forbear , he has advocated some kind of Federal control of the Exchange . When , therefore , he told the committee how faulty he found the bill to be in several particulars , and pointed out clauses which he held ought to be dropped or thoroughly recast , he spoke with what the Banking Committee must have felt to be uncommon authority . In his statement he was severe upon the scheme for marginal requirements in speculative buying , both as regards the amount fixed and the responsibility for fixing it . ' Be also signalized the danger of bringing about a great deflationary movement , if the bill were not amended , and filed his solemn personal objection to different clauses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theory and would be harmful in practice . It would be strange if the Banking Committee had not followed his argument with close attention . Indeed , it was made evident that at least some of his ideas would be embodied in the new draft of the bill . Many others have questioned the wisdom of proceeding with it at present and have urged a number of alterations or amendments if it is to be pressed for passage . The hearings have , in fact , brought out a telling amount of evidence from responsible sources . The case presented by the Stock Exchange itself has been powerful . No denial was made of the need of drastic reforms . The officials of the Exchange itself have undertaken to correct all the abuses upon which they can lay their hands , and have promised to do a thorough piece of house-cleaning if given the opportunity to go ahead with it . An earnest of their good intentions , as well as of the new spirit which animates the Exchange , was given yesterday in the questionnaire sent out for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stocks which had obviously been manipulated with the aid of a newspaper tipster . Members of Congress will say that such steps are taken in fear of pending legislation . But , in fact , this move is only one of many made in recent years by the Stock Exchange to prevent impositions upon the public in the matter of stock selling and making artificial prices . Mr. UNTEamvER earnestly appealed to the Bank* Committee to improve the bill by the changes which he proposed . But he added that , even if his advice were entirely rejected , he hoped the bill . would pass , since its failure at this session of Congress would be " nothing short , of a catastrophe . " Some would locate the catastrophe elsewhere . But no matter what may happen to the bill in Congress , the public has already had the advantage of intelligent debate of a measure which , however well intended , was so drawn as to inspire fear and opposition in legitimate business . The indications are plain that it will have to be thoroughly made over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next session of Congress .
