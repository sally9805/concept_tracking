ON THE LAKE A STORY BY MARGERY SHARP A THE edge of the lake , beside the old boathouse , a party of six persons stood looking at the sky . " It 's going to rain , " said Mrs. Romney . " Darling ! " said Mrs. Romney 's niece reproachfully . For the niece , by name Elizabeth , wanted to go on the water , and the aunt did not . Elizabeth , aged eighteen , was wearing an old tennis-skirt , an old sweater , and out-at-toes sandals . Mrs. Romney , aged thirty , had on a white pique suit , spotlessly clean , which was as obviously a product of Bond Street as the Pekingese under her arm . The third woman , being seventy and a grandmother , was comfortably determined not to leave dry land . " Anyway , Sir William and I will go , " said Elizabeth . But her glance  --  half commanding , half appealing  --  was not met ; Sir William continued to gaze at the sky . He was uneasily conscious that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had no wish to be got alone . He was very fond of Elizabeth , he enjoyed flirting with Mrs. Romney ; but he was perfectly aware that after an hour on the lake with either of them he might very well return to shore no longer an eligible bachelor , but an affianced man . Sir William enjoyed being eligible , he enjoyed being decorously run after by attractive women ; but he knew that he was approaching the dangerous  --  nay , almost fatal  --  age of forty-one . Mrs. Romney knew these things too . She had known Sir William for years ; ruthless in affairs and among men , he was so susceptible to feminine charm that it was a constant source of wonder to her that he had so long escaped matrimony . She could attribute it only to a series of last-minute interruptions . Why , only the night before ( thought Mrs. Romney ) , when Elizabeth appeared so suddenly from the rose-garden , had there not been a proposal trembling on his lips ? She could remember his exact words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own : " There ought to be someone to look after you ; I wish you 'd let me ? " And then Elizabeth had appeared , and the moment passed . Probably some Elizabeth or other always did appear , just at the crucial point . . . " If Sir William would like to go ? " began old Mrs. Campbell ; and she looked doubtfully round the group . These people were her guests , and it was therefore her duty to see that they enjoyed themselves ; but already , after only one day , she was a little tired of them . " I 'm getting old , " decided Mrs. Campbell . " Week-ends are too much for me . " But she pulled herself together and said brightly : " There 's such a pretty view ! " " Sir William has too much sense , " said Mrs. Romney , looking across at her niece . " Why do n't you take Peter ? " But the second man , a youngster of twenty , also kept silence . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lovely , is n't it ? " he asked , waving his free hand at the view . Mrs. Romney said nothing . She was very much annoyed : her dress had been twice splashed already , the Pekingese was scrambling all over her white shoes , and she had lost Sir William to her chit of a niece . " I say , you do look rippingl " observed Peter loudly . Simply because it was easier to smile than to frown , Mrs. Romney smiled . " But then you always do , " added the infatuated young man . Seeing that he was encouraged , Mrs. Romney took the trouble to contract her brows . At once his face fell . He stared at her piteously . " I say  --  did you mind my saying that ? " " Saying what ? " asked Mrs. Romney unkindly . If she had been ten years older she might have found his extreme youthfulness touching , or even adorable ; but at thirty she was still too young herself and still too attractive to have any use for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not be bothered to conceal it . " That  --  that you always looked ripping , " stammered Peter . " Not in the least , " said Mrs. Romney with composure . For some minutes he paddled in silence , and Mrs. Romney , always philosophic , began to make the best of a bad job by mentally planning her summer wardrobe . If she went to Scotland , her tweeds would still do : there was a certain cachet about shabby but once-excellent Donegals . But suppose she went yachting ? Immaculate white of course ; but it was no use pretending the new linens did n't crush , because they did . They crushed just like the old linens , and one might as well make up one 's mind to it . " Woolf " thought Mrs. Romney . " There 's always a breeze at sea . . . . " But before she could go farther  --  before she had even touched on the vexed ' question of shorts ? Peter began again . " I say  --  have I offended you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned back and closed her eyes . Half-paralyzed with despair , the young man , nevertheless , saw and seized his chance . The Pekingese lay unwatched . Peter put out a hand , in what he hoped was a friendly and unsuspicious gesture , and reached for the silky scruff . But Pekingese are intelligent , and as the hand descended the animal hastily backed against its mistress 's ankles . Mrs. Romney at once opened her eyes and ran a hand over her stockings . " Laddered , " she said grimly . " I 'm awfully sorry , " said Peter . " And it 's going to rain , " added Mrs. Romney . " We 'd better turn back . " They turned . It was obvious even to Peter that this was no moment for a proposal ; but his chances were so rare , and his emotions so overwhelming , that he flung prudence to the winds . He cleared his throat , and the ghost of Mr. Coles prompted him . " Celia , " he mumbled , " you must have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Romney . The ghost of Mr. Coles prompted no more : it evidently recognized the case as hopeless . " There , " added Mrs. Romney , in a tone of exaggerated interest , " is Joanna . " She had half turned , to watch the Rob Roy coming round the island 's point : made desperate by unkindness , staking all on a last throw , Peter seized the dog by the middle and at the same time crying " Hi , Changl " dropped it quietly overboard . " Chang ! " echoed Mrs. Romney . " It 's all right , " cried Peter heroically . " I 'll get him . " He stood up , prepared to leap ; but it is harder than one anticipates to leap recklessly from a small canoe . The craft tipped and swayed ; a teacupful of water landed in Mrs. Romney 's lap . Meanwhile the Pekingese , after the first splashings of dismay , was striking out steadily for the island . But the distance , in pro-He was , in all probability , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he gently swung the punt round and headed for open water . " Are n't we going to land ? " asked Elizabeth . " Do you want to ? You 'd get your feet wet . " She thrust out a strong brown foot in a strong brown sandal . Her whole body was as strong as a young tree . " You 're very beautiful , " said Sir William abruptly . At once she was quite still . Not an eyelash flickered . She sat perfectly still , waiting . " Besides , " added Sir William , leaping for safety , " it 's going to rain . " The stillness relaxed . Elizabeth shrugged contemptuously . " Oh , rain ! " she said . " 1 do n't mind getting wet . " " But I do , " said Sir William . " If I get wet I get rheumatism . You forget I 'm old enough to be your father . " Elizabeth stared . " But I am ! " insisted Sir William heroically . " How old are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stared still , but he could see that instead of being shocked or dismayed , the child was simply thrilled . She evidently considered forty-one to be of all ages the most romantic and admirable ; and in spite of all his resolutions , Sir William felt himself weakening . " I do n't like boys , " said Elizabeth . " Not even young Peter ? " asked Sir William . Elizabeth wrinkled her nose . She seemed to be entirely without the instinct of coquetry . " What a generation it is ! " thought Sir William ; and he glanced , with a sort of affectionate horror , at his companion 's attire . The sandals , the skirt , the thick sweater  --  all were shabby to the point of dilapidation : you had to be eighteen to carry off an outfit like that ! " Eighteen ! " thought Sir William : a romantic age , an admirable age ! Perfect health , the intelligence undulled , the senses untouched ! And the thoughtcrossed his mind that since he would almost certainly marry some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a thought by no means unfamiliar ; in the presence of any moderately attractive woman he had always an impulse to take the plunge and secure her , lest worse should befall . Only the night before he had nearly proposed to Mrs. Romney ; he had been practically convinced that what he needed was a woman of the world . Now , looking at Elizabeth , he wondered whether a fresh young girl  --  malleable , unsophisticated  --  would not suit him better . " Darling ! " he said experimentally . Her answering look was as unsophisticated as he could desire . She glowed like ? like a sunbeam . And a wave of sentiment rose in Sir William 's breast . That ? that was the look he wanted ! Not the swift , provocative glance of Mrs. Romney , not the calm , level gaze of women his own age , but a genuine outpouring of  --  well , of soul . " Soul ! " thought Sir William ; quite forgetful of the times when with equal fervor he had thought either " Intelligence ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth again and saw that her lips were slightly parted : if it had n't been for the punt-pole he would have leaned forward and kissed her , and then proposed on the spot . And after all , what was a punt-pole , to stand between him and happiness ? For happiness he was now convinced it would be : after all these years he had at last found what he really wanted . Sir William drew the pole in and laid it carefully along the punt . It was just at this moment that Joanna , in the Rob Roy , completed the same action . For she , like Sir William , had found what she wanted : not a yard away , half under the surface , floated the missing craft Bluebell . She shipped her paddle and reached impetuously towards it . " Elizabeth ! " murmured Sir ' William . There was a shout , a splash ; Joanna had tipped over her canoe and was struggling in the lake . " Can she swim ? " demanded Sir William .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
