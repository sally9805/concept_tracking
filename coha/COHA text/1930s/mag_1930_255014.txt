Although neither James Slattery nor Lou Scozza , two Buffalo , N. Y. fighters , has ever been light heavyweight champion of the world , the New York State Boxing Commission decided for some reason that these two were meeting last week for the light heavyweight championship . The Commission stipulated , however , that whoever won could be sure of being champion for only 60 days , since within that time he must fight Maxie Rosenbloom , rated as the best light heavyweight of all . For eight rounds stubby Scozza , a swinger , plunged after dancing Slattery , received a hearty cuffing . In the next four rounds Slattery got tired . In the 13th , a wild spray of punches suddenly erupted from Scozza . He dazed Slattery , knocked him against the ropes , was about to knock him out when the bell rang . Glassy-eyed but courageous , with his last energy forcing his wobbling legs to dance once more , Slattery jabbed and countered in the 15th as he had in the early rounds , won the decision .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
