Track , like crew , is a sport in which effort never ceases . When winter comes , trackmen pull on flannel drawers , pound away on wooden tracks , move inside to practice only when snow covers the boards . Last week the pick of U. S. runners , hurlers and jumpers , including 18 world-record holders and 14 onetime Olympic team members , crammed into Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden to test their training . The National Amateur Athletic Union championships , always a climax to the indoor season , this year took on added significance . Many a youngster decided to show the 100-odd , owl-faced , stiff-shirted officials that he , as well as the old standbys , deserved a trip to Berlin for the summer Olympics . <P> Because it was thought dangerous to have 35-lb. weights flying promiscuously around the small Garden enclosure , officials started the meet in a Manhattan armory . There a newcomer to the meet named Irving Folwartshny set a new world record of 58 ft. 1 in . To track addicts this was of small importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winner fell almost 18 in. short of the record , the 1,500-metre walk in which it was so difficult to tell whether the contestants were walking or running that the judges disqualified the first two finishers for safety 's sake . They were only slightly more interested when Dimi Zaitz , whose prodigious love for bananas is supposed to account for his strength , out-shotputted Champion Jack Torrance ; when bespectacled Chuck Hornbostel won the 1,000-metre run . <P> Judiciously they saved their enthusiasm for the 1,500-metre run ( 120 yd. short of a mile ) , the contest between longtime Rivals Gene Venzke and Glenn Cunningham . Since he became the No. 1 sensation of the 1932 indoor season , Venzke , still a University of Pennsylvania undergraduate at 27 , has , for the most part , played third fiddle to Bill Bonthron and Cunningham , has strangely lost none of his popularity with the crowd . Bonthron , now married , has retired until the third Princeton Invitation Meet in June. * Joe Mangan , one-time Cornell miler who defeated Cunningham last month , was recovering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd watched Venzke dodge Cunningham 's heels . On the last straightaway , with 40 yd. to go , Venzke unleashed a spurt , split the tape 6 ft. in front . To Cunningham went the credit of setting so fast a pace that the winner set a new world record : 3 min. 49.9 sec . In the final track event a hawk-nosed , granite-jawed Syracuse junior , Edward ( " Obie " ) O'Brien , furnished another thrill . When he went to Syracuse , he was a sprinter . Coach Tom Keane , developer of many a sterling quarter-miler , drew O'Brien aside , told him to forget sprinting , promised him instead the Olympic quarter-mile title in 1936 . A narrow-shouldered runner whose slim legs give no clue to the drive they possess , O'Brien broke ahead of the pack at the start last week , stayed there , sprinted at the end to set a world record for the 600 metres : 1 min. 21 sec . Faithful addicts stayed to the end to see a new high in the high jump , 6 ft. 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold its own in Berlin this summer .
