The British Government last week edged one short step forward to the adoption of the dread Continental system of universal conscription of men for military training . In the House of Commons Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain announced plans for another attempt to increase Britain 's armed forces by voluntary enrollment . Although the Prime Minister said that " we have not by any means yet exhausted what can be done by voluntary service , " the House and the nation had the impression the failure of this scheme ( plus another Adolf Hitler coup ) would probably mean full conscription at last . <P> The Government 's new plan is to increase the strength of the forces of the field Territorials , the British citizen Army ( much like the U. S. National Guard ) , from 130,000 to 340,000 . Together with the regular Army , which is expected soon to reach 250,000 , this will mean that Britain 's land forces trained and equipped for Continental service will number some 600,000 men . Instead of 19 divisions that will be ready for immediate service in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 . The anti-aircraft Territorials will be upped to 100,000 men and 10,000 will be on coast defense duty . Together with 150,000 men in the Navy and 118,000 in the Air Force , not to mention the 60,000 British troops in India and Burma , Britain 's trained fighting men will be well nigh 1,200,000-quite a respectable figure for a non-conscript country . <P> France started the policy of conscription in 1798 in the aftermath of the Revolution . Oddly enough , it was the revolutionary cry of equality-even equality in the matter of dying for one 's country-which replaced the professional soldier with the soldier drawn from public lists . Napoleon Bonaparte , " Son of the Revolution , " believed that " God marches with the biggest battalions " ; in 1813 , at the zenith of his success , he commanded a conscripted army of 1,140,000 men . In the wake of Napoleonic conquests most countries of Europe adopted conscription until , in the World War , some 50,000,000 men were compulsorily drafted into service . <P> Protected by her insularity and guarded by a second-to-none Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no drafts during the Napoleonic campaigns , the Crimean War or the Boer War . Only in 1916 , nearly two years after the World War began , was the first British draft made . <P> Universal conscription had its genesis not only in the French Revolution but in the cheap rifle , which could be produced by the millions . With more expensive automatic rifles , machine guns , tanks and airplanes threatening to make the rifle obsolete , many a military theorist ( and especially British theorists ) has held that the days of large armies are over , that henceforth wars will again be fought by small groups of professionals trained especially to handle war 's complicated machines . According to this theory , the draft would largely be confined to industrial workers conscripted to produce the machines . Until only a month ago Britain 's idea of help to France in case of war was that of furnishing a few highly mechanized divisions and her Air Force .                  @ @ @
