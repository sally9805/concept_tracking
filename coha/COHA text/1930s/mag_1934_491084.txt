T HIS is the point where this yarn of mine has to turn into a success story  --  temporarily . There 's no help for it . The facts are all against me . I 've never been much impressed by statistics or much of a hand at figuring. but even I can add up and find that there were seven productions during Liebler &-; Co. ' s first . ten years which turned in a total net profit of almost three million dollars among them . And that 's just skimming off the cream . Plenty of other plays did more than very well by us . Naturally , we did n't hit a home run every time we came to bat  --  a producer who could do that would he burned for a witch , and deserve it , if he did n't die of boredom first  --  but we made a lot more than enough to pay for our mistakes , which is by way of being a miracle in the theater . Viola Allen 's Magic Hatpin TT WAS like what happened when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races to celebrate her glorious success in The Christian . She usually lived the life of a recluse , so it was a big occasion for her . I impressed it on her that she had to bet to get into the spirit of the thing , and initiated her into the **36;574;TOOLONG system that was invented for beginners  --  matter of fact , for veterans it 's as good a system as any . Well , she closed them and jabbed . Three times in a row she jabbed the winner , and when the big race came along  --  the Suburban Handicap  --  I made her play Imp , because he was a horse from my home town . So she played Imp to win and then jabbed twice more and picked the horses that ran second and third to Imp . Racing seemed to impress her  --  not so long afterward she married Peter Duryea , a famous horse breeder . Naturally , this being pitehforked into the role of **27;612;TOOLONG gave ine my worst attack of the old complaint  --  chronic this time , since it lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , back home in Chillicothe our parents used to call it . swelled head and whale us for it . The symptoms are unmistakable : Ingrowing optimism first and then a steady tightening of the hatband . When they began telling me that Liebler &; Co. would go on forever , I rather agreed with them . After all , I had no idea what had started the ball rolling  --  I have n't yet  --  so there was no reason to imagine anything that was ever going to stop us . Come to think of it , it did take the European War to put a spoke in ourwheel , and that little affair played hob with alot of things bigger than Liebler &; Co. was , even in our astonished eyes . With the profits from The Christian coming in so fast they ran out over the window sills , I was loaded for bear . You may have noticed already that I was n't shy about tackling celebrities , even when I had only cheek to recommend me , and now , with what looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went gunning for the best . Stars ? James O'Neill , not only for old times ' sake , but because he was one of the grandest figures in the theater . Viola Allen was practically a member of the firm . And then a contract with lovely Eleanor Robson , the completely fascinating young person who made so many plays , notably Merely Mary Ann and Salomy Jane , such particularly bright stars in our crown , and gave us the loveliest Juliet of her time . Authors ? Weil , Israel Zangwill did n't know yet that he was going to dramatize his great novel , Children of the Ghetto , for us . I was told on all sides that Rudyard Kipling could not be persuaded to try a play  --  but Mr. Kipling would be persuaded or I 'd know the reason why . The receipts from The Christian would get us whatever we wanted from Hall Caine . Barrie , Sardou , Pinero , Henry Arthur Jones , Louis N. Parker  --  why not ? Directors ? When James A. Herne , then the best director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the . Ghetto for less than five hundred a week , we coughed up like little men . During the last few years any little pipsqueak director expected that much , but in 1900 it was unheard of . What did we care ? We were doing things in style at last . If Shakspere and Mrs. Siddons had still been alive , I 'd have cabled them to meet . me and talk over a play I had in mind . For instance , the way we put In the Palace of the King together . It looked for a while as if The Christian was going on forever , but eventually we 'd want something sure-fire for Miss Allen to follow it with  --  something so spectacular  --  and expensive , of course -- that it could n't miss . We went about it like ordering a three-hundred-foot yacht . A little hasty research developed that , for sheer lavishness of background , the period of the free-for-all spending match at the Field of the Cloth of Gold was about the world 's record and it also gave us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little thought  --  very little  --  suggested that the great romancer , F. Marion Crawford , was the man to do that background justice . I wrote Crawford  --  carefully inclosing a few figures about the receipts of The Christian  --  and went to see him in Italy , because his bad health made it impossible for him to travel , and he wrote us the tale that we wanted . Did it work ? Certainly ? In the Palace of the King was our second huge success . I was pretty sulky about having to go abroad . The American theater could hardly afford to dispense with me for even a month or two ; and besides , I thought the good old U. S. A. was good enough for me . I already considered myself a well-traveled young man  --  as tramp printer and advance agent I must have covered fifty thousand miles in ten years  --  but they were all American miles . On the way over , none of this tramping the deck and admiring the ocean for me . The boat was the old Etruria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rails under all the way from Sandy Hook to , Queenstown . I stayed below and dodged seasickness and boredom by playing poker . One of my opponents was l3etcha Million Gates ' son Charley , who seemed determined to prove that he was his father 's offspring . When anybody raised a dollar , Charley always came hack with five  --  in a dollar-limit game  --  and was perfectly willing to be called for one dollar . London looked interesting but unimpressive , Paris was a little exciting  --  but I never for a. moment . forgot that I was a busy man traveling on tremendously important business . See Florence , and Fall In Love I WAS Italy that got me  --  Italy and Crawford 1 between them . He came north as far as Florence to meet me , and by the time he 'd got done showing me round as only he could , I was head over heels in love with the place . From then on , whenever possible , I headed for Italy and settled down till something dragged me away  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1599 , I was there practically every year till the World War and every year afterward till the world began calling its nice new panic " the depression . " It was a trip to Italy that started me on my career of pioneer motoring , in the course of which some fellow madmen and myself were the first people to take an automobile thrOugh Spain and the Balkans and Scandinavia . But never mind that just now . I suppose Italy hit me so hard because it looked more romantic to my young eyes than either Chillicothe or Broadway . Not that Chillicothe was n't a nice place , too , or that the Broadway I knew was anything like the combination midway and lunch counter it is now , but  --  well , if you 've ever been in Italy with the most charming host in the world , you know what I mean , and if you have n't , you do n't . Why , I even learned to smoke Tuscan cigars , which is a feat  --  though it 's even more of a feat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cheap , that tastes best after you 've burned a fourth of it off in a candle flame . Once you learn not . to let them bluff you , they make any other cigar taste like milk and water . The first time I fired one up in Crawford 's villa at Sorrento  --  that was another place to make your heart . miss a heat the first time you saw it  --  he took me politely by the arm and led me into the garden , intimating that he 'd be charmed to sit with me in the open air until I 'd quite finished it . You did n't realize just how wonderful a person F. Marion Crawford was till you knew how sick he was . His battle with his incurable illness reminds me of what you read about Robert Louis Stevenson . He was a terrific and a conscientious worker and yet all the time he was on the verge of collapse . A few years later , when he wrote The White Sister for us , he had grown so weak that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he had to be carried up in a chair by six of the sailors off his sailing yacht . And yet when In the Palace of the King was n't shaping up right , be got on a boat , sick as he was , and name to America to see us through with it .. For six weeks he trouped with the company on its preliminary tour , spending his days in the theater and his nights on the train or slaving over the script .. That kind of ordeal is hard enough on healthy playwrights who are hardened to it . Haw he ever survived was a standing mystery . The Incomparable Duse AND then Italy to me was always the place where I met the elder Salvini and Novelli and Masa cagni  --  and Eleonora Dose . She was farthest north . Only Bernhardt and Rejane , in my opinion , can be mentioned in the same breath with her . No one who saw her only on her fatal tour of America a few years ago has any notion of what . the theater 's greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could express anything without the help of speech . When I called to discuss a possible contract . with her at 0 abriele cl'Annenzio 's villa  --  that was funny , too ; me , fresh from my shoestring days , sitting in a sumptuous villa at Settignano , having an interview with Duse  --  her agent , a good American from Baltimore , by the name of Smith , got into difficulties with his interpreting . At that period I did n't know enough Italian or French either to do more than buy a box of matches . Duse saw things were going wrong . She gently pushed Smith into his chair and turned to me to explain , in slow , musical Italian , her very complicated reasons for playing only four times a week . And so help me , I understood down to the last . detail . I 'd have been an idiot not to , so cleat and living and expressive was her pantomime as she spoke . Things did n't go so smoothly with d'Anntitizio , who immediately began insisting on coming along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repertory of his plays . America was anything but frieedly toward him just then , and trying to explain to him through an interpreter that his absence . world be more appreciated than his presence was one of the toughest assignments I ever tackled . Anyway , he stopped insisting after while , although I do n't think he ever quite believed such a thing was possible , and a year and a half later I met . Madame Duse at the dock in New York . As I escorted her off the pier a customs inspector stepped up to look into her hand bag . I glared at him and said : " This is Signora Eleonora Duse . " He took off his hat . and bowed low and said : " Signora Dose , pass on . " It was n't stiff or put on at all . That was the natural way to act in her presence . She had courage too  --  the same kind as Craw-ford 's . She showed that in the killing ordeal of her last tour , and she certainly showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammerstein 's Victoria , when Hammerstein was in the middle of building his new Manhattan Opera House . Oscar was always short of cash  --  he could have built the Empire State Building on the change of a dollar  --  and he always cleaned out the till of the Victoria as soon as there were a few dollars accumulated there and then paid us off in lump sums at the end of the week . Saturday matinee we 'd sold out , with a couple of hundred staudees , and the box office was empty as an old hat  --  every cent gone to buy concrete or meet pay rolls on the new Opera House . And at that . point Duse 's maid appeared  --  Madame was desperately ill , probably unable to appear . If she did n't , it was up to us to give the customers their money back  --  some four thousand nine hundred dollars  --  and at that time of day not a hank was open . The standees were all Italians up from the East Side to spend a lot more than they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be just plain suicide to try giving them rain cheeks . Oscar would have another building job on his hands if that gang got sore and started taking it out on his theater . But Duse played . She wouldn't-give up while she could stand and see . She went through the whole bill without a quiver , while we stood in the hack of the house and prayed . She dropped in a dead faint the instant the curtain fell . Whew ! What a woman ! Twenty years later , when she was an old , old lady , hardly able to play twice a week , but killing herself trying to , America flocked to see her . Our public did n't do very well by her when she wa-s in her prime . But in these times people are too affected to admit that a full evening of a language they do n't understand will probably bore them . With Duse on the stage , of course , it could n't possibly have bored them . But they did n't know that , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1902 people knew what . they wanted . Sometimes they knew it a little too well . For instil:flee , When we took our first and only flyer In Browning , special matinees of In a Balcony through the Middle West with Otis Skinner and Mrs. Lemoyne and Eleanor Robsott , It was the heyday of the Browning Clubs , and business was gtand . But next year we sent Mrs. Lemoyne back to the sante places in het hew starring play . The First Duchess of Marlborcffigh , with every expectation that people would still want to see her , and business was terrible . I asked a lady dramatic critic in Columbus just why Mrs. Lemoyne had been so welcome in Browning and so snubbed in something else . " That 's simple , " she says . " They 'd all seen In a Balcony and were afraid they 'd get another dose . " .9 Production That Would n't Behave ANYWAY , we had plenty of money and there was only one Duse and we were proud to bring her over at any price . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was one kind of grand feeling that went with our thundering successes  --  the exultation that came from Booth Tarkington and Harry Leon Wilson 's The Man From Home , and E. M. Royle 's The Squaw Man , and Mrs. Briggs of the Cabbage Patch by Mrs. Rice and Mrs. Meaner  --  splendid plays , grandly played , tremendously profitable , the envy of the whole theatrical world . But there was another kind of pride in battling it out with hard leek for a production that would n't behave . Children of the Ghetto was like that  --  the fact that we had to fight for it like Wild Indians and get licked in the end endeared it to us as nothing else could have . And its history is the complete story of the awful things that can happen in the theater . When we produced Children of the Ghetto , Zangwill and Zangwill 's novel from which it was taken were right in the middle of the public eye , and for additional advertising for something Jewish , the Dreyfus case was just coining to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense spared . James A. Herne to direct it and a magnificent east , Wilton Lackaye , Blanche Bates , Frank Worthing , Mabel Taliaferro , Ada Dwyer and others  --  all of them prominent stars or soon to be so . The yacht races were on  --  Shamrock s attempt to lift the cup  --  and we opened to an audience composed of the whole Social Register plus Sir Thomas Lipton and Lady Cunard for whipped cream . The play was enthusiastically received  --  by the audience , that is  --  and we went to bed assuming cheerily that we had another hit on our hands . But the next morning the newspaper reviewers got in their licks . The trouble was that Zangwill had been lecturing all over the country the year before on The Dranmaas a Fine Art , and giving the press hark from the tomb for catering to the cheap , popular element in the theater . The newspaper boys had all taken it personally  --  guilty conscience maybe  --  and now they had him where they wanted him . They called the play sacrilegious  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest Jew alive  --  he 'd as soon have committed murder as sacrilege . Why , early in the game he said that , since they were telling the Jews it was sacrilegious and the Christians it was a low Baxter Street play , there was n't a chance of profit  --  so , like the considerate gentleman he was , he refused to take any royalties . After four weeks of watching the thing starve to death , I dug farther down into our well-filled pockets and shipped the whole company , barring the supers , over to London . I would n't be surprised if my main motive was to show up the New York critics with a smashing success across the water . It was a complete stab in the dark . When we got aboard the old Teutonic , the most I knew about the English theater was that I 'd had to pay twelve thousand dollars cash in advance to get a house to show in . Winning a Job by a Nose We arrived two days before the opening and I went round to inspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsed already . Lord , what a mess ! My bright young man had hired a bunch of cockneys and made them up to look like Jews  --  which they did n't  --  they looked like Weber and Fields with a dash of Fagin . I dived in among them and started pulling off putty noses . But when I pulled one man 's nose , he said : " Beg pardon , sir , it 's me own nose . " So we kept him and fired the rest , with the stage manager tearing his hair and bleating that we had to open in two days , and then Zangwill and I went down to Petticoat Lane , the London Ghetto , to lay in a supply of the genuine article . There was a dance going on down there . Zangwill went in and introduced himself . Well , he was the greatest Jew in the world just then , so they hauled him up on the platform and had him make a speech . He explained what we were after . When he offered them two shillings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-five real Jews , the roof almost came off . The next morning the stage of the theater and the alley behind it were jammed with the most wonderful collection of types I ever saw  --  all kinds , both sexes , from kids to patriarchs with beards coming down to their waists  --  and not cr  --  pe beards either . They rehearsed like veterans , and after the opening the Lon-doe Times carried an editorial calling the attention of English producers to the wonderful mob in the Ghetto scene . Children of the Ghetto was a triumph in London  --  from Monday to Thursday . I was just about to send the press clippings to the New York critics when  --  this was Boer War time  --  the news came that the Boers had licked the tar out of the British at Spion Kop . Well , the entire London theater went out like a light . Everything closed down  --  and just to make sure , there was a dense black fog that tied up the streets for two days just as if the weather had gone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theSaturday boat hack . Orphan Children of the Ghetto That should have put us down for the count . But still I was n't convinced . It would be tough , booking a tour for the play at home , because its unhappy reputation made managers stay away from it like smallpox . The best I could do at first was a single week at the Grand Opera House in Chicago , and I got that as a personal favor from Harry Hamlin , the manager . And the papers were still yapping on our trail . One of them heralded our arrival in Chicago with something like : THE AWFUL THING TS COMING ! After the opening they were honest enough to admit it was good and we did magnificently for our single week . But then we had to get out to make room for Mrs. Fiske , and so we started wandering wherever we could pick up a booking . We stayed out the season and lost $75,000 . For years I kept framed in my office the review we got from the Birmingham , Alabama , Age-Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to this magnificent play : A play called Children of the Ghetto was given at O'Brien 's Opera House last night . It seems to us a splendid play and interpreted by a brilliant company , but it just wo n't do . Now I ask you , what can you do in the face of a press like that ? Zangwill made it up to us and then some . At Miss Robson 's request , he wrote Merely Mary Ann for us just to recoup our losses  --  it did  --  and besides , it clinched Eleanor Robson 's title to the hall of fame  --  and he gave us The Melting Pot , as well , for Walker Whiteside . There was a lot of satisfaction , although small returns , in tho Mane tour too . That was another case in our prewar career where , without any undeserved accidents , a great star in a repertory of great plays was unsuccessful , flatly because the public was not too proud to stay away from a language it could n't understand . Mane left her mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected way . While she was in New York , James Hazen Hyde , of the Equitable Life Assurance Society , gave a grand ball for her at Sherry 's , a tremendous and lavishly expensive affair that got as much publicity in the papers as a World 's Series . It probably did cost fifty thousand dollars , but . by the time the press got through with the details  --  the numbers of orchestras and the shiploads of vintage champagne and the hothouses of flowers and the nightingales ' tongues on toast at supper  --  it sounded like fifty million , which was , of course , the worst possible publicity for the life-insurance business . If Hyde could afford that kind of splurge  --  well , somebody was being gouged  --  that was the way the public took it . So , in self-defense , all the big life-insurance companies started a thoroughgoing investigation of themselves , at the conclusion of which Hyde went to Europe and never did come back . A thoroughly ridiculous affair , starting solely in the fact that a rich man wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubbed our toes we said it was bad luck and every time we stumbled over a success we said it was good judgment . Maybe it was . Our production of James O'Neill in The Musketeers  --  a lot of The Christian money went into that  --  Wilton Lack-aye and Blanche Bates and Margaret Anglin in the cast  --  didn't. do any too well , because O'Neill lost his voice in the middle of the opening performance . No doubt about that being bad luck . Then we got him into a tremendous and successful revival of our old friend , Monte Cristo , with a huge staircase for him to walk down  --  and that was certainly good judgment , because James O'Neill Could walk down a staircase against any ten men in the world and win hands down . Then Sag Harbor did pretty well  --  anything written by and directed by and acted in by James A. Herne was good judgment . His two young daughters , Chrystal and Julie , were with him  --  and that , by the way , was William Hodge 's first appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers Brothers ' musical comedy , where he had a thirty-five-dollar bit , and nobody could figure out what he wanted of him . And then In the Palace of the King was a buster . Then on the down curve we started dramatizing novels wholesale  --  S. Weir Mitchell 's The Adventures of Francois , with Henry E. Dixey and a trick dog  --  gosh , Dixey was worried about that dog  --  and James Lane Allen 's The Choir Invisible and Judge Robert Grant 's Unleavened Bread  --  all of which gave us a beating . But with bringing Kyrie Bellew back to America . for A Gentleman of France and importing Mrs. Pat Campbell we were under way again . It sounds as if we were still just one jump ahead of the sheriff , but one success paid the bills for four or five flops those days , and for the next fifteen years I forgot what sheriffs looked like . And believe me , there had been a time when I could smell one five miles against the wind . The Real Thing in Temperament Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperamental actress I 'd run into ? one-hundredproof temperament , but so interwoven with a grand sense of humor that you laughed instead of strangling her . Sometimes temperament is another name for a bad disposition , and I have known actors whose temperament came in a pint bottle with a revenue stamp across the top , but in her case it was the real thing . By the same token , she was the best natural press agent in the business . She landed ready to discuss the English theater with the gentlemen of the press , like the intelligent woman she was . But they tackled her with : " Why are you called Mrs. Pat ? " and : " What are your first impressions of New York ? " and such . That was too much for her . She lifted up her lap dog and said : " Ask Pinky . He 's an intelligent ? little fellow . His full name is Pinky Panky Poo , and the King of the Belgians gave him to me . " The next morning she had headlines all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinky were on the editorial pages . To back it up , she was a glorious actress , and her season of repertory , which everybody had said was all too worn out , went so well that , with the exception of Irving and Terry , she was the first English-speaking star to get three dollars a seat . Publicity is queer business , and we did n't always get the breaks . Like the time Richard Mansfield stole the show from Viola Allen when they both arrived on the same boat . We had a grand set of stories for her  --  she was returning with Hall Caine 's new script of The Eternal City , with original music by Mascagni ; she had been granted an interview with the Pope  --  but Mansfield announced simply that in his new production of Julius Ca3sar he was going to play both Brutus and Mark Antony every night . Not that he made good on it , but he did hog the headlines and leave Miss Allen pretty nearly out in the cold . The Tanbark Route to Headlines Still it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell  --  it was about as famous as Anna Held 's milk bath . That again was mostly accident . Hammerstein 's Republic Theater , where she played in New York , was by no means too solidly built , and every time a cable car went by in the street you could n't hear yourself think . A noisy play could survive it . A quiet one could n't . At Mrs. Pat 's first Saturday matinee , all the girls in town came to see her magnificent new clothes . So , out of sheer perversity , she played Beyond Human Power , a very quiet play in which she stayed in bed from beginning to end . You could n't hear anything but the clank and crash of the ears . I went outside , snorting my disgust : Something 's got to be done . We ought to bed the street down with tanbark . " A. Toxen Worm , our press man  --  certainly that was his real name  --  Danish  --  jumped at the idea . But he did n't bother about permission . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explained that Mrs. Campbell was very sensitive to noise . After the street cleaners and the newspapers got through with it , Mrs. Pat had miles of headlines and a few hundred more editorials to hang on her wigwam . She made money  --  about five thousand dollars a week clear profit  --  but it finally wore us down wondering what she was up to next . If she wanted a private car to tour in , wo got her one , the front half for her , rear half for the company . That was all right , but it was n't so good when her personal representative got there first and filled the company 's half with the boatload of 34 ! trunksshe carried . Not that it was n't all good fun among friends  --  but when she sent for me at the end of the season and started telling me where and when she would play next season , I said : But why tell me ? " She said she was legally obligated to let me take up my option on her further services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not taking it up . " " What ? Think of the money you 've made ! " " It 's a lot of money , " says I , " but I 've got my health to consider . " First she stared , and then , like herself and nobody else , she threw back her head and shrieked with laughter . It was utterly impossible to continue a quarrel with a woman like that for any length of time . Incidentally , she brought with her that time a hundreddollar-a-week young actor named George Arliss . Arliss has always maintained that it was one hundred and twenty-five dollars , but I tell him that I paid the bills and am in a position to know . I never took to pipes , but pipe dreams were a habit of mine those days ; and I generally found somebody to turn them into actuality for me . When Arliss and I ran into each other in the old St. Nicholas Hotel in Cincinnati , a few years later , we got to wondering if there was n't a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote it , and Arliss played it , and we made five hundred thousand dollars out of it , and the Lord knows what the movies have made out of it since . And on my third trip to England I pipe-dreamed about meeting all the most brilliant people in England  --  with an eye to business  --  if I had to crash their gates one by one . I did n't have to . A lucky hunch sent me to wonderful Addison Bright , the king of agents . I told him I wanted to meet everybody up to and including the Archangel Gabriel , and he went right out and snared them for me . First to the Garrick Club  --  whom did I meet ? Well , Irving and Beerbohm Tree and Cyril Maude and Forbes-Robertson and a dozen others that you never heard of unless you 're over forty , plus the literary touch in Barrie and Pinero and Jones and Conan Doyle and Anthony Hope , and so forth . Then to my first of Tree 's famous Dome suppers on top of Her Majest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see  --  and there were people like the Terrys and Constance Collier and Marie Tempest and Irene Vanbrugh and Mrs. Tree and Winifred Emery , and so on and so forth again . And then to Mrs. Brown-Potter 's place at Bray for the week-end , the rendezvous of everybody worth seeing . It was just like breakfasting at Delmonieo 's  --  only I 'd ceased being merely a spectator . I left London completely dizzy  --  I mean I was dizzy , not London . Sicking Holmes on Raffles Not so dizzy , however , but what I 'd got E. W. Hornung to let me have his dramatization of Raffles revised with an eye to production . Maybe you never saw Kyrle Bellew play Raffles . Well , I feel sorry for you . And that reminds me of one pipe dream that did n't solidify . It was a pippin too . Hornung , the creator of Raffles , the gentleman thief , was a cousin of Conan Doyle , who , you may have heard , had a gentleman detective named Holmes . My idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sicked Sherlock Holmes on Raffles and let nature take its course . I could get Bellew to do Raffles and Frohman was willing to contribute William Gillette to play Holmes again . But it was the irresistible force tangling up with the immovable object .. Neither author could let his pet character get the worst of it , and , after all , something had to happen or there would n't be any play . I got another bee in my bonnet on that trip that made history . I 'd tackled Barrie , of course , but he was all tied up with Frohman . Still , he was very friendly over luncheon and told me there was an excellent play in a newly published book called Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch . There seemed to be something in what he said  --  a year later we put it on , with 1 ? ladge Carr Cook in the lead , and before we 'd finished with it. , we 'd made just about eight hundred thousand dollars , the most profitable production in Liebler &; Co.

Anyway , it 's hard to believe now that anybody could be as busy and excited as we were all the time , always keeping five or six balls in the air at once and balancing a clothes prop on our chins at the same time just to keep it interesting . One single season would consist of tremendous hits like Merely Mary Ann and Raffles and Mrs. Wiggs  --  there was a year 's hag for you  --  plus all the complications of a successful all-star revival of The Two Orphans  --  plus a repertory tour of Ada Rehan and Otis Skinner ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustin Daly 's death  --  plus Linder Cover , which went bad because Ed Harrigan would n't save it by singing some of the old songs of the Mulligan Guards days  --  plus four or five other things that I 'd rather not mention , although they included the names of authors like Conan Doyle and Clyde Fitch . Compared with that , an advance agent 's life had just been loafing under a tree . Charles Frohman , the one rival that Liebler &; Co. never quite caught lip to , had the right idea . One spring morning I was driving through the Bois with Elisabeth Marbury  --  sunshine , flowers , gay people , Paris at its absolute best . And all I could talk about under those idyllic circumstances was how Frohman was always underfoot  --  every time I took a crack at a likely prospect , Frohman already had him sewed up . Miss Marbury laughed at me for my one-track mind . And then she told me how she 'd been driving with Frohman in just the same place a couple of years before  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if he did n't , think driving in the Bois in the spring was the most satisfactory thing in the world . And he did n't think so . He said the most satisfactory thing he could imagine doing was to open a new play in New York every night during the winter and then open a new play every night in London during the spring . Nowadays the very sound of that speech makes me shudder . But just then , when I was running round like a drop of water on a red-hot stove  --  and loving it  --  it struck me as a. very sensible speech . Maybe it was . I 'm certain of one thing  --  if we were crazy then , what are you going to call the world nowadays ? People in the theater still had the good sense then to treat one another like ladies and gentlemen . We hardly ever signed contracts in dealing with American stars . Just a personal agreement that both parties honored as a matter of course . Why , when we wanted William Faversham for The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Favvy was one of his people . Without reading the script , asking only if it was a good play , he agreed  --  provided he could have a half interest . " But without reading the script ? " I asked . He shrugged his shoulders . " Well , you see , " he said , " I 've been trying to get a success for Faversham for years . He 'll come through sooner or later  --  maybe for you  --  and I 'd hate like the devil to miss being in when it happens . " That was all . The Squaw Man went over splendidly , and we paid Frohman a total of one hundred and seventy thousand dollars for his half interest without any more formalities than that one conversation . C. F. never saw a rehearsal  --  he did n't see the show till months after it had opened  --  and , since we had plenty of money , I had n't even bothered to send round for a check for his half of the investment . Try and imagine that happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shaw Vogue Sometimes , of course , informal arrangements did n't pan out , even with the best intentions on both sides . Bernard Shaw 's idea of a play for Eleanor Robson , for instance , was the result of our starting the Shaw vogue in this country with You Never Can Tell . Previously Richard Itlansfield had been doing pretty well on tour with Arms and the Man and The Devil 's Disciple , but everybody thought it was Mansfield and not the plays that drew the business  --  everybody , that is , except Arnold Daly . Daly and Winchell Smith had been trouping with Candida and eventually came round to us for help , with all their own and their friends ' money gone . Shaw did n't mean much to me those times . But Daly talked my arm off , showered me with Shaw scripts , worked on me till I was groggy . After all , we had plenty of money , so I agreed to promote the best interests of the drama by putting on You Never Can Tell for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown in . Daly protested that You Never Can Tell was the least advanced of Shaw 's plays . I answered that that was undoubtedly why I 'd picked it . But when it began making money hand over fist I began to believe in this fellow Shaw myself . We added special matinees of The Man of Des-this ' and How He Lied to Her Husband  --  which last Shaw wrote specially for Daly to fill out the bill  --  and a good deal later Mrs. Pat in Pygmalion was one of our brightest moments . I did n't meet Shaw until one evening during the triumphant run of Merely Mary Ann in London  --  I 've never seen anything like the way Eleanor Robson conquered England in a single night in that play . She was dining with Ada Dwyer and myself at my hotel when a flunky appeared  --  a Mr. Shaw wanted to see me . When I sent him back to find out Mr. Shaw 's first name , he reappeared with a card : " G. Bernard Shaw . " And here he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd try to become acquainted , since I 'd put on some plays of his . I had n't had the good taste to think of anything so polite . No , he would n't have dinner  --  he could get the proper vegetarian diet only at home  --  hut he 'd sit and talk . He did  --  all through the meal he either talked at Miss Robson or looked at her when he was n't talking . Obviously  --  and quite rightly  --  he thought she was the most charming person he 'd seen in a month of Sundays . After dinner he escorted her to the theater for the evening performance and from then on he and his wife showered her with attentions . In my cheery way I suggested his writing a play for her . Well , he said , maybe he would  --  if he got an idea . First Call for Rehearsal A good while afterward Miss Robson and Merely Mary Ann were out in San Francisco , halfway through a very prosperous tour , when a cable arrived from G. B. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it was Major Barbara , by the way  --  which would be put on shortly for two trial matinees in London , and would I please have her in England in time for rehearsals ? I could have the American rights , but the English rights belonged to Granville Barker . Somewhat flabbergasted , I answered that I could n't very well chuck a highly profitable tour and throw a whole company out of a job so Miss Robson could travel six thousand miles to play two matinees of a script that neither she nor I had ever seen . Well , answered Shaw in effect , that was that and I 'd be sorry . It was years before he got through sending me direct and indirect messages telling me just how much . damage I 'd done Miss Robson 's career in particular and the theater in general by being unreasonable . Of course , most of it was facetious  --  some of it he probably meant . It 's queer how his grand-stand plays have given the dear public a dead-wrong picture of G. B. S. as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genial  --  and I 've known him intimately these twenty-odd years  --  as kindly and lovable a man as I ever met . You know , when you get right down to it , the Irish are the spice of the English-speaking theater . The Jews would run them a close second , but , from the day I was first sent to interview Boueicault down through George M. Cohan 's first radio program a few ( Centinued en Page 38 ) months ago , one of the few things I 've been sure of is that the Irish are natural-born high lights . People like Shaw and Ed Harrigan and . James O'Neill and Laurette Taylor , different as they all are , stick out in your memory like sore thumbs . They certainly stick out in mine , and for the best possible reasons . For instance , it was we who brought the Irish Players to America in 1911 . That was the nearest thing to a civil war we ever got into , the liveliest. and most enjoyable piece of trouble I 'd run into since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish Players were the original company that founded the Abbey Theater in Dublin  --  unquestionably one of the most brilliant troupes in history ; Arthur Sinclair , Sara Allgood , Maire O'Neill and a dozen others almost as fine , taking everybody 's breath with their magnificent performances of plays written expressly for them by Yeats and Synge and Lady Gregory and Lennox Robinson . I was bowled over when I learned that seven hundred and fifty dollars a week would cover the salary guaranty for the whole troupe . Even in pounds that figure would have been shockingly low for this collection of downright geniuses . But they did n't give a hoot about money and they enjoyed their work more than any other actors I ever saw in my life . The Playboy of the Western World Playboy that they professed to find unbecoming . They would n't have shocked your Great-Aunt Belinda , but when the Irish are looking for trouble , any pretext will do . We went right ahead , opening with The Playboy to get the worst over with at once . We could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening if he was on our side , but we did take a few thoughtful precautions . Among the spectators that night in Maxine Elliott 's Theater  --  lucky it was solidly built  --  were fifty plainclothes men turned drama lovers for the evening , and after the audience was in , a. fleet of Black Marias drew up at the curb and unloaded fifty more uniformed policemen to wait outside . The rest of the audience was divided between the cream of the regular first-nighters who were there to see a fine play and a suspicious number of square-jawed lads and colleens in street clothes who did n't look very much at home among the evening gowns and were obviously out to make sure that the fair name of Erin did n't get smirched . The atmosphere in that place was mighty queer  --  the electricity fairly crackled . I stood in the back of the house between Inspector McCluskey , the head of the uniform squad , and Charley Becker  --  yes , that 's the fellow ; not so long afterward he was sitting in the electric chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . The curtain rose and the play proceeded in perfect silence for ten minutes . Then the hissing began  --  gently at first , spreading and growing imperceptibly all over the house until it sounded like millions of them . The actors went right on , cool as cucumbers . Then the first stink bomb and a few vegetables , then a perfect barrage of stink bombs , and along with it yells and whoops and screeches that completely drowned out everything . The actors sized up the situation and stopped the play . One of them went off and got a little spirit lamp and , with all the cheek in the world , the ladies of the cast started making tea and drinking it on the stage , dodging things when necessary and pointing out and expressing their opinions of the bomb throwers in the front rows . That made the patriots still madder , and the house sounded like feeding time at the zoo . It smelled like the zoo too . When Irish Meet Irish Acton Davies , then critic of the Evening Sun , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage  --  as if that was news to us . " Sure it 's an outrage , " says McCluskey . " Will you prefer a charge ? " " Indeed I will , " says Davies . " The follow that threw the first one is sitting right next to me . " " All right , boys , " says McCluskey . " Let ' em have it ! " And the fifty plain-clothes men rose up in their seats and started the finest mass exhibition of the bum 's rush in history . They did n't even bother to open the doors . They pitched those patriots right out through them and they fell into the arms of the uniform squad in the lobby , and inside ten minutes the whole lot of them were in night court telling it to Magistrate Corrigan , who 'd been wait. - ing for them . It was funny  --  the play was written by an Irishman , the company were Irish , the rioters were Irish , the cops were Irish and it was an Irish judge that heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implored J. M. Kerrigan , the stage manager , to keep the curtain up whatever happened . " Now never mind us , " he says . " We 're used to it . " So the curtain stayed up all through the row and the actors had their tea and looked on at the fun as connoisseurs  --  they were seeing a show for a change  --  and then , when the sound of the last wagonload of patriots had died away , we rang down and started all over again . JI Gap In the Brogue The actors had enjoyed it and so had the policemen , and maybe the rioters did too , but the rest of the audience had n't had such a good time , which was a bad idea . During the rest of that week there were minor disturbances on a smaller scale  --  the patriots had even brought along a few Jews to help out  --  they say the judge 's face was a study when he heard a Yiddish accent in the line-up  --  and before long most people were convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worse . Between this and that , these magnificent performers did n't get much of the attention they deserved  --  they got plenty of the other kind . Four separate times I brought them over here  --  the last time was 1927 , with Sean O'Casey 's splendid plays The Plough and the Stars and Juno and the Paycock  --  and every time New York was apathetic . And now here 's the funny thing : Last year a newer , much less able and less experienced Abbey Company came over , and cleaned up during one of the worst seasons Broadway ever saw . There 's no sense in that  --  not even as much as there was in the Duse business . I 've sometimes wondered if it was the Irish Players affair that broke our luck , which we 'd been running pretty hard for thirteen years . Or perhaps it left me with some dents in my invaluable self-confidence that could n't be hammered out . It 's undeniably true that the rest of that season saw us producing eleven successive plays not one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successes in the old grand manner  --  but hell was already beginning to pop in the Balkans , where they were fighting the curtain raiser for the main show that went on two years later . No , I do n't suppose it was luck , good or bad . Things were changing under us anyway , if we 'd only been able to see it . We were n't  --  we were fools enough to feel mildly pleased when some fly-by-night movie company would pay us a few thousand dollars for the rights to a script that we thought was of no more use to us . All of us , authors , actors , managers , did n't realize that the road , which was life and death to the theater as we knew it , was dying of starvation because of our own stupidity , what with No. 4 road companies and big salaries and long runs and a new crop of stars that felt insulted by the notion of one-night stands . We wore all either blind or indifferent or contemptuous toward the movies . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ourselves a time before it struck .
