Few of the great names that once reported football still wrote their bylines on the sports pages last week . In the New York Sun and some 125 other papers Grantland Rice went on murmuring genteel phrases that made football sound as leisurely as golf , as intellectual as chess . But Damon Runyan had become a general columnist and short-story writer ; so had Paul Gallico . Westbrook Pegler discoursed solemnly about politics , as did Heywood Broun . William O'Connell McGeehan and Ring Lardner were dead . <P> Of the few veterans that remained , one of the best-paid and most eccentric was Bill Cunningham , temperamental sports artist of the Boston Post . Not syndicated , he filed a tax return last year on an income of $50,000 . His salary from the Post was $21,000 ; the rest he got from magazine articles , lectures , radio broadcasting and assorted chores . <P> A prodigious worker , Bill Cunningham does his column every day , for Sunday produces six columns on Saturday 's football game . On Sunday too he writes a full-length feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An average day brings him 70 letters , and all of them get answered anywhere from a week to a couple of months later . In his 17 years with the Post he has never taken a vacation . <P> In a profession notorious for the latitude it allows its writers , Bill Cunningham writes absolutely as he pleases . On the day after Britain declared war on Germany he began his column : " There 's blood on the paper this morning . " That day ( as frequently happens ) he had nothing at all to say about sports . " They bury a world when they go to war , " wrote Bill Cunningham , who knew . " Yeah . Walk softly , and with your hat in your hand . " <P> Born in Dallas , Tex. , Bill was captain of a prep-school ( Terrill ) football team that overwhelmed 114-0 another team on which played Bo McMillin and Red Weaver , stars of a great Centre College eleven a few years after ; went on to Dartmouth with a football scholarship , made Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile he had spent two years in France as a first lieutenant of Artillery . <P> Back in Texas , Elijah William Cunningham went to work as a reporter for the Dallas News , at the same time coached Southern Methodist University 's football team . One of his jobs as a reporter was to interview Arctic Explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson . Bill , married only a few days , took his bride along to impress her . But Stefansson was irritable . Said he : " If you are any kind of reporter you wo n't need to take notes . " Thereupon he tore through a staccato monologue , dismissed his interviewer . <P> Hopping mad , Bill Cunningham went back to the office to write a blistering story about Stefansson . On the way , his wife handed him some sheets of paper . It was the interview , taken down in shorthand behind the explorer 's back . Bill had not known his wife could take shorthand , because he had never met her ( except for a few minutes before a football game ) until the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone at her home in Attleboro , Mass. , to transact some other business , ended by asking her to marry him . As for the interview , Stefansson later wrote Bill a letter and said it was the greatest piece of reporting he had ever seen .
