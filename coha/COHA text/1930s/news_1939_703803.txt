txt Although flying conditions in the final days of the month were highly unfavorable. passenger traffic on domestic air lines in January held up remarkably well and was substantially ahead of any similar month on record . Preliminary figures available for the month for a number of the lines , which normally account for around 70% of the total business . show an increase of-approximately 35 , - in revenue passenger miles flown over January of last year . Compared with December 1938 these figures show a decrease of less than 5 , - , Assuming that the rest of the industry fared about as well , these figures indicate that the lines which report to the air transport association flew in January in the neighborhood of 36.000.000 revenue passenger miles as compared with 27.110.800 in January last year and 37 , - 342.924 in December 1938 .

Traffic in this period usually falls off sharply from the summer-fall peak and substantially below the break-even point in revenues . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp as in the past . Estimated January mileage is about 307e below that for October . the beat month last year . A year ago volume was down about 42% from the 1937 peak and two years ago a decline of around 55c ; from the 1936 peak was shown . The better trend shown this winter can be attributed principally to an improved safety record , but somewhat more favorable weather conditions and the upward trend in general business have also been factors . If the seasonal upturn in March is as sharp as usual , it is quit.e possible that the industry as a whole this year will return to a break even basis either late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter , whereas In 1938 it was well in the third quarter before traffic attained profitable levels .
