IF YOU are so foolish as to suppose that gambling goes on in the New York Stock Exchange I venture to refer you to Article XXXVI , Section 4 of the Constitution of the Exchange which forbids gambling within its consecrated precincts . If you imagine , however , that this does not mean what it says , you might try shooting craps on the floor of that august pavilion and behold with what stunning swiftness you would be ejected . To be sure you can take a " flier " in stocks there . But that is not gambling . If you think it is , I refer you to the Presi ? dent of the Stock Exchange himself . He will explain patiently enough that what goes on in his eminently respectable institution is speculation ? something very different from gambling . He will tell you that those who confuse the two terms are " ignorant , unfair , and often ill-tempered . " And he will add that people who condemn speculation " have the illusion that they are engaging in genuine processes of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " after all , the United States was not built by pawnbrokers . " Of course the inference is easy : the country was built by stock brokers and their clients ? those con ? structive ladies and gentlemen who clus ? ter about stock tickers or watch the quotation boards in brokers ' offices . It is very difficult for the average man to believe that there is a very real differ ? ence between a Park Avenue bear opera ? tor selling the market short and a race ? track operator placing his stakes on various race tracks for a day 's shrewd killing . The technic of these two gentle-men is different . The counters used and the instruments of play are not the same . The players are drawn from different social strata ; but certainly the spirit of both games is the same . Fortunately the differences between gambling and speculation have been officially stated for us by Mr. Edward Meeker , the economist of the Stock Ex ? change . They are worth examining . The first difference to be noted is stated thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of prop ? erty , while gambling does not . " It would be interesting to know where this notion regarding gambling comes from . It bears the marks of having been invented for the purposes of this distinc ? tion . I suspect that Mr. Meeker has here confused gambling with betting . Betting , it is true , does not involve a purchase of property . But betting is merely one form of gambling . You can gamble without purchasing property . But you can also engage in forms of gambling which involve the purchase of property . After all , what is meant by the word property ? It is any object of value which a person may lawfully acquire or hold . A certificate of stock in a corpora ? tion is property . To speculate in stocks one must buy a certificate . But a lot ? tery ticket is also property in those countries which legalize lotteries . A lottery ticket may be lawfully acquired and held . It may become the subject of a lawsuit . It is the same form of prop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? tion ? a chose-in-action . And of course to participate in a lottery you buy a lottery ticket . Buying a lottery ticket is certainly gambling . And we find a writer in the Encyclaptedia Britannica defining a lottery as a " speculation to obtain prizes by lot or chance . " It would not be possible for us to live under our oppressive system of morality if it were not mitigated by certain convenient fictions . Thus , for instance , some of us find it necessary at times todo a little stealing ? the theoretically honest methods of acquiring property are so discouragingly slow . But no one wishes to break into a man 's house and sneak away with his purse , or hit him on the head and rifle his pockets . It 's dangerous . It 's messy . It 's disreputable . It 's so obviously stealing . However , we have composed certain little comedies in which we get possession of our victim 's money or chattels by having him voluntarily deliver them to us . We have such clever little farces as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disreputable kinds of oil and min ? ing stocks , harmless concoctions mar ? keted under fanciful trade names guaranteed to make us socially endur ? able , and so on . And in the realm of gambling we have the same delightful fictions . No one , for instance , can con ? ceive of Bishop Cannon , special agent of God in the Virginia territory , squatting on his heels and shooting craps . That would be so openly , so obviously , so frankly gambling . But the conscience and the taste of the good bishop can be lulled to peace by so simple and crude a fiction as is found in the operations of a bucket shop . Some years ago in one of our states race-track gambling was thwarted by a law against book-making . The gam ? blers at once devised a neat little fiction to get round the law . In that state it was lawful to engage in horse racing . The owners could enter their horses and put up entry fees . These entry fees could be pooled and constitute a pursefor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was devised under which if you wished to wager ten dollars on a horse you bad to buy a ten-dollar inter ? est in the horse . And so before each race the horses were offered for sale . The book-makers became dealers in horseflesh . If a hundred men wanted to bet on a given horse they handed over their money to the brokers , who handed them back slips of paper bearing witness that they had bought a certain dollar-interest in the horse . The same thing took place with reference to all the other horses in the race . All the sums bet were then pooled , and this became the purse for which the horses raced . When the horses went to the post each one belonged to a large group of co ? operative horse-owners . When a horse won , his owners of course were entitled to the purse which was then distributed to all of his numerous lucky purchasers . Is it not possible that many stock speculators buy stocks in the spirit in which these race-track habitu ? s bought horses ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain steps not taken in the fictional buying of the bucket shops . In the bucket shops no stock certificates are used . On the stock exchanges certificates are actually employed , and brokers and their clerks run around very busily passing them back and forth in making deliveries . Thus they go to an immense amount of expense and trouble to perfect what is in many cases only a fiction : that they are actually merchandising stocks . Prof. F. W. Taussig , the distinguished economist of Harvard University , ven ? tures a comment upon this matter . The brokers receive from the outsiders orders to buy or sell and by the rules of the exchange are held responsible for the deliv ? ery at a stipulated time . The brokers in turn hold their customers to the same re ? sponsibility . But though thus in form like any other dealings on the better known exchanges ? the cotton and grain exchanges for example ? the immense majority of the transactions have in view no bona fide busi ness . The machinery which has been de ? vised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gambling on a large scale . ? Let us examine another distinction between speculation and gambling of ? fered by Mr. Meeker . " The risks entailed by the speculator arise fundamentally from the risks inherent in the property which he buys or sells , while the risks of gambling are created by the gambler and are based upon future events without any neces ? sary relation to the ownership of the property . " This sounds well enough , but what does it mean ? What is the property involved in the case of speculation ? It is the share of stock . That share of stock is a right to a proportionate share of the assets and earnings of the corpora tion . Now what are the risks of the stockholder ? They are twofold . There are those risks which are inherent in the property itself . The property may prove to be wholly unproductive . Its products may turn out to be unsalable or worthless . A hundred risks threaten the property itself at all times . These risks are inherent in the property But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not inherent in the property . His stock sells for one hundred dollars to-day and for ninety dollars to-morrow . There is a loss of ten dollars , not necessarily because any change has taken place in ' the property , but because a change has taken place in the opinion of the investing public about the property . There are two kinds of profits which arise out of speculation . A buys a piece of land because he believes there is oil in it . He puts up his money and puts down his drills . The oil gushes forth . Here is A 's profit ? something coming directly out of the land itself . B , however , buys another piece of land . He does nothing with the land . He expects it to yield nothing . But he holds on to it . He believes the town will develop in that direction . Hethinks the city will build a great boule ? vard in front of it . All these things come to pass . No change has taken place in the property itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that land has been created by forces wholly extraneous to it . B will get his profit not from anything which comes out of the land but from a pur ? chaser who will buy it at a higher price because he wants it more than B does . It is possible to see in a speculative venture risks inherent in the property itself . But there are ass ' also risks which have nothing to do with the property and which grow out of a number of factors wholly unconnected with it . It is not true to say that the risks of gambling are necessarily created by the gambler . He may merely choose his risk . He does create the risk when he throws a nickel into the air and bets it will come down face up . He sets in motion an operation the essence of which is its uncertainty . He could lay the nickel down head up or tail up as he chooses . But he chooses to throw it up in order to introduce into the act the element of chance . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk when he bets on the time made by a locomotive or on the result of an election . The risks are already there . He merely chooses the risk with which he will trail , just as a speculator in stocks chooses the risks upon which he stakes his money . One may buy property in the hope that it will produce double its value . Another buys in the hope that the number of people who want it will double . The third distinction is somewhat amusing . " The speculator 's buying or selling operations , " says Mr. Meeker , " affect the forces of supply and demand and tend to bring about the very change in price for which he hopes , while the bets placed by the gambler have no effect whatsoever in determining the actual outcome of the fortuitous events upon which he stakes his money . In other words , a speculator who purchases one hundred shares of Northern Pacific because he anticipates a rise in its price assists by this very purchase in bringing about the rising market for which he hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rain next Thursday or that Yale will win the Harvard football game exerts absolutely no effect upon atmospheric conditions and in no way strengthens the sinews of the team of his preference . " Gambling is by no means the simple thing that Mr. Meeker envisions it to be . A bet on the state of the weather next week is a very simple form of gambling . But has he ever heard of that popular pastime known as draw poker ? To be sure , the buying or selling of Northern Pacific stock may conceivably result in increasing or decreasing the demand for that stock in the market and thus bring about a change in the price . But what about the skillful betting of an astute poker player ? Surely Mr. Meeker will con ? cede that a well-timed raise will have an instantaneous effect upon the demand for further participation in the game . Theoretically the best hand wins . But a player with an inferior hand may bring about a profitable stroke by skill ? ful tactics . It must be conceded that the players ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome of the hand , though there are other factors to be considered , as there are also other factors to be considered in the case of speculation . A bet on a football game may not strengthen the sinews of the team , but a bet on a busted flush at the right moment may induce a gentle ? man with two pairs to lay down and leave the field . Here is the final difference . " In gambling transactions , the winner makes what the loser loses . But in specula ? tion , in the alternate rise and fall of the market , there are occasions where practically everyone profits and where practically everyone incurs a loss . " Professor Emery of Columbia Uni versity , who originated the definition of these differences , undertakes to illus ? trate this point . " A dealer in wheat , " he suggests , " may buy of a farmer and sell to a speculator , and the wheat he sold at a constantly rising price through a line of speculators till bought by a miller for grinding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miller loses by the transaction , which is not speculative on their part , yet each speculator wins . " It is amazing that an economist should leave out of his reckoning so many factors . Where two men bet , it is very easy to locate the gain and the loss . However Professor Emery makes the mistake of supposing that in specula ? tion it is a game of only two persons ? the buyer playing against the seller . But this is not so . It is a game in which a vast number of people participate , using their stocks or their grain as counters . Professor Emery 's illustra ? tion is an excellent one to bring out this point and to reveal the further point that a large number of persons are drawn into the game of speculation who hardly realize it , who have no wish to be in it , and whose chief part is in cashing the counters received from the more active players . Professor Emery arbitrarily removes the farmer and the miller from the speculative chain . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , engaged in important productive enterprises , are necessarily drawn into the game and , what is more , the public too is forced in whether it knows it or wishes it . The ' price paid by the miller is the highest of all , we are told . It is he who pays the profit which is distributed among all the preceding buyers and sellers . Their gains have come out of his pocket . It is now up to him to get them back , and this he can do only by levying upon those to whom he sells his flour . Up to the time he sells the flour he is " carrying the bag . " When he sells the flour he can pass part of the loss on to the public . If he does , the public pays the winnings of the speculator . Otherwise the miller pays them . Not infrequently the miller and the public divide them . What , then , is the difference between speculation and gambling , if there is a difference ? My own view is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them is gambling and the other is not . In its narrowest sense gambling is the staking of money upon a game of chance . It is clearly gambling to bet upon the result of a throw of dice . But no one will deny that it is also gambling to bet upon the result of a game of billiards , which is a game of skill . Indeed , no one will insist that the wagering must be upon a game at all . It will be admitted that it is gambling to bet upon the result of an election . We may say , then , that gambling is staking money upon the risk of some event . There must be a risk involved . There must be a putting up of money or other object of value upon the risk . A farmer who plants his seed takes a risk . His hoped-for crop is subject to the hazard of innumerable favorable and unfavor ? able factors . He must put up money and he must assume a risk . Is he gambling ? I am disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he puts his money not into the risk , but into an enterprise in which the risk is merely an incident . The gambler puts his money primarily upon the risk . In the case of the farmer the risk is an incident . In the case of the gambler the risk is the essential factor in the enterprise . That is why I define gambling as staking money upon the rick of a certain event . Now for speculation . It too consists in putting up money where uncertainties are involved . One man buys a share of stock . He puts his money into an enterprise . He does so because he has faith in the futurepossibilities of growth of that enter ? prise . He believes it will expand , pay good profits , enlarge its holdings , and be worth a good deal of money . He looks for earnings ? not necessarily in divi ? dends but in increased values . He is a speculator . But he is not a gambler . He hopes to get his reward from the en ? terprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incident . Another man buys a share of stock . He is not interested in the industry . He believes that in a week or month or two there will be a sudden demand for that stock because of the happening of some future event . He plans to sell when the demand grows . He is interested pri ? marily in the risk . He stakes his money upon this risk , not upon the basic en ? terprise . He is gambling . And he is gambling whether he buys on margin or not . The use of the margin merely intensifies the gambling character of the transaction by increasing the risk . It serves also as an evidence of the real character of the transaction . I think it must be conceded that , how ? ever we name them , the great bulk of the transactions on the stock exchange falls into this latter class and that , there ? fore , the bulk of transactions on the stock exchange is gambling . The defenders of the exchange give the whole game away when they try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserting that it takes over the risk-bearing functions of busi ? ness . " A special class of speculators , " says Mr. Meeker , has been created who make it their business to assume the risks of enterprise for a possible profit . " In other words it is argued that there are certain risks in business which the business man ought not to be forced to assume . The grain buyer , the grain seller , or the stockholder can get rid of the risks incident to their special busi ? ness by unloading those risks on the ex ? changes . The exchanges and their fol ? lowing of speculators specialize in risks . They are defended on the ground that they take some of the risk out of busi ? ness , but they are supposed to do this by locating the risks in the exchanges and the speculative markets . These mar ? kets , if this defense be sound . are , there ? fore , primarily concerned with the risks and not with the enterprises out of which they grow . That is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down as gambling . There are some very respectable authorities who brand these operations as gambling in spite of the Stock Ex ? change president 's insistence that such persons are moved by ignorance and ill-temper and the illusion that they are going through the processes of thought . Professor Irving Fisher writes : During recent years the general public has been beguiled into the folly of entering the speculative markets , yet the public has no special knowledge of market conditions and their participation is apt to aggravate the inequality in prices . In such cases specu ? lation becomes mere gambling . In fact it is worse than gambling for the evils are more extensive , being shared by the producers and consumers and all who are affected by the price fluctuations thus caused. ? Elemen ? tary Principles of Economics , p. 517 . Professor Edwin R. Seligman of Co ? lumbia speaks of those " individuals who are constantly taking fliers on the ex ? change to gamble in securities or com ? modities as they would at cards " ( Prin ? ciples of Economics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " They virtually bet on the future price of commodities and gamble about it as men gamble at cards or horse races . " It is important that these transactions should be called by their right names . Before we can decide whether the opera ? tions on the exchanges are good or bad , useful or not , we ought to be sure that we understand their true nature . There has been a very extensive propaganda of recent years to throw a halo of respect ? ability around this practice of gambling in stocks and to get the performance called by a respectable name . I think it important that the public should under ? stand precisely what it is doing when it goes into the stock market . Following the disastrous October break on the New York Exchange , we beheld newspapers , the Federal Reserve Board , banks , financial experts , and government departments all vying with one another in the most elaborate and determined effort to summon the public hack into the market in which it had been so thor ? oughly stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to go so far if the public had clearly un ? derstood that the feast to which invita ? tions were being so vigorously pressed was in large degree a great gambling affair . I have not gone into this matter to condemn stock-market speculation . I see no inherent immorality in gambling . I have no objection to gambling . I rather like the philosophy of some of the Roman Catholic moralists . They insist that gambling is ethically defensible as long as it conforms to four conditions : 1 . The one who gambles must be able to do so without causing injury to an ? other . Thus an agent who gambles with the funds of his principal or a father who imperils the income needed by his family fails to comply with this condition . Q. The game must be without fraud . The colored gentleman who plays with loaded dice and the race-horse clique which tampers with the horses or " fixes " the race beforehand turn that gamble into something morally indefensible . S. The gambler must act of his own free will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the participants . Thus the bridge expert who snares a raw amateur into a game taints the gamble with the vice of inequality , I think these are excellent tests to determine the character of speculation . The man who brings into a speculative enterprise the funds required for the security of his family ; the stock-market manipulator who produces even small fluctuations in market prices by means of skillfully placed buying and selling orders and adroitly provoked rumors ; the brokers and tipsters and manipula ? tors and propagandists who induce hundreds of thousands of people of small means to go into what they imagine is investment without realizing it is a gamble ; the set-up of a vast game to which millions sit down and in which legions of uninformed amateurs are pitted against a small number of veterans ? all these things taint specula ? tion just as they would any other form of gambling . To what extent arc these vitiating elements found in the markets ? How far are productive enterprises and the public injured by the operations of speculators ? ' What degree of equality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these propositions searchingly examined . They could not be examined without a very full investigation of all the economic aspects of the institution . I do not propose to offer any views on these points . Nor should I be con ? strued as condemning the existence of exchanges because they may be used by great numbers of people for gambling of an indefensible sort . An institution may be necessary and valuable and yet be subject to abuse . I do wish , how ? ever , to call attention to a matter of immediate importance ? the deplorable lack of complete information on the subject to justify anyone in forming an intelligent conclusion as to how much gambling takes place on the exchanges , how much of it is harmless , and how much of it is harmful . I , myself , be ? lieve that the majority of operations on most exchanges are gambling , and that much harm results to many individuals as well as to the general public from part , at least , of this gambling . I also know that the exchanges do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions are , how well the exchanges perform them , whether they actually furnish all the services attributed to them , whether or not there is some better way to achieve the same ends and whether or not these services actually outweigh the harm which re ? sults are matters upon which even ex ? perts may well hesitate to pronounce . I have a reasonable familiarity with most of the literature on the subject , and the thing which impresses me most is the lack of adequate data . The ex ? changes have been criticized by numer ? ous writers who are without special qualifications for understanding them . An immense amount of ignorant and highly emotional denunciation has ema ? nated from outsiders . On the other ha nd , few students of economics who deal with the subject reveal an extensive acquaint ? ance with it . They repeat , copying from one another , a group of stereotyped views on exchanges and speculation . One finds in all the books the same phrases beginning with the famous " corners " of Joseph and Thales and ending with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices , assumption of the risks of business , an open market for the ready sale of securities , providing credit for business and , now , the distribution of securities . Does speculation stabilize prices or unsettle them ? Does it provide credit for business or is it a machine for divert ? ing the profits of business into the hands of promoters and speculators ? Does it really help distribute securities ? Does it assume the risks of business or does it introduce additional risks into busi ? ness ? Indeed , is it essential or even important that the risks of business should be assumed ? Is it important ? in fact is it desirable ? that the market for securities should be made easy and simple ? May it not be that the ease with which the owner of securities can unload his holdings has resulted in the extinction of all the responsibilities of ownership which Professor Ripley charges is one of the crowning weak ? nesses of American business ? I do not believe that we are in a posi ? tion to return an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think we shall be able to do so until a thoroughgoing examination of them has been made by some authority equipped to assemble all the facts and properly appraise them . For some years I have insisted that the subject ought to be studied by a government commission . At this mo ? ment there is a strong and a widespread movement for a congressional investiga ? tion . I think this would be less useful . We have had one such investigation as well as several state legislative investiga ? tions . I have read the testimony in all of them and I have not found very much real light in any of them . A con ? gressional investigation would merely be another show , with the foes of the exchanges hurling abuse at them while their apologists indulged in sneering replies . I urge the naming of a commission which would explore fully and impar ? tially the whole subject of speculation and its agencies . Such a commission should be made up of several economists , several financiers , members who are familiar with the processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman or two . It should be organized under federal authority and provided with all the means necessary to extract information . And its sessions should be private . It should proceed with both eyes on the subject and neither eye on the newspapers . Its methods should he the methods of the student and thinker rather than those of the politician and publicity seeker . Mr. Hoover has gone in for commis ? sions to study our national problems . Here is a problem well worthy of study . Perhaps he may be induced to take a vicarious look into it before he moves from his present quarters .
