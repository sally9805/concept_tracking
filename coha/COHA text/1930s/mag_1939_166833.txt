Ever since the Middle Ages British belfries have pealed messy-sounding medleys of bongs . Less messy than it sounds , this " change-ringing " is done according to strict mathematical schemes , with good old English names like Plain Bob Triples , Grandsire Cinques and Spliced Surprises . A proper piece of change-ringing takes anywhere from six to twelve hours , keeps from five to twelve men busy pulling the bell ropes . Guardians of this little English art are London 's Ancient Society of College Youths . <P> Every year the Society , which has nothing to do with any college and has few members who are not at least middleaged , meets in London to have a good go at the bells of Westminster Abbey and other London belfries . These meetings have been held every year since 1637 . Even London 's great plague of 1665 , and the fire of 1666 , failed to keep the College Youths from their appointed bongfest . Last week , at the Society 's 302nd annual shindig , the " Bore War " did what fire and plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caters and Oxford Singles with hand bells in the upstairs room of a blacked-out London pub . Reason : open-air change-ringing might drown out air-raid sirens .
