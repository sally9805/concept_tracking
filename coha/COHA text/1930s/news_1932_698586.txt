txt Approved by Congress today without a dissenting vote , the Glass - Steagall creditexpansion bill reached the White House at 6:08 o'clock tonight and will be , signed by President Hoover tomorrow . The President announced that when he affixes his signature he will issue a statement regarding the measure which is hailed by its sponsors as a major move to stimulate credit . The bill will broaden the acceptability of commercial paper for rediscount by the Federal Reserve System , and make about $750,000,000 of the Reserve System 's gold supply , now used to support currency , available for other purpose 's . This release of gold , it was said in the Congressional debate , will protect the United States against " raids " by foreign countries on its gold supply . Congressional approval of the measure was accomplished by adoption of a conference report in both Houses . Late this afternoon , the bill was signed by Speaker Garner , and Senator Moses , president pro tem , of the Senate . Then it was sent to the White House . No Opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fifteen minutes ; the Senate in about two minutes . Adoption was by viva voce vote in each instance , with no opposition . In the House Representative Steagall of Alabama described the report , four or five questions were asked , and the vote was taken . In the Senate Senator King of Utah requested Senator Glass to explain the conference action . " The outstanding question was upon the capitalization limitation upon individual banks that might apply to the use of their ineligible assets , " Mr. Glass said . " The Senate bill had a limitation of $2,000,000 ; the House had no limitation , and we agreed upon a limitation of $5,000,000 . This excludes only sixty-two of the 7,000 member banks from applying under the individual provisions of the bill , and embraced in those sixty-two are what we believe to be the speculative banking institutions which will have to come under the group provision . " The other major question of difference upon which we finally unanimously agreed was as to the time limit of the bill itself . The House limited the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . The House receded so that the first pro , vision is made permanent . The other provisions of the bill had a one-year time limit upon which the House in ' sisted and the Senate receded . " The House required a majority of the members of the Federal Reserve Board to act , the Senate required six and the conferees compromised on five . " Provisions of the Measure . As adopted , the bill provides : 1 . Under permanent law , Federal Reserve member banks which have exhausted their eligible collateral may join with four or more other member banks in obtaining loans from the Federal Reserve System on joint promissory notes . A combination of only two member banks may secure loans if their aggregate deposits equal 10 per cent of the total member bank deposits in the Federal Reserve district concerned . 2 . Until March 3 , 1933 , member banks in needy circumstances , without further eligible paper , and not I capitalized above $5,000,000 , may borrow from the Reserve System on promissory notes , without participat1 ing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be eligible for this benefit . 3 . ' Until March 3 , 1933 , Federal Re- serve Banks may substitute government bonds for the eligible commercial paper now used as support for Federal Reserve notes . This provision will serve to release the surplus gold above the 40 per cent of gold required to support note issues . Thus the surplus gold may be employed as the 40 per cent backing for subsequent notes . Steps in President 's Program . Although the Glass-Steagall bill had non-partisan support in both branches of Congress , it conforms to the President 's recommendation that more commercial paper should be made eligible for discount by the Federal Reserve System . It is another step in the economic program which Mr. Hoover urged last Summer and reiterated to Congress in a special message Jan. 4 . Presidential recommendations already carried into effect by Congress include the addition of $125,000,000 to the capitalization of the Federal Land Bank System and establishment of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , with assets off $2,000,000 , - 000 . Mr. Hoover also asked for enactment of a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering establishment of such a system . Another request by the President was for a plan to aid depositors in closed banks . Senator Fletcher , Democrat , of Florida today introduced a bill to create a " bank depositors ' guaranty fund . " with combined resources of $125.000,000 . The Glass bill for banking law revision , now in the hands of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , proposes as a measure to aid depositors in closed banks a liquidating corporation , with assets of about $400,000,000 . The Thomas-Beedy bill , also in custody of the committee , would make $750,000 , - 000 available . Banks Would Set Up Fund . Under the Fletcher bill , every member bank of the Federal Reserve Systeam which the Controller of the Currency held to be apparently solvent would deposit a sum equal to 5 per cent of its capital stock with the Treasurer of the United States . Before any bank could join the system , it would be called upon to provide the Controller with details of its assets and liabilities , the names and addresses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares held by each . In order " to safeguard the interests of depositors and stockholders and protect the bank depositors ' guaranty fund , " the Controller would make semi-annual investigations of the condition of every member bank and of the financial responsibility of " each owner , transferee or holder of stock " in the bank . If any member bank that had paid the 5 per cent deposit were found insolvent and thrown into receivership the receiver would within thirty days , report the names and addresses of " each unsecured depositor . " These facts would be reported to the treasurer of the United States , who would ten days later use the bank depositors ' guaranty fund to pay the sums due . If there were not enough money in the fund the treasurer would be authorized to advance the sum necessary . Such advances by the treasurer would constitute a first lien against the bank , and the advance from the guaranty fund would be a secorid lien . Severe Penalties Provided . The treasurer would be authorized to invest the holdings in the guaranty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more than 2 per cent interest on their deposits in the fund . Every bank joining would have to state publicly that " unsecured depositors of this bank are protected against loss by the bank depositors ' guaranty fund , United States Treasury Department . " Severe penalties for violating the national banking laws are provided In the bill . Any officer or employe of the treasury or employe of a member bank who willfully violated the laws would be sentenced to from five to twenty years , " and the sentence so imposed shall not be suspended nor shall such convicted person be paroled or pardoned . " Senator Fletcher in a speech describing his bill said : " As on the last day of December , the capital stock of all national banks ( 6,373 ) was $1,621,449,000 , and the capital stock of all State banks ( 878 ) members of the Federal Reserve System was $881,074,000 , making the total capital of all members of the system $2,502,523,000 , the guaranty fund would be established with more than $125,000,000 to its credit . " There might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine affairs of State bank members , he said , but he argued that all members of the Reserve System should be examined , as well as holding companies controlling national banks . Hopes States Will Adopt Plan . It was gratifying to note , the Senator continued , that there had been few , if any , bank failures in recent weeks , but he declared it " important " that there be no repetition of the hardships recently experienced by millions of depositors . He expressed hope that States would adopt some plan similar to the Federal program which he proposed . " Legislation along the lines of this bill is necessary to restore the confidence many have lost in some of our financial institutions , " Senator Fletcher declared . " The people want safety above every other consideration , and if legislation may secure that we should give it our energetic attention . " There were 136 convictions for violation of the banking laws In the year ending Oct. 30. 1930 , he added &; and in seventy of these cases probation was allowed , while fines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depositors in closed banks were placed at less than one-tenth of 1 per cent annually in the first forty years of the old national bank act . The proposed sinking fund would reach such " huge proportions " in twenty years , Senator Fletcher contended , that there would be no " broken bank " in this country if the examinations were carefully carried out . In asserting that confidence must be restored , the Senator said there were 2,290 bank suspensions in 1931 , involving deposits of $1,759,000,000 . Included were 410 national banks with deposits of $473,000,000 , 105 State member banks with deposits of $302,000,000 , and 1.772 non-member banks with deposits of $984,000,000.
