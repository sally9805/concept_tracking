The Comic Artist ( by Susan Glaspell &; Norman Matson ; Arthur J. Beckhard , producer ) has been under various play doctors ' care since 1927 , when Mr. &; Mrs. Matson first wrote it . Its ills are still uncured . To begin with , the play is not named after the central character of the piece . Central character is Stephen Rolf , a prolix worthy who lives and paints on Cape Cod and goes about in a windbreaker . His brother , sensitive Karl , is the cartoonist of the family , having created a comic strip character named " Muggs , " who always is defeated in the last picture . <P> Stephen ( Richard Hale ) is leading a comfortable life with his stolid , attentive wife ( Blanche Yurka ) when Karl and his bride come to visit . The bride ( svelte Lora Baxter ) has previously been Stephen 's mistress in Paris . <P> The embarrassed handling which Playwright Glaspell and her husband give this houseful of agitated folk is typical of much of Miss Glaspell 's previous dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotonous series of dialogs . Except for two moments-the scene in which Stephen and his onetime girl embrace , and the finale in which Stephen and his wife decide to carry on together-the spectator finds himself wondering just how two more actors can be maneuvered in when the present pair dismiss themselves . Somehow , like Noah marshaling his animals in the Ark , the authors manage to turn the trick , but not always neatly . <P> The Comic Artist contains a good deal of excellent prose in its dialog , expresses not a few credible convictions , is honest if somewhat unprofessional . Most reviewers left it with justification for harsh criticism , but without the heart to administer it .
