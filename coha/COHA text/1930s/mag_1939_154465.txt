For six months Europe has shuttled back and forth between fear of war and hope of peace . Not since last September , when France , Germany , Czecho-Slovakia and Italy had millions of men under arms , has Europe so resembled an armed camp as it did early this week . All over Europe more men were being called to the colors , more soldiers were being rushed to frontiers . <P> Most ominous troop movement was in the Polish Corridor near Danzig , the Free City attached to the Polish customs union but ruled by an all-Nazi government . The Germans of Danzig ( about 380,000 ) have long clamored for a " home in the Reich " ; Adolf Hitler has long wanted to oblige . But only last week realistic Josef Beck , the Polish Foreign Minister , who knows that for every inch Poland gives Germany Fuhrer Hitler will take a mile , was reported to have reminded the Reich that his country would consider the seizure of Danzig a casus belli . <P> Nevertheless , the German press this week began carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the all-too-familiar German method of preparatory propaganda before expanding the Reich frontiers . The rolling stock of the Polish Railway Administration was removed from Danzig and environs and " more than 10,000 troops " were moved into Gdynia , Polish port twelve miles from Danzig . The Polish standing Army was increased to some 400,000 men and the Polish Army journal , Polska Zbrojna , published a defiant editorial labeled We Are Ready . <P> Southward Bound . The traditionally neutral Swiss had a real week-end scare when alarming news came over the border that the Reich had been massing more than 200,000 troops around Lake Constance , to the north , and near the Swiss eastern frontier . Switzerland 's border guard was doubled , border roads and bridges were mined and anti-aircraft guns were in position in Basel , Zurich and other big cities . To allay popular fears the Swiss Federal Council appealed for calm , issued a statement that " rumors concerning an immediate menace to Switzerland , whether direct or indirect , are without foundation . " <P> Privately , other explanations for German troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the Brenner Pass from old Austria into Italy has been closed to civilian traffic . For the same period long German troop and munition trains have been pouring through , southward bound to Italy . Best guess as to their ultimate destination : Italian-owned Libya , in north Africa , where Dictator Benito Mussolini has long planned an " adventure . " <P> The Germans have about 1,000,000 men under arms continually , have called up another 500,000 . Italy has mobilized several classes . Just to make the mobilization general , French Premier Edouard Daladier , under his new decree powers , had poured thousands of special reservists into frontier defenses . <P> For the past 20 years the people of no big power have wanted to go to war-not even those of Germany , whose dictator keeps telling them not to worry because no one dares fight the mighty Third Reich . One of the factors constantly working against a general European war is the lack among Europe 's most powerful nations of a disposition to fight .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
