txt  | slightly grayed . She will enjoy wearing blue , green , and brown in the in-between shades , which are neither brilliant nor pale and delicate . Most people fall in this group . Added to this classification are special cases : r . The mannish type of person who likes to appear as boyish as possible should wear cold dark colors like navy blue . She is not inclined to be emotional , and this type of coloring combined with the cut of her clothes will show her personality . 2 . The athletic type , on the other hand , is emotional , although she may wear tailored clothes . However , they should be more feminine and made of warm colors . Think of all of the lovely sport clothes made of rose , golden brown , or cadet blue . 3 . The vivacious person is usually sparkling , bubbling over with enthusiasm , and will need a brilliant color like red to keep her pepped up . 4 . The dramatic type of person is the one who studies carefully each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting in which she is going to be seen . She visualizes her effect on those about her . She therefore will go in for rather startling color combinations , which will be gay with an oriental influence , such as orange and black . She will wear brilliant colors , or an unrelieved black outfit . She is eccentric to a certain extent , but probably if all of us would consider our surroundings before we dressed , it would be to our advantage . 3 . Then there is the studious person . It seems wise for her to wear warm rich colors such as burgundy red and golden brown . Can you find yourself among any of these personalities ? If you can not , you are probably one of those people who are a little bit of everything with nothing definite in view . If so , get busy and see what you can do in order that you may develop into an interesting personality . It is always wise to note what colors mean to certain people . One authority claims that green gives a drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptable , whereas another authority says it shows a tendency to bit  | quarrel . So you can see that there is a wide and interesting difference in opinion . Red means originality , positiveness , leadership , and brings power and assurance . Orange is a magnetic color , I had my sister buy an orange dress one time to find out if this could be true . She likes orange , and she admitted that she was the center of attention all evening in her orange gown . Yellow is glamorous and radiant . If a girl vibrates to it , she has high spiritual qualities and a social success . Blue means the pursuit of happiness and makes its wearer lucky and fortunate . Violet usually means that the wearer has an ability to write prose or poetry concerning abstract things . With these meanings of color you can read your own character . Be sure that you feel well in the color , that it does something to you just as red does for me before you analyze yourself . It is interesting to note that color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violet have a quieting effect on violent patients , whereas red seems to stimulate melancholy patients so that they become more cheerful . Therefore , if color contributes to the lives of the mentally ill , it must surely play a role in the life of a normal person . I hope that you will feel the great importance of color in your life , and realize that it will give you charm and attractiveness . It will help you in obtaining your goal whatever that may be . SUGGESTED CLASS ACTIVITIES I. Bring to class pictures illustrating the different color harmonies . 2 . From works of art , show how the artist developed good line through the medium of proportion and balance .  | 3 . Make a chart showing your personal coloring . 4 . Make another chart listing the colors with their tints and shades which you can wear . 5 . Work out numbers 3 and 4 with your mother or sister as the model . 6 .

They have felt that the consumer of to-day was not a very well-informed person , and that the commercial field was taking advantage of this fact . They have endeavored to help this situation , but it has been a difficult task to educate the average buyer . However , there is every reason to believe that women would like to know more about this subject . It therefore seems as if you should consider it so that when you actually have the responsibility thrust upon you , you can make a success of it . In order to do this it seems wise to think seriously concerning the actual working of a person 's mind when she is purchasing clothing . IS THE CONSUMER EASILY MISLED ? Did you ever stop to wonder why you buy clothing ? What makes you want it ? Perhaps , it is because you feel a physical need for it . On the first chilly day of autumn , you experience a need for something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear which will protect you from the elements . If you want this garment only for protection , you may purchase a pair of red flannels which  | you will wear and experience the satisfaction of warmth . Or , you may possibly buy a large wool blanket and wrap this around you when you go out on a chilly day . This again will give you the needed protection . Suppose your mother should insist that this is the way you should go to school this winter . Would you be satisfied ? Of course not , because along with this materialistic desire is a mental desire which will only be satisfied when you experience joy from the wearing of a garment , because it makes you appear to advantage . Sometimes people are actually devoid of a feeling of pleasure from clothes , and only purchase clothes because custom so decrees . It is this type of person who joins nudist colonies . He sees no reason for wearing clothes , and he does not feel that it is immodest not to . The percentage of people who feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is also a group of people , usually of the wealthy class , who never actually experience the feeling of needing clothing , because they have plenty , but they buy and buy articles of wearing apparel because they enjoy it . There is also the group of people who feel the need of clothing , but who allow their desire for pleasure to endanger their better judgment . Although they need a good warm sport coat , they buy a light-weight dress coat because it is prettier , and they only have money enough for one . This , of course , is very unwise and will lead to bad results , although the purchasers obtain a sense of satisfaction . Clothing may be purchased because it appeals to the reason or intellect . Or because it appeals to a passing mood or emotion . However , it is better if there is a mingling of these two interests , so that your sound judgment will have some esthetic value . In order to develop this fine selective power , the five  | senses must be intelligently put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appreciate the fine artistic points of wearing apparel . Since clothing must satisfy a craving for the beautiful and artistic , it naturally follows that you must apply a knowledge of line and color to meet this demand . You will not only have to satisfy yourself , but must also choose garments which give pleasure and not annoyance to others . This is especially so with color . No doubt , you have had your beau tell you that he did not care for a certain dress you wore . On questioning him , you found that it was the color . This seems to have a different effect ? generally emotional ? on various people . Your sense of sight must be so perfect that you know the good from the poor . The sense of smell plays a small part in your selection , though you probably are wholly unaware of it . However , certain fabrics do have a repellent odor which makes them undesirable for general wear . The rustle of silk may be enjoyed by you , and therefore you will let the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever use the sense of taste in purchasing garments , but you most certainly do the sense of touch . Immediately , you think of the soft delightful texture of velvet , the warmth of wool , the stiff crispness of taffeta . Very often it is a delicate touch which enables you to distinguish one fabric from another . Naturally , in order to obtain the best results in the selection of any wearing apparel , there should be a perfect combination of these five senses . Heredity and environment also play a great part in your purchasing ability . If you have always been surrounded by lovely things and your family enjoys an artistic touch , you will naturally absorb this same appreciation . And by con-  | stant contact it will become a part of you . However , if you have not had this advantage , but still have the love of beauty , then through study you can easily acquire it . If you have never had it , and you are devoid of an interest in what is truly beautiful , then you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also responsible to a large extent for many selections . For instance , curiosity leads people to see and study all the latest styles , and then because of the natural instinct to imitate , they immediately copy and wear the garment . The instinct of acquisition leads a person to buy her own things so that she can say , " This is mine . " And rivalry makes one want to have as much as her friends . The love of distinction and attention makes her wear her clothing with the hope of having it approved by others so that she will be the center of attention . Because of these instincts , you experience certain emotional reactions . This fact actuates the clothing industry . The designers conceive the ideas for garments , and the wheels of industry revolve so that your mental make-up may be satisfied . This leads to the constant changing fashions . The clever business man always considers the working of the human mind when he conceives new ideas . He realizes that humans are easily led and often fooled . He therefore plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer to do as he wants . This is seen in advertising . He makes up an advertisement which will attract attention and concentration . Then , although it may give no concrete information , the consumer wants it and immediately thinks up any number of reasons for buying it . Naturally , the next step is the purchase of the article . Because of these emotional reactions which you have , it becomes all the more necessary to have some definite knowl-  | Figure edge which you can apply at these times . This fact has led groups of people through the help of the government to make manufacturers and dealers give certain true information concerning their product to the consumer . Pick up a fashion magazine , and look at the advertisements . How many of them really tell the truth ? Most of them are word masterpieces which lead you to think all kinds of nice things . Commodities are also brought to the attention of the consumer through displays . The more attractive they are , the more you , as a consumer , are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing a living model who is  | Figure attractive , displaying the articles to be sold . Immediately , the spectator wishes to look as she does . This is the reason why the most exclusive stores always have mannequins showing off their most interesting clothes . In some stores ,  | the salesgirl will be seen wearing jewelry that she is selling , or other accessories . And , because human beings like to imitate , things displayed in this way sell quickly . Another important selling factor is window exhibits which are pleasing to see . Are you a window shopper ? I am . I love it . When time hangs rather heavy on my hands , I walk for hours just looking in the shop windows . It is a grand way to formulate ideas for your wardrobe . I believe that you now realize that it is very easy to be fooled because of the way the mind naturally works . It , therefore , seems wise to gain some definite information concerning the different kinds and qualities of textiles , and how to recognize those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy wisely and economically . When you can think intelligently on this problem , then you will not let your emotions run away with you . However , do not become one of these wholly conservative people who control their emotions so completely that they are cold and uninteresting . WHAT ABOUT TEXTILE FIBERS ? Before you can buy wisely , it is necessary that you understand something about the fiber from which materials are made . Too much purchasing has been done by the trialand-error method . You purchased an article and then went home to find out for yourself whether the clerk had told you the truth . Maybe she had , and if this was so , you were lucky . In order to avoid some of the mistakes , it is best to make a simple study of the structure of fabrics . In this way you will discover why taffeta cracks , what is virgin wool , or why some silk materials are spotted with water . This is called the study of textiles , and at this time we will discuss briefly the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable , animal , and synthetic . Cotton and linen are vegetable fibers , wool and silk are animal fibers . Synthetic fibers , as you all know , are man-made fibers , derived from vegetable pulp and chemicals . Cotton Cotton is the most commonly used fiber . You learned about it when you were a tiny tot . At that time , you were  | shown a fluffy cotton ball and made to feel the hard little lumps inside . You were told that the best cotton comes from our own United States , in Georgia , the Carolinas , Florida , and is called Sea Island cotton . Other cotton comes from Egypt , South America , and the East Indies . The South is especially adapted for growing cotton because it has a sandy , loamy soil and a warm , humid climate . Cotton is usually a perennial plant , but in the United States it is an annual because of southern frosts . It is planted in March or April , and by August the plant has grown to a height of four to Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton boll . When this is ripe , it bursts open showing a beautiful white fluffy mass . You can imagine what a sight it is to see a whole field of these , bobbing in the breeze . And it is still more picturesque to see the colored folk humming as they pick the cotton by hand . They can gather as much as 250 pounds apiece each day . Until recently , no machine had ever been invented which could do this job as well as the human hand . However , a machine has now been constructed which may revolutionize this entire industry . The cotton is taken to the ginning mill where the seeds are removed . Eli Whitney invented the first one , but now the McCarthy gin is used which rolls out the seeds , without injuring the fiber . After this has been completed , it is pressed into Soo-pound  | Figure bales which are wrapped very poorly in burlap and fastened with metal bands . They are now ready to be shipped to a manufacturing center . Cotton is graded into nine distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair to middling " may have  | been coined here for they are graded fair to middling to ordinary . Marketing is carried on at the cotton exchanges , located in Liverpool , Bremen , Havre , New York City , and Boston . When it arrives at the mill , it goes through a series of processes which turn this fluffy mass into a beautiful fabric . These steps I am going to explain so that you will have a general idea of the actual manufacturing . If you are located near a mill , visit it and watch the process . It is vastly interesting . STEPS IN THE MAKING OF COTTON MATERIAL i . The first step is the opening of the bales by a bale breaker and then the picking apart of the fiber by the " opener " which makes it into a fluffy mass again . 2 . The bales must then be mixed with other bales so as to obtain a uniform mixture . 3 . It then must be cleaned by a picker machine which beats out the dirt , and the scutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be disentangled . This process is called carding and changes the fibers into a lap which resembles cotton batting , and then later into a sliver which looks like a rope . The carding machine is now very complicated . The one which your great grandmothers used was simply a board with metal prongs sticking up like your peg board , and was used as if it was a wire hair brush . And that really is what carding is ? a brushing of the fibers . You brush your hair to disentangle snarly portions , but a comb is necessary to complete the process . 5 . So it is with cotton . The combing process removes the short fibers , straightening the others and making all these fibers of uniform length parallel . 6 . It is now ready to be spun . Spinning is a drawing and twisting process by which the fiber is converted into thread . You may have seen the old-fashioned spinning wheels used by your ancestors . Perhaps you have one in your own home . If you have , see if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house used to have to do it . If she did n't , there was no new dress for her . Did you ever stop to wonder what you would do if you had to help raise the cotton , spin the thread , and weave the material before you could make it into a garment ? You would not have time for anything else . 7 . The thread then can be bleached with chemicals and dyed the desired color . 8 . Weaving , the conversion of the thread into material , comes next . When you were little , you probably did some weaving in kindergarten . Remember the little mats you used to make by interlacing brightly colored papers . Or , perhaps later , you made a real little Indian rug on a picture frame . This was really the way weaving was first accomplished by primitive people . Threads were attached to the limb of a tree and then staked to the ground . These were the warp or lengthwise threads , and are always the stronger . The weaver then squatted and wove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gradually , through a series of inventions , the complicated present-day loom was discovered . You will want to go and see them operated . If you examined a piece of material with any care at all , you have noticed that not all materials are woven in the same manner . If they were , we could not possibly have all of the hundreds and hundreds of different kinds of material . Within the last year , this fact has been used more than ever until now they are simply classed as novelty weaves . However , there are a few standard ones which will always be used . a . The plain weave is the most common and is simply the placing of the woof thread over and under each alternate warp thread . It is used to make such materials as percale , gingham , muslin , taffeta , linen , and homespun . The cord and rib effect is a variation of this weave . b . The twill weave is the strongest of all the weaves . It gives the impression of a diagonal line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used for khaki and serge . c . The satin weave gives a smooth and glossy appearance , and is made by one woof thread passing over many warp threads . This weave you have seen used in satin , and variations of it in sateen and damask .  | d . The pile weave is made of a series of loops which have been cut . This is used in making Turkish toweling , corduroy , and velvet . e . The gauze weave is made by a simple twist of the warp thread around the woof thread . This is used in making marquisette. f . The lappet weave is a plain weave plus a decoration . This may be accomplished by means of an embroidered dot or by applying a claylike material to the cloth . Dotted swiss is a good example of this one . g . There are numerous novelty weaves which are a combination of these . 9 . After the material has been woven , the design may be applied unless it has already been made during the weaving process , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it is a surface design , it can be easily recognized as the appearance will not be the same on both sides . Your printed materials are made in this way . Then the moire effect , embossing , and embroidery are applied . Very often , some materials must have a finishing process to obtain the correct effect . a . When a material needs to be stiffened , it is placed in a solution of starch , clay , mucilage , glycerine , wax , or ammonia water , and the process is called sizing . This is a wise thing to remember when purchasing material . Have you not often wondered why some cotton material appears so sleazy after laundering ? If this has happened to p 117 Figure you , it is because that material has been sized to give it body , and during the washing process , this sizing has been removed leaving the material very thin and pliable . Have you ever noticed that sometimes when you tear a piece of cotton material a fine powder seems to come out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cambric is one material which is highly sized . Can you think of others ? b . Another finishing process is called calendering . This gives a high luster to the material by placing the goods through heavy , heated rollers . Cottons can be made to resemble linens by this procedure . c . Mercerization is another way by which cottons can be given a high luster . This is done by placing the material in a strong caustic alkali solution .  | d . Some fibers are run through a gas flame in order to singe off the fuzzy ends giving it more the appearance of silk . It is also treated with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid . This is the way lisle is made . c . A new development is the san f orizing processes which insure the material from further shrinkage . If you do not realize how cotton material is made or what can be done to change its appearance , you may be fooled often in your purchases . You may have read and studied all of the above material and still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . One way is to look at a fiber under the microscope . It will resemble a twisted ribbon . Cotton is soft to feel . It is dull in appearance except when it has been put through the mercerization or calendering process . It tears with a shrill noise , and the broken ends are fuzzy . When buying cotton material , you should examine the fineness and closeness of the weave . You should inquire into its guarantee for fastness of color and against shrinkage . If there is a fair degree of balance between the warp and woof threads , the fabric should be quite durable . In order to test the firmness of the weave , you can draw it over your thumb to see if the threads pull apart . If you purchase your fabric from a reliable store , and it is made by a reputable firm , you ought to have very good luck with it . Linen Linen is made from flax which grows in Ireland , Belgium , or Russia . Little of it is grown in the United States because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is planted in deep , well-plowed soil , and grows into a plant twenty to thirty inches high . When the lower leaves and stem turn yellow . it is pulled by hand and allowed to dry for ten days . By Ewing Galloway , N. Y. Figure  | STEPS IN THE MAKING OF LINEN 1 . The rippling process which follows is the removal of the seeds and leaves . The flax straw is then tied in bundles . 2 . The outer covering of the flax fiber must be removed by retting . In this process the outer stalk is removed by fermentation which gradually rots it away . This may be accomplished by five different methods . a . The first is dew retting . The flax straw is placed on the ground so that dew may fall on it each day . The action of the dew and the sun sets up the needed fermentation. b . Pool retting is another way . Here the flax , tied in bundles , is placed in stagnant pools . c . The best way is stream retting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottom of a rushing stream . The flow of the water over it sets up the necessary action . d . Chemicals are also used but not as satisfactorily as the natural methods . e . There is also a machine which can remove the outer part of the stalk , but again the flax fiber does not seem to be as good as when it has been naturally retted. 3 . After the retting has been satisfactorily accomplished , it must be dried in order that the cleaning process may take place . The outer fermented stalk is then broken up and removed by scutching which beats it off , leaving the clean flax fiber. 4 . The carding and combing process in the manufacture of linen is known as hackling . This combs the flax fibers making them lie straight and flat . 5 . It is then sorted and graded before it is placed in bunches on a machine known as a spread board or traveling apron . Each bunch of flax straw overlaps the other , six inches , and when it leaves , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you would guess will be the next step . This is done while the straw is wet . 7 . It is then ready to be woven , after which it must be bleached . Natural linen is a dark muddy color . There are four degrees of bleaching ? one quarter , one half , three quarters , and full . 8 . Beautiful linens are a pride and joy to a housewife . The lovely  | Figure gloss and leathery feeling which fine table linen possess is obtained by beetling the finish goods . This is done by means of heavy heated rollers . It used to be obtained by pounding the material with a wooden mallet , called a beetle . Now it becomes necessary to learn how to identify linen . The fiber appears like a bamboo rod under the microscope . It feels leathery and tough when you touch it . When torn , it has a dull noise rather than the shrill one of cotton . Because of the finishing processes given cotton , it is necessary to watch closely to see that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil on a piece of material is a good test . If it is cotton , it will remain opaque , but if it is linen , it becomes translucent . Linen that is made of long fibers is smooth and glossy and  | more durable than that made of short fibers , which is coarser and becomes rough after it has been laundered and worn several times . Inferior quality linen is often sized to give it body . This can be detected if it is rubbed between the hands or if a drop of iodine is placed on it . Do you know what will happen ? Try it and see . Wool Wool material is usually made from the hair of sheep . However , sometimes it comes from goats , llamas , or alpacas . In Australia and South America , animals are especially raised for this purpose . Others are grown in the United States and New Zealand . Great care is taken in the raising of the sheep . Climate and food are responsible in the main part for the kind of wool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if it is moist , the wool is long and crimpy ; and if the weather is bad , the fleece becomes very coarse . The shearing is usually done in May . The wool is taken off in one sheet called a fleece by means of electric clippers . It weighs about eighty pounds , but is normally only worth about twenty-five to thirty cents . Each fleece is done up separately , and groups of forty are sent to the manufacturer . The fleeces are skirted in order to remove any torn , ragged , or badly stained parts , and this wool is called taglocks and is very poor quality . You have probably used lamb 's wool and wonder what the difference is . This is wool from an animal who is only six to eight months old . Hogget wool is from a sheep a year old . If the wool is to be used from an animal which has been slaughtered for meat , it is removed by chemicals and called pulled wool . Wool is made into cloth in the following manner : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naturally , the wool has to be sorted . The quality depends on the part of the body that it comes from and number of clippings the animal has already had . The best quality is called pick locks and comes from the neck , sides , and shoulders of the animal . It is sorted through a skilled sense of touch , and as you can imagine , this is far from a pleasant job . 2 . The wool is then scoured to remove the oil and dirt . It is washed in several tanks of water , and the oil which is left in  | the water is made into that soothing cream called lanolin . The scouring and drying must be done carefully so that the wool will spin properly , absorb dyes evenly , and produce a well-balanced cloth . 3 . It then has to be blended in order that it will meet the strength requirements , so that the proper color may be obtained , and the style must be determined . If a cheaper grade of wool material is desired , shoddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton can be added at this time . The fibers are weighed out , oiled , and laid in layers . No doubt , you are wondering what shoddy and mungo are , are you not ? There is not enough wool produced each year to meet the demands . It therefore becomes necessary to use wool which has been worn by somebody else . This probably sounds like an astounding fact to you , but it is true . When your mother sells old clothes to the rag man , he in turn sells them to a firm which reworks the wool making it like new . This is how shoddy is obtained . The material is cleaned , picked apart , and restored to its natural state . This is perfectly good wool , but of course it is not as nice as the virgin wool , which is wool which has never been used before . Mungo is the term applied to reworked wool which is made from hard felts , and hard woven cloth . This is still a cheaper grade . When cotton has been mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be removed before the wool can be used again . The wool is called extract wool . You can see why there is such a great difference in the prices of wool materials , can you not ? 4 . The wool may be dyed while it is still in the fiber state . You remember the old expression , " dyed in the wool . " 5 . Before the manufacturing process can proceed , it must be decided whether the fabric is to be a woolen or a worsted . These two terms are often used erroneously for few people know the difference between them . The woolens are soft and fuzzy whereas the worsteds are firmer to feel , and a distinct pattern can be seen after they have been woven . This is due to the fact that the fiber for woolens is simply carded before spinning . Thus the fibers do not spin into a smooth , strong yarn but rather into a soft , fluffy yarn . On the other hand , worsted yarn is prepared by carding , gilling , and comb-  | Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is a tightly twisted thread . Worsteds wear longer than woolens . However , they are more expensive . They hold their shape nicely , but have a tendency to become shiny after they have been worn . Remember the back of your Father 's blue serge trousers . Flannel is a woolen material , whereas serge is a worsted one . 6 . Sometimes the yarn is sized to give it strength before it is woven . This is done by adding Irish moss , starch , glue , or mucilage . A sized material will be less expensive and must be watched for . 7 . After the material has been woven , it must go through some finishing processes . The real beauty of the fabric is now obtained . It is inspected for flaws ? broken threads or weak places . These are mended . The knots and bunches of yarn must be removed by a process called hurling.  | Figure 8 . The cloth must then be washed to remove any oil or dirt gathered during the manufacturing process . If the dyeing has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carded , or while it was a yarn , it is now done , and called piece dyeing . q . It then goes through a fulling or felting process . The selvedge edges are placed together so that the right side is inside . It is then soaked in hot soapy water and run through heavy rollers .  | Figure By doing this , the fibers are brought closer together . Sometimes flocks are added at this time . This is wool which has been discarded during the manufacturing process . By adding it , the material becomes heavier . Did you ever let down the hem of a wool skirt ? When you opened it out flat , you noticed in the crease that there were little bits of something in the hem . You brushed them out thinking that they were dirt particles , never realizing that these were portions of wool which had rubbed out through friction . io . The fabric is then napped with a teazle to make it slightly fuzzy . The teazle which grows in the fields is still found to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap is brushed in one direction and sheared to make it even .  | 12 . The material is then steamed , pressed , and brushed giving it a slight luster . Sometimes it has a surface finish made of starch , gums , or chemicals . It may be sprayed with water to prevent spotting and shrinking . The finished material is then inspected , measured , doubled , rolled , and packed . Most garments made of wool seem to shrink a great deal after they have been laundered , because of the construction of the fiber . If you were to look at it under the microscope , you would see that it resembles many scales with points . Unless great care is taken each time the article is laundered , the scales become more enmeshed with each other resulting in drastic shrinkage . Because of this , you must inquire whether your material has been preshrunk before you buy it . If it has not , be sure that you have it done . As you have already seen , it is hard to tell virgin wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , read carefully the informative labels which are attached to the material or article that you are purchasing . Unless it is marked virgin wool , it is probably reworked fiber . In order to discover if flocks have been added to the fabric , brush the back of it to see if the flocks drop out . If the finish comes off when you rub it between your hands , then naturally you will decide that it is a poor buy . A piece of all wool cloth is very elastic after you have squeezed it in your hand . To assure yourself when you get home that your material is all wool , take a sample and try to burn it . If it is all wool , it will not burn but will roll up into a gummy ball , and have the odor of burning feathers . However , if it has been adulterated with cotton , it will partly burn with a flame , and an ashy residue will be left as if you had burned papers . When you are shopping , go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can distinguish the good from the poor fabrics .  | Silk Silk is the other animal fiber . Silk worms grow best in China , and also Japan . France and Italy also are able to raise them . It is absolutely necessary for them to have mulberry leaves to feed on . Most silk is made by worms which have special attention , and it is called cultivated silk . You will be surprised to hear what attention these little animals receive . The eggs are deposited on sheets of cloth or paper called cards . These are kept in a warm place for several days and are then placed in cold storage to await mulberry time . The eggs are then placed in an incubator for twenty to thirty days , when the caterpillars appear . In order for them to grow properly , they must live in a clean place , with good ventilation , plenty of space , and no strong odors . Noise bothers them so quiet must prevail . Did you ever hear of anything so temperamental ? Little Chinese girls watch over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are the size of pin heads , but they have an appalling appetite for chopped young mulberry leaves , and so shortly reach their maturity . At this time , they are three inches long and ten thousand times heavier than they were at the beginning of the larva stage . Their caretaker now notices that they stop eating and begin to toss their heads . Therefore , she puts near them a tiny twig . They attach themselves to this by means of two threads called fibroins which they secrete from their head . These are held together with a gummy substance called silk glue . They are able to make nine to ten inches a minute , and by continuing this for three days , they make a fiber boo to 1300 yards long . When they have finished their cocoons , they rest for  | Figure fifteen to twenty days in the chrysalis stage . The moth is now ready to emerge . If it is to be used for reproduction , the moth is allowed to secrete an alkaline fluid which dissolves the filament allowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiber is to be used for silk thread , the moth must be killed , before this can happen . This is done by heating the cocoon . It now becomes necessary to unwind this raw silk . This is done by soaking the cocoon in hot water to soften the gum  | which holds the silk filament together . The problem now is to find the end of the fiber , and this is as difficult as finding the end of the spool of thread . It is accomplished , however , by moving a brush of twigs over it until it untangles the filament . This is placed through a glass eye , and the unwinding , called reeling , begins ? a process which not only unwinds the fiber but also twists and squeezes it . It is wound into skeins and is now ready to be sent to the United States for manufacturing . r Not all silk worms get such attention . Some develop by themselves on the mulberry bushes . They are gathered , and the silk is known as wild silk . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made from this type of silk . The raw silk is harsh , stiff , and lusterless when it arrives to be manufactured . The first process is known as throwing . This resembles spinning as it makes it into thread . More of the gummy substance is removed during this procedure . Waste silk is really spun and is called spun silk . In order to remove all of the gum , it must pass through the degumming process . It is then bleached by chemicals before it is dyed . The weaving process follows , and sometimes the material is weighted . This is done by the addition of metallic salts to give it more body . You have probably noticed that sometimes when your dress comes home from the dry cleaner it has become sleazy . If that has happened , you know that the material was weighted . Some fabrics like taffeta crack . This defect also indicates weighted material . Weighting makes the material less durable , hard to press , and the color can not be depended upon . The use of lead as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy to distinguish silk from the other fibers you have studied . The difficulty comes when you see it with synthetic  | fiber materials . It is soft , smooth , and pliable when you touch it . If you look at it under the microscope , it resembles a glass rod . In selecting silk material , it is best to buy one with a firm weave because it is less liable to pull at the seams , shrink , stretch , and lose its shape . You have probably noticed the label " pure-dye silk " and have interpreted it to mean that the dye was pure , and of a fast color , but strange as it may seem it does not have anything to do with it . The term means that in all colors except black there is no more than ten per cent of any other substance or fiber added . In black , there may be fifteen per cent . It therefore becomes necessary for you to insist that the silk trade label their materials correctly , and then you as a consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will require study on your part for it is so easy to be fooled . The judging of good and poor silk was hard enough before you had such nice man-made fiber on the market . Each year synthetic material is becoming lovelier and harder to distinguish from real silk . This fiber has an interesting history . Synthetic Material It has always annoyed men to think that they could not in some way produce a fiber similar to silk . When a disease of the silk worm almost ruined the industry , men realized that they should be able to make a synthetic fiber . As early as 1664 it was mentioned , but it was not until 1884 that a patent was obtained for the first process which was called the nitro-cellulose process . Cuprammonium process was invented some years after and is the one used by Bemberg today . The viscose method followed , and finally the acetate process . In 1924 the term rayon was coined , and since that  | time , the industry has increased by leaps and bounds . Today the viscose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rayon consumed in the United States , the acetate 17 per cent , and the cuprammonium 3 per cent . The nitro-cellulose process is not used in this country . It also is interesting to note that at the present time about four times as much rayon is used as silk , and the amount used is almost equal to that of wool . This is not generally realized , for there still seems to be the false idea among consumers that rayon is something to be shunned . Because of this , the public are slow in realizing that rayon has made it possible for them to have the great variety of fabrics on the market to-day . Already the fiber is used in combination with cotton , wool , and silk . Because it is made by man , it can be changed to suit his will , whereas other fibers are unable to give this variety because they have definite properties which can not be tampered with . Although the methods for making rayon are continually changing so that a more perfect product may be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts concerning its manufacture . Each of the various types differs in methods and materials , but it is necessary for all to have a pure cellulose to begin with . This is procured from spruce pulp or cotton linters . The spruce wood is cut into small chips about of an inch thick by / of an inch long by / of an inch wide . These chips are then treated with an acid solution and cooked in it to remove the natural gums and resins . The acid is removed , the pulp washed , and bleached for the final purification . This process usually takes place in the paper mills . If cotton linters ? the short ends left on the seed during the ginning process  --  are to be used , they are removed from the seed by machine . They also must be specially prepared by passing through various bleaches and purifiers . The  | spruce and cotton cellulose is usually sent to the rayon mills in the form of blotting paper . Before the spinning process can take place , the cellulose must be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which change the cellulose to a soluble form . This powdery substance is then dissolved in a liquid . The solution passes through various mechanical devices before it reaches the proper stage for spinning . The liquid is then forced continuously through fine holes of a metal spinneret . These are made of platinum or a composition of gold and platinum . The filament emerging from the spinneret must be coagulated . This is accomplished by passing it into a liquid bath , or by allowing the air to harden it as a spider spins his web . The viscose and cuprammonium processes use the coagulating bath whereas the acetate is hardened in the air . Several filaments are then collected , twisted together , and made into a skein . The acetate filament is now in a finished form , but the other types must be passed through various bleaches and washes . Some filaments go through a special twisting process in order to obtain the lovely crepe effects such as matelasse . The skeins must be soaked , oiled , or lubricated before this process can take place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the strength , to make the yarn soft and supple , and to coat and bind the filaments together . Various methods are used to place oil , gelatine , or gum on the filament . The extra twisting can then be put into the rayon yarn . The yarn is then wound onto spools or cones , or left in the skeins and shipped to the rayon mill . However , all rayon yarn is not made from continuous filaments twisted together . Some of these are cut into definite lengths varying from one to six inches depending on whether it is to be used as cotton , wool , or silk . This is called cut  | Figure staple and known as spun rayon yarn . These short filaments are then spun as you would cotton , silk , or wool , and the resulting yarn and fabrics resemble cotton , wool , linen , or spun silk . The rayon yarn and the spun rayon yarn which is to be used for warp threads must be converted from a spool or cone into a continuous wide sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on beams . This process is also used in cotton and silk weaving . The warp thread is also sized in order to ensure a more successful product by increasing its strength and preventing breakage of the yarn on the loom . Various sizings may be used such as gelatines , glues , gums , castor oil , soluble oils or soaps . These are usually boiled off in the finishing process . The filling or woof threads also undergo a special preparation and must be given a great deal of attention during the weaving process . Rayon is dry , springy , and has a tendency to become wavy during the weaving . In order to avoid this , a piece of fur is placed in the groove of the shuttle to control it . The temperature and the humidity in the weaving room must be carefully regulated . After weaving , the material generally goes through a boiling-off or scouring process , which removes the oils , fats , and chemicals used in the manufacturing that might prevent proper and even dyeing . It then goes through a desizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric ready for dyeing . Rayon lends itself nicely to dyeing . Various color combinations may be obtained by using different types of rayon and other fibers in the same material . For instance three colors of different hues may be placed in the same dye bath . In this a fabric is put which is made of viscose , acetate , and wool threads . When the dyeing is completed , each fiber has absorbed a different color with the result that you have a mixed colored material . Changeable taffeta may be made by submitting a piece of taffeta made with an acetate warp and a viscose filling to a dye bath , and because each of these rayon fibers takes color differently , the desired effect is obtained . There are certain finishing processes which are important . Tentering straightens the fabric so that the filling threads are  | running at right angles to the warp thread . The material is held in place by metal clips passing over heated pipes which allow it to be stretched . Palmering gives a calendered effect to the material . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives the desired appearance and the soft feeling to the material . It really is an ironing process . Delustering is an important process . It is now possible to produce yarns having normal , semi-dull , or very dull luster . This is done by placing the yarn into solution to which a pigment has been added before it is spun . Most yarns are prepared in this manner , but occasionally it is necessary to remove the luster after it has been woven . This consists in depositing insoluble inorganic salts on the fiber . Barium sulphate is used , followed by Glauber salt . When it is done in this manner , the result is not permanent . Weighting which is often used with the other fibers is not needed in rayon materials because of the nature and the low price of the fiber . Although rayon is often compared with silk , it really should not be . In fact it should not be compared with any of the other fibers , but instead should be recognized as something entirely different . The comparison should be among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great variety of forms which rayon may now assume , there are few if any characteristics which you can test , and feel sure that it applies to all . For it can be made soft or harsh , stiff or sleazy , dull or shiny , heavy or thin as desired . At the store , you will have to trust the clerk to tell you the truth about the fabric , but at home you can burn a piece of material in order to ascertain of what it is made . If it is an acetate , it will burn with no odor , and a small bead will be left . If it is viscose , it will burn with no odor and leave  | no ash . However if the rayon is mixed with either of the vegetable or animal fibers , there will be the characteristic odor and residue of each . Rayon fiber is always weaker when it is wet , and must therefore be handled carefully . If it is stretched too much , it will not regain its normal shape until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inelastic . Rayon materials launder nicely , and white articles do not turn yellow after several washings . It is better to determine how rayon was made before you attempt to clean or press it . For instance , an acetate fabric can not be cleaned with an acetone cleaner because acetone dissolves the fiber . Also , acetate materials like other fine materials must be pressed with a warm iron . If it comes in contact with a hot iron , the fibers melt , fusing together , and the fabric becomes shiny . Good rayon materials are in the same price range as poor quality silks . Therefore it will be cheaper to purchase a good rayon than a good silk , and you probably will not be able to tell the difference . As yet rayons have not been made fine enough to be used to make lovely chiffons and georgette crepes . You often see trade names used for rayon and wonder what they are . One is the American Viscose Corporation which produces both viscose and acetate rayon . Their semi-dull rayon yarns are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is their extra dull rayon yarn . " Seraceta " is their acetate rayon yarn whereas " Fibro " is made of viscose or acetate cut staple . Products of this company are labeled " Crown Tested Quality . " This is a beginning in marking rayon products . Dupont rayon which is known as " Acele " is an acetate . The Tennessee-Eastman Company also make an acetate product , but do not use any trade name .  | Figure " Bemberg " uses the cuprammonium process for their materials . " Celanese " is another synthetic yarn commonly believed to be made by the acetate method . " Nylon " is a new fiber derived from coal , water , and air , and containing no cellulose . It is made by the E. I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company . When making a choice between several pieces of fabric , you should know certain little tests which you can use in the store . The material should be pulled between the fingers to see if the threads will spread easily . If they do , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will therefore not be durable . Another way to determine the firmness of the weave is to estimate the number of threads to the inch . The more there are , the better the fabric is . Then hold it up to the light to see if it has been woven evenly . Naturally the  | one which has a uniform appearance will be a better one to purchase . DO YOU WANT SOME FOOL-PROOF SHOPPING ADVICE ? Although you may have learned thoroughly all of these facts on textiles , and you may feel certain that you can distinguish one fiber from another , and the good from the poor , there is still a possibility that you may be badly fooled when it comes to the actual purchasing of ready-to-wear articles . And I hate to be fooled , do n't you ? The only way to be absolutely fool-proof is to learn everything you can about the commodity , and then only purchase those labeled with correct information which you can interpret . Shopping for Materials Labels should give the brand name or trade mark . They should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government . Directions for care and guarantee for dyeing and against shrinkage should be stated . A guarantee of fast color , not only to sunlight but also to washing and perspiration , is necessary . It is well that the form and variety should be listed as in the case of furs . Some of the things to watch for and understand are these : r . " Pure silk " means what it says , all silk , but it does not tell you how much it has been weighted . " Pure dye silk " on the other hand means that not more than io per cent of any other substance has been added to it . 2 . " All wool " again tells you what it is , but it does not tell you whether it is reworked or virgin wool , or whether it has been made from long or short fibers which will concern its durability . 3 . " Part wool " can mean almost anything , because it does not tell you the exact percentage of fibers in the material .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shrink more than 3 per cent , but it does not mean that it will not shrink at all . Terms such as pure dye may mean rayon , and not silk at all . Because of these misleading terms , it becomes necessary for you as a consumer to insist on correct marking . Do not buy anything which you are not sure of . Ask intelligent questions of the salespeople . Often they know little or nothing about it themselves . What chance have you , then , unless you try to be a wise shopper . All forms of wearing apparel have certain distinguishing characteristics which you should consider before purchasing . Everything you purchase , you will buy because you really need it , because it is attractive , becoming , and serviceable . Extreme styles are poor buys because they can only be worn one season which makes them expensive . If you buy something which you can wear for more than one season , it will naturally lower the cost . Anything which is going to need a great deal of care and cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary person to purchase . Shopping for Hosiery One of the things which you are already buying by yourself is stockings . Do you have good luck , or are you always getting runs in them and having to buy another pair ? There are a few things which may help you to avoid this difficulty . There are four kinds of hose : full-fashioned , semifashioned , tubular , and cut , all of which are made from silk , rayon , wool , cotton , or in combination . Full-fashioned are the best , costing more than the other types but being well worth it . They are made to fit the ' r , foot , and ankle , a process which is accomplished by knitting the material  | in a flat piece and shaping it to fit , just as you would a sweater . It is then joined by a seam at foot and leg , and by this and the full-fashioned marks it may be recognized . Semi-fashioned stockings are knit in a circular piece and shaped by pressing on a form . A mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full-fashioned type . 4 : Tubular stockings have no seams and are used mainly for children . Cut hosiery is made by cutting stockings from fabric such as lace , and shaping them during this process . Stockings may be a constant worry to you because you never seem to be able to find just the right kind . In order to help you solve this problem , you should know certain stocking characteristics , which determine the wearing qualities . First , the weight of your stocking has a great deal to do with it , you know . This is governed by the number of strands twisted in each thread . This varies from two to four strands per thread in the sheer hose to twelve to fourteen strands per thread in service-weight hose . Of course , the kind and quality of the fiber used has a great deal to do with it , as well as the amount of twist in the yarn . The stockings should be reinforced at the top , heel , and foot . If a reinforcement is cotton , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even sheer slipper hose may be obtained with a tiny reinforcement on the sole , which helps a great deal . Often good stockings do not wear well because you buy them too small . They should be long enough in the foot and also in the leg . Although you wan Aockings to wear well , you also wish to have them look nice . Their appearance depends on the smooth-  | ness of the yarn and its weight . This can easily be determined when the clerk runs her hand through the stocking . If there are light and dark streaks in the hose , you immediately know that they will not look well on you . The finer the gauge , the more pleasing is the appearance and the better the quality which also means that you pay more for them . In the finest quality there are 52-58 loops , but 45-51 loops make a good medium quality . The 39-44 loop type is a poor quality . The dull appearance of hose may be obtained in two ways . One is by means of chemicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using grenadine yarns , single strands of raw silk , twisted many times one way and then another . Dyeing also plays its part in the appearance of your hose . Ingrain dyeing , which means that the silk was dyed before it was made into a stocking , is better than dipped dyeing . You , as a buyer , should know these facts , and then when you examine stockings , you should notice the fashion marks . These are obtained during the shaping process by knitting together stitches in order to make the stocking smaller at that point . In very good quality stockings , there may be as many as 86 in a two or three thread , forty-eight-gauge hose ; or 72 in a four thread , forty-two-gauge hose . Inspect your stockings , and see how many fashion marks you have . You should test the hose to see if it is elastic . The top should stretch until it measures eleven to twelve inches at the top and about seven at the instep . All stockings should be carefully labeled so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gauge , the size , the fiber used , and whether they are firsts or seconds . If you demand to know these things before you purchase  | hose , you will not have the amount of trouble you now have in obtaining the right kind . You would do well to examine carefully various brands before you make your choice . It is more economical to purchase at least two pairs alike . It is wise not to buy stockings on sales , as very often hose of inferior quality are offered at this time . " Nylon , " a new synthetic fiber , is now being used for stockings . This material is meant to be run-resistant and it is interesting to note that it dries extremely rapidly after laundering . Shopping for Under-wear Another bit of wearing apparel which you may be buying is underwear . Each year it seems to become more attractive and more tempting to purchase . You will have to steady yourself , and remember not to buy it if it is not going to be pleasing to look at after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the counter because it has cunning bows or perky pleats , but these will look shabby after it has been washed . It is , therefore , better to buy underwear which is more tailored than frilly . If you can not afford expensive undies , then keep to the plainer ones for no lace is better than cheap lace . Good  | lace is expensive . Only the wealthy can afford the very beautiful hand-made linen laces . However , it is possible for you to purchase fine machine-made cotton laces . Cheap laces are coarse and spoil the appearance of the garment . Laces which are familiar to you are Valenciennes ( val ) cluny , filet , Irish , Torchon . Rose Point and Duchess are very lovely . To-day , Alencon lace is often used for your underwear . In order to insure its durability , also purchase the correct size so that the material will not be strained or tear out at the seams . And here is an important point : be sure that the seams are very well made . Tiny French ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be firm as well as small . You know enough about fabrics to realize that if your underwear is going to last you a long time , it must be of good material . You will have to watch for weighted silks and materials which fade easily , for the inexpensive garments are usually made of this type of fabric . Read labels carefully , and buy only those that are truthfully marked . The cost of the garment naturally depends on the kind and quality of the fiber , the construction , the type of workmanship , and the exclusiveness of design . You will , of course , have a preference for the type of underwear you buy , and also the fiber and material of which it is made . Cotton has always been considered the most hygienic , linen the coolest , and wool the warmest . However , to-day silk or rayon are used to a greater extent than any of the other fibers . Some people like to have their underwear made from woven material , whereas others prefer the knitted varieties . This type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more freedom of movement . This is one reason why stout persons prefer it . It is fine to wear while traveling  | because it does not wrinkle very much , is easy to launder , and requires little or no ironing . Open mesh underwear is porous thus allowing the air to circulate , over the skin , and permitting evaporation . Wet clothing conducts heat away from the body , so this is another reason for using knit underwear . However , you know how easy it is to get a run in it , and also how it is liable to stretch out of shape . There should be reinforcements at the crotch , underarms , fastenings , and edges . It is better also to buy this in tailored styles . The rib knit is better than the plain knit , and that fashioned to fit is better than that knitted tubular . The seams should be flat and covered or locked to give comfort and to wear well . No matter what type of undergarment you wear , you should keep in mind when you purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheer dresses need shadow-proof slips ; backless dresses need backless slips ; evening gowns need evening slips . Even panties must be bought with this in mind . Shopping for Dresses , Coats , and Suits You probably are hoping that soon Mother will let you purchase your own dresses , coats , and suits . Maybe she will if you let her see that you can be very thoughtful about it , and not buy something just because Mary Jones did . My mother let me start when I was ten . That was very young , but I really did not do so badly . She sent me to a reliable store where there were good clerks , and this helped a great deal . That first dress I will never forget because it was my pride and joy . The cost of the dress is directly dependent upon the material , the construction , and the workmanship which has  | gone into it . Remember that it is utterly impossible to get something for nothing , so it is your job to be able to distinguish these factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have studied materials so here is a chance to apply that knowledge . Ask questions of the clerk , and request to see the label . You will never be able to ask intelligent questions unless you know something about the problem . The construction is vastly important . Always look at the wrong side . The seams should be wide with finished edges which will not fray out . This also allows for any necessary alterations . The stitching should be continuous in a straight line the entire length of the seam . The closings should be inconspicuous . The entire garment should be cut so that the warp thread is running up and down , except when a true bias is used . Inexpensive frocks are made of pieces cut out of small yardage . The cut should be noticed carefully because otherwise the skirt will not hang evenly , and the sleeves will have a twisted appearance . Cheap clothes will have skimpy pleats , gaudy trimmings , and narrow hems . When it becomes necessary to buy an inexpensive frock , purchase one which is very simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is better to buy one good dress and wear it longer , than it is to purchase two or three cheap ones . Expensive clothes can be distinguished easily by a keen observer because of certain characteristics . Some you know , but also watch the gowns with buttons which really button with tiny loops , or sleeves which close by means of a dart which runs to the elbow instead of closing on the sleeve seams . These are little things , but they are important . Trimming such as buttons , buckles , and clips also are different in expensive clothes .  | You should always try on the dress and stand in front of a triple , full-length mirror in order to see the back and front at the same time . Too many clerks have a tendency to pull the frock in the back so that it looks nice in the front , just to make a sale . Of course , you will only find this in cheap shops . The dress should be roomy enough to allow freedom of movement , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoulders and hips , but should not draw . In order to test this , bend your arms , rounding your shoulders , and see if it pulls . If it feels tight , you should not buy it because it will immediately pull out at the seam . You should try sitting and walking in it in order that you may judge whether it will be comfortable . It is most annoying to pull your skirt when you sit down , or to have your tight skirt catch you when you are in a hurry . In order to show Mother that you know all of these things , act intelligently when you go shopping with her the next time . She will probably be surprised . Once you get in the swing of it , you will have little difficulty , and soon you will be purchasing coats and suits . The principles are the same as for dress buying . However , it will be necessary to look at the lining . It should be well  | constructed and fit , made of good material , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will want a coat which has sufficient lap so that when you sit down you will have enough material to fold over without having to struggle to keep it closed over your knees . If you are not able to purchase a coat with a good fur collar , it is better to purchase a self-trimmed one . And this brings up the problem of good and poor furs . You probably would love to have a fur coat . I remember I did at your age . Although you may not have one for a long time , it is well to know something about furs so that you can judge the trimming on coats and suits . Shopping for Fur There is really no relation between the wearing qualities of fur and the price . Some of the less expensive furs , such as muskrat and raccoon wear beautifully . This depends on the nature of the fur ? its weight , uniformity of thickness , firmness , and elasticity . It then must be carefully treated in the manufacturing process so that it is soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze or wring it between your fingers . If this may be done with ease , then you can feel assured that you have a good piece of fur . To test the thickness and uniformity of the fur , you can blow in it and then watch the manner in which the hairs part . The best furs come from the northern and artic regions . Many of the furs are dyed . If this is done correctly , it does not injure the pelt . When furs have been blended , it is very hard to distinguish them from the very best . As all furs become lighter after exposure to sunlight , this is often done to make the skins appear like new . Did you ever stop to wonder what kind of an animal lapin came from , or cony ? Just good old rabbit . Surprised !  | Well what about barunduki ? Just a little chipmunk . And I suppose you thought that Hudson Seal came from the animals you watch perform by that name in the circus . No , it is just dyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mislead , the Federal Trade Commission has outlawed these misleading " trade names , " and has decreed that a description of each term be given . In brief these are the rulings which have been made : I. That in order to describe a fur , in every case the correct name of the fur must be the last name of the description , and if any dye or blend is used , simulating another fur , the word " dyed " or " blended " must be inserted between the name signifying the fur that is simulated , and the true name of the furs ; as " seal-dyed muskrat " or " mink-dyed marmot. " 2 . All furs shaded , blended , tipped , dyed , or pointed must be described as such ; as " Black-dyed Fox " or " Pointed Fox . " 3 . Where the name of any country or section is used , it shall be the actual country of the origin of the fur as " American Opossum , " Where the name of a country or place is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Sitka-Dyed Fox . " You can see that the Federal Trade Commission is making a great effort to help you with your purchases so that you will not be fooled . When you reach the point where you are going to buy a fur coat , it is well to buy it from a reliable dealer who will give you a bill of sale on which he states exactly of what your coat is made . It should fit well , being wide enough through the shoulders to allow for free movement , and have sufficient lap . When selecting the fur , it is well to remember that long hairs look best on tall people , whereas short flat fur is becoming to short persons . Among the more durable furs are Alaska seal , mink ,  | Figure beaver , racoon , leopard , and muskrat . Broadtail , ermine , chinchilla , moire caracul , and baby kidskin should be purchased for their grace and beauty alone for they are very perishable . Good fur is an investment , but poor fur is a  | Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less expensive type than it is to buy a poor pelt of more costly fur . Shopping for Knitted Garments You probably have often bought sweaters and other knit garments . They , as you know , are comfortable and clinging , which accounts for the ease with which they stretch out  | of shape . They are splendid for sport and informal wear although the fad for knitting has placed it among the more formal types . When buying this kind of garment , you can not afford to buy anything cheap because it so easily sags and becomes pouchy . Knitted or loosely woven garments are warmer than tightly woven ones because they allow circulation of air . Air , as you know , is a poor conductor of heat , and therefore helps to hold the warmth of the body . This is the reason that two light-weight garments are warmer than one very heavy garment . Warp knitting is much better . This can be distinguished because of the lengthwise ridges on the face and crosswise on the back . You should watch closely to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so closely that they exaggerate your figure . Shopping for Shoes It is very necessary for you to know how to buy shoes because this is something that one has to do for oneself . Mother or the clerk does not know how a certain shoe feels on your foot . And you must recognize immediately whether it is going to torture you , or be comfortable , no matter how attractive it may appear . If your feet hurt , there is not a possible chance of your ever having a good time or being a raving beauty . A pain or an ache , even in your big toe , will give you a worried pained expression which is awful to look at . When you slip your feet into the shoes , stand up and walk around a bit . Do not be too sure that they fit . Examine them . They should be one-half inch longer than your foot when you are standing up . There should be a straight inside line . It should fit snugly around the heel and over the instep .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wiggle around a bit . The widest part of the shoe should come at the large toe joint . It is best to have a flexible shank which fits snugly under the arch . The heels should be in proper proportion , so that it will not distort the normal posture . If your shoe can meet all these requirements , it will not allow bent and overlapping toes which rub against each other to form corns , bunions , and fallen arches . In order to be sure that shoes pass the test , draw a pediograph to-night of your feet with your weight on them . Then place your shoe on it , and see if you can observe the outline of your foot . If you can , then you know that you are not purchasing shoes of the correct size . There are shoes for all occasions . Calfskin is a good durable leather and is fine for shoes which must give service . Kid is easily scuffed as the leather is thin and soft . It is used for dress shoes as are suede , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patent leather is serviceable , but being non-porous it is often very uncomfortable . Lastex is also being used . The low-heeled oxford is best for school . The heel can be 3/4 " to 13/4 " high and should be broad . Higher heels can be used for occasional wear . Wooden heels are lighter than leather heels and may be covered to match the shoe . There is also a composition heel which does not become scuffed or marred as leather heels do . There should be a good lining in the shoe . It is always best to find a make of shoe which really fits and gives comfort . Then always buy that kind of shoe . Some manufacturers are making up shoes in different lasts so that they can fit all types of feet .  | Shopping for Hats Hats are difficult to purchase . To-day there are smart hats which make you appear dashing but not beautiful . Then there are the more conservative types which really do frame your face . It is for you to decide whether you want to look pretty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look as attractive as possible and still have snap . This is not easy to do , but experience helps . You can purchase a ready-made hat , or it can be custom made . This means that it is made especially for you and has not been tried on by a hundred others in their vain hunt for just the correct hat . You should stand in front of a full-length mirror to get the entire effect . Do not let the salesgirl bring out more than three hats at a time . If you do , you will be so confused that the hat you finally buy will be a mess . A hat has to be placed just so , or it may make you look like something you are not or do not want to be . It may make you look serious or humorous , dignified or frivolous , sad or gay , alive or wilted , aristocratic or vulgar . If you do not believe me , try the hat at different angles . What is the effect ? The workmanship and the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price . The nearer it is to an original model , the more expensive it will be . You should know your head size so that you can tell the clerk exactly what you wear . If you have an idea of what you want , it will facilitate the purchase . Felt is a good all-year-round type of fabric for a hat . Velvets and straws have a short life as they are worn for only a few weeks each year . In most stores , it is impossible to return hats because of sanitary reasons . Shopping for Gloves Each year you find a greater variety of gloves on the market . They are made of innumerable materials in many different styles , and the cost is determined by the material , style , fashion , and workmanship . Gloves made of fabric should have a close , fine texture . They hold their shape well and have a good appearance . As a rule they wash easily . Leather gloves are made of kid , lamb , goat , sheep , or horse skins . Even reindeer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , pliable glove which stretches and scuffs readily . There are washable kids , but most of them have to be dry cleaned . They are used for dressy and formal wear . Capeskin and doeskins are clumsier but more durable and suited to hard wear . Many of these can be washed nicely . For instance , Kislav gloves are guaranteed to wash and not to crock . If they do , they will give you a new pair . Suede are lovely , but perishable . Black suede gloves always seem to rub off on anything white . Pigskin mades a good durable glove . Fur- or fleece-lined gloves are good for cold weather , but must be purchased larger than your ordinary size . If you do not do this , the circulation in your hand is stopped , and  | your hands are colder than ever . For this reason , mittens that have a thumb in them are excellent for warmth on chilly days . When you are going to give gloves hard wear , you should see that they are reinforced , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are good . Overseams are dainty and inconspicuous , but not strong . Pique seams are less dressy but stronger , whereas prix seams are clumsy and used on cheap gloves . You should also inspect the stitching to see that there are no broken threads . Be sure you know what size gloves you take . Then it is best to have the clerk measure your hand with the thumb tucked under . She will test the length of the glove finger by measuring it with your finger . It will be wise to allow her to put it on your hand . Shopping for Accessories Purses can now be purchased to fit all occasions . They can be made of any material , and many women are having bags made of the material of a certain gown they wish to use it with . In New York the milliner , shoe maker , and bag maker work together on special orders , telephoning each other , getting samples to obtain the exact color . In this way , one can have hat , bag , and shoes especially made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all sizes and shapes . It is well to have a purse of convenient size to hold necessary articles . It should always have a good firm closing , and the talon type is best as it does not allow the bag to open by itself . The purse inside should also be attached securely to the bag so that it will not fall out . It is always well to have a zipper compartment in it for any valuables . Handkerchiefs are usually made of linen which should  | be fine and closely woven . The edges should be finished in such a manner that they will not fray out easily . Other accessories should be purchased to set off the costume . Most of these are novelties and should be bought with care so as not to spend too much money for them . DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS IN THE TRADE ? We have only been discussing your side of the consumer problem . No one could be a consumer if there were no store from which to buy . The home used to be productive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labors have left it , and it is now a consuming center instead . Because of this fact you are dependent upon some one to sell you commodities . And the merchant in turn is dependent upon you to purchase his articles . There should therefore be cooperation between these two wheels of progress . Each is dependent upon the other . The consumer buys what the store has ; the store sells what the consumer wants . It is a continuous circle with no end . As a consumer you make certain demands on merchants according to your choice of garments . You may choose with attention to style , or quality , to workmanship or price . Of course , it is much better if your stylish model is of good material and has fine workmanship . These factors will differ in degree as to your standard of clothes . You may buy expensive clothes , or low-priced ones , or maybe those that fall in the middle . When you have decided on your price range , you are able to find your place in the realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style which are definitely the newest thing on the market . They cause people to turn around and look at you . These will be expensive no matter what bracket you purchase them in ,  | because they are fads which will go out of style quickly . I Then there are the exclusive models , worn by the best dressed women in the world . They can only be purchased by the wealthy because they are so expensive . When a thing is rare , naturally the price is higher . This is what happens to this type of clothes because they are not allowed to become common . The popular models are those which have met the demands of the general public . Nearly everybody likes them ? young and old , stout or thin , tall or short . You will see yourself coming and going . The conservative styles change little from one season to another . These , of course , will be cheaper in the long run because you can wear them longer . You probably will not feel quite so smartly gowned in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always with us , and can always be worn . They last for years . Can you think of any garments which fall into this class ? When you combine quality with style , you will be a better shopper . You will then have a garment which will be finer in every way as far as material and workmanship are concerned . Then you may be one of these people who want to get value received for the money spent . If you are , and you really should be , you will shop around until you feel satisfied that the garment you buy is worth the money you spend for it . It always does your heart good when you think that at last you have gotten a real bargain . Then because some of you wish to have service while you shop and others do not , you find the need for the different types of stores . Some women want comfort while they shop . They demand homelike atmosphere in the furnishing in the store . This type of place naturally carries  | expensive clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying on clothes with fifty other people , and clutching their pocket-books with their teeth or perhaps stepping on them , clothes may be purchased at a very much reduced rate . The more service one demands , the higher the price will be . If you can get as much satisfaction and pleasure from imitations , your clothes will be much cheaper . It is only when you demand real sable , flawless diamonds , virgin wool , unweighted silks , and all-silk hosiery that you become unhappy because you can not have them . When this becomes the case , do not fret and stew about it , but learn to be satisfied with what you have , and carry with you the hope that some day you may honestly have your heart 's desire . The demands you make also influence the price of clothing . When more and more people begin to wear and use the same thing , it becomes popular , then common , and the price goes down and down . If there is no further call for an article , the merchant keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the beginning of the season , prices are always higher . By the middle , they have started to drop , and by the end you can probably get a bargain . However , sometimes this does not work out because fashion changes so rapidly that what is good for the winter season this year may be entirely out by next . If this is so , then you have to sacrifice style for price . These constant changes are demanded because women are continually wanting something different . This seems to be a trait of human nature , and keen people in the clothing field are using it to advantage . Since the mass of the people , are interested in low prices , it becomes necessary to have mass production . With this comes mechanical labor which will eliminate waste . Each year working conditions have been improved until to-day  | Figure there is no comparison between the well-lighted workrooms and the old sweat-shops . It is interesting to note the procedure by which a dress is constructed . The fabric must be received at the factory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and measurement . It is sponged by a special machine and is then ready to be cut . Layers and layers of material are placed  | together , and on top is placed the pattern . This pattern is based on an average figure for the various sizes . The pattern is marked and material cut by an electric shear . Very small pieces must be cut by hand . The parts of the garment are fastened together with a ticket . It then goes to the seamers where it is stitched by machine . People are specially trained for operating these power machines and do nothing else on the garment . It is then tried on models , after which it is sent to the trimmer . The finisher then gets the body , cuffs , and collars which she puts together . The garment is inspected by the foreman who will either find it satisfactory or not . If it does not pass the test , it is returned to the worker for alterations . After the buttons have been sewed on , button holes made , and trimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then ready for the final examination . A record is kept of the different models so that copies can be made . Wearing apparel made in this type of production is inexpensive . The dress may be one of a hundred or a thousand . The material is cheap , and sooner or later the seams will rip . Mass production has a definite effect on the clothing industry . It has a tendency to abolish individuality of tastes because it standardizes the pattern , the style , and the size . It also has changed the life of the worker by allowing him more time for leisure . It has done away with the spirit of rivalry because the whole staff is working together for a perfect product . As progress is made from cheap garments to the more expensive types , you notice that the higher the price is the more care goes with its construction , until you reach the exclusive models which are made especially for you . When you do not care for the very inexpensive clothes ,  | and you can not afford the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to sew well so that you can copy the good models yourself . It is not enough simply to know how a garment is produced , but you should also know how it is marketed or sold to you . To-day this is accomplished for the most part by a merchant owning the store where you shop . Can you think of any other way that this has ever been handled in your community ? Unless it is a very large store , it will probably appeal to only one group of people . For instance , its clientele may be from the upper social class , the middle or professional people , or the working class . It is often thought best to buy wearing apparel from a shop that specializes in it , rather than in a department store . You will have to judge this fact for yourself in your own community . The store will have a group of buyers who may go to New York to order the clothes personally , or they may work through the resident buyers in New York who purchase for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles throughout the country . These buyers visit the wholesale merchant who has his own manufacturing center or buys from a manufacturer . At his office , models are paraded on mannequins before the buyers so that they can decide what they want , always keeping in mind the needs of the community , and its financial status . As it costs more to sell a garment than to manufacture it , it becomes necessary for the buyer to set the price of garments so that he will make a profit . This mark-up is usually 50 per cent above the wholesale price , which will probably allow the merchant to make a profit of 33 1-3 per cent . On sales , the price of the article is usually lowered one third of the original price . Instalment buying is usually a poor policy because it  | allows people to buy more than they can afford . This is particularly true of luxuries such as fur coats and jewelry . You should never purchase anything unless you know that you have the money for it . What fun can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the money is coming from ? Shopping by mail is becoming more popular . It used to be done mostly in rural communities , but now people in towns and cities send to New York for articles which they see pictured in newspapers or magazines . Some of the magazines conduct a special service , giving each month a list of very good finds . In order to make this work out , the larger stores have buyers who do nothing else but look after these orders . Now that you realize both sides of the consumer problem , it is wise for you to conduct yourself in a courteous manner when you go shopping . Salespeople are human beings and should be treated as such . It is wise to shop when there are only a few people in the stores . Enough people have to shop on Saturdays . Do not handle everything you see , and do not ask a clerk to show you everything in the show case when you have no intention of buying anything . This same principle applies to trying on garments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time when you are not going to compensate her for it . Some people have a habit of buying things with no intention of keeping them . This has been known to be done by certain women just so their neighbors will be impressed . All of these little things send up the price of the articles you will sometime purchase . It is my sincere desire that after this discussion you will try to become a wise consumer . Facts and conditions will continually change , and you must keep abreast of the times . Watch carefully your , magazines and newspapers for articles  | on new inventions and regulations governing this subject . The study has just begun , you must further it . SUGGESTED CLASS ACTIVITIES z . Bring to class samples of material which you wish to test in order to find out the fiber of which they are made . Analyze them as to weave and use . 2 . Test swatches of material for fastness to sun , laundering , and perspiration . Test them also for shrinkage . 3 . Visit factories to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments . 4 . Gather as many labels and guarantees from all types of clothing commodities as possible so that you may study them to see if they give correct information . 5 .

You can also follow out No. 6 with other wearing apparel such as underwear . 8 . Select a piece of woolen material which you would use for a skirt ; worsted for a tailored suit ; flat crepe for a slip ; rayon for an afternoon dress ; linen for a spectator sports dress ; cotton for shorts . 9 .

Write a description of what you would say and do when you go to purchase a pair of silk stockings . Footnote  | Footnote  | What Will You Wear ? " What shall I wear , Mother , " is a familiar cry in every household . Did you ever stop to wonder why ? Is it because you have an oversupply of clothes ? Is it because you are a timid soul and must be told ? Or is it because you do not know what is proper for you to wear for a particular occasion ? Probably it is the last one . So few of you really wear the correct clothes . Usually you need a new dress , or it is your turn in your family to have one , so you hurry down town and purchase something . If your eye happens to alight on an attractive sport dress you buy it , whether it is what you really need or not . Then you proceed to wear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a dance or party , and you wonder why you never feel or look right . It is because you have not learned to pick clothes for certain occasions and to wear them only at that time . Unless you have an unlimited clothing allowance , you can plainly see that you will not be able to have many clothes suitable for each of the various occasions . However , you will feel well dressed , if you know that you have on the correct costume , even though you may have worn it many times . If you also know what is proper to wear for each occasion , you will not need to bother Mother so much . Having suitable clothes for all occasions is a new idea for  | the average person . You have heard some older member of your family tell about her Sunday dress of black taffeta which she wore as her best for a number of years . Then she had a week-day dress which she wore for working . Obviously it did not take her much time to make up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there has developed a specialized dress for each occasion , and it seems necessary for you to know all you can about it . This knowledge will save you many an uncomfortable hour . Some girls are a bit conceited and think they are the last word in what the well-dressed woman should wear . Often they are the ones who need the greatest amount of help . WHAT WILL YOU WEAR TO SCHOOL ? Let us start with the school dress and continue on through the day discussing what is appropriate for each hour . Many girls seem to think that party dresses are much more important than school clothes , and so they give little time and thought to everyday things . That , of course , is an erroneous idea , because you spend most of your time in school and should consider with great care what you should wear for this time . You probably have noticed lately that in the fall , the most important stores open college shops in order to help the girls choose the proper clothes . If you have observed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls to wear simple tailored clothes for school . They are trim looking , sturdy , and durable with a sporty air about them . Yet , you can not rightly call them sport clothes although some of them can be used for that purpose . They definitely are easy to care for , to keep pressed , and can be laundered instead of dry cleaned .  | I am a great advocate of sweaters and skirts for school wear because they provide an opportunity for great variety . With one skirt of a standard color , two or three sweaters can be worn . Since knitting is so much in vogue at the present time , many sweaters cost little money . In order to set off skirts and sweaters and give variety , several scarfs and belts can be used as accessories . The girl who is handy can make her own scarfs from bits of material which have been discarded . A string of pearls is also worn with a Brooks sweater . There are now many novelty sweaters being used as a variation for the classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for evening as well as daytime wear . Also , with skirts one can wear clever blouses of jersey or velveteen in winter , and perky cotton or linen in warmer weather . There are many clever jackets of mannish cut , which also are very suitable and give another variation to the outfit . Therefore , in planning a year 's wardrobe consider a couple of skirts as the foundation , and then by using sweaters , blouses , and jackets with appropriate accessories , you can build an ideal school wardrobe . There are also many attractive one-piece dresses of simple line which can be used , but naturally they will not give as great a variety to a wardrobe as the skirt type . This type of  | dress should be tailored . It can be made of light weight wool , plain silk , linen , or cotton such as gingham , pique , or broadcloth . Trim collars and cuffs add to the attractiveness of the dress , and several sets will allow for some variety . You should , however , avoid wearing fussy clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes here . That is , of course , a very bad idea and should never be indulged in . Have you ever watched a girl who has on a fancy dress at school ? Does she act quite natural ? Of course not , because she really is afraid of spoiling it ; moreover , she likes your admiring glances . In order to do your best work , you must feel well in your clothes by knowing that they are correct . To go with your school dress , you should wear low flatheeled oxfords . They really are the only suitable type , and now they are available in many different styles and materials . Many of you will tell me that you can not wear low heels because your arches are too high . That , of course , is a stupid idea , because every one can wear them , and at present they are very fashionable . The trouble has been that most girls have felt more grown up in high heels and have not realized that they were not suitable for school wear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear high heels , the muscles in the back of your leg have a tendency to tighten up , because they are not being used . Then when you wear low heels you have a severe pain in your leg because you are stretching those muscles . If you want to avoid this , you should wear low heels during the day , and then put on your high heels in the evening , for a dressy occasion . You should always try hard to keep your feet in good condition . There are a number of good foot exercises you can practise to help strengthen your arches . With oxfords a durable type of silk or lisle hose should be  | worn . Here is the place I want to mention ankle socks . They should not be worn to school . Immediately you say , " Why ? " There are a number of reasons . In the first place , they were designed for sport . By slipping these socks on , it enables the player to get a better grip with his toes . They are fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the second place , do you think that they add anything to your attractiveness ? If you wear them over your silk stockings , you immediately draw attention to your ankles . Is that what you want to do ? Few of you have dainty ankles , and they certainly can not be called attractive with a big wad of material around them . Then probably some of you dare to appear with bare legs ; and such legs ? red , rough , hairy , pudgy , or skinny ; in other words , nothing to show to anybody . Yet many girls do . If you are going to go bare-legged , please read in section eleven how to make your legs beautiful . Unless your legs have a lovely bronzed coat of tan on them and are smooth and well shaped , you can not appear at school that way . But you will not wear ankle socks even then . You can buy a special foot-covering to wear which will not show , or you can use plenty of foot powder in your shoes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appear now and then at school . Again they were made for sports , and school is no place for them . For a coat to wear to school , one of tweed , camel 's hair , or some other type of durable material is serviceable . It should be strictly tailored and have almost a mannish appearance . Such a coat can be worn year in and year out , because it never goes out of style . A simple felt hat is always a wise choice , for it can be worn the year around with a  | great deal of abuse and still look well . If you purchase a good one , it can always be reblocked as styles change . There are always days when the weather is bad . If your coat has been rain-proofed at the factory , then you will not need a raincoat . Otherwise , it is always best to have a raincoat which will keep your other clothing in good condition . Be sure you have galoshes and rubbers so that your feet will be well protected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . The correctly and smartly gowned woman never appears on the street without them , and then they also keep hands in much better condition . Wool , cotton , or pigskin gloves are always good for school wear . You are now outwardly , completely attired for school except for handkerchief which may be very gay , and other accessories such as jewelry . It is always best to use as little as possible , and unless you can have good costume jewelry , it is better to go without . The ten-cent variety is usually not very pleasing unless you select it carefully . Ear-rings of course have no place at all in school attire , and should seldom be used by a high-school girl , no matter how sophisticated she may think she is.  | WHAT WILL YOU WEAR FOR SPORTS ? As some of your sport activities take place in school , it seems wise to consider them next . As you know , each year brings a more specialized outfit for each sport . And as women are now taking up all types of sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the subject . Luckily only a few of you will indulge in all of them , and most of you will only participate in a few of these activities . Swimming is a common sport and is enjoyed by many , so let us consider it first . It was not so very long ago that the bathing costume was a cover-all affair . I can remember when I was learning to swim , my mother made me an outfit which would surely make you laugh . It was made of a blue fine serge and had a pair of bloomers attached to a bodice . Over this was worn a complete dress-like covering which had a white flannel sailor collar and cuffs trimmed with soutache braid . Belt and buttons completed the suit . This was worn with long black stockings and a pair of bathing shoes made of blue satin and trimmed with white which laced well above the ankle . Can you imagine such an outfit ? You can guess now why some of your elders are shocked at your abbreviated costumes . There , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit . First , what kind of a figure have you ; and second , do you really swim or do you paddle about and wear your bathing suit only as a beach costume ? These things should definitely be thought of before purchasing a suit . In the first place , have you noticed how few really attractive people you see on the beach ? This is due mainly to the fact that few people have nice figures which can appear in public practically nude . Most people are too fat or too skinny . They either are bulgy in spots , or their bones stick out like swords . Yet they think nothing at all about putting on a scant bathing suit and parading up and down to be viewed by the public . Remember a lovely figure is probably the most beautiful thing in the world , but when figures are had , they are ugly . So before you dash about in an abbreviated suit , I think you ought to do something about your figure , so that people will not snicker and stare as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's activity in the water . The girl who is intent upon swimming will choose a plain one-piece suit , knitted of good wool . It will fit snugly , well up on the shoulders so that the shoulder straps will not slip off . It will be more attractive if there is a little skirt attached . Any color is suitable , although white has a tendency to be transparent when wet . The girl who wades and swims a few strokes can choose a fancier outfit , although I still think the first is best . There are some suits which have a jersey jumper and a gingham top which are quite practical . Then also there are some of silk jersey which can be used if you are not much of a swimmer . With either of these suits a wrap may be made of turkish toweling or of the material of the suit . Or one can have a coat , cape , trousers , or skirt as she chooses .  | However , the beach-sitter , who wants to get a suntan and be fashionable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in clever materials which have been fashioned in trick and smart ways . One season at the winter beaches the designers showed a smart suit of white jersey silk which was decorated with blue anchors , and to go with it was an interesting dress of the same material which buttoned the entire length in the front . Each year the suits become a little more brief than the year before , until now tiny pairs of trunks and narrow brassieres are being worn . Certainly they have now reached their scantiest point , and soon the fashion may change its trend again . As with all other costumes , there are always appropriate accessories , and a great variety of bathing shoes , hats , caps , and bags . As for the sandals , remember that for walking they should fit well , and fasten so that they will not slip at the heel . And the cap should keep out as much water as possible . If I were you , I would take along a pair of dark glasses . They are such a help in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the last few years , there has developed the sleeveless and sometimes backless tennis dress . This type of wearing apparel should of course be worn only for active sports , and when the game is finished , a jacket of the same material may be worn . These dresses should be loose and simple , allowing great freedom of movement , and easy to launder . Professional tennis stars often wear an extremely short pleated jumper dress . Recently , some of the great tennis stars have started wearing shorts for tennis . This , of course , is permissible , but it is best to have a skirt near at hand to slip on when the game is over . The wrap-around type is best . Again , you should consider your figure before purchasing a pair of  | shorts . If your hips and upper part of your legs are large and fat , you should never wear them . Here is the place to wear short wool ankle socks and sneakers . Golf is becoming more popular all of the time , and so you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports the costume should allow great freedom . Sweaters and skirts are the universal costume for this sport , except in very warm weather when a shirt-waist type of dress is often worn . Dresses of this type are always very tailored , with a circular or pleated skirt , and the waist either gathered or fastened with a pleat on to a yoke . On cold fall days a jacket is essential for warmth . Spiked shoes , of course , are best , and it is wise to have them water-proofed . Culottes and slacks are sometimes used for golf . For those who like it , of course there is no sport as enjoyable as horse-back riding . There is a specialized outfit for this sport . The type will depend on whether the riding is formal or informal . Riding in such a place as Central Park in New York City is termed formal riding and riding in the country over the mountain trails calls for an informal type of clothes . The formal type of clothes consists of breeches or jodhpurs worn with a fitted coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just below the knee , and jodhpurs are worn with a low boot which just covers the ankle . With the formal coat , a mannish blouse and vest are worn and usually a stock collar To top this is a hat very much like a derby or a small felt . Then there are gloves especially made for this purpose . This type of habit is extremely expensive , but it can be worn for years . For informal riding , the same type of breeches and boots or jodhpurs is suitable , but with this is worn a gay shirt and suede vest . The shirt may be of cotton such as gingham , or  | in colder weather , of jersey . Chilly days call for a short jacket of leather or wool . String gloves are nice to have for warm days . Since many people who enjoy riding are spending time in the West , it seems wise to consider life on the dude ranches . The average easterner will dress herself up like the cowboy in the circus if she is not careful . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton or wool shirt , left open at the neck so that the kerchief may be jauntily tied at the proper angle . Boots and hat for this costume should be bought in the West . In addition a short warm jacket and some sweaters are necessary . Knit underwear is the best to wear under any riding outfit , and lisle or wool socks should be long enough to come above the boot tops . During the winter you no doubt will go skating . If you plan to do some figure skating , you will need a dress with a short , circular skirt . These are usually made of velvet or soft wool . Sometime a snug-fitting jacket and a skirt are used . Special wool panties and opera hose must be worn with this outfit . Then for skiing and toboganning there are the suits made of water-repellent material . The trousers may be full or taper at the ankle . Gay flannel shirts or sweaters are worn under the jackets . Heavy boots and wool hose are essential to this costume . No doubt you wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , but as you have noticed they have been worn too often at the wrong time . They are excellent for sailing . By this I do not mean that you should don them for trans-Atlantic travel . However , they are often seen on cruise ships , private yachts , or sailboats . But when they are worn , they must always be beautifully tailored , or they will look sloppy . They can be worn nicely for fishing , for it is  | possible to tuck the trousers into the top of boots . They can also be used for hiking . However , a better costume for hiking or hunting is a circular or pleated skirt with warm sweater or jacket to accompany it . Spiked shoes are helpful as is a jaunty felt hat to keep hair from becoming entangled in the tree branches . There are many other sports , but those that have been mentioned are the most common . There is a phase of sport life which we should consider , and that is the clothes that the spectators should wear when viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they should be suited to the weather . For instance , a football outfit should be warm . It should be tailored and durable . An outfit which may get dirty has no place at this type of game when everybody is jumping up and down . Therefore , rough woolen suits and coats which may be fur-collared worn with sporty felt hats are always good . Remember that feet and hands will surely get cold , so wear warm gloves and hose . It will not hurt to add a pair of wool panties to your underwear list . For summer sports , the spectator clothes will usually consist of a linen or silk dress worn with a jacket and will have some decorative touch , which will be an idea for accessories . These clothes are not classed as sport clothes , nor can they be considered afternoon clothes . They really fall in a class between these two . There are also spectator shoes ? white oxfords or pumps with a cuban heel . Sometimes they are trimmed with black or brown . Hat , gloves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS SUITABLE FOR STREET WEAR ? There probably is no better outfit for street wear than the tailored suit . This is most appropriate for shopping . By  | changing the type of blouse , one can be correctly dressed for wherever you go all day . A street costume should be dark in color in order not to attract attention . Another type which is good is a black , dark blue , gray , brown , or green dress , cut simply with very good lines . It must be devoid of any fussy trimming . This is the type of outfit you should wear when you go to obtain a job , and it is the kind of clothes you should wear in a business office . They are definitely not dressy , but can also be worn for an afternoon tea by simply putting on a lingerie collar , or a bit of jewelry . When you are older and can have a fur scarf , you will enjoy wearing it with this costume . Your coat again should be in keeping with the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sporty . A trim-looking hat to match the outfit with gloves and bag should always be used . Washable gloves are best because they are very liable to soil immediately . A cuban heel oxford , one-strap slipper , or pump is always good for street wear . WHAT IS SUITABLE FOR AFTERNOON WEAR ? An afternoon outfit is usually dressier than those for the previous occasions which we have discussed . It can be of slightly brighter colors if desired than the street clothes . Usually , the dress is of silk , and in the fall and winter , some very sheer wools may be used . The length of the skirt is changed according to the time of the day it is to be used . Afternoon clothes may be a bit longer than sport , school , or street clothes . The trimming on these dresses is more elaborate , and usually the details of the dress are too . This type of dress is appropriate for afternoon teas and bridge parties , for informal parties in the evening , and the theater . Your hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  | now you can at last wear French-heeled shoes . You should also have a dress coat to wear , as a sport coat just will not do . This coat will be more fitted and probably will be furtrimmed . There are also elaborate suits of velvet which are correct for afternoon wear . WHAT WILL YOU WEAR IN THE EVENING ? When we reach evening wear , we have to divide it into informal and formal clothes . The informal type you may possibly call a Sunday night dress . This is a poor name for it because people never dress formally on Sunday evenings . These clothes are ankle length and do have sleeves . The sleeves may be either long or short . Sometimes the back of the dress may be cut rather low . Many times you will find that this dress is an evening dress worn with a jacket . This is really a splendid way to have it because then you have two dresses in one . You will always wear a small dinner hat when you wear this type of dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be worn with it and sheer hose . You probably like the toe-less type of sandal , but again keep away from them unless you have beautiful feet and manicured toes . You will look much nicer with sheer hose on . It is hard to find a coat which is just right for this dress . However , a velvet coat or cape can be worn nicely , and a fur cape or coat is always good . It may be wise to mention that there are certain furs which can be worn for all occasions , such as mink , but as a general rule , sport furs such as raccoon will not look well for evening wear . Your bag will be a small one of a fabric like velvet or silk crepe which blends with the costume . Of course , there will be gloves , usually white or of the fabric and the color of the dress . This type of dress can be worn for restaurant  | dining , theater , informal dances when your escort is wearing a business suit or a tuxedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the hour is wearing . Strictly formal clothes call for the man to wear his tail coat , but men have gotten sadly out of the habit of doing this . Formal clothes are appropriate when your escort is in his tuxedo . However , you should realize that it is not really correct . Formal evening clothes are very lovely , made of beautiful material and gorgeous colors . Usually there is very little to the bodice of the dress , but again , do not be too anxious to expose a bony back or shoulders . Try to camouflage it a bit with a floating scarf . Here is the time to wear stunning jewelry , but if you do not own any nice pieces , it is better to go without . There are always lovely evening wraps to wear with evening clothes . Usually , they are luxurious in velvet and fur . Sandals and very sheer stockings should blend with the dress . A hat is out of place with this costume , but occasionally fashion sponsors the mode for elaborate coiffures and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . Evening gloves may be of kid , suede , or of fabric , and a bag will probably be very elaborate of pearls or rhinestones , or of gold or silver brocade . These clothes are very perishable and have to be taken care of . They are worn only a few times , and thus become an expensive item in your wardrobe . WHAT WILL YOU WEAR FOR LOUNGING AND SLEEPING ? When the day is ended , you will want to relax and rest . To-day there are delightful negligees of all kinds . No doubt you will get more use out of a tailored flannel robe , which you can slip into , and just lounge . You can also get silk ones  | of the same design which are extremely attractive . You will probably long for an elaborate negligee , but unless you have lots of money and the type of home to wear it in , it will be a waste of money . There are also lounging pajamas , but these really are not very fashionable just at present . Pajamas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as formerly . The tailored nightgown is used instead . You will have to decide between mules and slippers , but remember that slippers are much more satisfactory , although you may not think that they are as cute . WHAT CLOTHES WILL YOU TAKE ON A TRIP ? Although you have covered all the hours of the day , there are certain times when you have to consider your clothes from a different angle . This happens when you are about to go on a trip . You always wonder what you had better take with you . Any type of travel will of course have a tendency to be dirty . If it is a train trip , remember to wear a dark , tailored dress . A white collar and cuffs look nice when you start , but they do not always look so well at the end of the trip . Now that there are air-conditioned trains , you can keep cool in summer which is such a help . The type of clothes for street wear is excellent  | for traveling . The weight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the place where you are going . Figure On shipboard , sport clothes are grand for day wear . In the evening you will dress for dinner except on Sunday and the first night out , when it is optional . When planning a travel wardrobe , there are two impor-  | tant things to remember . First , too much luggage is a nuisance , and second , you must look well at all times . In order to accomplish this , it is necessary to plan a wardrobe around one color scheme . Navy blue is always good . By choosing one color , you can reduce the accessories to a minimum , which always saves luggage . Print dresses are very satisfactory because they do not show the signs of travel as quickly as plain colors . Evening dresses should be simple , and if accompanied by scarfs or capes , will eliminate the need for dinner clothes . If you are taking an extended trip , you will want to take along clothes which will pack nicely . Lace is always good to have for evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials of which you can have dresses made . In fact , there is one material which looks better if it does become mussed . It is a great help to you if you know how to pack well . One secret of packing is to avoid putting shoes , cosmetics , and odds and ends in with your outer garments . In order to help you avoid this , all kinds and types of luggage are now on the market . There are special bags for shoes , for hats , for cosmetics , and a weekend case for lingerie . Then there are different types of cases for your outer garments , either the wardrobe variety or the flat suitcase . The longer the suitcase is , the better it will be , for then you avoid having too many creases in your garments . Placing tissue paper in sleeves , and between the folds will help to avoid unnecessary wrinkles . If pleats or loose-floating parts are pinned into place , a costume will arrive in much better condition . When folding a garment , place it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . This allows the center front of the dress to be free from creases . Sometimes , pieces of cardboard cut to fit the suitcase , will help give a smooth  | Courtesy of the Oshkosh Trunk , Inc . Gaily and carefully she packs her wardrobe in these various bags with anticipation of the vacation that is just beginning . foundation for each garment . If there are any vacant corners , or if the case is not packed full , you should put tissue paper in them to prevent the articles from slipping around . Many accidents also occur if one is not careful to place cork and tops on bottles securely . You have to consider the laundry problem , so do not take a number of dresses with white collar and cuffs , because they will cause you a great deal of unhappiness . Underwear  | should be very simple and easily laundered . When you are going to take a trip and do not know exactly what to take , your teacher will help you , or the better magazines have a service department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do not have any costume especially for church , and yet it seems as if it should be considered . Perhaps , you like to get all dressed up and go to church in new clothes , because you think that a large number of people will have the opportunity of admiring you there . Of course , that is a poor idea , and you should never think of it . It will be best to wear subdued clothing , both in color and in line , so that you will not attract attention . WHAT WILL YOU INCLUDE IN YOUR TROUSSEAU ? Very often , I find that many high-school girls marry soon after they have graduated , and because of this , it seems wise to discuss the trousseau and wedding dress . The trousseau of every girl will be different owing to the fact that this depends on the type of life you are going to lead after you are married . It will also depend on the amount of money you have to spend . With these two things in mind , jot down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the new garments which you would like to have . Your clothes should be in keeping with the standard of living that you and your husband are going to set in ycur new home . The girl who is going to do her own housework must include several attractive , simple wash dresses and aprons for this purpose . For the girl who is to have servants this problem is eliminated . If life is to be full of social activities , the bride will need evening , dinner , and at-home garments . But , if her social life is going to consist of an evening at the movies once in  | a while , and a gathering of a few friends in her home , she will not need to spend anything for these clothes . It used to be the idea that when one married , she should have clothes enough to last for a year . However , that is not the best thing to-day , as fashion changes so rapidly . Great care should be given to the choice of underwear . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much of it as she wants . If you must care for it yourself , select the simple tailored type , for pleats , lace , and ribbons are hard to launder . If great pains are not taken the garments will soon look very messy . Also , keep in mind that a wife must always look as charming as a sweetheart . Great thought should be given to the type of wedding you are going to have . Your mother will probably want to see you in a wedding gown and veil , and I suppose it is rather nice to think about when you are old and gray . However , the bride should decide . If she does want to wear the traditional wedding gown , then the time and place of the wedding will influence the type she will have . Money will also play a big part in it , but it is possible to have a lovely wedding quite inexpensively . The wedding dress should above all things fit one 's personality . If you like ruffles , then be sure and wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple clothes , wear that type . If there is to be a church wedding with a large number witnessing the marriage , the gown should be elaborate . This does not mean that it has to be lavishly trimmed , but the material should be more beautiful , and the train a bit longer . At a recent wedding of some prominence the bride chose heirloom satin for the material for her dress . She had designed the gown herself . It was very simple , but the line and material were beautiful . The outstanding point of the dress was the back which is most important because that is  | the part the people observe most . The bodice buttoned down the back to the waistline with tiny buttons , and the skirt swept off into a regal train. , There was only one seam in the skirt , and this was in the center back . This was made possible by having the length of the skirt the crosswise of the material . The seam started at the waistline and tapered in a bias line to the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride wore a braided halo of the satin to hold her tulle veil in place . It fitted snugly to her head . The veil should be about twelves inches longer than the train . She carried a sheath of calla lilies , which helped to give her a Madonnalike appearance . From this costly type of gown , you can go down through varying grades until you reach a very inexpensive costume . Instead of satin , you can use lace , dull crepe , taffeta , or velvet with a tulle , lace , or tulle and lace veil . If the sleeves are short , gloves must be worn . If the wedding is to be at home , the gown will be less elaborate , and the train will be quite short , unless it is to be a large affair . If the wedding is in the summer , a beautiful organdy frock may be worn with a short veil . This will be very charming and , of course , much cheaper . Usually , in a large church wedding , there are several attendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find dresses , hats , and accessories which seem to be just right . Each bridesmaid will probably be a different type , and yet , the outfits must look well on all . In planning your color scheme , remember that the effect must be pleasing . They are a background for the bride , and the picture must be beautiful . In the spring and summer , the color scheme will be light and airy ; whereas in the fall and winter , rich darker tones are in keeping with the season . At the wedding of the bride I just described , the color  | scheme was a pinky peach with a cloud blue . The maid of honor wore an entire blue outfit like the bridesmaids ' who were gowned in peach chiffon frocks made with wide sweeping skirts which fell in a short train . Over these were worn blue starched lace coats , which were perky and gave a delightful effect over the chiffon . They had high flattering collars . Blue lace halo hats were decorated with a few peach blossoms over each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maids , a tiny fluttering blue tulle veil was added to each hat which just touched the tip of the nose . There were blue suede gloves which wrinkled nicely at the wrist , and pale blue sandals and stockings to match . Their bouquets were of peach colored flowers such as African daisies , tied with wide blue crepe de chine ribbon . An orchid corsage was coyly placed in the bouquet so that each of the girls could take it out and wear it after the wedding . The wedding took place in a lovely old cathedral before a gold altar . The church was exquisitely decorated with thousands of lilies . You can imagine that for the guests , the wedding was a pleasing spectacle . For the girl who does not want to be married in traditional white , a suit is the very nicest thing to wear . A dress brings up the problem of finding a coat to go well with it . A suit is an attractive outfit , and it makes a good going-away outfit . This type of wedding calls for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride 's . A shoulder corsage takes the place of a bridal bouquet . No doubt you are all wondering about your wedding and sometimes find yourself planning it although there are no prospects . Remember there is no great hurry about it , and when the time comes you will find that it is a lot of fun , but also a great deal of work . In order that you will never look conspicuous , you must  | learn to select and wear clothes which are suitable for the occasion . It is a mark of good breeding always to wear clothes which are appropriate for the hour , the place , and the occasion . SUGGESTED CLASS ACTIVITIES 1 .

To buy an outfit is a comparatively recent idea in clothing . One used to purchase a dress , or a coat , or a hat with little thought as to what was to be worn with it . Then she wondered why she never seemed to look nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young lady who selected her Easter outfit in this manner . Mary 's father had told her that she could have a certain sum of money each Saturday for a number of weeks before Easter with which to purchase her costume . She was delighted and the first Saturday she looked about for a coat . Suddenly a brown and white checked sport coat caught her eye , and she decided immediately that she had found the one she wanted . This was sent home , admired , and then stored away until Easter morn . The next Saturday found her shopping for a dress . Finally she found one , a lovely afternoon dress of soft rose crepe de chine , beautifully draped , with pretty lingerie touches on the collar and cuffs . Again , home it went and was carefully put away . And the third Saturday , she shopped for a hat , shoes , stockings , bag , and gloves . For a hat , she selected a bluish-green turban with a tiny nose veil . She decided upon black sport oxfords like her friend 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pair of white wash gloves . With a sigh of relief , she struggled home , feeling sure that at last she would appear very attractive the next day .  | She was up early Easter morning which happened to be a perfectly beautiful day . She carefully bathed and dressed . Everything seemed to fit nicely , and she was pleased with her dress . Then she took a look at herself in a long mirror . Something was wrong ; the shoes did not seem to be right for the dress . She slipped on her hat . That looked even worse . The colors clashed . Hurriedly , she slipped into her coat , and it did not help a bit . She felt badly . She knew she was all wrong , and yet there was not a single thing to do about it . She must go to church . Coming home from church , she thought it all over . She had mixed sport and dress clothes together . She had not watched color combinations . Nothing seemed to be suitable when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to study outfit building , so that she would never make this mistake again . If by any chance you think that this tale is far fetched , just look at yourself , then look at those about you , and if you want to see this mistake displayed extensively , journey down to a busy shopping corner , and watch the people pass by . In five minutes , you will see a half a dozen cases equally as bad as the one I have described . If you do not find them , it is probably because you are unable to judge what is good and bad . No longer can you buy clothes separately , but instead , you must always consider all parts of your costume together . You must think of yourself as a walking picture , and you know that you only care for lovely ones . As it is absolutely impossible for all to be beautiful , it is therefore extremely important to dress so that you will always look chic and stunning . One way to do this is by knowing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMBINATION WILL YOU CHOOSE ? The first thing to do is to decide on a color scheme . This is necessary because you want all of your clothes to blend well . Unless you have an unlimited clothing allowance , you will have to be content with one color scheme . More than one color combination means another complete set of clothes . At first , you will think that you can not always wear the same color . Of course , that is a problem , but when you consider that you want to look attractive at any cost , you will quickly agree that this is the best way to reach that end . Personally , I know that to dress in outfits is the only way by which one can always be sure that she has something to wear , and that it is correct for the occasion . I have had a great deal of experience along this line in my own family . Since I was very young , I have always selected clothes which go together , but I have two sisters who have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was always loaning them clothes . This racket became so great at our house that I finally had to start renting my clothes out by the outfit , charging them a small sum which depended on the type of outfit . For a complete evening costume , I used to get five dollars . Even my youngest sister , when a senior in college , was likely to telegraph , " Send outfit for Senior Ball . " So you can see that outfits are the thing to wear , even if you have to rent them . I hope that by this time you have decided that you would like to know how to build outfit clothes . The first thing , as I have said , is to decide on a color scheme . You remember that you have already decided what colors look best on you , and you also know your favorite color . If this should happen to be a color such as red , and it looks well on you , you will want to use it in the color scheme . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but rather as touches here and there , because a complete red outfit would be very tiring . You would then have to use some other color as a background for your dashes of red . In this case , black , dark blue , white , gray , or beige could be used . You will find that for the person with a small clothing allowance it is best to choose such staple colors as black , brown , navy blue , white , or gray as the basic color in her wardrobe . These colors can then be combined with a favorite color to vary the wardrobe . Brown combines with yellow , orange , beige , tan , cream , gold , and certain shades of blue , green , and rose . With navy blue , use lighter blues , red , white , cream , beige , gray , yellow , orange , blue-green , and blue violet . Of course , with neutral colors ? black , white and gray ? you can combine all shades . One thing you will want to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same shade , because people will not fail to say , " why , you look like a little brown bird . " It is clear that your work on color harmony will be very useful at this time . Often it happens that there are things in your wardrobe which you must wear another season ? coats for instance . In this case your color scheme would definitely be influenced , because you will want to blend new clothes in such a way that they will look well with an old coat . It is well to mention here that if you are going to have to wear a coat two or three years , do not buy one which is of a distinctly popular color . The coat will be fashionable for one season , but for the other two , it will be an outcast . It will also be very hard to find clothes which go well with it , because as soon as a color ceases to be popular , it is immediately taken out of circulation . Therefore , it is always best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to show you how to plan a color scheme for an outfit , I will describe one which I used several years ago . During the summer , I had purchased in Scotland a beautiful piece of novelty woolen material which was predominately black , but which was flecked with red and oyster white . This I had made up into a spectator sport coat in the fall . It was quite tailored , princess style with collar and cuffs banded in Persian lamb which had the same curly effect as the material . In the early spring of the next year , I wanted to use the coat , and my problem was to select an outfit which would go well with it . My color scheme was definitely decided for me because of the black , red , and white mottled material of the coat . Because it was spring , I felt justified in selecting a dress of my favorite color , red . You will notice that bright colors for dresses are often used when the first spring-like days roll around . I finally found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oyster white poker-chip buttons and a black patent leather belt . This blended nicely with the coat . For a hat , I decided on a smart little black straw which had a tiny red and white feather on one side . My shoes were of black patent leather and cloth in a pump style with a cuban heel . Then I picked up the patent leather of the belt again in a bag , which had a lovely red fastener . My costume was finished with a pair of washable white pigskin gloves . In planning the outfit , I had been careful to keep everything similar as far as the type and the occasion for which it was to be used . The colors were carefully blended with enough black to subdue the red dress . I was able to get a great deal of wear out of this costume because it was complete , and I always felt well dressed in it . I also had a black and white dress which I could wear with the same coat and accessories .  | HOW WILL YOU SELECT UNDERGARMENTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from scratch and have a complete new wardrobe . You have decided upon your color scheme , you know what type of clothes you need and are going to buy for certain occasions . The best place to start is with your foun-dation garment . Do not gasp in horror and murmur that you do not wear such a garment , because I am sure that you are all eager to be as attractive as possible . With the gowns cut as they are to-day every figure , no matter how perfect , needs some type of , foundation garment . Even the most beautiful models in the world are sure to wear some , thing firm under their dresses . This is because they want to have a firm , smooth silhouette . Without the foundation garment , you are bound to jiggle and bulge in spots . This piece of wearing apparel does away with it . Of course , there is no garment which guarantees a perfect figure . You must do your share through exercise , correct posture , and proper diet to gain as nearly perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm garment , you can wear any type of dress . It is not necessary to incase your body in an armor-like corset , but you should all wear a girdle or girdle pantie of some type . There are many on the market which are made of an elastic two-way stretch material . These , you simply step into , and pull on , being careful not to put your fingers  | through the elastic . There are no bones to stick into your ribs . They are completely comfortable , and allow great freedom of movement . If you do not want to be bothered with garters , the pantie variety in the same material are also excellent . By wearing one of these confining garments consistently , day in and day out , you will gradually take off excess weight on your hips . Some girls may have a prominent abdomen and want a firmer garment in order to take off rolls of fat around the waist . In this case , a girdle with a reinforced front panel , or a garment which has a brassiere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brassiere to give a boyish figure , but now they are intended to make one look like Mae West . According to medical advice , the one caution concerning brassieres is that they should not be too tight . In buying an all-in-one garment to wear with evening clothes , be sure that it has a low-cut back . I find that young ladies usually like to wear as little as possible under evening clothes . Little snug fitting panties of satin lastex are especially nice , and now you can buy a little square piece of silk to fasten to your girdle , which takes the place of panties . This is really quite a nice thing because usually the lower edge of your panties shows under your dress . It always seems better to avoid any markings of undergarment which allow people to know what you are wearing . Another thing which has always been very annoying in a girdle is garters which bulge . However , this has been done away with by the new garters which allow for  | a flat wrap-around of the stocking . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are satisfied with your foundation garment you can continue with the rest of the outfit . You may think that this precaution is unnecessary , but the really smart women whom you call the best dressed women in the world , never consider buying their wardrobe for a particular season without first making sure that their undergarments are correct . After they have been fitted to their girdles , or all-in-one , they next consider underwear . Most of all you probably like the lacy variety . That is nice when it is made of lovely lace , but unless you are wealthy , it is better to do without than to wear cheap lace . Then too , it has to be very carefully made , or it gives a bulkiness to the figure . It is interesting for you to know that movie actresses wear very tailored underwear under their clothes , and it is only when you see them in boudoir scenes that they have on fancy underwear . The type of undergarment which you decide to wear depends on personal tastes . You may like step-ins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide , but the thing to remember is that you want a smooth sil-  | houette , free from wrinkles , and that this is best achieved through the use of simple tailored underwear . Even lace around the lower edge of a slip will have a tendency to make your dress stand away from the figure . You should also remember that the appearance of the garment is spoiled , if your skirt is not shadow proof . Therefore , in summer , you must wear reinforced slips for safety 's sake . You will probably also find that certain pieces of underwear go nicely with a particular outer garment . If you keep that in mind , you will not have the difficulty of dressing and then finding that your slip shows . This is most annoying and happens more frequently than is necessary . WHAT OUTER GARMENTS SHOULD BELONG IN YOUR WARDROBE ? When you consider the selection of outer garments , you must immediately refer to your color scheme , which you have previously decided upon . Then , of course , you must know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparel . Few people do this , because they buy clothes whenever they feel like it , with little thought to their use . The best way to select clothes is to look over your wardrobe at the beginning of each season . Then decide what clothes you can use from last year and what clothes must be discarded . Very often you will find a dress still in good style , which needs new accessories . After you have decided what you need , and you know how much money you can spend , you should then study the smart fashion magazines , shop windows , and advertisements to see what is new and fashionable . You probably will not be able to use the extreme dresses , but you can adapt them in many ways to suit your more conservative tastes . When you have made up your  | mind as to just what you need and want , based on the line and colors good for you , you can go shopping . Shop around if you like so that you can judge and compare prices , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you especially like , it is to your advantage to become a regular customer . In this way , you will have a special clerk who knows exactly what you like , and what looks well on you . It will save you a great deal of trouble because she really does all the work , and all you have to do is to sit back and see what she has picked for you . In this way , you become established in that shop , and you will therefore receive much better service . Dresses , Suits , and Coats for Your Outfit For twelve years , I have purchased all of my dresses , suits , and coats from the same clerk in one particular store . I do not need to shop around because I have so much confidence in the type of merchandise this firm carries . In this case , the clerk became so accustomed to the type of clothes which I would buy that when she selected new wearing apparel for the shop from the wholesale house , she always brought back garments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted . Sometimes , she would even let me go with her to the wholesale house and select my own clothes at the fashion showing . At the present time , she has left the city and I really am at a loss to find the right clothes . It is well also to purchase several pieces of wearing apparel at one time so that you can see how they will go with each other . In this way , you are sure to avoid mistakes , and you also will find that by buying your wardrobe at the beginning of each season , you will have clothes for all occasions . You can then sit back and enjoy yourself because  | Figure you know that you are well dressed . It will also avoid the mad dash for a new garment when some special occasion rolls around . You never find just what you want at such a time . Hats for Your Outfit A hat is rather hard to buy , but if you have a definite color scheme , you can get along with fewer hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each dress . You will need a sport hat , and if your street clothes are quite tailored , you can wear your sport hat with them . If your street clothes are more dressy , probably the same hat you wear with your afternoon clothes will do nicely . Then , if you dress for the theater or restaurant dining , you should have a little evening hat . If you buy a hat which bears a nationally  | known trade name for sport wear , you can wear it for several years , as this type of hat seldom goes out of style . If you buy a simple little turban for evening wear , this again will last you for several seasons . Therefore , the only hat which will really concern you is the afternoon variety . There is no limit to the styles in this type of hat . They change rapidly , and the hat which is smart this week may be extremely poor taste in a month . You must , therefore , select a hat which is more conservative , which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still look nice for several seasons . Always remember the clothes with which you must wear your hat . And it is especially wise to try the hat with the coat or suit you are going to wear with it . A fur collar usually helps the hat to be flattering , so when you are trying on a hat , drop the collar so that you get the appearance of the plain neck line . It is also necessary for you to look in a full-length mirror , because often a hat will look extremely well when you are sitting down , but not when you are standing up . This is especially so with very large hats on a small person , because they make one appear squatty , like a toadstool . And a tiny hat on a large person looks like a peanut on a pumpkin . Felt is an excellent hat material because it is used for all of the seasons , while velvet and straw can only be used correctly for a very short time . Silk also makes a good fabric for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should avoid hats which are made of materials that spot easily , such as antelope . You may not realize it , but it is possible for you to have custom-made hats . You will select a model which you like . Head measurements are then taken , and the hat is made to fit you exactly . It will be necessary to have a fitting as you do for a dress .  | Shoes for Your Outfit Shoes come next in our outfit building . Black or brown , depending on the color scheme , are always the most practical for general wear . Colored shoes are good for one season , but usually must be discarded , which really seems a wasteful expenditure of money . Of course , there are shoes for all occasions just as there are dresses , and it is necessary for you to select those shoes which are most suitable for your clothes . A good pair of flat-heeled oxfords for general sport and walking wear are always good . If they are in your standard color they will last for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your afternoon clothes . This pair can either be a dressy oxford , pumps , or a one-strap slipper with a French heel or a high slender cuban heel , which is even nicer . At present shoes demand a great deal of attention because they are being made in many new and odd forms . Platform soles and wedged soles , peculiarly shaped heels , square toes or no toes at all are being worn . Finding shoes with heels of various heights is no longer the problem it was several years ago , however . If shoes are made of leather , they can be used  | for all seasons , but if they are in suede , they can only be worn for fall and winter . The sandal type of shoe is much better for evening wear or very dressy afternoon wear than for street wear . Evening slippers can be very gay , depending on your pocket-book and your ability to have new slippers for each dress . Silver and gold are always good and can be worn with practically any gown . In summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles depending on your needs . Hosiery for Your Outfit Stockings differ each season . Names change so quickly that there really is no need for you to consider them . You really are at the mercy of the clerk who will show you what is correct to wear with your type of shoe both as to color and style . It is therefore best to buy several pairs of hose which v , ill last you during one season , and then when the new colors come in for the next season , you can buy some more . The weight of the stocking should be governed by the type of clothes you are going to wear with it . Be sure to give this information to the clerk when you are purchasing them . When you are wearing sandals , you should wear sandal foot hose , but be sure to select the type which is slightly reinforced in the sole of the foot , for it lasts considerably longer . Accessories for Your Outfit You have now assembled a complete outfit including all of the essentials . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes which are suitable for all occasions . That is very fine , but the costume needs a little toning up . You must give it some snap and sparkle , and this is done through the use of the correct accessories . Under this class come your bag , gloves , jewelry , scarfs , handkerchiefs ,  | and belts . Each of these will play an important part in your wardrobe . There are bags and gloves for all occasions , some simple , and some more elaborate . Bag and gloves can be in the basic color , or you can introduce some color note at this point . The main thing to remember is to select a bag and gloves which are suitable for the rest of your outfit . It is also important to consider the interior of your bag . Do you load your bag with a lot of junk , or do you carry only a few well-chosen bag accessories ? A few months ago one of your leading fashion magazines carried an article describing and showing the things which were found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a vanity , and if you can find one which includes the rouge and lipstick gadgets , it is far better than if they are placed separately in your bag . Then you will want a comb of your own . You noticed I said " of your own , " because that is something that you should never loan or borrow . Your hanky , of course , should again be appropriate and suitable to the rest of the costume . It is always extremely bad to see a gay sport handkerchief in a lovely afternoon bag . Remember that handkerchiefs may be very costly depending on the fineness of the linen and the quality of the lace . Then perhaps you have a key to the house and instead of dropping it in your bag you can attach it to a little chain of silver or gold . You may also want to carry a pocket vial of your favorite perfume . You should also put in a few calling cards in a case , and a tiny pencil to jot down names and numbers . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still not have to class it as junk . The accessories already mentioned are really essential to the costume , and now you want to consider some which are not needed , but are nice to have , such as jewelry , scarfs ,  | belts , collars , cuffs , flowers , or hair ornaments . Each of these has its place in the wardrobe as a finishing touch which may give just the right note to the whole costume . Costume jewelry has become an important and interesting type of accessory . It changes frequently , and is made in so many different styles that it can easily suit everybody 's taste . It is also not cheap to purchase , and when a different set is worn with each dress , it runs into a great deal of money . There is also the tendency for people to make themselves conspicuously gaudy by using too much of it . When used together , a clip and a bracelet are always good , but if you should add a ring , necklace , and ear-rings you would immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of jewelry should then be used sparingly and in good taste . The other accessories always help to bring new life and interest to an old outfit . They also are especially good when Figure used on what I call a basic dress . If more people would follow this idea for dressing , they would be much better dressed for less money than they are . This type of dressing is good for business women . It will be good for you when you go out to seek a fortune .  | The basic dress consists of a simple one-piece dress , cut on very good line to fit beautifully . It should be black , navy blue , or brown , depending on your taste . You will find that a medium V neck line and long tight sleeves are best . With this as a basis , innumerable accessories will go with it , so that each day the outfit can look different . There can be tailored collar and cuffs , and a set which is more frilly . They can be of lace , satin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can be in different colors . Then a clever scarf and belt will give variety . Costume jewelry can also be worn to good advantage , and again the dress takes on a different air . A flower at the neck line is still another idea , and you can probably find other ways to change this dress . You can do the same thing with evening clothes , through the addition of a cape or jacket . At present , the accessories for evening wear are especially lovely and regal looking , as there is a tendency to use many hair ornaments . These always give a touch of grandness to your costume when correctly used . As a last word on outfit building , remember that there is a time and place for everything , and it is most important that your clothes follow this rule . Then each detail must be worked out with a great deal of care , so that the finished product is a beautiful picture to behold . SUGGESTED CLASS ACTIVITIES r .

Are you by any chance the type of girl who pouts and sulks when Mother says , " I am sorry Mary , but you can not have a new dress for the party . " If you are , do you then run to Dad , and put your arms around his neck and in a tearful voice say , " Daddy , dear , I need a dress the worst way for the party Saturday evening . Jane is having a new one , and so is Hilda , and I hate to be the only one without a new dress . Please Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who takes Mother at her word and realizes immediately that the family finances are in bad shape ? Let us consider what will happen in the first instance . Mary 's mother and father will talk the whole situation over , and finally come to the conclusion that they must not make poor Mary feel badly , and that perhaps Mother could go without the dress she had been saving for , or that Dad could wear his shabby overcoat a little longer . The next morning they tell Mary that she can have the new dress , and immediately she is all smiles , kisses them both , and says they are the very best Dad and Mother in the world . This of course makes them feel fine , and once again Mary has gotten her own way . In a few weeks , she will have forgotten how good her family have been to her , and the same scene will be repeated . Each time Mary becomes more and more  | selfish . Do you want to be this type of an individual ? I hope not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this ? These are simple questions to answer . In the beginning , her family should have discussed with her their financial status . She should have been made to realize just what her father 's income was , and in what manner it had to be spent . In this way , she would have felt a certain responsibility to her parents to help them spend the money wisely . It is a pity that more families do not hold a financial conference , but usually , they are afraid that you will go out and tell the neighborhood all about it . Most of you have the feeling that money grows on trees , and all you have to do is to have Dad gather it . Instead Father has to work hard for it , and usually makes only enough to cover the bare essentials for the family . Therefore , unless some careful planning is done , the money just will not stretch as far as it should . If you do not realize what a great expense you are to your family , estimate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing to-day . Are you surprised ? Just suppose that you have brothers and sisters who come to school too , and their clothing will also cost quite a bit . Think then how much it costs your family each day for clothing alone , in order that you and your brothers and sisters will make a pleasing appearance at school . Do you wonder why sometimes Mother says , " No , Mary , you can not have a new dress " ? To many of you , this is the first time that this financial condition has been considered . In some families , the mother buys whenever something is needed , or when she has the money . In other families , brothers and sisters take turns , and on a certain Saturday in each month , each one has so much  | to spend . One therefore must anticipate needs for the future month , because she has to wait her turn . Still other families give an allowance which must be used wisely . This is a very good way if it is based fairly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct conclusion of just how much you should have to spend , your family should hold d ' financial conference and discuss the matter freely . Mother and Dad should decide how much money can be spent for clothing . This is usually about io-i5 per cent of the total income . If you know your family income , you can decide about how much your family can spend for clothing . The next thing to decide upon is how much each member of the family can have to spend . This of course will depend upon a number of things . First , how many are there in your family ? Naturally , an only child will have considerably more to spend than a family of several brothers and sisters . Second , what are the occupations of the various members of the family ? If Dad holds a position in an office , he will have to appear each day neatly dressed , and his clothing will therefore cost a great deal more than if he were doing some form of manual labor where he could wear overalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home , she will need far less than the active club woman who spends her afternoons at meetings or playing bridge . If you are the oldest child , then you will need more money than the younger members , but if on the other hand , you are the youngest and there are other children in college , you will have to be content with much less . All of these points should be considered and discussed at your conference in order that you can each see how you fit into the general scale of affairs . I think you are all going to be surprised at how little you really should be spending . If , for instance , the father earns $2,500 a year , all that the family should be spending for  | clothes is io-i5 per cent of it , or $250-$375 . Apportion it according to the family needs , and see how much each member can have to spend . It is not very much , is it ? To-night at the family dinner table see if you can bring up this discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family to meet this part of the clothing problem wisely . Of course , there will be a few of you who will not want to do this because you know now that you will get more the other way , but are you not a little ashamed of yourself for being so selfish ? You at least can find out what your father 's income is , and from this , compute the amount which you would rightfully have to spend . After you have this amount , you probably will not know exactly how to spend it wisely . You know that you are going to need clothing to satisfy many different needs and desires . Your body must be protected so that you will not feel too warm or too cold . You must be shielded from exposure to wind and rain . You must help guard your body from injury . Do you realize how often your wearing apparel causes an accident ? A few years ago , a noted woman was killed because she was wearing a floating scarf . Can you think of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garment you have on ? Your clothing must be suitable for different occasions and in keeping with the standard of living you maintain . This is necessary in order for you to keep your self-respect . Because clothing must perform so many duties , it is very necessary that careful thought be given the subject . HOW MUCH CAN YOU AFFORD TO SPEND FOR CLOTHING ? The best way to do that is to make out a clothing budget . A budget , as you know , is a wise plan for the spending and  | saving of the future income . Perhaps it seems foolish to you to go to all of this trouble , but there really are many advantages to a budget . It will make you shop with a definite aim in mind because you know exactly what you need and how much you have to spend for it . It will permit you to take advantage of real bargains . It will make you think before you purchase anything , and that should have a tendency to promote saving . It will help you to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget , you should make a clothing inventory , a list of every bit of clothing which you own . You should then divide these clothes , so that you know which pieces you can use just as they are , which pieces should be repaired , which pieces may be renovated and made over , and which pieces will have to be discarded . With this list as a guide , you can jot down those articles of wearing apparel which you are going to need and want . The next thing to do will be to apportion your money in such a way that all of your wants will be met . Generally , you can plan your budget by spending the following amounts for the various types of clothing :  | Table Usually you will receive underwear as gifts , and this will enable you to lower the amount spent for these garments . You may want to vary your percentages a bit , and that is all right as long as you keep a proper balance . There is a tendency to overspend on some articles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , but if you were to see their undergarments , you would be shocked . Then you usually forget to allow anything for the care and repair of a garment . This is a very important item because your personal appearance depends greatly upon the correct upkeep of your clothes . The only way by which you can live within your budget is to keep a daily record of all of your expenditures . In this way , you can see exactly where your money goes , and whether you are spending it wisely . If you keep a careful expense account for a year , you can make a very accurate budget for the next year . You can carry a small note-book around in your pocket-book and jot down your expenditures as you spend your money . The clothing expense record plan on page 220 may help you . At first you will have a hard time remembering to keep your expense record correct , but gradually if you really are in earnest , it will become a habit . When you are able to live within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have achieved a great success . At the same time you will have become a more attractively gowned girl .  | You will find that the following chart will help you in planning your budget : Table  | Table SUGGESTED CLASS ACTIVITIES r .

There is nothing so grand as a homemade pie that Mother makes , but there is nothing worse in this world than a homemade-looking dress . It carries a trade mark all its own . You know it the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathetic soul and say , " What a lovely dress . Did you make it ? " She may feel flattered and nod a beaming assent , when she really should take warning . But then , she may be one of those poor conceited persons who just do not know any better . I hope you do not belong to that class . I always find in every class at least one who is very proud of her homemade-looking dress . She of course is the most difficult person to teach , and yet she needs the most help . Then there are always a few mothers who take great pride in their homemade masterpieces ; they condescendingly inform the teacher that they never use a pattern and of course know a great deal more about sewing than she does . At first these students and their mothers troubled me , but I soon learned to ignore them and to concentrate on those students whose mothers sent them to me to learn to sew correctly , to make smart clothes . Perhaps this procedure was cruel because usually the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager-to-learn looked like walking fashion plates in the style show which was given at the  | end of each problem . However , after this first sad experience the superior pupils decided not only to come down to earth , but also that they did not know as much about sewing as they thought they did . You often hear girls say , " What is the use of learning to sew when you can buy such cute clothes ? " Then they add that you can buy clothes as cheaply as you can make them . I think , therefore , it is well to discuss the pros and cons of this subject . To-day , we have on the market a great array of cheap garments , poorly constructed and ill-fitting . Then on the other hand , you will find well-constructed garments of good material which fit nicely . If you buy these , you will have to pay a great deal more than $4.98 or even S9.98 . Also , you have to remember that the cheaper a garment is , the more often you will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore you are liable to see yourself coming and going . On the other hand , if you can make a garment which looks professional , and you should hold the $zoo model as your ideal rather than the $4.98 article , you are sure to have an individual dress . It will have been designed for you , it will be custom made so that it will fit perfectly and suit you exactly . If you have only five dollars to spend , you will have a garment made of much better material than you could possibly get if you purchased one for the same price . The whole problem narrows down to this fact : are you willing to make clothes which will have the appearance of a custom-made frock from a well-known designer 's house ? It is no harder than making homemade-looking clothes , but it does require studying the construction of well-made clothes . You will have to observe the seam and seam finishes used each year , how pleats and tucks are put in , and innumerable other little details which distinguish fashionable  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailored to perfection . Of course , the clothing teacher will help you , with all these details because she is a connoisseur of such information . WHY DO N'T YOU MAKE SMART CLOTHES ? Even though you may never make a habit of constructing all of your clothes , it is nice to know how to do it . If you see a garment you especially want , and the price is prohibitive , you can copy the outfit , making it yourself . This happened to one of my students . Nancy saw a lace evening dress photographed from one of the exclusive shops in New York City . The price of course was way beyond her means , being $15o . She brought the picture to me and asked me if I thought she could possibly make it . On examination , the dress was quite simple ; yet the line of it was so perfect that it was very lovely to look at . I knew Nancy could make it . She set out to find a pattern which she could use . Here she found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion magazines did not have it . As Nancy had had one year of clothing , it was possible for her to drape the dress from soft muslin , and in this way make her own pattern . This she did , and then constructed a lovely lace dress for $15 , which was a perfect copy of the $15o model . Now , was that not worth learning to sew ? I will always remember Nancy in this frock as she appeared in the fashion show . The stage was set as a garden , having a terrace with a balustrade and steps leading from it . The terrace was flanked by a rock garden , gay with real blooms . Evergreen trees were banked about the stage making a delightful background for Nancy as she came down  | the steps in her sweeping lace frock . The dress fitted snugly , and the white was a sharp and beautiful contrast to her shiny black hair , fashioned with a halo , and her snapping , big black eyes , with long , curly lashes . She had chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an added touch tiny red rosebuds formed a bracelet at her wrist . As she passed on to the stage , the spectators burst into applause because they appreciated that here was a student who had climbed the ladder of success in this field and had set an ideal for all others to strive to attain . You too can have that same glorified feeling of success and admiration if you choose . The first thing to do is to start at the very bottom , and pretend you know nothing about sewing . If you begin this way , you are sure not to lose any important part , which might later hinder the results . WHAT TOOLS WILL YOU NEED ? Naturally , you can not sew unless you have the proper tools . It is therefore necessary for you to begin your clothing work by assembling these articles and placing them in a box of convenient size . 1 . Scissors Less than six inches in length , having sharp , closely fitted blades made of good steel 2 . Shears Over six inches in length , sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smooth , sharp points , thin and bought by the pound 4 . Needles Sizes No. 1-12 , running from coarse to fine ( A good size needle to use is No. 8 . There are crewel needles , darning needles , and  | Sharps . Do you know the distinguishing characteristics of each ? ) 5 . Pin cushion Used for neatness and convenience ( Wool filling prevents needles from rusting. ) 6 . Tape measure Firm , double material , metal ends , numbered on both sides beginning at opposite ends so that it is reversible , and sixty inches long 7 . Thread a . Cotton Sizes 40-100 most common ( 50 makes a good basting thread , whereas 70 is good for ordinary sewing. ) b . Silk Sizes designated by letters E to A ( It is well to have in your box basting thread in your favorite color , a spool of white for ordinary sewing , and then a spool of thread the color of the garment you are making . Silk thread is seldom used on anything but shiny silks , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light in weight , with small indentations , made of gold , silver , steel , celluloid , or aluminum ( It should fit the second finger of the hand holding the needle and covering the end of the finger nearly to the first joint . Of course , you think that you are not going to wear one , but do not be childish and take it off when my back is turned , because I know you do it . I did it myself when I was your age , but I soon found out that Figure  | I could never learn to make tiny , neat stitches without a thimble , and which is worse ? ripping out bad stitches or wearing a thimble ? If you put it on when you first start to sew and keep it on regardless of what you are doing , you will soon get so used to wearing it that you will forget and walk out of class with it on . Of course you think you will not , but just wait and you will , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g . Emery Small bag containing black dusting powder for polishing needles ( It is not a necessity , but it is nice to have . ) These supplies will complete the standard equipment for your box . It is also well to have a small gage which will give the smaller measures such as / inch , inch , / inch , and I inch . This can be made from cardboard and is especially nice to use for hems . There is a commercial gage now which resembles a tiny ruler and has a sliding device which can be adjusted as desired . WHAT MEASUREMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL ? The next thing to do is to have your measurements taken . This can be done by a fellow student , but please do not be the ticklish type who giggles through the entire ordeal . Fifteen giggling girls is more than any teacher can stand . You must stand erect while these measurements are being taken ? heels together , head up , shoulders up , tummy in , hips tucked under . The measurer will place a tape measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will put your hands on the soft part between the last rib and the hip bone . Then stepping so that your back is turned toward her , she will take the following measurements : 1 . The bust measure is taken over the fullest part of the bust , well up under the arms , and straight across the back .  | 2 . The waist measure is taken at the normal waistline. 3 . The hip measure is taken six inches below the waistline and over the fullest part of the hips . 4 . The length measure is taken from the center back of the neck to the floor . 5 . The outside arm measure is taken from the bony upper edge Figure of the shoulder around the elbow which is bent to the wrist . 6 . The inside arm measure is taken from the muscle that joins the arm to the body to the base of the thumb at the wrist with the arm straight . 7 . The wrist measure is taken around the wrist . 8 . The girth measure is taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are the general measures which should always be in the box for reference . It is necessary to have these measurements so that you will know what size pattern or garment to buy and also be able to alter it if necessary . It is sometimes wise to know the front and back chest measure , and the length from the highest point of the shoulder in front and back to the waist , and to the floor . In order to determine the actual length of a garment , subtract from the length measure the distance you wish the garment to be from the floor and to this add the amount required for a hem . From these measurements , you can also ascertain the required amount of material for a simple garment . WHAT GARMENT ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE ? After you have your measurements , the next thing to consider is what you are going to make . This may depend on several things . Sometimes your teacher will want you to do a certain problem at first , because she thinks it is best for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of cotton shorts or step-ins for their first problem . This was a very inexpensive thing to make and allows all the practice you want . If a student was an experienced sewer , it gave me a chance to see just how well she sewed . If the student had never sewed before , it gave her a wonderful chance to learn a great deal about the different stitches , seams , use of bias , button holes , and the use of the sewing machine . If a girl finished this problem nicely , she could then make anything she wanted , the only limitation being that she could not use silk , because only a very experienced sewer can make a really professional looking garment from silk , and material made of synthetic fiber is even more difficult to use . These materials must be manipulated with great care .  | The step-ins usually took three weeks , and then the girls started coats , suits , or dresses . I will always remember one student who was very ambitious . She made her step-ins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to make it . It was the polo type , made of lovely material , lined and interlined . She tailored it carefully , and when it was finished it was a masterpiece . This was only one case of the hundreds of successful garments I have seen made in this way . If your teacher is not particular what you make , you should look over your wardrobe very carefully and see what you need . Never make anything which you do not want or like , because you will immediately lose interest in it . After you have decided on what it is to be , then browse through good fashion magazines until you see the correct pattern . Recall carefully all of the facts you learned about line , and use them when picking your design . Also you should realize that fashion figures are drawn exceptionally tall so as to give a very slender appearance . WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT BUYING AND USING A PATTERN ? Patterns are purchased according to age or bust measure . The latter way is always the best to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-two-inch bust , and you prefer to ask for it by age . Sometimes you think that you can economize on your pattern , but that is a foolish idea . The more expensive patterns are really made to fit the figure properly , and you will have no trouble with them . In asking for a pattern , you will ask for it by number , and then give the size you desire . You should look at the envelope carefully to be sure that you have the proper one .  | No pattern can be returned after it has been opened . It is also well to look at the picture showing the different parts in order to be sure it is made the way you expected it to be . You will probably want to buy material while you are shopping , and it is always best to get your pattern before Figure your material . On the envelope of the pattern , you will find a list of appropriate materials to be used for the pattern . Look over this list , and if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiffon , you had better change your mind one way or the other . On the envelope you will also find a chart telling exactly how much material you are going to need . This of course will depend upon the width  | of material . Fifty-four-inch material always cuts to the best advantage and will be cheaper in the long run , although it is more expensive per yard . Then in a napped material like velvet , there is an up and down which always requires more material . With your pattern , your material , and your thread to match under your arm , you can trudge home all ready for the big adventure . Your teacher will probably insist that you bring your material to school in order to cut it out . There are always a few students and doting mothers who think they will surprise the teacher by having it all cut out at home . This is most annoying , and if you were my student you would have to put away your work until the obedient students had theirs cut out . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to make interesting clothes , and unless you follow directions accurately , this is absolutely impossible . The first thing to be done is to take out your pattern and sort the parts . There are always extra collars , cuffs , or sleeves which you will not want . You should therefore put all the parts you do not need in a pile and then fold them up neatly and return to the envelope , so that they will be out of your way . There will be a chart in your pattern which has a picture of all of these parts , and in this way you can distinguish the ones you want . The next thing to do is to test your pattern to see if it is going to fit . There are a number of ways to do this . First , if you look at the measurement chart on your pattern , you can find all of the measurements which correspond to the bust measure you are using . If these are the same as your measurements , then you know that the finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspond , if for example , your hips are one inch larger than they should be , then you will know that you must alter your pattern .  | A second way which is not so successful is to hold the pattern up to you , and then judge for yourself . A third way is to measure the pattern , remembering that allowance for seams and fullness has been made on pattern . And a fourth way is to pin or baste the pattern together and see if it fits . After you have tested the pattern and found that it fits correctly , you can then proceed to place the pattern on the material . But if on the other hand you find that it is too short or too long , you will need to alter the pattern . Altering the pattern correctly before you touch the material will help to assure a well-fitted garment , and will save time for you in the end . To make a garment shorter , take a tuck of the desired width above the waistline and below the hip line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are in the habit of folding up the lower edge of the pattern to shorten it . If you do this , you change the outline of the garment , and therefore lose the correct line . You should never tamper with the edges of the pattern because all changes should be made within the boundary line . To make a pattern narrower , a tuck should be taken the desired width from the shoulder line to the lower edge . Never fold under the center back . This would change the neck line entirely . If your sleeves are too long , the same method is used , placing the tucks above and below the elbow . When you wish to take fullness out of your sleeves , tucks are again used at the desired places , but you must be careful to keep a good arm-stye line . If the garment is too short , length may be added by cutting the pattern above and below the hip line , and spreading it the desired width on the material . In this way , the outline  | of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few inches were added at the lower edge . To enlarge a pattern for extra width , cut it in the same place that you would otherwise take a tuck to make it smaller . If you do not want to damage the pattern , it is very Figure simple to cut the pattern out of newspaper or wrapping , and then use this pattern for alteration purposes . Before you actually begin to work , you should study the pattern . You will notice that the better patterns are dotted here and there with symbols . Each one of these has a special meaning which has been carefully thought out by the tech-  | nicians who made up the design and pattern for the garment . The average sewer is too conceited to use them . I remember I was , but when I finally became conscious of their great value in turning out a good looking article , I faithfully began to study each one , and to use them . Each pattern company has worked out its own set of marks , and therefore it becomes necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they mean on your particular pattern . One of the most important is the one meaning to lay on fold . Unless you know which edge of the pattern to lay on a folded edge of material , you will without a doubt have a very disastrous result . Can you imagine what it would be ? Then there are perforations which will tell you where the seams should come , others for tucks and pleats . You will also notice notches along the edge of the pattern . These tell you that something must be joined at this point . There will be other marks which will tell you that a certain part of the pattern should lay on the straight of the goods , the lengthwise thread called warp . When you are sure that you know exactly what everything means , take the material , pattern , and equipment and go to a large , clear table space . After you have placed the material on the table , weigh down the heavy end so that it will remain firmly in place . Usually part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case , fold the material in this manner . You know of course that the lengthwise thread runs parallel to the selvedge edge of material . Care should be taken to be sure that the fold is exactly on the desired warp thread . In order to be as economical as possible , fold your material only wide enough to take in the largest piece of the pattern . This will leave one large piece of material instead of two small ones . You will have noted which is the right and wrong of the material , and whether  | there is a definite up and down . The material should also be straightened . This is done by pulling a woof thread , and cutting along this line . Be sure that the material is smooth and free from wrinkles . As a safety measure all pieces of the pattern should be placed on the material before any are cut . Sometimes it happens that you have needlessly wasted material , and sometimes , if you cut each piece as you go along , you suddenly find yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can usually place all the parts on the material before you begin to cut . It is also wise for you to ask your teacher if you have arranged it correctly . Remember that she has had more experience than you and will recognize quickly mistakes which will cause you a great deal of trouble if they are not corrected before cutting . In pinning the pattern to the material , it is best to pin the longest straight edge first . The pins should be placed so that they are parallel to the edge of the pattern . Do not use too many of them . Only the key points on each piece need to be held in place . If a great many pins are used , the cut edge will be jagged . When you cut the material , use a sharp pair of shears with long even strokes to avoid ragged edges . The notches should be cut outwardly away from the pattern . To me , they look like rabbits ' ears standing up . You may wonder why I do it this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them more plainly ; it leaves no possibility of tearing the material at this point ; and the seam can be narrower . This was the way I always caught my students who allowed their families to do their work at home for them , for invariably the notches were cut in , following the outline of the pattern . You should see the look of surprise on a student 's face when I casually remarked somewhat  | sarcastically , " My ! Was n't it nice of Mother to help her little girl ? " Remember , you are the one who is learning to sew , not Mother . She already knows about it . Perhaps she is the type who is eager to learn all of the new methods which you are being taught . The notches can also be marked with thread or with chalk marks if you prefer . After you have cut all of the parts , you should then mark the perforations . This can be done with chalk or pencil , but these methods are not very satisfactory . The best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used is called tailor tacks . If you are wise , you will make each type of perforation with a different colored thread . In this way , it will be easier to follow directions for making the garments . You are going to learn to sew by making tailor tacks . For these you will need a long double thread , with a knot at the very end . Remember your thimble is on your finger , and you are holding your needle between your thumb and first finger , in such way that the thimbled finger hits the end of the needle , in the same manner that a woodpecker pecks at a tree . This is the only correct way to do it . In sewing , you always proceed from right to left , and you will find it much easier if the larger amount of material is held in your lap . This enables you to guide the placement of your stitches more easily . To make tailor tacks : 1 . Take single stitch , putting needle down and bringing it up in perforation.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Stretch thread to next perforation. 4 . Repeat processes z and 2. 5 . Continue in this way until all perforations have been marked . 6 . Cut double threads remaining between perforations. 7 . Remove pattern . 8 . Gently pull apart the two thicknesses of material . 9 . Snip threads between . When this is completed , you have thoroughly marked the perforations . If you are using material made of silk or synthetic fiber , the edges should be stayed . This is accomplished by placing each piece on tissue paper , and then stitching the material to the paper . The paper is then removed . This line of stitching keeps the material from stretching when being sewed . You are now ready to make your garment . The process is really only the solving of a puzzle . You have all of these parts , and if you put them together correctly , you will have a pleasing picture . If you keep this in mind , sewing becomes a game , and soon becomes as much fun as the jig-saw puzzles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of the jig-saw up and put it in place . Sometimes you worked hours trying to solve one little corner . Often you finished a little section only to find that it was not correct . But recall that marvelous sense of satisfaction when you sat back in your chair and viewed your successful accomplishment . And so it will be with your sewing . Your first problem may be tedious because you are trying to learn so many new things . You may have to do something over and over before it is right . But practice makes perfect , you know . You will detest ripping , but it happens to every-  | body . So grin and bear it ! And say to yourself , " Next time I will be more careful . " The greater the pains you take with your first garment , the easier all of the others will be . And I hope you will be one of the persons who always strive for perfection . Figure The room in which you are going to sew should be well lighted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use artificial lighting . Equipment should be placed for efficiency at all times . The light should always fall over your left shoulder . A straight-back chair with no arms is best for sewing .  | In the pattern you found specific directions for making the garment . If you follow these carefully , you will have no trouble . However , because you are an inexperienced sewer , you had better have a little sewing instruction so that you know how to make the stitches and seams called for . I am only going to do . this for you briefly . Your teacher will show you how to do it , and you may want to refer to the many books devoted to clothing construction . DO YOU KNOW THE TYPES OF STITCHES AND SEAMS ? The most commonly used stitches are the following : Basting is a temporary stitch . There are two types , even and uneven , but they are both straight , never crooked . The uneven type is the better of the two because it is easier to use as a guide . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a long and then a short straight stitch is taken . It is fastened with two small stitches in place . Running stitches look like very tiny , even basting stitches . They are used for gathering and for hand tucks . It is best to use a double thread for gathering . Overcasting stitches are small slanting stitches , used on raw edges to keep them from raveling . This is a very simple stitch ; yet it is one which is usually badly done . The needle is pointed toward the left shoulder , and the thread is placed over the edge of material . The stitches should be the same distance apart as they are long , and all in the same direction . Overhanding stitches are small straight stitches used to hold two finished edges of material together . The needle is pointed as if it would stab you and is inserted at the very edge of the material . It is used to sew on lace , or to hold two  | folded edges of a hem together . Hemming stitches are small slanting stitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge in place . The knot is concealed beneath the folded edge . The material is placed over the first finger and held in place with the thumb and second finger . The needle is pointed toward the left shoulder , and picks up only a thread or two before it slides up into the folded edge . The tinier the stitches , the better is your hemming . Catch stitches resemble elongated cross stitching . The needle is pointed toward you . This stitch is used to hold raw edges of heavy wool material in place . In order to hold two pieces of material together firmly and well , it is necessary to use a seam . There are three main seams used , but there are many novel and decorative seams to learn about after you have mastered these . A plain seam is used on mate-rials which do not ravel easily . It is used a great deal now because we desire to have our garments as smooth as possible . It is made as follows :  | z . Place two right sides of material together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge . This enables you to sew over the pins in a straight line . They should always be placed this way . 3 . Baste , using uneven basting / inch from edge , or along tailor tacks . 4 . Remove pins . 5 . Stitch on machine using basting for guide . 6 . Remove basting . 7 . Tie ends of machine threads by pulling both to wrong side and tying in double knot . 8 . Press seam flat . If it is wool material , use a damp pressing cloth over the seam , and do not iron dry . A piece of cheese cloth is a useful protector when doing a silk seam . q . Finish raw edges as desired . MAKING A PLAIN SEAM It is always necessary to finish off the raw edges of a plain seam . The method you use depends on the material to a certain extent . If the material is a firmly woven one , such as wool flannel , the edges may be pinked . Pinking is a saw-tooth edge given it by special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The overcast stitch can also be used on materials which do not ravel too much . For materials which tend to ravel it is best to fold the raw edge under about an eighth of an inch and hold it in place either by a running stitch or by machine stitching . This is an especially good way to finish off silk seams . Sometimes the edges are bound with seam binding . This is often used in making coats when a lining is not  | used . Some wool seams may be catch stitched into place . A French seam is a seam within a seam . It is used when an especially strong seam is desired , or when the material Figure ravels easily . This seam is not used as much now as it was in the past , because it has a tendency to make the garment stand away from the figure . It is made as follows : 1 . Place wrong sides of material together . 2 . Pin . 3 . Baste / inch from edge . 4 . Remove pins . 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastings. 7 . Tie ends of stitched threads . 8 . Cut edges to within / inch of stitching . 9 . Press seam open . p 244 10 . Turn to wrong side placing right sides together keeping the stitching directly along edge of seam . 11 . Pin . 12 . Baste 1/4 inch from edge . 13 . Remove pins . 14 . Stitch so that finished seam is not more than 3/8 inch wide . 15 . Remove bastings. 16 . Tie ends . 17 . Press . The flat fell seam may be either stitched or hemmed . It is used when a flat seam is desired . The stitched fell is made by placing the two wrong sides together , and the finished seam is stitched on the right side ; the hemmed fell is made by placing the two right sides together , and the hemming is on the wrong side . The method i as follows : 1 . Place desired sides of material together . 2 . Pin . 3 . Baste 1/2 inch from edge . 4 . Remove pins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remove basting . 7 . Tie ends . 8 . Press .  | 9 . Trim the side nearest front part of garment to within / inch of stitching . 1o . Press larger of two edges flat over the narrower one . 11 . Turn under larger / inch . 12 . Pin . 13 . Baste . 14 . Remove pins . 15 . Stitch or hem as desired . 16 . Remove basting . 17 . Tie ends if stitched . 18 . Press . You will notice that in the making of these seams , the seam is pressed after it has been stitched . This is imperative , because it is one of the little things which makes for a professional piece of work . Seams on wool must always be pressed with a damp cloth between the iron and material . Heavy unbleached muslin and canvas make good pressing cloths . Before using these clothes , they should be thoroughly soaked and washed in order to remove any sizing . Cheese cloth makes a good pressing cloth , when pressing silk seams . Silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some means by which you can simplify pressing . Sleeve boards are a help . And then there are small pads which you can insert at certain points to make the pressing easier . In this way , all parts of the garment have a well-tailored look . Another thing to remember about seams is that French and fell seams should be small , whereas plain seams should  | Figure be large enough to insure safety when finishing the raw edges . DO YOU KNOW HOW TO RUN A SEWING MACHINE ? Since it is necessary for you to stitch on the machine when making a seam , you had better stop now and learn how to use it . The type of machine which you are using will influence this to a certain extent , but there are a few general points which are the same for all machines . Elias Howe invented the first sewing machine , and since that time great improvements have taken place in it . At the present time , there are two types of machines , the lock stitch  | which uses two threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have in your home and school ? What type do you think would be the safer for you to use ? These machines can be manipulated by hand , foot , or electric power . Each machine is made of various parts , and it is wise for you to learn what each one of these does . With each machine , you will find a direction book . Take this out , and see if you can locate the tension , the stitch regulator , the feed , the presser foot , and other parts . Unless each of these parts is adjusted correctly , it will not function properly . Poor stitching will result , and that in turn will probably mean ripping . One of the most important things is to thread your machine correctly . The usual way to thread a machine is to place the thread on the spool pin , passing it in turn to the tension , take-up lever , needle with the necessary guides between . In the lock-stitch machine there is a bobbin , and unless that is correctly placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be placed in your machine ? The upper and lower threads should lock between the two pieces of material so that the stitching will look alike on both sides . If instead there are loops of threads on one side , or the stitching puckers , your machine needs special attention . Can you tell me what causes this trouble on your machine ? Perhaps you know a great deal about a machine , but there are little bits of sewing-machine etiquette which you have not learned . After sitting down to the machine and adjusting the chair so that the front edge of the seat is even with the edge of the machine , you should take out a little cheese cloth duster , and frce the machine from lint , dust , and oil . This is a precaution against soiling the material . Then after threading the machine correctly , you should take the upper thread in your left hand and , turning the balance wheel in the proper direction , lower and raise the  | needle just once . If you leave the bobbin case open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower thread in a loop . If you will now give the upper thread a little jerk , the lower thread will be brought up through a tiny hole . To complete this task always use a pin or scissors instead of your fingers , for it is so easy to run the machine needle into your finger . Then place the two threads under the presser foot and back . This is done to avoid any knotting and tangling of threads which would cause the machine to lock . If you are foolish enough to allow the machine to do this , call your teacher , and by a miracle touch , she will show you how to fix your particular machine . As soon as you lower the presser foot you are ready to stitch . The first stitch should come in the very edge of material . Then , turning the balance wheel in the proper direction , begin to sew . Do not think for a minute that it is all as easy as this , for it is not . You should practise for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have not the prepared sewing machine sheets , draw straight and curved lines on paper to use as a guide . Remember never to run your machine without something between the presser foot and the feed . If you are careless about this , the teeth will soon be worn flat and will be unable to carry the material backward . If you are learning to use a treadle machine , you will find that it is much easier to go backward than forward . However , if you put your left toe in the upper left corner and the right heel in the lower right corner of the treadle , and keep turning the balance wheel with your hand until your left toe hits the floor , you will have no trouble in learning to go forward . You should learn to stitch slowly in order to keep the machine under control , and if your stitching begins to be  | crooked , you can place your hand on the balance wheel , take away the power , and in this way stop the stitching where you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machine . This will make it easier for you , and also will guard against spotting the material with oil . When you have nearly reached the end of a row of stitching , place your hand on the balance wheel so that you can regulate the placement of the last stitch . It should come in the very edge of the material . The presser foot should be raised and the needle and the take-up lever raised to their highest point . When this is done , the tension is released so that the threads may be pulled backward without breaking . Draw out a long enough thread so that when it is cut there will be enough on the material to tie , and enough on the machine to keep the needle threaded . When turning a corner on the machine , the presser foot is raised , the needle is left in the material , and the material is then turned . When finished , you should again dust it off so that you will not leave any loose bits of thread which might clog the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when you lower the head of the machine this will not pop off . Special care should be given the machine by oiling and greasing it regularly according to directions . Remember , practice makes perfect , so continue to use the machine until it has become a habit , and you can be placed in the expert class . After you can do simple machine stitching , there are many intriguing attachments which you will enjoy using . With these you can make new and interesting things . Usually , the box of sewing-machine attachments is put aside , or given to children as a plaything . This is indeed too bad because  | the gadgets are simple to use , and of course add a great deal of variety to sewing . IS YOUR GARMENT WELL FITTED AND FINISHED ? After a garment is basted together for the first time , it should be slipped on in order to see if it fits . This step is important , because in this way you are not going to lose any time in ripping a completed seam which does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergarments and never over your dress . You will probably feel too lazy to do this , but if you do , you will be sorry later on . At the first fitting , you will see if the shoulder seams and underarm seams fit properly . It gives you a chance to see if the garment is too large or too small . Very often the shoulder seams have to be adjusted because of a difference in the slope of your shoulders . After the seams have been properly adjusted , you should trim the neck to its desired size , and also cut out the armscye so that it will not be too tight . After the seams are completed , the sleeves may be basted in , and at this inspection , you can adjust the sleeves , collar , cuffs , and belt . You will also be able to mark the hem line . This is accomplished by standing erect and having somebody measure accurately the required distance from the floor , and mark the hem line with pins around the entire skirt . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other person , better results are insured . If the garment is made of dark material , it is possible to make this line with a piece of tailor 's chalk , or a chalk marking device . The third and last fitting is for the final inspection , and I sincerely hope that the results will be most pleasing . There are a number of ways by which you can finish off the other raw edges of your garment , but these are deter-  | mined by the purpose , position , and the appearance desired . A hem is a very common way of doing this . It is usually a double fold along the raw edge of material . Hems are more successfully used on a straight edge than on a curved edge . When you are making a small hem , the method is as follows : 1 . Fold under raw edge desired width , usually / inch . 2 . Make second fold desired width . 3 . Press . 4 . Pin by placing them at right angles to the folded edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . Hem by hand or stitch by machine as desired , but remember hemming is usually the best . 8 . Remove bastings. q . Press . When you are putting in a hem in the lower edge of a dress or skirt , you would use the above general method , but it is accomplished in a little different manner . r . The hem is first turned up on marked line . 2 . This fold which is really your second should be basted . 3 . The remaining hem is pressed flat . 4 . The garment should be fitted to inspect the straightness of the hem line . 5 . If it needs adjusting , be sure and do it . The whole appearance of the garment is spoiled if this is not correct . 6 . The raw edge of the hem should then be trimmed so that the width of the hem is the same throughout . 7 . The raw edge is then turned under the desired amount . 8 . Pin . q . Baste . ro . Remove pins . ir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge is always put in by hand , in order to avoid an ugly line at this point . 12 . Remove bastings. 13 . Press .  | If the edge is curved , the fullness may be taken up by making little pleats in it . These should always face the near-Figure est seam . If it is a hem in woolen material , the fullness may be shrunk to make it fit . If it is a very circular hem , it is best to use a false hem , which is cut to fit the curved edges .  | Often on wool garments , the hem would be too bulky if you used a double fold . You therefore finish your raw edges in another manner . This is done by pinking the raw edges if it is firmly woven material , and then catch stitching it in place . If the edges are ravelly , it is best to finish it with a piece of bias . This is applied flat , stitching it to the raw edges , and then the finished edge of the bias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw edges is to use a bias strip . This is used especially on circular edges . It can be used as a binding , facing , or trimming which makes it decorative . However , before you can use it , it is necessary to know what it is and how you make it . It is a strip of material cut on the diagonal of the material , when the warp threads are placed parallel to the woof . This probably sounds very complicated , so the easiest way for you to understand it is to do this : 1 . Take two crayons of different colors , and on a sheet of plain paper draw in warp threads of one color and woof threads of another . 2 . Do this on both sides of the paper . 3 . Fold paper which resembles a piece of gingham so that the warp threads are parallel with the woof threads . 4 . A diagonal has been formed , and if you cut on the fold you can then cut off strips of bias . In the same manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should always be taken with regard to the warp and woof threads . When you are cutting a number of strips , you will get better results if you mark them with a line . There is a gage which you can slip on the end of the shears to guide you as you cut . Some people also like to cut a very
