Last week from George Washington University ( Washington , D. C. ) came new and astonishing light on the Tramp Athlete . Eleven members of the freshman football squad appointed a spokesman-Carrol Robinson of Salem , N. J. , crack tackle-to present to Coach James Ebenezer Pixlee their demands : that the wages which they earned as janitors , watchmen , waiters be given to them for spending money , that their board and tuition to which their earnings are normally applied be given them gratis . Coach Pixlee , unable to meet their requests , was considerably embarrassed when the cream of his team walked out . <P> Said Spokesman Robinson : " It 's always understood that if you go away to play football you will be taken care of . ... We got wind of a rumor several days ago that we were all going to be dropped to shift for ourselves after the football season . . . felt that we ought to get something besides food and flop and tuition . . . . Most of us will get jobs on ships until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch on at any other college-certainly not this year . " <P> Commented Coach Pixlee : " I realize that five of our best prospects were included among the blacklisted students . But when , principle is involved , one can not think of actual results . "
