By the number of people who watch it , the number of people who read about it , the amount of money it draws , football is obviously the No. 1 amateur sport of the U. S. On two days last week , the season of 1936 , during which some 20,000,000 spectators paid $30,000,000 to see games played by 700 college teams , arrived at its climax , approached its conclusion . <P> In Seattle , a Thanksgiving Day crowd of 40,000 saw University of Washington , clinching its claim to the Pacific Coast Conference championship , roll up its biggest score in 34 games ( 40-10-0 ) against Washington State . First two touchdowns and the last were made by Sophomore Fullback Albert Cruver . One each went to Byron Haines and Jim Cain , spark-plugs of the Washington backfield since the season 's start . Another touchdown rewarded one of the year 's trickiest plays-a lateral from Nowogroski to Cain , who forwarded to Dick Johnson . Next day , after a secret poll to pick the West Coast representative for the Rose Bowl game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington unanimous . <P> Famed for its crew-which this year won the Intercollegiate and Olympic championships-its ski teams and its swimmers , the University of Washington 's football prowess was great from 1908 through 1916 , when its coach was famed Gilmour ( " Gloomy Gil " ) Dobie , later at Cornell , now at Boston College . The year before Dobie arrived , Washington lost four games and the year after he left , it won only one . <P> During Coach Dobie 's nine-year stay , Washington did not lose a game . In the course of 61 contests without a defeat , it ran up 39 victories in a row , a string surpassed only by Yale 's 48 from 1885 to 1889 . Its opponents included everything from the best teams in the U. S. to high- school boys and sailors from U. S. warships . <P> This year , not the least of Washington 's achievements turned out to be the only game it lost , at the outset of its brightest year since 1925 . That was to Minnesota , on Andy Uram 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Phelan , who played at Notre Dame from 1915 through 1917 , using an attack that stresses finesse more than sheer ( and traditional ) power , Washington earned its right to play in the Rose Bowl by seven victories in which its opponents scored only one touchdown , and a 14-to-14 tie with Stanford . <P> Byron Haines , Washington 's lefthanded , left-footed , drop-kicking halfback wears custom-made football shoes , and in them has become the best open-field runner on the Coast . Jim ( " Sugar " ) Cain , campus representative for Beech Nut chewing gum , has played every position in Lhe backfield this season , functioned effectively in each . Washington has represented the West in the Rose Bowl twice before . <P> In 1924 it tied Navy . In 1926 it lost to Alabama 20-to-19.
