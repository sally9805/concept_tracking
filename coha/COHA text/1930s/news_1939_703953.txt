txt Economy in Sewage Disposal Mr. Russell Replies to Critic of His $200,000,000 Saving Plan TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The greater part of the cost of providing complete treatment of the city 's one billion gallons daily of sewage is for interceptor sewers to convey the material to large centrally located treatment plants . Two-thirds of the cost of the 180,000,000-gallon-a-day plant at Wards Island is for interceptors and tunnels . Over 70 per cent of the treatment works cost on the island is for the huge settling tanks required for the long period of detention necessary to the activated sludge process of sewage treatment . John Yearwood , in a letter to THE TIMES , challenged me to show where $200,000,000 of the $350,000,000 sewage disposal program of the city can be saved . He also criticized my statement that $200,000,000 would have been saved if in 1914 we had completed a program recommended by Dr. Soper of the Metropolitan Sewage Commission . He then proceeds to support my statement with data relative to increased labor and material costs since 1914 which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , which , of course , is the burden of my complaint against the present cost to carry out a plan similar in many respects to the 1914 recommendation . Substitute Proposal Made Before the completion of the Wards Island plant was undertaken in 1934 , competent engineers submitted a substitute proposal whereby the activated sludge unit would be replaced by modern chemical precipitation plants constructed along the shoreline at points where from twenty-five to fifty million gallons a day could be gathered by connecting local outfalls with small interceptors . The short detention period required by this process eliminated the need for large land areas or huge settling tanks . The suggestion was made that the base of existing or new piers or docks be provided with treatment tanks , or floating barges be designed , into which the sewage would be pumped and mixed at high speed with chemicals . The saving in construction costs of both interceptors and plant was estimated at GO per cent of the plan adopted by the city , which , applied to the $350,000,000 proposal , is more than $200,000,000 . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to meet increase in population or seasonal conditions of the sewage matter . Although a greater number of treatment units are required under this plan , strangely enough the fixed and operating costs were estimated to be 50 per cent less than the city 's plan . Suggestion was also made that the chemically treated , odorless sewage solids be dried and sold for fertilizer , the revenue from which was estimated at $2,000,000 a year . In connection with the survey made at the time , it was found that some 200,000,000 gallons a day , or one-fifth of the total sewage , was from waste of water into sewers by faulty household plumbing and wasteful use of the city 's water supply . The elimination of this waste would save 20 per cent of sewage disposal plant capacity and other incidentals to the treatment process . Difficulty in Treatment So much difficulty has been had with the treatment method on Wards Island as to challenge the wisdom of the plan adopted by the city . They now resort to partial chemical treatment as an aid to the activated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure of the plant properly to treat the sewage so that huge quantities of untreated sewage must be by-passed into the river until the peculiar biological requirements of the activated process are restored . The city is handicapped for funds to proceed with a plan , even one that means a saving of $200,000,000 , but this could be overcome if we would apply for legislation exempting sewage works from the debt limit . We are now spending $300,000,000 for the wasteful Delaware Water Project , which is exempt from the debt limit and which in fact will tend to increase the sewage-disposal problem by inviting greater waste of water . I trust this explanation will activate Mr. Yearwood 's interest in the sewagedisposal problem and in saving the millions of waste involved in the city 's present program . EDWARD T.

Food at the Fair To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am one of the hundreds of thousands who went to the World 's Fair on opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned home with a bad taste in my mouth . It was due to the food situation at the Fair . My experience on opening day demonstrated that it 's impossible to get a square meal in anything like comfortable surroundings at a reasonable price . It even requires the patience of a Job and the muscles of a football player to get a hot dog at any of the stands where they dispense this type of food . It seems to me that the Fair could operate a sufficient number of restaurants where one could obtain a complete meal for a dollar or a dollar and a quarter . There should be enough profit at this price to justify the undertaking . J. STANLEY LEWIS . New Rochelle ? N. Y. , May 2 , 1939 . Employment Week Favored TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The President 's proclamation designating the week of April 30 as Employment Week brings renewed courage to the men and women over 40 who are seeking work . It was Plato , 1 believe , who thought that a citizen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being adequately prepared for our careers , such as they are , is characteristic of the difference between ancient Greece and the United States , so youngsters must be at a premium since knowledge , experience and good judgment are no longer reckoned . On the other hand , turning from business to the professions , the aged always command larger fees and greater respect than novices ; therefore I can not . understand why personnel managers invariably shake their heads if one admits to being 42 . Fortunately , a movement that began last year in Boston has spread to several American cities : the Forty-Plus groups are actively engaged in promoting the idea that unemployed persons of 40 can still be valuable to employers and self-respecting to themselves .

Women and Neutrality Act One Asserts That Organizations Acted Without Members ' Consent To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The press has recently reported that various national women 's organizations are in favor of the repeal of the Neutrality Act and that these organizations are represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees and who has been conducting an active speaking and radio campaign advocating this repeal . As a charter member of one of these organizations , the League of Women Voters , and a long-time member of another , the American Association of University Women , I wish to protest in the name , I believe , of a very large majority of the members of both of these organizations that the women of this country are strongly in favor of extending instead of repealing the Neutrality Act . Whatever action our national boards or national officers may have taken , the fact remains that this is a current political issue on which the opinions of the rank and file of the membership have never been registered . Certainly our organizations have held no referendum on this subject , nor have we ever had notice or warning that a vote on this subject was to be taken at any time . Many women who have belonged to these organizations for years have been astonished to find themselves apparently committed to this alien point of view by a small number of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without authority . No doubt they have authority under constitution and by-laws that has made it legal for them to appoint this speaker as their representative if they wished to do so . But they clearly have no evidence that the members of their organizations share the opinions of this representative . On the contrary , the women of these organizations , like other women in America , hope and believe that the Neutrality Act will be extended and strengthened , as the only way at the present time that will make it possible for America to remain outside the battle lines of Europe .

Minding Our Own Business To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your correspondent , Albert Lee , states that " there seems to be no sound reason for not placing a munitions embargo on Japan . " There is a sound reason . The majority of Americans intend that this nation shall mind its own business . ARTHUR NOONAN . New York , May 3 , 1939 . Gambling and Churches To THE EDITOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently to the activity of a number of clergymen of New Jersey concerning the evil of betting on horse races . While this would seem a cause worthy of their consideration , it has been suggested by those not associated with horse betting that these gentlemen might be persuaded to turn their attention to the gambling instinct in their own localities , even under the auspices of church societies . This interest commences with the youngest in our communities who go from door to door with little books of five-cent chances from which the lucky number will receive a pie or cake , and includes even women working in church societies who find more interest in raising money through little books , the lucky number giving them a patchwork quilt . To the uninitiated the enthusiasm of men or women playing bridge or bingo seems a little strange until one sees the lucky ones march away carrying the prize . In these days , when propaganda plays such an important part , many of us are apt to see but one side of the question of horse betting and forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from lotteries . MAY CASWELL LIOGErr . Springfield , N. J. , May 2 , 1939 . If Lincoln Lived Today To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It would appear that this is the age of charity and paternalism . If that rugged individualist Abraham Lincoln had been a boy today , the chances are that a kindly government would have furnished Lincoln 's father with a good floor for his cabin , some civic club would have supplied the young man with a reading lamp , while another would have certainly furnished him with a set of good books . Federal officers would see to it that he did not go to work until he was 16 years of age and that then he must not break the law by accepting anything less than the established minimum wage and that he must not work more than a maximum limit of hours . He would doubtless be regimented into some organization wherein any tendency to rugged individualism would be smoothed off into conventional regularity . The youth movement would then be ready to take him in charge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , there would be no Abraham Lincoln . HENRY WARS ALLEN . Wichita , Kan. , May 2 , 1939.
