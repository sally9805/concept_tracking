Owing somewhere around $170,000 , the ten-year-old publishing house of Covici-Friede last week was taken over by its printers , J. J. Little &; Ives , who alone were in for a reported $103,000 . Main asset of interest to creditors was Novelist John Steinbeck , ex-laborer and reporter whose tender tale of proletarian brutality , Of Mice and Men , had netted Covici-Friede about $35,000 . How much Steinbeck was considered to be worth by publishers was disclosed last week when his contract was sold for $15,000 to Viking Press , which in addition gave Publisher Pascal Covici a job . ( Partner Donald Friede withdrew three years ago . ) <P> Simultaneously with closing of the Steinbeck deal came Viking 's rosy announcement that advance orders for Steinbeck 's new volume of short stories , The Long Valley , to be published September 19 , had already reached the 8,000 mark . Hard at work on a new novel at his bungalow in Los Gatos , Calif. , Novelist Steinbeck meanwhile awaited a check for $6,000 covering back royalties . This will bring his total earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ) to around $50,000 . In another 17 years , when he is 53 , he figures he will have saved enough to give him an income of $35 a week . That will be enough , says he .
