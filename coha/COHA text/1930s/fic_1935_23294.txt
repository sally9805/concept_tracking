4.31r  --  ZI SLOT MACHINE A STORY BY MARGARET CULKIN BANNING J AY did n't intend to have more than a sandwich and a glass of milk for lunch . At first he thought that he would stop in for it at some cafeteria near the office and then he changed his mind . His stenographer would n't be back for at least an hour , and until she got out those letters there was n't much to do . Also , he did n't want anyone to get the idea that he i was avoiding people he knew because Elsa had left him . That was n't the way he meant to play it at all . So he went out to the Town Club where he was living now , and the steward told him that Mr. Brooks had been looking for him . " Where is Mr. Brooks ? " " I think he 's in the taproom , Mr. Colby . " The taproom was one place Jay had meant to avoid . Drinking at noon was definitely out . He had made that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something important on his mind . If the plan materialized that he had been talking about vaguely the other day of refinancing those two investment companies , and they took Jay on as general counsel and secretary at a good retainer , it would fix up everything . Not at once , but in time . Jay was sure that he could pay off every debt , given enough time and a little run of luck . He had told that to Elsa . But she had stopped believing it . There were several men in the taproom drinking at the bar , and another was standing at one of the three slot machines , the one that had to be fed with quarters . " The jack-pot 's just about ready to drop , " said the man who was playing . " Give me five dollars more in quarters , Morris . " The boy behind the bar opened a paper package of silver coins and brought the right amount . " Hello , Jay , " called Ford from the bar , " I 've been looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow afternoon . " Jay came over to him . " Sorry . I 've resigned from Woodlawn . " " Oh  --  did n't know  --  too bad , " said Ford . But he did n't protest any further . That , as Jay well knew , was because they all thought that he should have resigned months ago though they liked to play Saturday afternoon golf with him . Probably they thought he should get out of this club also . But he had to live somewhere and he was n't going to let anybody think he felt that he was licked . Once you did that you were all through . Ford changed the subject but he made no mention of refinancing companies or retainers . " Look at old Pete over there , throwing his money away , " was all he said . Jay ordered a drink for himself . Now that he was here he felt that he might as well . Brooks picked up his glass and said in an abbreviated and undirected toast , " Luck . " And Jay too drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money and his house , and now his wife was gone . Every man in the room must know that by this time . They were all friends , but he suspected that when they talked him over with their wives or with one another they were critical and suggested that he had n't played it right . When a man was n't getting any breaks , even his friends bore down on him . The twenty quarters Peter Gow had called for clicked , one after another . He came away from the machine resentfully . " Five dollars gone to heir Everyone was amused . It always was a joke to see Pete Gow lose money because it pained him , even though he was so rich . jay felt in his own pocket and found some change , two quarters . Walking over to the quarter machine , he put in one of them . An orange , a plum , and a bar appeared as he pulled the handle . Nothing else happened . " I think the damned thing 's stuck , " said Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly three straight bars , each advertising Bull's-Eye Gum , changed the pattern under the glass . There was a shower of quarters , clogging the place in which they fell , some of them spilling on the floor . The jack-pot had dropped . The other men came over to see and exclaim . " If that fellow does n't have all the luck , " grumbled Pete . " I just fed the thing eight dollars " " How much did you get , Jay ? " Jay counted his winnings . " Thirty-two dollars . " " That ought to hold your Jay gathered up the quarters , chuckling and warmed . It was a goodwindfall . Better than that , it was a great satisfaction to get the money when Pete had n't been able to get it , and to have the machine prove that luck was n't always against him . At the bar he changed the money into bills , bought two more drinks , and went upstairs to the dining room . " Well , George , " he said to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just got the big jack-pot . " " Did you , Mr. Colby ? " asked the negro in delight , with his one-piece smile . " Good luck sure know where it ought to fall ! " Jay glanced up but he saw that the nigger had n't meant anything special by that . He was recommending the English mutton chops , so Jay ordered one of those though he had n't meant to eat so much . However , it was a kind of celebration . The slot machine incident had set him up . It made him feel right on the edge of something good . If he had n't come out here this noon somebody else would have had that money . And he had nearly not come . Someone across the room called to him that he certainly was a horseshoe , and Jay noticed Bob Wilson , taking it all in from his place at a near-by table . Jay did n't like Bob so he laughed a little more loudly in answer and made a big thing of it . It annoyed Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he really did have some 1 brains tucked back of those little sharp eyes . Wilson was a director of the club , and Jay knew that he objected to the slot machines in the taproom , which were illegal , and that he was a great stickler for the posting of delinquencies in dues . Bob Wilson was always minding someone else 's business and all he had ever done for a living was to marry a girl with money . Ten years ago Jay could have married her himself . Marie Wilson did n't ask Jay to dinner any more , but she had been crazy about him once . He might have married her if Elsa had n't appeared on the scene and made shadows out of all other women . Jay thought , I put it over for quite a while . Elsa had as much as anybody else . We held up our end better than a lot of them . We never served bum liquor and we never forgot our friends . They were all glad enough then to come to the house if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was odd that now , with Elsa gone , Jay wanted more than ever to put it over . The outcome was between him 1 and the town now , between him and his luck . Elsa had to go . Jay knew it . He admitted it . They were terribly on each other 's nerves . They could n't be civil to each other in pub , he any longer . It was easier when they were by themselves , though that was hard enough . But the only thing was to have a new set-up . Six months ago she had begged him to make a clean break , to go somewhere else and begin from scratch . But Jay would n't do that . He was n't going off like a tramp . And besides , he knew that he would touch bottom one of these days and then come up again . He got back to his office at two- ' thirty and said to his stenographer , " Well , just made some money ! " The girl glanced up doubtfully , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking . He always knew when a woman gave him that look . It annoyed him now . He had n't been drinking . Since lunch he 'd had just one highball and that nip of brandy which he could n't refuse when it was offered to him . If the girl did n't mind her own business she 'd have to be on her way . He was n't asking her opinion of what he *should or should n't do . The stenographer had not said a word , but he still felt as if she had . L Elsa had also made him feel that way in these last weeks . There was little work to do . The letters he had dictated were ready for him to sign . Most of them concluded the final arrangements about the furniture in his house . They had come to an agreement about that . Elsa wanted nothing but her clothes and a few things she loved for color or memory . Jay did n't want any of the stuff and he could n't pay storage on it if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Town Club by the week and moved out after she had gone . The house in which he and Elsa had lived had never really belonged to them . He had made the first few payments , but after that he got behind on everything and the mortgagor had only let them live on in the place because they kept it heated and the property could n't be sold to advantage on a bad market . But that could n't go on forever . The property had reverted to the first owner and Jay had sold the furniture to him as well . It would take care of the back-interest payments in part . He was glad to get rid of the house . It was a fine , handsome place but there was n't a corner of it that had n't held a worry or an embarrassment in these last years . The only things Jay really regretted letting go were the bottle cupboard which had been especially constructed for his use and some of those cues in the billiard rack . The second afternoon mail came in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few advertisements coaxing him to buy securities or big cars . He had been in the big-car class and it took a surprisingly long time to get off a mailing list . There was also a letter from his bank . He looked through the mail , leaving much of it unopened , wondering a little if there would be any word from Elsa before she sailed . Of course there was n't . She was the type that could see through anything she started , and she had said it must be a clean , final break . She was on the ocean now and she 'd never come back as his wife . He imagined the wind swinging round her the checked tweed coat she was probably wearing . She was going to Sweden with some friends who were glad to get her away from Jay . They 'd been working on it . Maybe I 'll fool them , thought Jay . Maybe disappoint them and come through . The letter from his bank asked him , in a disciplinary way , to come in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the liquor and the jubilance of the slot machine jackpot , Jay decided they could n't scare him . All right , he 'd go to see them . He looked at his watch . There was time to do it now before the bank closed . " Mrs. Hull is on the telephone , " said his stenographer . Jay picked up his extension . " Hullo , Grace . " He could tell from the tone of her voice that Grace Hull was quite determined to do the right thing . She was being brightly conscientious about it , after having talked him over with everyone , after having pitied Elsa . If she only knew how she had bored Elsa , thought Jay . " Jay , how are you ? I have n't seen you in ages . We 've missed you ! " She talked with little false italics , pressing enthusiasms into words and statements where they did n't belong . Jay knew that Grace had not missed him at all . She had known him since they both were children but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsa had been in a fast crowd that was too rich for his income . The failure of his marriage had to be almost a triumph for Grace . It proved how necessary all her own precautionsand safeguards were . Grace would never have run such risks as to overspend , to live in too large a house , to love without making it a matter of return obligation . She was asking him to come to dinner now because it was the conspicuously kind thing to do and Grace fancied herself as benignant . Besides it would give her a close-up view of the Colby situation , and lots of people wanted that . " Sorry I ca n't make it , Grace , " sal Jay laconically , " but thanks a whol lot . I 'm tied up with a bridge game . " " How about Friday ? " " I may be out of the city , " he lied . " Well , I 'll try again . I 've thought o you so often , and wondered about yo and if there was anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'd love to have a good talk with you . You know , Jay , sometimes I think that 's what we all need . Just t talk things over . " He almost laughed . She was so obvious . What there had been between him and Elsa was not for Grace to fins ger with her clumsy pity . " Plenty of talk seems to be going on , " he said . " Now , Jay , you must n't be bitter ! ' That was what she 'd say . He knew it as he said good-by and put the tel phone down . She would tell peoplc that she had talked to Jay Colby and he was so bitter . Let her . He put on his hat and went over to the bank . It was a little after three o'clock bu Jay went in the side door and asked fo Mr. Ladd , who kept him waiting fif teen minutes and then sent word tha he could see Mr. Colby . Jay was fa . miliar with that inner office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here when i had n't been hard to get it , in the day when bankers were willing to take a chance , when they were looking for 9 good gamble , in the days when all h had to do was to sign his name . " Well , Jay , " said Mr. Ladd , beginning in a friendly way , " how are things going ? " " All right , " said Jay , " picking up . " " We 've been wondering about that note of yours . It 's been running some time . Too long , as a matter of fact . " " I 've hoped you 'd extend it for another six months . " " We 'd like to . We 'd like to help you out , Jay . But after all , you know this is n't our money . " " I 've been having some pretty poor breaks , " said Jay . " I 'll get on top of them soon . " " Yes . We hope so . Your equity in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . " " Furniture ? " " I let it go . It 's no good to me . " " Running a car ? " " I figure taxis are cheaper in this weather . " " And street cars , " said the banker , " arc still cheaper . Law business pretty good ? " " Not right now . " " Making your office expenses ? " " I have a bad month now and then , " said Jay . " Any new prospects ? " " As a matter of fact I have . " " Nothing you could turn into negotiable paper ? " " Not right now . " " Too bad . You know how it is with us . We 've got some collateral of yours here but we ca n't continue to protect it . I It does n't cover your borrowings as things are . " " It was worth double the amount when I put it up . " i " Maybe so . But not now . We 'll have to sell those bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've been a depositor here for years . " " Yes . You 've had a lot of money and you 've spent a lot . Now Jay , I 'm a good friend of yours . You knowthat . It seems to me that one might say you 're at the crossroads right now . You want to choose the right road . Spend what you earn . Not a penny more . Live within your means . " Jay had heard it before . Easy to say spend what you earn , but what if you were n't earning anything ? He thought that those had been Elsa 's bonds . He 'd have to get them back to her . She had said she did n't want them , but she was going to have them back no matter what she said . When the banker paused Jay said good-by and went out . He walked straight over to Ford Brooks ' office to see if he could talk over that reorganization plan and build a fire under it . But Ford was out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own office , so Jay went back to the club . His bill was in his box and he stuck it in his pocket before he had a game of squash and a shower . He won the game and his opponent bought him a drink in the taproom and after that they played the dime machine . All the days of three months were much alike except that he managed on one of them to borrow five hundred dollars from a rather remote cousin . He paid his club bill and his office rent and his stenographer . There was n't much of it left . He knew that they were beginning to look at him queerly at the club . He was posted again . Peter Cow and Bob Wilson were together in the taproom when Jay walked in one spring evening . They nodded but they did n't ask him to have a drink . He did n't need one . He walked over to the slot machines . He always had a chance with them anyway . Jay wondered if Peter was still worrying about that five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably he was . That was the millionaire of it . " Give me some dimes , Morris , " he said brusquely to the boy at the bar . Morris looked at Bob Wilson . " All out of dimes , Mr. Colby , " he said . It was n't true . The men at the bar knew it . Jay knew it . He swung round with a savage face . " Give me some dimes , damn you , " he repeated . Bob Wilson stepped forward , very much the director now . " Look here , Colby , you ca n't talk like that to our employees . " " Who 's going to stop me ? " " The club is . And we ca n't have you borrowing small change from everybody to play those machines with . " It was true , so Jay swung out and knocked him down . In the back of the cigar store there was a place Jay had n't known was there . He had come in here every now and then for cigarettes and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the room so he was hanging round . Since he had given up his office he slept very late in the morning and about this time of night he was always wide awake . The fellow who asked him now to play a game of pool was someone he did n't know but he played a nice game . Jay took his money . He was about to tell the stranger once about those billiard cues he had left behind when he sold his house and furniture , then thought he would n't mention it or they might think he was bragging . " Let 's see if we can beat the old machine , " he said . " You never can , " remarked the other man . " It ca n't be done . " Jay got a lot of dimes at the cigar counter and began to play . It showed three oranges after the first dime and he got eighty cents out of that and fed it back . It took only forty . The jackpot clattered down  --  and it looked like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them mind , " said Jay , chuckling . That was the first luck he 'd had in weeks . Going from one office to another asking for a job was n't any fun . If he could n't get a job he asked for a small loan , and sometimes he got that and saw in the eyes of the person who gave it that it was the last one , saw what he had seen in Elsa 's eyes when she 'd told him she was going away with her friends , something final , something else ended . He knew it when he saw it , knew when they stopped believing that he would ever come back . But there was luck left in the world just the same . He liked the feeling of all that money in his pocket , all those dimes . They proved it . He played there often after that . Sometimes he would make a dollar and lose it and sometimes he would n't even make the dollar . It began to anger him to see that jack-pot just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . It happened more than once . He got ugly . The proprietor began to say , " What 'll you have , Mr. Colby ? " as soon as he came in , and to make him spend something . But the slugs were an accident . There was a store near the room Jay rented where they sold magazines and newspapers and old books and Japanese curios and puzzles and all sorts of junk . He stopped in there for a newspaper one night , and the fellow did n't wait on him at once because he was sorting stuff on his shelves . Some of it was piled on the counter . Jay was in no hurry . He took the cover off a box and explored . " What 's this ? " " Slugs , " said the man . " Never see them before ? " ill " No , " said Jay . " What are they for ? " " Anything . We do n't sell them any more . Not allowed to . But they used to be sold a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , what do you know about , that ? " grinned Jay . 1 He picked one up . It was smooth and made of lead and not quite the right weight . He was curious . 1 " Let me have a few of these . I want to fool somebody . " " Take them along . No good to me . " Jay picked up a dozen and put them in his pocket . " Thanks . " 1 Of course he did n't intend to use them . It was just fun to see if they would work . He 'd tell the fellow he was putting them in before he did it . But it would be interesting and it only took a very small thing to interest Jay now . He liked to concentrate on something that would keep him from ! spreading his situation before himself . He liked to curl his thoughts round some dislike he had cherished or injustice done him . He read the papers and explained them bitterly to himself . He ate in lunchwagons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That night it rained again and the room was wakeful and unpleasant . Jay could n't stand it . He drank all the gin he had , and then wandered down the street and into the cigar store . Maybe he 'd pick up a game of pool and he liked those fellows . It was all very well to be high-hat but nobody knew what was happening in the country who did n't mix a little . He told himself that he would n't miss the experience of the last few months for a good deal . Those fellows out at the Town Club did n't know what it was all about . 4 He stood about for a while because nobody wanted to play with him . They thought he was too tight to play . They knew who he was and what he had been of course . He saw a man whose face was familiar and suddenly remembered who he was . That was Bob Wilson 's chauffeur , and he must be paid with Marie Wilson 's money . If Jay had married Marie he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had married Elsa . And at that thought of Elsa , whom lie always denied to his mind now , a horrible sense of failure and impotence crowded up on him again . It would be loss in a moment and he knew he could n't stand that . He walked away from the pool table over to the slot machines . The quarter one looked full , ready to drop . He put his hand in his pocket and felt the slugs . Pulling one out he tried it . Nothing happened , but it fitted certainly . It worked the machine all right . He put in another , two more , six , seven , absorbed now in making the thing work . And then the angry hand of the proprietor was on his shoulder , digging into it . " You dirty bum ! Get out of here , " said the man , " you dirty cheat ! " Jay swore viciously in answer . " I saw what you 're putting in there ? " Jay went after him . He went after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They beat him up and threw him out on the street and he was pretty well battered and not steady , so he lay there and the policeman picked him up , out of the rain , off the sidewalk , drunk and disorderly . In the morning , the judge wanted to know what the fight was about . But Jay would n't tell . Naturally the fellow in the shop would n't tell a judge . The machines were n't supposed to be there . But Jay knew that the chauffeur would tell . Bob would know . Marie would know . In the club and over dinner parties they would tell that story . Perhaps the judge , who was a politician about town and knew Jay 's career , would tell the rest of it . But he was a very decent judge . " Colby , " he said . " there 's no complaint going to be entered against you . I do n't like this business . This is too bad . You 've been a good lawyer . You 've been a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing for you to do right now and that 's to clear out . You ca n't ever build up here again . Get into a new place , cut out the booze , and make a fresh start . Do it before it 's too late . Buy yourself a ticket somewhere . " " With what ? " asked Jay . The judge knew practically everything about human distress . But this shocked him . For Jay had been a swell , one of the upper crust . It seemed to the judge far worse than the predicament of accustomed bums on the benches because it had been so swift a blow . It almost embarrassed him . " Come in to see me in my rooms , " he said . For he could n't lend him money over the bar of justice . The bus left at noon and at ten o'clock that night Jay was still traveling . Every now and then he remembered that a scant year ago Elsa had begged him to go away , to make the break then . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was still bruised with blows and shame hut he was a little easier now , after sleeping in the chair all afternoon and looking out at strange fields and towns and houses that held no criticism of him . He was n't going to let anyone get anything on him again . This was a fresh start . He still had brains . He 'd do something . They were stopping . He got out and stretched . There were twenty minutes to wait and , instead of going in the bus depot , he wandered down the street so that he could be by himself . He chose a small tavern which looked common and quiet . It was a cheap little place , smelling of sour beer , and it was evidently legal to have slot machines . There stood three of them in the open against the wall . Jay looked at them with a horrid turn-over of memory , remembering last night , hating himself all over again . He walked over to where they stood , wondering how many people they had fooled to-day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all right . He made a bet with himself . The thing would drop if he played it twice . He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his change , the judge 's money . Two quarters . He 'd send the judge back that money . He put one of them in and jerked the handle . " Say  --  look , " said a man on the other side of the room , " that fellow got the jack-potl "
