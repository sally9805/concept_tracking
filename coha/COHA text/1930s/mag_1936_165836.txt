Polling New York City and State , the New York News fortnight ago reported that 10,771 people approached by News representatives at home and in the street were going to vote for Franklin Roosevelt Nov. 3 as compared with 6,775 who favored Alf Landon for President . Same day the Literary Digest 's national Presidential straw vote revealed that in New York State 99,228 voters , telephone-subscribers and club members were for Landon , 34,120 for Roosevelt . When he saw this discrepancy , the News 's energetic Publisher Joseph Medill Patterson summoned an editor , had him get the Digest 's Publisher Wilfred J. Funk on the telephone , offer to bet him $10,000 against $5,000 that the News 's straw vote was more accurate for New York State than the Digest 's poll . <P> " Why , that sounds like easy money ! " said Mr. Funk . " Let me talk it over with some of the boys in the office . " After talking it over , Mr. Funk was less enthusiastic . The Digest figures Captain Patterson had challenged did not include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in the magazine 's poll . <P> Though he still " did n't know of an easier way to make $10,000 , " if the wager were on the final figures of Digest and News , Mr. Funk felt that " as a matter of policy it would be impossible for the Literary Digest to bet on its ' own poll . . . . The magazine takes no sides . . . plays no favorites . . . . " <P> Captain Patterson and the Newsmen airily labeled this sensible stand as " walking out " on a " tentative promise " to take up the bet . Of his own poll , Captain Patterson remarked on the editorial page : " Only time will tell how accurate this poll is . . . . Our 1928 poll was inaccurate . . . . Since that time , we have reliably predicted results in this State . "
