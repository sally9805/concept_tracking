txt ADVANTAGES OF MUTUELS Holds Larger State . Rev.enuee to Be Only an Incidental Boon ? To Sports Editor of The New York Times : It is with some diffidence that I venture to offer some slants on racing which a recent column by John Kieran indicates may be welcome . I know a good deal about racing and this dearly purchased knowledge is behind my comments . As Mr. Kieran said , the possible revenue from the mutnel take would not solve New York State 's financial problems . It would help , but would ' not furnish a complete and final answer , any more than a Federal lottery would meet the towering Federal deficits . I hope nobody is claiming this for the mutuels . But mutuel revenues at least would be ' five or six times as large as the income the State now receives from admission taxes and there are other considerations so important and obVious as to de , serve attention . In my opinion , it can be stated as a positive , provable fact that the mutuel system is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever , not only for the State 's revenues but for the public , the horsemen and the track owners themselves . Machines Opposed by Bookies Naturally the bookies would n't like it ; but since they are a , sinister and predatory influence in racing , operating a sure-thing game against the public , with the whole sport in New York subordinated to their business as Professional gamblers , I do n't think they are entitled to any consideration . Mutuels are better for the public for a variety of reasons , the first of which is that at mutuel tracks admission prices are substantially lower . In New York the race-goer pays through the nose , all on account of the bookie , because his admission fee , plus the payments by the bookies ( which also come from the fan ) are the sole source of a track 's revenue . The odds against the horses , of course , reflect all this . Just consider the perplexity of a visitor , used to the mutuel system , surrounded by bookies offering 3 to 5 against all horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot and , some of them ; refusing to accept bets against favorites at any price . The visitor , coming from any of the twenty-odd States where the mutuels operate , might naturally inquire where the two-dollar win , dows were . Imagine the scorn that would greet this query . Many of the bookies regard a two-dollar bet with the disdain natural of such wealthy guys ; and many wo n't take show bets , either . Benefits Revert to Public Let me emphasize that a bookie operates on a percentage which may run as high as 40 , whereas the top mutuel take , I believe , is 10 . ConI eider also that the track receives the net of the mutuel take ( less the State 's share ) and returns the money to the public in better accommodations and lower admissions and to the horsemen in bigger purses . The miserable accommodations at all New York tracks are only in Ikeeping with the general public-bedamned attitude shown toward race-goers in the Empire State , who for many years have been so meek and uncomplaining that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport , no better treatment . This may give you the slant of a race-goer ' who at least in that capacity knows what it is all about . It also will explain why I am looking forward to the day when , with mutuels in New Jersey , I can see a- $50,000 handicap at a tine track while a few hundred of the select witness the running of the sadly degenerated Suburban at Belmont . Fair warning  --  that is what is going to happen and the reasons why it should n't are not confined , as I have tried to show , to the State 's revenue . KENNETH C. CRAIN . New York , April 30 , 1939 . A Record Not on the Books To Sports Editor Of The New York Times : Mel Walker cleared 209 centimeters , the equivalent r 6 feet 1014 inches , while touring Europe with an American track team in 1937 . Why is he not credited with the world 's high jump record ? New York , April 29 , 1939 . Editorial Note : According to Daniel J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker 's mark , through an oversight by the Swedish officials , was not submitted for approval to ' the International Amateur Athletic Federation in time to be acted on at that body 's last meeting in February , 1938 , However , the performance will be ruled on at the next I. A. A. F. meeting , which will be held in Helsingfors at the time of the 1940 Olympics . A GIANT FAN 'S BAD DREAM Slumbering Reader Is Disturbed by Visions of Dodger Menace To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I went to bed the other night but sleep did not come easy . Disturbing visions of a man with a malicious countenance appeared before me . " I am the spirit of the Brooklyn Dodgers , " he droned , " and this year my earthly progeny will finish ahead of the Giants . " Then he leered evilly and prodded me , first with a pitchfork , and then with Hamlin 's pitching record and Camilli 's batting average . I , loyal Giant fan , unable to answer , awoke with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture flashed before my mind : Joe Moore batting only .158 and playing poorly afield ; Myatt not hitting and unable to steal first base ; Bonura allergic to baseballs hit or thrown in his direction ; Jurges weak at the plate ; Demaree slower than a broken-down jalopy in a Sunday traffic jam ; Whitehead an uncertain factor . I also saw a parade of pitchers : Hubbell , a former great now at the end of the trail ; Melton , who soared high his first year , who beat only the second division clubs the next year and who now is beating only the Giants ; Schumacher , throwing only a nothing ball and looking like a nothing-winner ; Castleman  --  oh , oh , oh ! But mortal man can star d only so much . I cried out in anguish . There was only one chance . I took out the crystal ball ; donned my turban and gazed fixedly into the flawless globe . Yes , the Fates decreed first place for the Giants . Then I took a hat pin , closed my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of National League teams . Forsooth , the pin pierced the name of the New York Giants . One test remained . I opened the dictionary and , lo ! the page I picked at random carried the legend " giant . " All the tests have been passed and I hope to sleep soundly now . But please , Bill Terry , make the Giants win . A fellow ca n't always rely on his imagination . ARTHUR WEISS . New York , May 2 , 1939 . Baseball Sandwich Men To Sports Editor of The New York Time. : Baseball being a strictly mercenary game at best , I have been wondering what has kept the magnates from seizing upon a simple yet logical means of adding to their purses . The plan , though it may sound silly , is as sensible as the placing of advertisements around the walls of the balls parks . Simply sell space on the players ' uniforms . The potentialities of the idea are unlimited . Players could be classified according to known foibles , habits or whims . For any outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAN WINSTON New York , May 2 , 1939 . Editorial Note : The idea has interesting possibilities . But it also has disturbing drawbacks . Just suppose , for instance , the human legend for " Dairy Fresh Milk " ( sic ) should go sour at bat , in the field or on the mound . Cites a Bigger Yankee Score to Sports Editor of The New York Times : A minor point of order for your staff correspondent with the New York Yankees , who alleged that the 22-2 drubbing of the Tigers on May 2 was the biggest score made under " Marse Joe " McCarthy  --  in 1936 , the Yankees trimmed the Philadelphia Athletics by the count of 25-2 . MOREY BERGER . Ithaca , N. Y. , May 3 , 1939 . Editorial Note : The correspondent is quite correct . However , the mistake referred to , a general one probably resultant from the confusion caused by Gehrig 's retirement , was rectified in the later editions of THE TIMES of May 3 . NEW EVIDENCE ON HAND Old Story of Baseballs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nate York Tinto , : Come , come , air ! Do you infer in your comment on A. M. Sakolaki 's letter that the verdict of the Baseball Commission of 1907 is the final word on the subject of the origin of baseball ? In the thirty years since the report of the commission , much additional evidence has been presented , all of which completely explodes the Doubleday-Cooperstown tradition . Doubleday , in all probability , played baseball ? but so did hundreds of other boys in many parts of the States long before his day , as well as hundreds more in England still earlier . Your reference to A. G. Spalding 's book , published in 1911 , is most misleading , since this work is superseded by later research . May I refer you to the latest : " Baseball and Rounders , " by Robert W. Henderson , in the Bulletin of The New York Public Library for April , 1939 . The Cooperstown people erected their Baseball Museum in good faith but no ? . that their claims have been incontrovertibly proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perpetuate an error . There is no reason why the Baseball Museum should not remain at Cooperstown . But  --  let it tell the truth ! R. W. HENDERSON , New York , 41. prii 29 , 1939 . Was Doubleday A. W. 0 . L. ? To Sports Editor of Tho New York Times : A. M. Sakolski 's letter in THE TIMES of last Saturday brings up a question which has puzzled me for a long time  --  namely , what was Doubleday doing in Cooperstown in 1839 , when he should have been at West Point ? I have seen somewhere an article which said that , in answer to a letter , Doubleday said he drew up the rules for the game of baseball . However , as I recall it , he said nothing as to the place . It is likely that if Doubleday introduced the game at Cooperstown he did so in 1840 , when he was on furlough from the academy . NED LEE . Richmond Hill , L. I. , April 29 , 1939 . Celebration Called Premature To Sports Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of baseball demonstrates that the Postoffice Department 's commemorative stamp may have been issued too early for the 100th anniversary of modern baseball . The first regular baseball club is believed to have been the Knickerbockers of New York , organized in 1845 . The first set of uniform rules , adopted by a convention of clubs , followed in 1857 . Therefore , if we must observe the 100th anniversary of baseball , I suggest that 1857 would be the best date to select , since the uniform set of rules then adopted really modernized the game . DAVID SHULMA N. Brooklyn , May 1 , 1939 . Editorial Note : This department , Postmaster General Farley , the Baseball Commission of 1907 and all others who in good faith have accepted as fact the founding of baseball by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown in 1839 do appear to have struck out . Mr. Henderson , author of the first of the above letters as well as of the cited article in the Bulletin of the New York Public Library , " explodes the Doubleday-Cooperstown tradition " in no uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend , his interesting and well-documented study carries undeniable authority. * The curators of the Baseball Museum might well serve the " truth , " as Mr. Henderson urges , by setting 's aside a niche in the Hall of Fame for his work .
