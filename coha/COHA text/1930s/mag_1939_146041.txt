Had some one reminded Franklin Roosevelt to put into his peace-offering message to Adolf Hitler last month some honest acknowledgment of the faults of the Versailles Treaty , Herr Hitler 's reply to Mr. Roosevelt last week ( see p. 18 ) might have been much shorter , less sarcastic . The President 's omission gave Herr Hitler a fine opening to shoot over the Roosevelt shoulder at Woodrow Wilson , and students of debate could but admire the adroitness with which he seized this opening . Herr Hitler has never been noted for humor . To some unsung ghostwriter , perhaps , was due an Iron Cross for supplying cracks that made even non-Nazis smile wryly and which put Debater Hitler at least level with Debater Roosevelt in man-to-man repartee . <P> Roosevelt : Millions of people now fear war . <P> Hitler : " This fear . . . has undoubtedly existed among mankind from time immemorial . . . . For instance , after the peace treaty of Versailles 14 wars were waged between 1919 and 1938 alone , in none of which Germany was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fear lies simply and solely in an unbridled agitation on the part of the press . . . which in the end goes so far that interventions from another planet are believed possible and cause scenes of desperate alarm . " + <P> R. Major wars leave scars for generations . <P> H. " No one knows this better than the German people . For the peace treaty of Versailles imposed burdens . . . which could not have been paid off even in a hundred years , although it has been proved precisely by American teachers of constitutional law , historians and professors of history that Germany was no more to blame for the outbreak of the war than any other nation . " <P> R. Leaders of great nations should preserve their peoples from disaster . <P> H. Then it is a " punishable neglect " for leaders not to control war-agitating newspapers , and disturbing to recall ambassadors " without any reason . " <P> R. Three nations in Europe , one in Africa have been exterminated . <P> H. " A historical error . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in 1918 into nations " which they never wished to be and never were . " As for Ethiopia , what about the Moroccans , Berbers , Arabs , Negroes ? <P> R. Self-evident home defense is the only excuse for war . <P> H. What about the U. S. in the World War ? " Let us hope . . . the United States will in the future ... not go to war . . . except in the case of unquestionable home defense . " <P> R. All international problems can be solved at the council table . <P> H. Theoretically , perhaps . " My skepticism , however , is based on the fact that it was America herself who gave sharpest expression to her mistrust in the effectiveness of conferences . For the greatest conference of all time was without any doubt the League of Nations . <P> " The freedom of North America was not achieved at the conference table any more than the conflict between the North and the South was decided there . . . . <P> " I mention all this only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although undoubtedly deserving of all honor , finds no confirmation in the history either of your own country or of the rest of the world . " <P> R. Let Germany lay down her arms before conferring .
