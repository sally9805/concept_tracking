I F MAYOR LAGUARDIA had spent his entire time in office looking for the worst possible tax , he could not have found one worse than the sales tax which he has imposed on the city of New York . Judged from any point of view , the sales tax is indefensible . It is clumsy , costly to administer , bureaucratic , and detrimental to legitimate business . The burden of the levy falls chiefly on those least able to pay it , both because this group constitutes the great hulk of the consumers and because the wealthy spend a comparatively small proportion of their income on consumers ' goods . To say , as one alderman is reported to have said , that a part of the tax will be paid by non-residents of New York is to admit that it violates even further the principles of sound taxation . If the money is to be used for the relief of New York residents , there is no reason why the city  --  the wealthiest in the world  --  should attempt to shift the burden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any number have been suggested which would be better than the one imposed . The Citizens ' Conference on Unemployment has formulated a program designed to raise from $50,000,000 to $70,000,000 by alevy on high incomes and business profits . While this would be sound , we believe a tax on luxuries to be even more defensible . Figures were forwarded to Mayor LaGuardia , for instance , showing that a very considerable sum could be raised by a graduated impost on all restaurant meals costing more than 50 cents . A tax on rents in excess of $75 a month would also yield a substantial income . Even ex-Mayor O'Brien 's much-derided levy on automobiles was far more equitable than that devised by LaGuardia , who only a few months ago was emphatic in his denunciation of attempts to throw the burden of the depression on the poor . F OR THE THIRD TIME Great Britain and the United States have made strong representations at Tokio against the oil monopoly recently established in Manchuria . From a legal standpoint these protests , are undoubtedly in order . The two Anglo-Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretense that Manchoukuo is an independent country . Nor can there be any doubt that Japan has deliberately violated the " open-door " principle contained in the Nine-Power Treaty . But it is both strange and disheartening that the State Department should not have taken a firm stand on this point until the profits of the Standard Oil Company were endangered . The hopeful aspect of the situation lies in the fact that on this issue as well as on that of naval disarmament the United States and Britain appear to be working more closely together than ever before , a development which Japanese diplomacy has sought above all else to prevent . If this cooperation can be maintained during the difficult year ahead , it is inconceivable that the Japanese will long persist in their present intransigent attitude . T A4 CKING a more substantial cause for gratification , the press has bailed the 36 per cent increase in the value of American exports for the first ten months of 1934 as indicating a " recovery of our international commerce . " An analysis of the trade returns , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains have not been made in agricultural products , where our surpluses lie , but in motor cars and manufactured goods , where the advantage obtained by devaluation of the dollar has been most apparent . Even more serious is the fact that imports have shown practically no gain , apart from the rise in prices . Since the United States is a creditor country , the increased export surplus tends to throw our international balance of payments still farther out of adjustment and to intensify pressure on the debtor countries . For the past few months it has been the policy of the Administration to take the balance owed us in the form of gold and silver . But obviously this can not be long continued without disastrous effect upon the countries depending on these metals as a basis for their currencies . It is a situation which in theory can be corrected by the reciprocal tariff negotiations now under way . Action will have to be prompt and courageous , however , to overcome the damage which has already been done by an ill-conceived monetary policy . W E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards of fair competition . If such a code is imposed on us , we intend to disregard its provisions . " Such in effect was the ultimatum flung at the NRA by spokesmen for the milk-distributing industry . The milk distributors take their stand with the tobacco manufacturers and the public utilities , whose codes , started through the administrative mill many months ago , have long been lost from sight . It is easy to understand why the employers in all three cases should be dead set against the idea of codification . The industries are already monopolies or quasi-monopolies and would gain nothing substantial through the privilege of dictating fair trade practices . Labor provisions  --  minimum wages , maximum hours , the guaranty on paper of collective bargaining  --  would be the only significant features of any code that might be forthcoming . Why become subject to labor standards , the employers reason , when the NRA can offer nothing in return ? But to understand the motives which control the employers is hardly to excuse the NRA from adhering to the premises of its own logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work week and raising rates of pay per hour , per day , and per week . The President 's licensing power lapsed last June after a life , exclusively theoretical , of one year , but Section 7-c of the Recovery Act is still effective . This section authorizes the President to impose codes limited in content to labor provisions in the event that the employers and employees of any industry fail to establish labor standards by mutual agreement . It is not too late even now to apply this provision to the defiant employers in the milk , tobacco , and power trusts . T HE SUCCESS of Soviet agrarian policy is confirmed by the announcement of Premier Molotov , on November 25 , that the rationing of bread is to be discontinued on January 1 , 1935 . Since the initial days.of the Five-Year Plan the sale of bread in the state and cooperative stores has been restricted in order to assure an adequate supply for industrial workers at a reasonable price . While the amount available for each individual has been generous according to American standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per person has proved extremely irksome to the majority of Russians . Nevertheless , even when the harvest was good , as in 1930 and 1933 , the restrictions were maintained hecause of the necessity of building up reserves of grain and of exporting all available surpluses to pay for imported machinery . Now the emergency is past , according to Premier Molotov , and sufficient grain is on hand to provide for the needs of the Soviet population up to the 1935 harvest . He pointed out that grain deliveries and grain purchased by the state during the past year totaled more than 900,000,000 bushels , as compared with 390,000,000 controlled by the state in 1928 when the bread cards were introduced . Those who would interpret this step as an indication of a " trend toward capitalism " might well ponder Molotov 's statement that 92 per cent of this grain came from collective and state farms , whereas 86 per cent had come from individual peasants as late as 1929 . Similarly , the number of state and cooperative stores has increased from 123,000 in 1928 , providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 283,000 in 1934 ; which provide for practically the entire retail trade . Despite temporary concessions to private trade  --  each hailed in the American press as the deathknell of communism  --  it has actually been all but wiped out . If one wished to make invidious comparisons , one might also point out that in the Soviet Union the increased cost of bread is to be offset by a rise in wages  --  the second within a year . T HE HITLER GOVERNMENT has dismissed Professor Karl Barth from his post in the University of Bonn because he insisted on qualifying the oath of loyalty exacted of all university teachers . Barth , the leader of the neo-orthodox " dialectical " school of theology , has been a thorn in the flesh of the Nazis throughout the controversy between the church and the state . His little pamphlet " Theological Existence Today " was the trumpet call which , more than any other single influence , prompted church leaders to offer resistance to the totalitarian claims of the fascist state . The refusal of Karl Barth to sign the oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professors presumably offered no resistance to this final effort to " coordinate " them , is all the more striking in view of the age-old tendency of German theology to enjoin obedience to the state as a religious duty . In the entire current controversy the church has never presumed to criticize any of the policies of the Nazi state on moral or religious grounds . It has insisted only that the " brotherhood of blood " of a racial state must not be made authoritative in the religious community and that the state must not presume to regulate the internal affairs of the church . The church of Germany has thus restricted the sacred realm in which it holds itself supreme to the narrowest possible limits . The limits are so narrow , in fact , that the church has probably sunk to a lower level of authority and moral prestige in Germany than in any other nation of the Western world . Yet it would seem that the very minuteness of the spiritual territory which the church staked out for itself prompted it in the hour of crisis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting to shame groups with larger pretensions . T WO DEVELOPMENTS this past week suggest that the suicidal tendency of the radical movement in this country to divide into minute fragments may have come to an end . The action of the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in permitting a united front with the Communists in local branches , while timid and evasive of the real issue , is at least an advance on the party 's previous attitude . This , together with the party 's reaffirmation of the Declaration of Principles , indicates that the Socialist Party may yet free itself of reactionary leadership and play a significant role in American political life . At the same time we find that a fusion has taken place between the American Workers ' Party and the Communist League ( the Trotzky Opposition ) to form a new group known as the Workers ' Party of the United States . We hope that these two events will lead to the growth of a united labor movement in this country which will eschew the luxury of factional differences . A S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newspaper Guild has won its first important victory . The National Labor Board has not only taken jurisdiction in the case of Dean S. Jennings , chief rewrite man on 1VIr . Hearst 's San Francisco Call-Bulletin , allegedly forced to resign for guild activities ; it has ordered his reinstatement within ten days . This case will be discussed further next week . Meanwhile newspaper workers on the picket line in Newark , New Jersey , are getting some valuable experience in the motives , the technique , and the point of view of those who are driven to strike for better conditions . And when the forty-two editorial employees of the Ledger get back on the job they will have learned a great deal also about the tactics of employers whose workers have walked out . The strike was called against a publisher , Lucius Russell , who has a flagrant record of arbitrary hiring and firing , particularly since the rise of the guild . He has refused to deal with the guild as an independent organization . Since the strike began , Mr. Russell , like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making demands it has not advanced ; he has made much of protecting his " loyal " workers ( they have rapidly diminished since the walkout started ) ; but being a publisher , M r . Russell 's greatest concern has been for his freedom of speech . Despite repeated disavowals he maintains that the guild , through the grievance committee it has proposed , is trying to get editorial control . Needless to say , in his brave fight to maintain the integrity of his editorial policy he has not hesitated to misrepresent the guild and its activities in advertisements " edited " to fit his own point of view . Throughout the strike , the guild , by means of that ingenuity for which newspaper people are famous , has contrived to keep the town strike-conscious and also entertained . When the Ledger suspended publication , the unit issued free a lively newssheet of its own bearing the caption , " Ledger Fails You ? Its Staff Does n't . " It has enlisted the sympathy of many news dealers who have boycotted the Ledger  --  at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 5,000 . I N the correspondence columns of this issue , The Nation prints a communication from the International Labor Defense in answer to its editorial on the Scottsboro case in the issue of November 28 . This letter makes several vague but unpleasant insinuations  --  such as that The Nation condones the attempt of the Alabama courts to railroad the Scottsboro defendants to the electric chair ; it offers an exposition of Communist theory  --  which it has every right to do  --  with which The Nation does not agree and for which disagreement it has no apologies to offer ; and it charges two errors of fact , one of them serious . ( It really does not seem to matter much whether the I. L. D. tried to get rid of Mr. Leibowitz before he tried to get rid of the I. L. D. , or vice versa . ) The serious error is the sentence in The Nation 's editorial which declared that " several hundred thousand dollars " had been raised in the Scottsboro defense . The Nation depended for this statement on a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no direct connection with the case . The I. L. D. makes a contradictory declaration about the funds raised for the defense which appears in its letter referred to above ; to last April , according to the letter , total collections amounted to $55,194 ; to date , the letter sets them " under $75,000 . " On October 11 the New York Herald Tribune on page 20 carried a news story in which " a representative of the I. L. D. , " discussing the sums raised for the Scottsboro defendants , said : " The complete defense , including mass pressure , has certainly not cost more than $125,000 " The Nation withdraws its remark that " several hundred thousand dollars " has been raised in the case . It does not know how much has been raised . T OO LATE for the- letter columns , The Nation has also received from Charles C. Burlingham a comment on its proposal for an impartial committee . Mr. Burling-ham 's letter follows : In your recent article on the Scottsboro case you suggest that a committee of lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impartial deposition from Norris and Patterson , designating their counsel . " This suggestion does not seem to me very practical , especially while an application for certiorari is pending . No argument is permitted on such applications ; the court passes on the papers filed , the practice being fur each Justice individually to examine the petitions and briefs before the court grants or retuses the writ . The character , ability , and experience of Messrs . Pollak and Fraenkel give assurance that the moving papers are as complete and persuasive as possible . If Mr. Leibowitz or any other lawyer wishes to intervene , or claims the right to represent the defendants exclusively , he should apply to the Chief Justice , who will probably decide the question himself or refer it to the Clerk , a Master , or some other referee . It is certainly not to the interest of the defendants that there should be an unseemly contest between committees or lawyers as to who is entitled to represent them . . Mr. Burlingham 's suggestion that the solution of the whole matter be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . It would mean , during the intervening months or weeks , while the Chief Justice or his referee was acting , that the defendants would be subjected to the pressure and uncertainty which they have endured so far , resulting in new and conflicting affidavits on an average of about once a week . The Nation has never questioned the competence of Mr. Pollak and Mr. Fraenkel to argue the appeal ; but the question which lawyer legitimately represents the defendants remains in dispute , and we feel that it should be settled out of court if possible . In spite of Mr. Burlingham 's letter , therefore , to which we have given the most respectful consideration , we reiterate our suggestion of a committee to settle the matter once for all , if this can be done . We are willing to consider any suggestions the L L. D. may make for candidates to this committee ; or to refer the discussion to any body which both the I. L. D. and Mr. Leibowitz can agree upon as impartial . The Nation takes no sides in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them entitled to the unchallenged services of the best possible counsel . A FEW WEEKS AGO we made some irresponsible remarks about the theory that space is finite rather than infinite in extent . We have always resented the idea of being cabined and confined , and there seemed to us something slightly stuffy about a universe shut up within the bounds of a fourth-dimensional sphere . We have , however , just been reminded by the second and successful attempt to cast the 200-inch mirror for the projected telescope on Mount Palomar in California that space , though perhaps finite , is nevertheless large enough to be well ventilated . The new reflector , twice the diameter of that in the largest existing telescope , is expected to penetrate three times as far and to pick up nebulae 900,000,000 light-years away . Inasmuch as light travels some 500,000,000 miles in an hour , we have n't the space to set this distance down in miles , but it makes the universe at least something more than that nutshell which Hamlet regarded as the equivalent of infinite space .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
