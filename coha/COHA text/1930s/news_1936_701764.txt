txt Encouraged in his fiscal plans by a rush of investors to subscribe to the government 's offering of $1,809,000 , - 000 in cash and refunding securities placed on the market this morning , President Roosevelt doubled efforts in preparation of the revenue message which he hoped to lay before Congress tomorrow with a request for $786,000,000 in new and " substitute " taxes . Although today 's financing operation was the largest since the World War , the response was so great that Secretary Morgenthan ordered the subscription books closed tonight on the cash securities . The cash offering , amounting to $1,250,000,000 , was heavily oversubscribed , he said . Furthermore , the demand for bonds wtts much greater than the demand for notes , reversing the trend of the past when investors preferred to keep their funds in short term rather than long term securities . Officials and observers agreed that this was a manifestation of confidence held by the financial community that the administration intended stabilizing its fiscal affairs , and to do it by orthodox methods . The request for new taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not the most dramatic , evidence given of this intention . They discounted completely the theory that investors were putting their money into longterm tax-exempt securities in anticipation of new tax legislation . Capitol Ready for Message . Preparations were being made at the Capitol this afternoon for receipt of the revenue message tomorrow . It is expected to set the actual revenue need at $1,137,000,000 in order to restore the budget to the position it was in before the Supreme Court invalidated the Agricultural Adjustment Act and Congress foteed prepayment of the veterans ' bonus over the President 's veto . Nevertheless , the President will not demand more than $786,000,000 in new and " substitute " levies for any one year , allowing Congress to spread some of the proposed taxes over a period of three years . President Roosevelt spent practically the entire day working on his tax message . He saw a limited number of callers during the morning , but shut himself in the office during the afternoon , allowing no interruptions except reports on the rush business being done at the Treasury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to send the message to the Capitol early tomorrow . Doughton . Plans Tentative Bill . Congressional leaders were no more informed today as to what they would do to raise the necessary revenue than they were on Thursday night when the President startled them with a demand that taxes be levied to rebalance the " regular " budget . Chairman Doughton of the Ways and Means Committee said he hoped to introduce a tentative bill soon after the message is delivered in order to give his committee a framework on which to construct a suitable measure . The tentative bill , it was thought , would include a series of agricultural processing taxes , rewritten largely from the invalidated AAA ; the President 's proposed " windfall " tax , to recapture some of the impounded processing taxes that were returned to processors by court orders ; increased excess profits taxes1 and increased income taxes , both personal and corporate . This would permit the committee to confine witnesses to these phases of tax legislation and prevent an endless series of hearings on the entire taxi situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of repairing the budget without the necessity of heavy increases in taxation continued at the Capitol , but an organized movement toward this goal , like the drives for various tax plans and for currency inflation , was being held in check until the President 's message is delivered . Congressional leaders and members generally had concluded one thing , however , and that was that they were to be put definitely to thel task of restoring the budget to the condition in which it was originally sent to Congress , wherein the deficit for the next fiscal year would be confined entirely to the expend-1 itures for relief and work relief . They knew that the President would insist that the returning confidence in the integrity of the fiscal program , as partially expressed in the response to the security offerings of today , be vindicated to the last degree . Exchange Offering Remains Open . The cash offering of $1,250,000,000 in government bonds and notes dated March 16 was heavily oversubscribed a few hours after being offered this morning . The amount of the oversubscription was not an flounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2% per cent notes due April 15 will remain open indefinitely . Expressing great satisfaction with the results of the offerings , Mr. Morgenthau pointed out that there had been a new and noteworthy trend ; investors showing a preference for the long term bonds rather than the shorter term notes . The Treasury offered $650,000,000 in 2% per cent bonds , callable in twelve and maturing in fifteen years . The note issue was for $600 , - 000,000 at 11/2 per cent maturing in March , 1941 . This made up the cash offering to obtain about $800,000,000 in new money and to retire $450 , - 000,000 in maturing bills . Exceptionally sound government credit conditions and removal of doubt as to administration fiscal policies were among the reasons to which Mr. Morgenthau attributed the oversubscription . He called particular attention to the fact that the bonds issued last December , which had the same interest rate as the current series but with a twelveyear maturity , did not prove as popular as the twelve-fifteen-year bonds of March 16 . " Which means , " Mr. Morgenthau said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved to that extent in three months . " Preliminary figures showed that the demand for bonds was far greater than for notes . The trend was a reversal of that existing as to government financing for some time . " The cash oversubscription for the bonds exceeded that for the notes . On the conversion issue , the exchanges offered for bonds were far in excess of those for which notes were sought . " Budget Director Hails Result . Acting Budget Director Bell was present when Secretary Morgenthau made his announcement . Mr. Bell commented that he " felt easy tonight . " Mr. Morgenthau said that he had been highly confident that the new issues would go over well , but nevertheless he indicated gratification over the success of the gigantic issue which has among its purposes the paving of the way for financing the soldiers ' bonus . As to the trend toward bonds , one official said that investors probably were actuated in part by the better interest rate . The heavy oversubscription would reflect surplus funds available in the country , as indicated by more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a renewed willingness on the part of investors to place their funds in long-term securities was contrasted to the demend for extreme liquidity which was characteristic of conditions in the last few years . Mr. Morgenthau asserted that the administration had cleared the financial picture . " The relief measure is really the only unknown quantity in the equation now , " he said . " When the tax measure is out , then relief will be the only one of the major financial problems unannounced that would affect the government 's fiscal position . " THE TREASURY STATEMENT . The following formal statement was issued : " Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau announced last night that the subscription books for the current offering of 2% per cent Treasury bonds of 1948-51 and of 11/2 per cent Treasury notes of Series A-1941 closed at the close of business Monday , March 2 , 1936 , for the receipt of cash subscriptions .
