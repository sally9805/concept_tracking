txt The Riverside Plan . The Washington Heights Association for the Protection of Riverside is greatly interested in the plan of Commissioner Moses , as set forth in news releases from his department . The plan entered into by the city and the New York Central Railroad was adopted with the approval of the associations organized for the protection of Riverside Park and other waterfront property from Seventy-second Street to the Ship Canal . There has been no change , so far as we have been informed , in the contract entered into by the city and the railroad company . Now comes the statement of Mr. Moses that he intends to change the plan , and he would leave the tracks uncovered and take from the park additional space for the West Side Highway . Has Mr. Moses authority to change the plan without hearings before the Board of Estimate at which civic bodies can express their views ? MARIE COLLINS ROONEY .
