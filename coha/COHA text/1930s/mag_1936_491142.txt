IT SOUNDED mighty good to us . We sat down with paper and pencil and figured it all out . We made rows of figures and added them up and subtracted and divided . We tried to find a catch in it ; but any way we looked at it , we were sitting pretty . We said , " We ca n't lose . " My husband sat back and tapped his teeth with the end of his pencil . He took the pencil away from his teeth and whistled softly , as men do when they see a pretty girl pass , or another man walks up to them and offers them thirty-five or forty thousand a year , which is twenty-five or thirty thousand more than they have ever made before . Bob had been making ten thousand a year . Then a man from Colossal Pictures took him up into a high building and showed him the world and the gold thereof . I knew that Bob was intelligent and resourceful and clever and full of energy , but I did n't know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you had an office at Broad and Wall and pulled off mergers and refinanced companies and knew when to buy long and when to sell short . " There just is n't that much money , " I said . Bob could n't believe it either . He went around pinching himself for days . Then he signed on the dotted line and we began to take it seriously . That was four years ago . Fool 's Gold In the Beverly Hills I REMEMBER Bob said , " We can save half of it . We 'll sock it away each month , and then , when they find out they are really paying me that much and fire me " ? we laughed when he said that ? " we 'll have enough so we can buy a cottage and a couple of hundred acres up in Connecticut or somewhere , and live the life of Riley . " There was even a clause in the contract which said that Colossal would pay for a compartment and my transportation , so that I could go East with Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York shows . " Imagine , " I said . " They call that a business trip . " So we stored the furniture and hoarded the Century . Three days and four nights later we were looking up at the Beverly Hills . The sunlight slanted up from the Pacific and made them shine . Bob said , " Thar 's gold in them hills , pardner , and I 'm goin ' to cut myself a slice of it . " I 'm wiser now . I know those hills are full of baloney dollars . I know that no matter how thin you slice them , they are still baloney . So I 'm sitting down to take stock . I 'm doing a lot of thinking . I 'm trying to find out what happened to the money Bob has made and where it has gone , and why so little of it has gone into that sock we talked about so glibly four years ago . I do n't think we are a special case . In fact , our case is pretty typical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a vice president in charge ci production , divide us by two and you have a writer on a six weeks ' contract . But the problems we face are pretty much the same . Aad we all wake up some day with the same question mark in front of our eyes . Ironically enough , even now , I do n't know of any place where / could live more cheaply if I had to than in Hollywood . But being in pictures is like riding up to a garage in an expensive limousine to have a few repairs made . The man in the overalls takes a look at your car and charges accordingly . As soon as the people with something to sell find out you are in the picture business , the prices go up as if they were filled with helium gas . For that reason , a lot of our friends in the upper salary brackets carry on their business deals , such as renting houses , through dummy agents . The Hollywood housing problem is as good a place to start taking stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain one , and a shifting population calls for furnished houses . Accordingly , the people who have furnished houses I SEEMED that we had left a spot on the living- 1 room rug . I offered to have it cleaned , but I ended up by buying him a new rug . Our Persian cat had scratched the upholstery and we said we would replace it . He sent the divan and two chairs out to be re-covered , and had a much finer and more expensive covering put on than they had worn originally . Be said our gardener had ruined his plantings and his flower beds and had been careless with the lawn . We got a bill for resodding and replanting . The glasses had to be replaced because , when he ran his finger around the rims , he found minute little nicks and ragged places . It was a very lovely place when he was through with us . I would like to have lived in it . But he had two new greenhorns moving in , who were " trustworthy " and who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and he will parlay his house into a palace . He gets away with it  --  he and his brother bandits  --  because picture people do n't care to fight such holdups . It is bad publicity in a business where bad publicity is fatal . A messy lawsuit does you plenty of no good in a town where a good front and keeping up face is everything . We are smarter about houses now . We insist upon careful and detailed inventories when we move in , although they will go to any extreme to avoid pinning themselves down . We make the landlord run his finger tips round the rims of the glasses before the first Martini is stirred . We make him hire the gardener , so that we wo n't be responsible for the welfare of the lawn , even if it costs a little more in the rental . One of the items we gloated over when we were putting those optimistic rows of figures down on paper was the matter of coal . We were right on that . But we found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our coal bill had been back East . It is absolutely necessary to sprinkle your lawn every day , and the water is metered out like gas or electricity . Water rent for an average house in Hollywood runs to twenty dollars a month . The Young Idea in Hollywood I YOU have a swimming pool in your back yard , it 1 costs you an additional fifty dollars a month to change the water in it . The much publicized ozone is free , but the water is something else again . It is piped at great expense across plain and mountain . Another thing which loomed up as a great potential saving when viewed with our New York telescope was the fact that our children could go to a public school in Los Angeles . We were told that they could count on rubbing shoulders with other children of their approximate upbringing arid background . But no one had told us that Ella and Bob , Jr. , would have to live in a high-rental district in order for them to get their shoulders within proper rubbing distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got when Bob , Jr. , came home from school one day and said , " Johnny Marcum won twenty-five bucks at Santa Anita yesterday . " Johnny , the son of one of my neighbors , is eight years old . Only last week I asked Bob , Jr. , how things had been at school that day . He said , " Pretty dull . Three of the kids were working on location and could n't be there . " When the wife of a studio executive speaks of her offspring as " my jewels , " she means just that . It cost me one thousand dollars to have a baby in Beverly Hills . I had my first one for one hundred and fifty dollars back home . Your " jewels " are set in expensive surroundings . If you have attained any degree of prominence in the movie world , you pay and pay through the nose for their protection . Unless you live in Beverly Hills , which boasts of a fine police force , you pay for private watchmen and patrols . Their fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of your home , and ranges from five dollars to twenty-five a month . As a matter of fact , nobody has to look you up through a credit service , or jimmy his way into the studio bookkeeping department to figure out what the traffic will bear in your ease . There is an easier and surer yardstick to use in placing you in your particular salary niche . In Beverly Hills about fifteen streets run across Sunset Boulevard . Most of the bodies who are anybody in this dizzy business live on those streets between the 500 and 900 blocks . If you make less than ten thousand a year , you probably live in the 500 block . If you are a minor executive and make more than ten thousand , you move up a notch to the 600 block . If you live in the 700 or 800 block , you are a producer , or a supervisor at the very least ; and if you plunk yourself down with about fifteen dependents in the 900 block , you are definitely in the stratosphere and paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by this time you have hired a business manager to help you keep some of it . You do n't have to live in this particular slice of the movie marble cake . There is no law compelling you to . As a matter of fact , two miles away you could live just as well , in houses just as attractive , but you would be on the wrong side of the tracks , which is unthinkable . It 's screwy and child-ish , but mighty important . Once you have a house , the problem is to stock it with servants . And they come high and choosy . Movie business hours are different from ordinary business hours . Bob gets home from work about seven or seven-thirty , and we sit down to dinner around eight-thirty or nine . It makes a pretty long day for the help , and they remind you of it when you are trying to agree upon wages . People in Bob 's position have to entertain a lot . The personnel changes a lot , and every time a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives have to do something about it in the way of wining and dining him . Also , the standards of service are exacting . A cook or chef must be able to produce something more than meat loaf , boiled potatoes and pie . He must be able to run up a tasty sottifi6 or curry sauce without having a nervous breakdown or running a high blood pressure . A maid may be called upon to set a finger wave or iron an accordion-pleated frock . She must be well turned out , trim and tactful . Servants add all these things up , divide them into your salary and come out with the wrong answer for your budget . Shopping by Ear W HEN I said I could live cheaply in Hollywood , I meant it . Food can be bought for the proverbial song , but somehow I never learned the words and music . Your friends all buy their foods at certain markets and shops , and you naturally fall into the habit of using the same shops , although the butcher and the baker charge you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of shopping in person is out . There is none of this thumping melons with your forefinger and peering into the ears of corn , or seeing if the shop next door has a special on canned goods . Your shopping is done over the telephone , and usually you leave it to your cook . The result is often petty graft in the kitchen . A little bonus to the cook from the market for throwing the trade their way is quite the usual thing . The bonus is added to your bill . Not only the butcher and baker but other tradespeople work this racket if they can get away with it . But in spite of the chance for extras , lots of servants wo n't take jobs with picture people at any price , because of the late hours expected of them . One hundred and fifty dollars a month for a couple , and twenty-five dollars a month for a part-time gardener , who has plenty of other families on his list to take care of . is the least you can expect . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple is common , and all this in spite of the fact that you are home very seldom . We are only home alone one night out of every two weeks , and I have to fight to keep that one night free . The men work under high pressure ; they deal and talk in big figures all ( Continued on Page 881 day long . Their responsibilities are tremendous . At night they are too nervous and wrought up to sit down for a quiet rubber of bridge . There are only two or three places where picture people go after dark , and Bob ca n't take a party of six to any of them and get out for less than fifty dollars for the evening . I know it seems stupid that we go to these places like sheep following a bellwether , instead of going our own way to other and less-expensive places , but it is not all huddle psychology or wanting to be seen by the right people in the right places . An awful lot of business is done at night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town with a brass-band procession down the main street , the band continuing to play in front of the theater until a short time before the performance . The racket raised by a couple of comets , a trombone , a tuba , a clarinet. , a French horn , a snare drum and a bass drum made certain that every soul in the place , whole or half witted , flush or broke , knew there was a show in their midst . That was a minimum number of bandsmen and no such troupe as ours could afford to pay even one extra person . So you can see why the barnstorming trouper had to be a fair performer on something that went boom-boom or tootle-toot or um-pha-umph as well as an actor , and why " must be able to double in brass " was as standard a line in the old theatrical advertisements in the Clipper as " write stating salary " and " a good dresser on and off stage . " Many an actor and manager who was to become a name to conjure with has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sliphorn to advertise a performance of Uncle Tom 's Cabin or The Streets of New York at the Town Hall tonight . But a dusty street in a small Western town , a blistering sun and the exertion of manipulating a tuba or a bass drum made a bad combination . I was a pretty good performer on the snare drum , but I always kept quiet about it , merely indicating that if I had to be in the band , I had a kind of acquaintance with that instrument . And I drummed dutifully , but outrageously out of time and with no more roll than you 'd get out of drumming on a fur cap . Within 3l. hundred yards the leader would be showing distress signals , the populace on the sidewalk , trying to keep time , would be hooting derisively , and , at the end of the parade , my drum would he taken firmly from me and I would be en joined never again to pollute the hand with my ungodly lack of rhythmical sense . That suited me the finest kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool barroom as soon as we got off the train or , what I liked even better , stroll along the shady side of the street with my hat on the side of my head , watching my colleagues perspiring musically out in the middle and having people in the crowd point me out to one another as one of the big men in the company . It was a tremendous feeling . I think I can see what those youngsters ' letters were getting at . Editor 's Note  --  This is the first of a series of or . tides by William A. Brady . The next will appear in on early issue . " All day long I see people who want to see me . At night I can see the people I have to see in order to get anything accomplished . " Speaking of thinking in big figures , when your pay envelope every week contains more money than you ever saw at one time before coming to Hollywood , and you have n't got used to the idea that it is real money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances with it . When we spend our evenings at a private party at a friend 's home , there is often gambling . Many of the larger homes are equipped for roulette , crap , blackjack and bird cage . Bob has a natural knack as an amateur croupier , and I have stood on the side lines plenty of times with my heart going thump-thump while he banked a game for a host who was busy elsewhere ; for the games seem to be geared to the pocketbooks of the higher-ups rather than the lower-downs . A little week end at Caliente was a dangerous thing . There were the races . Then , between tearing up tickets , there was gambling in the clubhouse . Your paper money was changed into silver dollars instead of chips ; and to this transplanted Easterner , at least , these enormous silver cartwheels lost all semblance to money as soon as I bought a stack of them . They weigh your pocketbook down . You think , " Well , there 's no point in lugging all that home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to lead the same kind of life we had always led . There would be no stupid galloping to keep up with the Joneses . We thought that the people we would meet and the friends we would make would get a kick out of simple things like picnics and steak dinners and weenie roasts . We thought they would go for it as a novelty . We were all eager and bright-eyed about it  --  and naive . We tried it , but our picnics and weenie roasts were complete frosts . The men were too tired to relax , too tense and geared up to play simple , and the women were full of the idea that they must be forever busy being decorative and glamorous . Keeping up with the Joneses is bad enough , but keeping up with Joan Crawford 's , and Jean Harlow 's , and Carole Lombard 's figures is a more strenuous job . And it is only human to I want to look as svelte and sleek and eurvaeious as the ladies your husband comes in contact with day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Trocadero at night . The search for Ponce de Leon 's fountain goes in waves and spurts . You go heavily for masseuses at three dollars a pushing around , and diet lists supplied by your doctor or your manicurist or the nurse girl . The masseuse gives you three-quarters of an hour of supervised exercise and a half hour of pounding and squeezing your fat cells . In the first stages of your campaign you have her in two or three times a week . After a while your dresses begin to fit again and you weaken . Then , a month or so later , you are conscious of your husband 's eyes resting on your midsection with a faraway " I knew you when " look in his eyes , and you call up the masseuse again . It is even tougher for the men to keep in shape . They are locked up in the office from ten o'clock to seven-thirty , and are too tired to play tennis or take walks or putter around out-of-doors at the end of the day . They try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is just too bad , as any conditioner of men will tell you . And I mean that word " shape " literally . When Bob found himself getting bulbous and pudgy and wearing a spare tire around his middle , he arranged for a man to come up twice a week at seven in the morning and give him the works . He ran Bob around the tennis court twenty times and then sicked him on the dumbbells and pulleys and bending and dipping and push-up and pull-up routine . It cost Bob five dollars a treatment . The personal overhead of a Hollywood wife runs into important money . Hairdressers and beauty parlors are more expensive than they are back home . A wave , shampoo and manicure take a large bite out of a five-dollar bill , leaving only a very , very small core . You can wrap the same goods up and take them home for a dollar and a half back in Manhasset or around the corner on 52nd Street . You ca n't see it or touch it , but there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hollywood wives . Something besides marcels and permanents . It consists of a lot of superfine time , and nothing much to do with it . My friends have various ways and means all worked out for filling it. , all of which cost money . And what , you may ask , does the owner do to redeem it ? All about me I can see women taking music lessons and riding lessons and tennis lessons , with a grim air of determination , in an effort to fill the vacuum . Every day they drop in , in twos or threes or fours at the Vendome , or Victor Hugo 's , or The Brown Derby . You can kill a couple of hours that way and you can also seriously cripple a five-dollar bill . The stars come out at night in Hollywood . And they get dressed up before they make their appearance . Those of us who only make the wheels go round get dressed up too . And when I say " dressed up , " I mean evening clothes . Good clothes seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are only two or three good tailor shops . Back in New York , Bob used to get fairly presentable sack suits for seventy to eighty dollars , but his Hollywood tailor speaks another language , full of words like " one hundred and twenty " and " one hundred and fifty . " The High Cost of Low Backs I blush to say it , but I have paid as high as two hundred dollars for an evening dress since I have been here , and I would have fainted at tie thought four years ago . Then , too , living in a place where you are constantly on dress parade , you develop a phobia against appearing in the same evening dress more than three or four times . It is a vicious circle . You must have evening dresses to go out at night , and you go out at night so frequently that your dresses are old stories to your friends unless you buy new evening dresses so that you can go out at night . It sounds pretty involved , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the first of every month . There are some wives  --  principally those stratospheric explorers who live in the fabulous 900 block  --  who actually feel that they ca n't afford to be seen in a dress more than once . One way to beat the game is to wear them one night and return them the next day as being defective or unsatisfactory . I know one girl who bought six hats , wore them all at least once , and returned them with varying excuses . If such returned merchandise has to be scrapped and taken out of circulation the loss to the store is probably passed on to the customers in higher prices for the buyer who plays fair . Another way to salvage something out of your passe flounces and furbelows is to pass them on to the ever-present dependents . Dependents are the largest single item of expense . No matter what you earn out here on the Gold Coast , it seems fabulous to relatives back in the home town . Aunts , uncles , brothers , ( Continu  --  d on Page 88 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even parents , instead of putting up a fight to help themselves , sort of relax and go limp . They have the attitude that because they know you 're living well , they have a right to expect more than mere living expenses . They leave perfectly good homes back East to come out and " be with you . " Of course , someone has to do something about the homes they have left . When Bob and his friends close their eyes , they can see little white elephants back East in the shape of houses that ca n't be sold for the first mortgage . It seems a shame to let them be sold for taxes , even if the absent dependent would allow them to be sold . So the lucky son , daughter , niece or nephew in Hollywood kicks through with the taxes and upkeep ; for even if you manage to rent them , there is the little matter of new wallpaper and paint . jobs and plumbing and roofing to take care of from time to time . I have done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have figured it out that the average couple in the movies has from five to ten people financially dependent upon it . When the Gravy Train Stops I know one executive who has been in pictures for eighteen years  --  a darn good record , by the way , for Hollywood . He has saved and invested shrewdly , so that he now has an income from his investments equal to his salary , and his salary is much larger than Bob 's . And it 's a mighty good thing he did . He has fifteen people completely dependent upon him . They tap him for a combined total of thirty thousand a year in upkeep . Sometimes I wish I were a dependent relative . It 's nice work if you can get it . Some of the stars make the best of a bad job and try to get some return on their output . You 'll find dependent relatives acting as business managers , agents , secretaries , glorified majordomos and personal press agents . They talk in the language of royalty and editors . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , how did you like our last picture ? " and " We have decided not to sign up for that radio hour . " If by word or manner you cast any doubt upon the value of their services to the family breadwinner , they are not amused . They develop a competitive technique in an effort to cut themselves into a larger share of the family dole money . They turn on the vox humane with the ease of a Shirley Temple weeping over the backsliding of a screen daddy . They work themselves up into spasms of jealous rage if they suspect that brother Jim has talked himself into a town ear or a new house with a game room in the cellar . Their trump card is a dignified , hurt silence that says louder than words , " I can see you are tired of having me around . Well , I wo n't be a millstone around your neck any longer . I can always get into the old folks ' home or go on relief . I wo n't bother you any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the El Dorado runs dry , when the sirupy voice that has turned masculine backbones into jelly develops a crack and lays an egg at the box office , when the studio decides to get along with one less master mind in the front office . Recently I saw it happen , and I know what happens to them . They go hack to work . A certain feminine star found that her list of dependents was growing more rapidly than her salary . She was working her head off , with no time for vacations . She was making a pile , but enjoying none of it . She had become So nervous under the strain that she had taken to a diet of bread and milk . One day she rebelled , threw up her job and told the folks back home she had been fired , and from now on they would have to take care of themselves . Amazingly enough , they did . Uncle John took some of the money he had saved from the allowance she had sent him , and started raising dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had looked Like small potatoes when he was up in the filet-mignon class . And Aunt Sarah fired the trained nurse , forgot her mysterious pain in the back , and pitched in to help with the housework . It all went to prove my favorite theory : If you did n't have a movie job and your dependents did n't have a gravy train to ride , they would get along somehow . Then , too , the Administration at Washington and the state of California seem to be growing more and more dependent upon us every year . Bob says that next year , when he has to pay a state income tax as well as a Government income tax , six weeks ' salary out of every fifty-two will go to the tax collectors . We also have two secondhand automobiles absolutely dependent upon us to maintain them in the style to which they are accustomed . If Washington is the City of Magnificent Distances , Los Angeles is the city of super-super distances . We think nothing of driving thirty miles for a swim and thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streetcar lines and interurban trains . We had to . They do n't believe in them in Hollywood and Santa Monica . We found it an absolute necessity , therefore , to have two cars . Without an extra car , I would be left stranded when Bob had chugged off to the studio in the morning . The gas and oil bill for our flivver and larger car runs about fifty dollars a month . I do n't see how we could cut down on that . Willing Victims In addition to the gas and oil bill , Bob carries $100,000 and $200,000 public liability policy on each car . Movie people who are unfortunate enough to nudge a pedestrian with a bumper or mudguard often find themselves plastered with lawsuits for tremendous sums . In fact , I think sometimes that Cahuenga Boulevard is lined with people who let themselves sag in front of oncoming autos , hoping that the driver will be good for twenty or fifty grand . I know people back East who hope that if everything else fails them , they will be smacked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can start life anew on the proceeds of their accident . Well , the auto of a movie employee is the Limited of the West Coast . One of our friends , a writer much in demand by the various story departments , rammed his car into another car one night . The other car was driven by a man who was obviously a victim of St. Vitus 's dance . " I 'm very nervous and high-strung , as a result , " he said , " and I really should n't he struck . " On the advice of his lawyer , however , our writer friend settled out of court for twenty thousand dollars , although he was seriously hurt , and the victim of St. Vitus 's dance had only suffered from shock . ( Continued on Page 80 ) ( Continued from Page 88 ) We sent flowers to our friend in the hospital ; and when we went to condole with him , we found that he had laid out his bankbook in a little white Pasteboard box and our flowers were appropriately arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of Hollywood 's amenities . Hollywood has one custom I have not run into anywhere else . If you are willing to pay out six or eight dollars a week , there are people who will undertake to keep your house full of flowers . They will not only deliver them daily but will arrange them tastefully and attractively for you . It sounds tempting . I know I fell for it . There are hothouse plants out here too . Movie agents fall into that category . Like the well-known lily of the field , they toil not , neither do they spin , yet Solomon in all his glory is not arrayed like one of these . Fortunately for Bob , he has never been in a spot which forced him to use an agent . But there are a lot of things waiting around the corner for us along with prosperity , and one of them may be an agent . His fee will be 10 per cent of Bob 's salary if , as and when he comes into our life . And that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his agent when he has hired him , that 's just too bad  --  for Bob . Bob can go out and get another agent and pay the new one 10 per cent of his take , but the 10 per cent will keep on going out ? to the one he has fired , too , as long as the job Mats that the fired one had landed for him . I know men who have as many as three agents , one active and two inactive , except on pay day . Exacting Guests Our parties at home fall into two general classifications . Small parties for six or eight , or big parties for forty or fifty . The larger parties cost from two hundred dollars up . You ca n't expect your regular staff of servants to handle them for you . So you get in a caterer and turn him loose . I get away with from four to six parties of this kind a year , but our obligations are piling up on us , and Bob thinks we should entertain more than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , and that figure is rather under the average of his men friends and business associates . As a matter of fact , it is quite a bit more than seventy-five a month , now that repeal has made it possible to get vintage wines and imported beers .

Julian Street 's book on wines is to Hollywood what the Hagerstown Almanac was to my grandfather . realizing that Wallace is an idealist . No farmer can read the book without wondering how he got that way . Wallace , with his farm background , should be a practical man . He should understand farming . He should know at least a little about human nature . Of course , a practical farmer may at the same time be an idealist , but not quite so violently idealistic as is Henry .

Every week end seems to cost us about fifty dollars , no matter where we go or what we do . At least I know that Bob cashes a check for that much every Saturday noon at the studio cashier 's window , and it 's all gone by Monday . Summer cottages at Malibu or other beaches are very expensive . And even at sky-high rentals , there are not many attractive ones to be had . Most of our friends prefer to join beach clubs . Which means that you buy a fivehundred-dollar bond and pay dues in addition . The dues do not include food and drink . If you feel very swanky and want a family cabana at one of the clubs for the summer , you must go down into your jeans and come up with six hundred dollars . After a summer or two of this nonsense , we thought it would be cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resultant week-end congestion , with the sandwiches , beer and suppers , turned out to be more expensive than the club idea . Occasional trips East for both Bob and myself I regard as necessary expenses . I mean jaunts in addition to Bob 's annual trips hack to see the theater openings , which are paid for by the studio . Bob works on these trips and does n't really get away from California mentally at all . I mean the trips we take either together or alone at other times . It is absolutely necessary for the peace of mind and mental well-being of an Easterner transplanted into the California climate to receive an annual or semiannual assurance in person that somewhere the seasons actually change , that snow flies and rain beats in faces and the air is capable of a cold crispness . There is also the feeling summed up in the oft derided but none the less real desire " to get away from it all .

One of our friends who happened to be in the East when we were there on ow ' last trip came hack to the Coast to report : " Bob and his wife ca n't be in New Here is the most significant sentence in the book ( from page 22 ) : " Enduring social transformation such as our New Deal seeks is impossible of realization without changed human hearts .
