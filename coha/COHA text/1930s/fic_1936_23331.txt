WINNING SEQUENCE A STORY BY MARGERY SHARP u p to the ages of sixty-one and sixty- three the Misses Pye had never told an untruth . Since their father had been a clergyman and their mother a deaconess , this was only right and natural ; but it made their one lapse , which occurred on the first Saturday in September , all the harder to excuse . Even so , they did not actually tell the lie  --  the sin was a tacit one  --  and it is only fair to add that they were neither of them quite themselves at the time . Miss Pye and Miss Roberta lived on the top story of No. 7 , Portaferry Road , Paddington . The thoroughfare was not a prepossessing one , but they had an affection for it because it lay in the heart of their father 's old parish ; and it was also very cheap . No. 7 was not prepossessing either , until one reached the top floor ; and then one entered a domain as exquisitely neat , as meticulously ordered , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in London , and it was dusted three times a day . What with dusting , cooking , visiting the sick and doing embroidery for bazaars , the Misses Pye led full and happy lives : and they had in addition two never failing sources of pleasurable pride . These were a nephew in the Air Force , and a miniature of their great-greatgrandmother ; nor was it easy to say which gave them more satisfaction . The nephew Henry , starting as an aircraft apprentice at Halton , was now at Cranwell and well on the way to earning His Mayesty 's commission ; the heirloom miniature , besides being an authentic proof of their breeding , was also a work of art . It was reputed to be by Cosway , and a Mr. Faraday , a friend of the Vicar 's , had once actually offered fifty pounds for it . The two ladies naturally refused , and always talked of the offer as a gross breach of taste ; but in secret they were extremely pleased by it . It was not everyone in Portaferry Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds lying idle on the mantelpiece . " We 're a couple of sentimental old fools ! " said Miss Pye every Saturday ; for it was on Saturdays that the miniature was taken from its case and set upright against a little easel to grace the weekend . Saturday was also the day on which their nephew sometimes came to tea , so Miss Roberta always bought a cake as well as buns : and if he did n't arrive they ate the cake on Sunday  --  when it was a little stale , and went further  --  and thus had a treat for the week-end all the same . Neither Miss Pye nor Miss Roberta had ever heard of the Technique of Living , but they knew a good deal about it nevertheless . On the first Saturday in September , however , the cake was bought in full confidence , for Henry was definitely expected : and it was therefore all the more upsetting when the one o'clock post brought a letter with an Air Force badge . " It 's to say he ca n't come ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully  --  one of the parish Wolf Cubs collected crests  --  and drew out a short note . It consisted of no more than half a page , but she was so long reading it that her sister grew impatient . " What does he say , dear ? Why is n't he coming ? " " He is coming , " answered Miss Pye slowly . " He 's coming to supper . " " To supper ! And we 've only sardines ! What time will he be here ? " " You 'd better see it yourself , " said Miss Pye , still in that odd , slow voice . Miss Roberta glanced once at her sister 's face , then took the letter and read . Henry was very sorry to trouble them , but could they lend him fifty pounds ? And could they let him have it that night , as otherwise , he was afraid , it would mean leaving Cranwell . " Fifty pounds ! " cried Miss Roberta , aghast . " Whatever can he want it for ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " He  --  he must be ashamed to . " There was a short , horrified silence . " Whatever it is , " said Miss Roberta firmly , " ' we 've got to get it for him . " " Of course , " said Miss Pye . Their eyes flew to the mantelpiece . From her little easel the lady of the miniature smiled heartlessly back . Never before had she looked so charming , so debonair . No one could wonder that Mr. Faraday , man of wealth as he was , should be prepared to give so vast a sum for her . " You 've still got the address , dear ? " said Miss Roberta at last . " The Gables , Southholt Green . But he talked about moving , because they 'd built a race-course there . He may n't even be in England . " " We must go and see , " said Miss Roberta sternly . " And if he has moved , we must go to  --  to a pawn-broker 's . After all , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made their preparations . To keep their strength up , they boiled and ate two eggs . Then they put on their best coats , and the hats bought only two years ago , and Miss Robertawore her beaver neck-tie . They were not going to embarrass Mr. Faraday by any poverty-stricken looks . They would just explain that they were  --  well , tired of their miniature , and had decided to give him the first refusal . Miss Pye actually rehearsed the sentences as she put the ivory into its case and wrapped the case in a clean handkerchief . The whole packet took up no more room in her bag than the box of lozenges she carried for her cough . " Suppose , " said Miss Roberta suddenly , " he comes before we get back ? " " He has his key , dear . " " But he must be very worried . Might n't we leave a message , just to say that it 's all right ? " Miss Pye frowned . " Whatever he 's done , Roberta , we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be made to feel . Leave a message if you like , but only saying that we shall be back . And make it stern . " So Miss Roberta , after a moment 's thought , got out the newly-bought cake and a sheet of paper , and on the paper wrote simply : If we 're late , dear , cut yourself a slice . " It seemed to both of them that that was quite stern enough . Southholt Green is a pleasant outer suburb most easily reached by train from Marylebone Station ; and on that fine Saturday afternoon the two ladies were quite struck to observe how many other people were going there as well . There was even a special booking-window , where they had to stand in a queue , and where half-a-dozen gentlemen took tickets before Miss Pye moved up to the grille . " I want two third-class returns to Southholt Green ? " " Race train , " snapped the clerk . " Certainly not , " corrected Miss Pye . " I want two third-class ? " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns for one-and-three . " The sisters looked at each other . It meant a saving of ninepence on each ticket . " But we are not , " explained Miss Pye , " going to the races . If it does n't matter ? " " If you do n't make up your minds , " observed a gentleman behind , " we 'll none of us be going . " In some confusion Miss Pye put down her half-crown and hurried Miss Roberta off . They had no difficulty in finding the train , but spent so long looking for a Ladies Only compartment that the guard was at last forced to thrust them into a smoker . It already contained six gentlemen  --  four with cigars  --  and one young lady who , like her cigarless companions , smoked cigarette after cigarette ; and in this wholly foreign atmosphere  --  their two persons squeezed into the space designed for one  --  their lungs filled with unaccustomed and offensive odors  --  the Misses Pye passed the next half-hour . They shut their eyes , and endured . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green they felt and looked so remarkably shaky that the last touting taxi-man at once marked them down . " Come on , ladies ! " he cried encouragingly . " A bob all the way , and save you twenty minutes ! " Miss Pye looked at the vehicle with longing . " Shall we , Roberta ? " " A shilling seems very reasonable , " said Miss Roberta . " Only how does he know how far we want to go ? " " If he says a shilling , he must take a shilling ; that 's the law , " said Miss Pye ; and with her sister following , stepped recklessly into the cab . It was at this point in their journey that they definitely took the wrong turning . Now the taxi , as has been said , was the last on the station rank , and just as Miss Pye was about to give the address a portly gentleman sprang up as from the ground and placed his foot upon the step . At the same moment the door on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thrust himself unceremoniously in . " Now , ladies , " cried the first urgently , " you 've got the last cab , we 're in a hurry , what d' you say to letting us share , and getting a free ride ? " The ladies said nothing . They were too startled . It seemed as though every one they met was bent on giving them loud peremptory advice : and as they had yielded in turn to the booking-clerk , to the guard , and to the taxi-man , so they now yielded to the gentlemen in a hurry . For before they could collect their wits their new mentors were established on the folding-seats , the driver had grinned and mounted , and the cab was in motion . " It 's like Alice in Wonderland , " murmured Miss Roberta . " All the animals ordering one about . " The gentleman opposite nudged his companion . " Alice ! " he repeated . " There 's an Alice in the three-thirty . How 's that for a tip ? " And he winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she at once closed her eyes . So did Miss Pye . But they had to open them almost immediately , for a moment later the journey  --  a remarkably short one , even for a shilling ? had come to an end . It had come to an end , in fact , outside the Southholt Race Course . " Oh , dear ! " cried Miss Roberta despairingly . " Did n't you give the address either ? " wailed Miss Pye . For the moment , indeed , their courage was quite out . Their heads and backs ached , and though they were actually in Southholt Green , Mr. Faraday seemed as remote as ever . And in fact he was remote , for they had heard him mention with thankfulness that his house was at least nowhere in the vicinity of the abhorrent race-course . It was far away over the Green , miles and miles away , where no taxi on earth would ever take them for a shilling . " Oh , dear ! " said Miss Roberta again . The gentleman paying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked round . Of Mr. Faraday he naturally knew nothing : all that presented itself to his eye was a couple of distressed-looking old girls staring dejectedly at a notice-board . Neither Miss Pye nor Miss Roberta had even seen the thing , for their gaze was quite blank ; but it so happened that the legend thereon might very well have accounted , to the casual observer , for their melancholy appearance . " Ladies , accompanied by Gentlemen , " said the board , " Half Price . " With an impulse of pure benevolence , the gentleman returned . " Here , " he said kindly , " you come in with us , and save half the price . How 'll that do ? " Miss Pye drew herself up . But even as she did so , while the lightning flashed from her eye  --  an extraordinary thing happened . " Thank you very much , " said Miss Roberta . " I 'm sure we 're greatly obliged to you . " " Roberta , how could you ? " demanded Miss Pye . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towered the backs of the stands , about them streamed hundreds of purposeful race-goers . Had they found themselves upon Mars , the Misses Pye could scarcely have been more at a loss . " It was Providence , " said Miss Roberta boldly . " Have n't we been led  --  all the way from St. Marylebone ? " " We have been hustled , " corrected Miss Pye . " And if you think Providence approves of pony-racing ? " " How do you know they 're ponies ? " asked Miss Roberta eagerly . " I saw it on one of the notices . But ponies or horses , it 's all the same thing " " Oh , no , " said Miss Roberta , " I 'd much rather have them ponies . They 're smaller , you know . And I do think , as we 're here , we might just go and look at them . " Although two years younger , Miss Roberta had always taken the lead . She took it now , and with a hand hooked under her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of open pad-dock bounded by white railings ; and here even Miss Pyc breathed freely , for the aspect of the place was positively domestic . Family groups picnicked upon the grass , children ran shouting in the sun , elderly couples walked soberly up and down . An occasional beer-bottle caught Miss Roberta 's eye , but thermos-flasks predominated . It was like the beach at Broadstairs , with the stands for boarding . houses and the row of bookies for the donkey-boys on the parade . Miss Roberta observed these last with interest , and found them a most respectable-looking set of men : if their voices were rather hoarse , that was doubtless due to their open-air life . " I wonder where the Tote is ? " she mused aloud . " It 's another way of betting money , you know , something like a slot-machine . " " You have too much to do with those Wolf Cubs , " returned Miss Pye rather tartly . She walked quickly towards the course , intending to avoid the crowd ; but since the three o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a few moments the two ladies were hemmed in against the railings and staring , like their neighbors , up the green stretch ; only unlike their neighbors they did not know what to expect . The sudden onrush of the ponies , the flash of the jockeys ' coats , took them both unawares ; the closeness and the speed made Miss Pye at least feel as though she had been narrowly missed by a thunderbolt . As for Miss Roberta , as her first words showed , she had been absolutely struck . " If we backed one and won fifty pounds , " said Miss Roberta clearly , " we should n't have to sell the miniature . " Her sister jumped . " Backed one , Roberta ? " " Put money on one . And then when it won , we should get a lot more . " Instead of at once changing the subject , Miss Pye rashly asked a question . " But how , " she enquired shrewdly , " can you tell which is going to win ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's all luck , like that raffle we bad at the Bazaar . I 'm almost certain I could do it . " Miss Pye opened her mouth to deliver a peremptory rebuke ; but either because the vicissitudes of the journey had really affected her brain , or possibly because the genius of the place seized and twisted her words , the rebuke was never uttered . All she said was , " Do n't put on more than half-a-crown , dear ! " The half-crown already extracted from her bag , Miss Roberta , followed by Miss Pye , edged back into the crowd before the stands . Her spirit was still high , but though she had talked so lightly of picking winners , she had very little notion bow to set about it . Her only preference in horse-flesh was for the cream or dapple , and though there was a huge sign-board giving the ponies ' names , it made no mention of their color . She also knew , from a poem , that Arab steeds were fleet ; but there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she turned and asked her sister 's advice . " What sort of horses do you like , dear ? " " Percherons , " answered Miss Pye promptly . " I always remember , that summer we stayed on the farm , what gentle faces they had . " Miss Roberta sighed . She was practically sure that Percherons did not race , and in any case , they were too big to be ponies . It was at this juncture that a voice from behind them , so apposite that it might have been the voice of Conscience itself , suddenly spoke . " Want a winner , lady ? " asked the voice affably . They turned round and observed a dapper little gentleman in a check suit . Whether by accident or design he was leaning against a sort of small sign-post , and on the sign-post it said " Sandy , the Lucky Scot . " " Yes , " said Miss Roberta quickly . " We want a winner very much . " At once , as though it were the most natural thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thrust itinto her hand . Before Miss Roberta could open it , however , he followed up the gesture with a demand for sixpence . " But why sixpence ? " asked Miss Roberta . The Lucky Scot looked at her with admiration . " Because yer goin ' to win two quid fer two bob , lady , and I ai n't a bloomin ' philanthropist . You get two quid , I get a tanner : and if that ai n't fair , I du n no what is . " " It does seem very reasonable , " murmured Miss Pye . " I wonder he does n't ask more . " " Hush ! " said Miss Roberta , hastily passing over the coin and leading her sister away . " He knows his own business best . I wonder what the horse 's name is ? " To their slight embarrassment , it was Bachelor 's Shirt ; but after a good deal of advice and piloting from interested spectators ? " They really seem very helpful here " said Miss Pye  --  the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they followed the stream , and climbed up a stand , and stood in happy confidence waiting to see their horse win . Of the eleven runners , Bachelor 's Shirt was tenth . Now the late Reverend Charles Pye , though as mild an old gentleman as ever held a living , had nevertheless been able to produce , as occasion required , a fine denunciatory style ; and his blood now boiled in his daughters ' veins . Without a word , in perfect unison , Miss Pye and Miss Roberta nipped down from the stand and darted and dived through the crowd after the bobbing thistle-painted sign . " You , man ! " cried Miss Pye breathlessly . The Lucky Scot turned and saw them . With unparalleled effrontery , he even grinned . " It did n't win " accused Miss Roberta . " It was last but one ! " cried Miss Pye . The creature shrugged . " All in the luck of the game , ladies . I 'd have bet my bottom ? " " Do n't prevaricate , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner , and it did n't win . It 's downright dishonesty ! " As well he might , the Lucky Scot gazed at them in stupefaction . For if they had their code of ethics , so had he : and his profession of tipster was justified  --  even hallowed  --  by every unwritten law of the race-course . His surprise and indignation , both boundless , found their only natural outlet . " May I be damned , " he began methodically , " may I be double-damned and double ? " " And do n't use oaths , " said Miss Pye severely . " You 'll either pay what we should have won , or  --  or I 'll fetch the police ! " The Scot glanced round . A small but appreciative crowd had already gathered , and there was no doubt whose side it was on . With ready chivalry it had plumped unanimously for the two ? Id girls . " Go it , ma ! " cried the crowd heartily : and though the phrase offended her ears , Miss Pye was nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye and positively defied him . " Well , what did win ? " he asked , weakening . This was an awkward moment , for in their righteous haste neither lady had stopped to sec . But the mob rushed to their aid . " Rose Marie ! " prompted the mob joyfully . " Twenty to one ! " " Or if you want the Tote dividend , " added a gentleman more joyfully still , " it 's fifty-eight-and-six . " " Then it 's a bloomin ' swindle ! " shouted the enraged Scot . " It 's a put-up job ! " " It is indeed ! " cried Miss Roberta warmly . " We shall go to the police at once ! " " And if you ca n't control yourself , " added Miss Pye , " we shall charge you with obscene language as well . " The tipster paused . He had a pretty good idea that on the first count at least no bobby would charge him ; but there were several reasons why any contact with the police was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just at that moment he had no desire to thrust himself , as it were , on their notice . With a sudden change of demeanor , he approached Miss Roberta 's ear . " See here , lady , " he murmured , " s'pose I give you another tip instead  --  real dead cert  --  horse I 'm going to put me own shirt on . How 'll that do ? " The ladies whispered together . " Yes , " said Miss Roberta finally . " We 're going to give you one more chance . " With a stub of pencil , on the back of an envelope , the tipster hastily scrawled a name ; and beseeching them not to disclose it to anyone else , urged his two tormentors in the direction of the Tote . Then he took out a handkerchief , and thankfully applied it to his brow . Contrary to his usual practice , the Lucky Scot left his signpost and mounted a stand to watch the next race ; for he felt an unusually strong interest in the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little way below him , so that if by unlucky chance they lost again he was fairly certain of being able to escape them . Had he known , as he did not , that they had backed the pony Chipmunk to the extent of a whole five shillings , he would probably have taken no risks , but left the course at once . Chipmunk won . " Thank ' Eaven for that ! " ejaculated the Scot piously ; and once more mopping his brow slipped back to the old pitch . He had not been there more than a few minutes , however , when his brief complacency was violently dispelled . " You , man ! " shrilled Miss Roberta . " My Gawd ! " cried the Scot in horror . " What 's up now ? " " We ca n't get our money ! " cried the ladies in chorus , " We went up to the window , and they would n't pay us ! What shall we do now ? " Sandy the Scot groaned aloud . Though lacking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time have given a pretty accurate description of the Furies . They were a cross between old ladies and blood-hounds , and there was no escaping them . " Here , let 's see yer ticket , " he said wearily . Miss Pye displayed it . " Yer on the Tote double , lady . Yer got ter pick another ' orse fer the next race , on the same ticket , see , ' n if that one wins too yer get a whole packet . " After he had explained it two or three times the sisters withdrew and held a short conference . Then Miss Pye returned with hand outstretched . " Here 's your sixpence , and we 'll have another winner , please . " " Not from me you wo n't , " said the Scot firmly . " What shall we do now ? " whispered Miss Roberta . They were already in the Tote queue , passing steadily along ; and owing to their passage with the Lucky Scot they had not had time even to see what ponies were running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselled Miss Pye . " He 's wearing opera-glasses . " They pressed up to the broad hack and listened carefully . " Seventeen , " said the man in front . " We 'll have that too , " said Miss Roberta . " Two , " echoed the girl in the window ; and that was how the Misses Pye picked the winner of the four-thirty . They won fifty-three pounds ; and their demeanor , as they collected the money , was so noticeably that of sleep-walkers that a benevolent policeman escorted them to the gates and put them in a taxi and told the driver to see them on the train . Miss Roberta 's only conscious act was to give the taxi-man a pound . Heput them into a first-class carriage , and since no one else got in they were able to take out the miniature and hold it alternately . At Marylebone Station Miss Pye put the other odd pounds into a box for railway charities , and as they then found they had no money of their own left , they were forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More exhausted than they had ever been in their lives , the two old ladies at last turned the corner and reached No. 7 . In the top window a light showed . " He 's herel " said Miss Roberta , suddenly alert . " Then we can have supper at once , " said her sister thankfully . " We shall have to speak to him first . Do pull yourself together , dear . " With straight backs and stern faces they toiled up the three flights of stairs . At the sitting-room door Miss Roberta even managed a frown . But as soon as they entered , as soon as their nephew turned to face them , all sternness melted away . Henry Pye stood rigid as though at attention , white-faced and weary-eyed ; and on the table behind him the cake-tin was unopened . " Well , dear boy , " said Miss Pye affectionately , " it 's nice to see you " ; and she took the wad of notes from her bag and slipped it into his hand . With one abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry sat down . " Is it  --  is it all here ? " " Yes , dear , fifty pounds , " said Miss Roberta . She spoke as calmly as she could , but the moment was a dreadful one . Henry looked so white , so racked , that the hearts of both old women yearned towards him : yet at the same time both in their hearts knew that he ought not to go unscathed . He should be  --  not punished , but made to remember . " I 've just been a plain damn ' fool , Auntie . " " Do n't swear , dear , " said Miss Pye  --  but sympathetically . " Just tell us how it happened , " urged Miss Roberta , " and then you 'll feel bet-ter . " The boy looked from one old face to the other . " I  --  borrowed -- some money out of the Sports Fund , " he said at last . " I 'd got into a mess . You see , I 'd been backing horses . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Roberta scarlet . " That 's why I had to ask you . And when I got here this evening and saw what you 'd done , I felt  --  I felt like the worst cad on earth . " The eyes of all three turned to the empty easel . In Miss Pye 's bag the miniature weighed like lead . She rose and walked stiffly to the mantelpiece . " My dear boy ? " " No , " said Henry quickly , " leave it there . Leave it there whenever I come . I want it to remind me . " And quite suddenly , like the face of a small boy who has confessed and been forgiven , his facelightened . He got up , and gave each of his aunts a kiss , and then involuntarily yawned . Emotion had so worn him out that five minutes later , when Miss Pye came in with the supper-tray , he was stretched on the sofa and fast asleep . " Roberta ! " whispered Miss Pye . " What are we to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Miss Rubel ta . " But that 's wicked ! " " Then we must be wicked , for Henry 's sake . It will be a lesson to him all his life . Whereas if he knew how we had got the money ? " " Yes , " agreed Miss Pye . Her eye rested a moment , almost wistfully , on the wad of notes . " You know , dear , I do see the temptation myself . " " So do I , " said Miss Roberta . " And that 's another reason for keeping the stand empty . To remind us as well . "
