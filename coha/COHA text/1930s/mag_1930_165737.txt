Quietly announced last week was the merger of two potent advertising agencies , H. K. McCann Co. and Erickson Co . Full statistics on dollar volume of these agencies are not available but indications are that the new organization ( separately ranking about sixth and tenth ) will rank fifth , perhaps higher . <P> The meager merger announcement gave no details-not even the new corporate name or directorate . No information has been forthcoming about the reasons for the merger . But the implications are obvious ; McCann gains many valuable accounts including Congoleum-Nairn , Bon Ami , Valspar , Dictaphone , Agfa-Ansco , Dill Tobacco ; and Erickson , which had these accounts among others , gains service facilities of which it has long felt the need . Erickson had only one office ( in Manhattan ) , while McCann has seven in the U. S. , three in Europe , four affiliated in Canada . McCann Co. , headed by Founder Harrison King McCann , is the larger of the combining bodies , but Erickson , headed by Founder Alfred William Erickson , goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Both agencies were incorporated in 1911 . Mr. Erickson had been running his own agency since 1902 . Four of his earliest accounts , Barrett Co. , Valspar , Bon Ami and James McCutcheon &; Co. are still with him . Mr. McCann had been with Standard Oil , and the Standard Oil Companies of New Jersey , Ohio , California , Indiana , Nebraska and Pennsylvania , together with Stance , Inc. are still among his biggest clients , along with California Packing Corp. , Devoe &; Raynolds ( in part ) , Canadian National Railways , Zonite , Borden ( in part ) , Beech-Nut , Encyclopedia Britannica and many another . <P> Both Mr. Erickson and Mr. McCann have been prominent in the American Association of Advertising Agencies . Mr. Erickson was elected president in 1921 , has served since on the executive board . Mr. McCann has been chairman of the Board of the 4A 's for the past two years . Harry Dwight Smith , Mr. Erickson 's partner for the past three years ( before that president &; founder of Fuller &; Smith ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> From Maine farmhouse to Manhattan penthouse has traveled Harrison King McCann , who believes in an " open door " office and encourages his executives to stand on their own feet , think with their own brains . A frequent host , a frequent guest , he sings &; plays much and well ; likes horses , dogs , hunting , billiards , golf ( in which his national handicap was once 8 ) , says with modest mendacity that he does many things , all badly . He has a reverse superstition about the number thirteen , for his company is called the Thirteen Company. * His chief abhorrence is modern art . <P> <P> * There are 13 letters and characters in the company 's name , address and slogan : The H. K. McCann Co. 285 Madison Ave . Truth Well Told .
