her large eyes untouched by amusement . They were dark , widely set , and starry with mascara . Her fair hair hung loose on her neck in a long wavy bob that faintly suggested Hollywood . She was dressed in a corset that cupped her small breasts , moulded her slight body in barely developed curves , and terminated in garters and short lace ruffles above the silk sheen of her slim , stockinged legs . Her feet were encased in little silver slippers , and written in white ink at the base of the photograph was the laconic legend , Ivy Doty . Film-Form Foundations with Grip-It Garters . ' That 's Ivy , ' said Ed Brown , with a sigh of satisfaction . Makes a fine study , do n't she ? She 's a nice girl , too . ' Cicily took the photograph . She had never thought much about modelling before . Those girls in ads did n't seem human beings . She 's married , you say ? ' For there was a virginal quality in the pose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those widely set eyes . Oh , yes . Very happily . She 's Mrs. Harold Doty . ' Ed Brown took back the photograph . Also Miss Wisconsin . ' Good-natured ridicule gleamed in Albert 's glance . She 's one of my finds , ' said Ed Brown complacently . Where did you find her ? ' Cicily was interested . I saw her on a float in Waukesha , three years ago . She was Waukesha 's Beauty Queen . I try to keep an eye on the smalltownpageants . You never know what you 'll find . I offered her a position that very afternoon . She 's a practical girl , so she 's had the sense to keep it . So many of those beauty queens get their heads turned and go out to starve in Hollywood till they grow old and blowzy . But Ivy stays on the job . She keeps in condition , gets good pay , and knows that she 's lucky . Married the man shep101was engaged to before she was Miss Wisconsin  --  and that 's a miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chicago and wangled a job for him in my bookkeeping department . He runs an adding machine upstairs . Do n't look like much , either . Queer little runt with an Adam 's apple . But he seems to suit Ivy . ' He closed the filing-case . As I said  --  she 's practical . She 's one of my best girls . ' Why , you old dog ! ' laughed Albert . She never told me that ! ' It was n't the kind of joke that Ed Brown found amusing . He merely said , not smiling , I hope she screens . ' Out in the hall again they ran into Oscar Hessler , with his hat and coat on , coming down from the third floor . Round and rosy , as usual . He took off the hat at the sight of Cicily and his small green eyes smiled at her . Gus Shanks addressed him . Albert , ' he said , has had another idea . ' It killed the smile . Oscar stopped in his tracks and asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat caustic . Ed Brown told him , briefly , and Oscar said nothing , his green eyes lowered , looking at the floor . What 's the matter with those two crepe-hangers ? ' Cicily inquired , when she was alone with Albert in his office . They 're jealous as hell , ' said Albert curtly . They know I 'll get a raise . ' Oh , Albert ! Will you ? ' Sure to , sweetheart . This is enterprise . ' His voice was jubilant . I had another brain storm yesterday . ' Enterprise , too ? ' I think it qualifies . Ed 's going to adopt it . ' What was it , darling ? ' Albert was picking up his hat and his overcoat and his glovesp1O2 and his muffler from the armchair where Miss Sadie had laid them in readiness . Perhaps this kind attention had made him think of her , for he said generously , It was really Miss Sadie 's idea . ' She had an idea ? ' Well , she said the view from my window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Advertising , like charity , should begin at home . So I told Ed that if he 'd plant some new bushes all around the house and sod the lawn and paint the fence and set out some bright flowers in an old-fashioned border , he 'd have a return on his money . He got it right away  --  he 's quick about things like that  --  and he gave the order . Come spring , this yard is going to be a garden spot . We 'll attract every eye . ' Albert  --  how clever of you ! ' He grinned at her pleasantly . I thought so , too . ' Darling , do n't be vainglorious . ' But her eyes were appreciative . I never am . Just know a good thing when I see it . You 're a good thing , sweet . ' He kissed her . Come along , now . ' He turned toward the door . She was reminded of the cocktail party , but his gaiety was contagious . She skipped by his side as they descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through the doors leading into the lower hall she could look into the deserted studios of the commercial artists . The lights were all out in them , but easels and cameras , drawing-desks and posters , showed in the light from the hall chandelier . An elderly janitor who served as night watchman came out of what had once been Aunt Flora 's china pantry . He smiled at Cicily , an unexpected apparition . Good night , Pete . This is Mrs. Lancaster . ' The inference in his tone was that Albert was proud of her . Got any use for a cigar ? '  |p103Thank  you , sir . ' The smile was transferred to Albert and Cicily remembered Miss Sadie 's comment , He 's a great favourite . ' She did n't wonder . With children and servitors , Albert 's touch was sure . A lovable trait  --  impulsive , attractive . She felt suddenly near to him , seen as his wife , unique in that relationship , by the eyes of the janitor which seemed to be commenting , They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes  --  old , respectful , yet admiring  --  as a desirable woman and Albert as desirous . Abruptly , it seemed romantic to be going home with him . Albert , ' she said , when he had opened the door on the dusk of the winter street , must we go to Gertrude 's ? ' Lord , yes . She expects us . ' She remarked , not quite honestly , She would n't care . ' Probably not . But I said I 'd drop in . ' He started down the steps a few feet ahead of her . It 's awfully late and dinner 's at seven . ' We need n't stay long . As soon as we get there you can telephone Vesta to make it half-past . ' She does n't like to , darling . And we 'll miss Bertie . He 's always so cunning when he 's ready for bed . ' Albert merely opened the front gate for her in silence . ' I ' 11 telephone , ' said Cicily , her tone a conciliation . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hop in first . I 'll walk around the car . ' The night had definitely fallen when Cicily and Albert reached Gertrude Sewall 's house  --  a brown shingled cottage , overlooking the fourth tee of the Lakewood Country Club golf links  --  but Cicily could visualize the level western landscape , shrouded in darkness , under the starry sky . Brown withered weeds , the snowstreakedfields , scattered scrub-oak trees . The site of the house , at that time of day and year , seemed lonely and dreary . In summer , however , Gertrude 's side porch , shaded by a willow tree and commanding the billiard-table emerald of the golf green across a split-rail fence at the end of her tiny garden , was a favourite rendezvous for what Cicily thought of as the horsey set ' of Lakewood . She knew them fairly well . They merged with , yet were subtly differentiated from , her own lifelong intimates . In many instances , indeed , they belonged to the very same families , sporting eccentrics , dissenting from domesticity through the lure of turf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sheltering willow and the big barn behind it , beyond which was a paddock and a runway with jumps in it  --  gates , hedges , and ditches  --  divided from the surrounding fields by high wooden fences ; not one prosaic barrier of Middle-Western wire . As the Ford rolled up the drive , all this was invisible , but Cicily knew it was there . A neat maid opened the door on a neat little hall  --  and silence . Very unexpectedly , no clamour of voices came from the living-room door . Then , That you , Albert ? ' It was Gertrude 's voice , disembodied . It 's both of us , ' said Cicily , as she approached the living-room from which the voice had sounded . Cicily ? Why  --  how nice ! ' Surprise , not quite suppressed , sounded in Gertrude 's tone . Darker than the hall the living-room was lit by one dim lamp and the glow from a dying fire . Gertrude , in riding clothes , lunged out of a deep armchair where she must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone fireplace pI05Hello , old speed , ' she said to Albert , who  --  to do him justice  --  looked somewhat surprised by the intimacy of this reception . I thought it was a party , ' he observed  --  Cicily could not help thinking  --  with masculine ineptitude . No . Just one or two people . They have n't come yet , ' said Gertrude carelessly , and Cicily wondered if this could be true . While she was wondering , I ' 11 go mix the drinks , ' their hostess added in her most indifferent manner . We wo n't wait for them . Sit down by the fire . ' She left the room and Albert sank into the seat she had vacated , saying with satisfaction , This is a grand chair . ' Cicily remained standing , the better to look about her . She had not been in this room for nearly seven years . It had not changed  --  dark brown and comfortable  --  rather like a room designed for a man 's comfort . No feminine knick-knacks and very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly , lay on the table , and a wide sofa and three large armchairs , deepbackedand down-cushioned , were gathered near the hearth , where an English fender with a brown leather seat on it , guarded the open fire . Hung over the fireplace  --  made of rough field stones  --  was a large framed photograph of one of Gertrude 's hunters and on the broad mantel-shelf was a collection of ribbons  --  blue , red , and yellow  --  displayed under glass , which Gertrude 's entries had been awarded at horse shows , and one large silver loving cup , obviously a trophy of some equine achievement . The room , though so masculine in its atmosphere and appointments , was thoroughly Gertrude 's , which was not surprising as she lived in it alone . She had been divorced from Baines Sewall for more than six years . She had left him decently , going to Reno and charging mental cruelty , but his drunkenness was back of it . Baines was a queer fish , dissipated but devoted . He still hungpI06 about her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't , though everyone said that he had other girls . Some gossips thought that they still lived together  --  on and off , when convenient  --  but Cicily doubted it . The thought was too unpleasant , and why would Gertrude do it ? Baines was unattractive and , since the Sewall bank had failed , he was really quite penniless , dependent on his father , who was Doctor Lambert Sewall , the silver-haired rector of Saint George 's in the village , a dear old gentleman , strait-laced and pious and thoroughly ashamed of his scapegrace son . Gertrude had her own money  --  enough of it , probably  --  which gave her an advantage over her former relatives-in-law . But she lived very simply , preferring to spend her surplus on horses and travel . She played bridge constantly , but she usually won . At this point in her reflections  --  Cicily had been summing up all she knew of Gertrude Sewall  --  she suddenly remembered the lateness of the hour and said to Albert , Oh , dear  --  I should telephone Vesta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , he only said idly , Why do n't you do it now ? ' So she left the room and crossed the hall and entered the pantry to find the telephone , which was just where it used to be , beside the kitchen door . The neat little maid was mixing Manhattans without Gertrude 's supervision . Cicily smiled at her and took down the receiver . Oh , Baines , ' she heard a voice say , you make me tired . Of course you can get him if you hurry . ' It was Gertrude , speaking on the telephone upstairs . Cicily hung up the receiver , not at all troubled by the fact that she had overheard this snatch of conversation , indeed ratherpI07amused by it , thinking , She talks just like a wife to him  --  irritatedand demanding . What a funny relationship ! She waited a moment for the line to be free . Then she gave her own number and was glad when Sis answered , so she need n't speak to Vesta . Gertrude came into the pantry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , Hannah . Everything ready ? ' Then she saw Cicily . I was calling up Sis to tell her we 'd be late . ' For Gertrude 's expression was curiously stony . It seemed to ask an explanation of Cicily 's presence at the telephone . Oh Did you get her ? ' Cicily nodded and the stony expression perceptibly relaxed , though Gertrude made no comment , but picked up a plate of sandwiches . I 'll take these , Hannah . You bring the tray . ' Albert relinquished his armchair as they entered the living-room , but Gertrude waved him back into it and perched herself on the fender , with her back to the fire . In the glow from the embers , slim and erect in her trim tan riding coat , with her lank legs crossed in her neat-fitting breeches , she commanded a definite , out-of-door charm . She said to Hannah , Put everything there . ' There ' was a low table in front of the fender . Gertrude leaned forward to fill the glasses from the shaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , decisive movements had a trig elasticity which was pleasing to the eye . She said , addressing Albert : It was so warm today that I took the three-year-old out for a quiet hack . As soon as the frost is out of the ground I want to begin schooling him . He 'll make a fine hunter , if I can give him the time . But will you tell me why I bought him ? I ca n't use four horses . I ca n't even keep them exercised . ' From the depths of the sofa , Cicily inquired , Have n't you a groom ? '  |p108Of  course . But he ca n't do everything . I need another , but I ca n't afford it . I 'm still economizing after my last trip abroad . I was there eighteen months , mostly with Maisie Caldwell . Who says Europe 's cheap ? Maisie was ennuyee  --  she was getting her divorce and that 's always a low moment  --  and we simply spent millions in search of diversion . I went to her wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Villefort  --  my dears , he was priceless . Beau comme le jour , with chocolate-cream eyes and one of those French waistlines ! He has n't a sou , but a dream of a chateau . Maisie , as madame la comtesse , was an utter riot . To the manner born . You never would have dreamed that she 'd once been Mrs. Avery Caldwell of Lakewood , Illinois , or that her father had made his pile in that laundry-soap company . I gave Avery an earful when I came home . He was simply fascinated . More interested in Maisie than he had been in years . I suppose you would be . ' She paused to draw breath . I mean  --  are you , Albert ? ' Cicily was included in her impudent grin as she risked this reference to the existence of Belle . The impudence was mitigated as she reminded them cheerfully that their plight was a common one . I wish Baines would marry some innocent girl . I 'd like to watch her struggle with him . ' Cicily was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mixed up with ; and the queerest thing about it is that I really belong in it and that Albert does , too . But that thought , in itself , was queer . It had popped up unbidden and she could n't account for it , or for the feeling behind it . Divorce , in the abstract , had always seemed to Cicily civilized , practical , necessary , and humane . Yet the people who went in for it --  Well , they were the divorced crowd . Odd to be one of them . Aunt Isabel consideredthem distinctly immoral . Even Mumsy deplored their influence in the community , the threat they implied to the safetypI09of Lakewood . Cicily herself ; when married to Jack , before Albert had loved her , had always regarded them with tolerant pity as men and women who had smashed because of some weakness inherentin character . She had never admitted this to Mumsy or Aunt Isabel , preferring to pride herself on a superior sophistication . But she admitted it now . Gertrude was rattling on , putting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , lit with mischief and malice , looked younger than it was . Over his cocktail glass , Albert was watching her , flattering amusement in his luminous eyes . She was diverting him . This talk about Maisie was reminding him of Europe , of the gaiety of the embassies . Yet Maisie was a product of the U.S.A. Typical , too . Our Native Wildflowers , ' thought Cicily cynically . They were less subtle and much less sophisticated than the HonourableMrs . Diston , of blessed memory , who would have despised Maisie as obvious and vulgar . But what was Audrey Diston but a hothouse variation , artificially cultivated and bred for brains and subterfuge , of Maisie 's rude , crude bloom ? The thought of a hothouse made Cicily remember the funeral florist and the single red rose in the vase on Albert 's desk and the abject devotion in Miss Sadie 's protuberant eyes . She glanced at Gertrude 's eyes , so different from Miss Sadie 's , glinting at Albert in lively exhilaration . So predatory women would always . look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning . Miss Sadie , very fortunately , had nothing in common with them . A predatory secretary , thought Cicily , would utterly unnerve me . And then  --  what a fool I am ! Gertrude was saying , Well  --  this puts Avery back in circulation . Legitimate circulation . His attentions have always been counterfeit before . I think I 'll set my cap for him . He 's rather a dear pII0 The doorbell sounded . So  --  Gertrude had not been lying . Those one or two people ' were really going to come . Hannah opened the door , and Gert ? ' said a man 's voice , raised from the hall on a questioning accent . Baines Sewall appeared on the threshold and  --  Goodness , thought Cicily , he 's gone to pieces ! He added , in an inflection half humorous , half grudging , perhaps only meant to be comic , Well  --  here we are . ' Gertrude was not looking at him , or at Avery Caldwell either , as at Baines 's elbow the comtesse de Villefort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment , were fixed on Cicily and Cicily was aware of it . Both men shook hands with Gertrude , greeted Cicily affably , nodded to Albert and accepted their cocktails from their hostess 's hand . Avery Caldwell sat down on the sofa . A handsome man  --  forty-ish  --  with a little black moustache and shiny black hair , and a chin and a waistline just beginning to grow heavier . His complexionwas ruddy and he exuded a sense of physical well-being . A successful architect , he owed much of his success to the primitive fact that he was successful with women . He sat close to Cicily , with the comfortable assurance of a man who was accustomed to feminine encouragement . But she hardly noticed him . She was thinking that Baines was perfectly unconscious that that unfortunateinflection on which he had entered the room  --  carrying with it the inference that he was , after some difficulty , producing himselfand his companion as Gertrude had commanded  --  had let Gertrude down . His flat , foolish face , weakened by dissipation , was wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed it . Gertrude was n't sure how much damage , if any , the inflection had done . She was n't sure about the telephone . God knew what she 'd said over it ! But the sequence of events was crystal-clear to Cicily . Only the motive behind Ger/trude 's duplicity was clouded . She had certainly asked Albert to drop in alone for a cocktail , and he , to his credit , had not understoodher . Surprised by Cicily , she had lied about a party  --  as you too often do lie , quickly , not thinking  --  and then slipped upstairs to telephone to Baines to bring Avery Caldwell and make that lie come true . So much was obvious . But why , marvelled Cicily , had she gone to all that trouble ? If your conscience was clear , there was nothing so frightful in this day and age about asking a man to drop in for a cocktail -- She almost blinked . The flash of light was blinding . She regardedher hostess with suddenly hostile eyes . For Gertrude must have known her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew what she 'd planned and that had befuddled her , when confronted by Cicily . For an instant she 'd thought that Cicily knew it , too . But , good Heavens , thought Cicily , she ca n't already be making a serious pass at Albert ! Why , she has n't seen him more than five or six times . Or had she ? Of course she had n't . Albert would have mentioned it . There was , of course , that bond between them of the purchase of the three-year-old  --  the cursed colt ! If a three-year-old was a colt . She really did n't know . She did n't know anything , and she was laughing a little , in spite of her anger , at her own helpless ignorance . She could laugh because Albert was innocent  --  at least in this immediate affair . In simple good faith he had told her that Gertrude had asked them both to a cocktail party . He was innocent and ignorant . Even now , he did n't know what had happened and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she knew it would intrigue him to learn that Gertrude had plotted and planned to meet him sub rosa . They were talking of bridle paths and Gertrude was urging that more must be cut through the country west of the golf links . The farmers would give them the right of way . In scattered oak grovespII2the land lay idle . There were logging roads there that needed no improvement . Lanes could be landscaped on the edge of the open fields . Do you ride , Mrs. Lancaster ? ' Avery Caldwell inquired . Uncle Fred 's question on the evening of Sally MacLeod 's dinner party . I do n't know a horse from a buggy , ' she declared defiantly . They all laughed at that , and Avery pursued , But you 're keen on it , Albert ? ' Yes , he is . ' Gertrude answered the question . Then , directly to Albert , You 'd better come on the Hunt Club Committee . ' But he ca n't hunt . He has n't a horse , ' Baines objected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were shifting between them . Avery permitted himself a faint , dry smile . No , I have n't . I 'm hard up , ' said Albert . His candour was disarming . There was just a perceptible instant of silence , before Gertrude said casually , leaning forward as she spoke to pass Baines the sandwiches , I 've a mare you could ride . ' The silence that followed had lasted longer than an instant , before Albert observed , Why  --  that 's awfully good of you . But What ? ' asked Gertrude . I could n't let you be so generous , ' said Albert politely . I told you that I could n't keep the wretched nags exercised , ' said Gertrude briskly . You can ride Ginger . She 's a pretty little filly , but her mouth 's a trifle hard . Not a mount for a woman . She 's a thoroughbred who turned out too slow for the track , and I bought her cheap one day when she was left at the post . I ought to sell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she ca n't race , she 's an excellent hunter . Here , Avery  --  let me fill your glass . ' pI13And suddenly , incredibly , it all seemed settled and Cicily was aware that , in spite of her matter-of-factness , both Baines and Avery knew that Gertrude was up to something . She tried , in vain , to meet her husband 's eyes . Later , in the Ford , driving home through the darkness , she pulled herself together and said meekly , I hope you wo n't ride , Albert . ' Why not , sweet ? ' he inquired . Well  --  you know I  --  I 'm rather afraid of horses . I think it 's dangerous , ' she equivocated . He laughed at that . A bridle path is n't a polo field , darling . ' She hated argument and she knew that he did , but so much was at stake that she continued painfully , And then  --  there 's Gertrude . I do n't think  --  I mean , I do think ' She paused inarticulately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirr the Ford made , as it rushed on through the dark suburban road , deserted at the dinner hour . Then , What do  --  or do n't  --  you think , dear ? ' he asked , with an edge in his tone that was faintly that of irony . She knew it was the last thing that he wanted to know . So again she equivocated . I think that you  --  that we  --  should n't accept an offer like that . It 's too much for her to do for us . ' Strange how your voice betrayed you when you were disingenuous . He assured her lightly . Oh , I think you exaggerate . She would n't have suggested it , if she felt that way . She 's not doing us a kindness . She 's no great friend of yours and I know her very . slightly . It 's just as she said  --  she needs another groom and ca n't afford to hire one . '  |p114She  knew , immediately , that he was going to ride and that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was determined he always adopted that light , brittle tone . Perhaps he believed what he said . Albert had a talent for believing what he liked . So she said no more , but sat withdrawn from him , leaning back in her corner of the front seat of the motor , her eyes on the shaft of the headlights that illuminated the road . When they reached their front door , Robin flung it open before they entered the vestibule . He must have heard the motor coming up the drive . Do you know what time it is ? We 're simply starving ! ' His nine-year-old voice was vibrant with hunger and exasperation . John and Sis ran out of the living-room behind him . It 's nearly eight o'clock , ' John volunteered . And Sis contributed , Vesta 's mad as a snake . She had a date with her boy friend to go to the movies . ' Cicily stood motionless , looking at their mutinous young faces . Then she asked dully , Is Bertie in bed ? ' Long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Cicily moved wearily in the direction of the stairs . I want to go and look at him , ' she said dispiritedly . Oh , gosh , Mother ! Let 's eat ! ' The protest was Robin 's . Albert stepped forward to lay a restraining hand on his youngest stepson 's shoulder . Listen , kids , ' he said gently , in the quiet tone of friendly consideration that always enlisted their whole-hearted co-operation , do n't make a row like this and bother your mother . We want to take care of her , do n't we ? She 's tired . '  |p115MuMsY  , ' said Cicily , her tone faintly constrained , but with a note of determination in it , what was Albert 's father like ? ' From her seat on the bench beneath the gnarled hawthorn tree in Cicily 's garden  --  a relic of the days when the lot had been wildwood  --  Jane merely looked up past the sprays of white blossom to the blue of the May sky . If she was surprised by this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remember him , ' she said indifferently . I do n't very well . Not before he was ill . Tall , was n't he  --  and good-looking ? With a big brown moustache ? ' Yes . Very handsome . Press that earth down , Cicily . ' I am . ' She was kneeling on the grass at the edge of a flower bed beside a big wheelbarrow , planting her annuals in the crumbling brown soil . An hour before , her mother had dropped in to advise her on her garden . Was he handsome like Albert ? ' Her hands , loosely covered by big white cotton gloves , went on patting and pressing . There 's a certain resemblance . But Albert looks more like his mother 's people . You must keep those marigolds away from the heliotrope . ' Yes  --  with the zinnias . I 've nothing here but candytuft . Albert does n't look very much like Aunt Muriel . '  | He looks like her family , in a general way . ' I think they 're quite alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my salmon-pink phlox , ' said Jane reflectively . She seemed to be seeing the garden in July . I ' 11 bring you some , dear . ' Cicily sat back on her heels and looked at her mother . Did you know Albert 's father 's family ? ' she asked abruptly . No , I never met them . ' Jane 's tone was vague and her gaze was still fixed prophetically on the flower beds . He came to Chicago when I was a child . ' He was grown-up , then ? ' Yes . He was , dear . ' Cicily picked up her trowel and began to dig little craters in the brown earth in front of her . After a moment , Well  --  you have n't said much about what he was like , ' she reminded her parent . Jane stirred on her bench , but not at all uneasily , not as if she were nervous . Why , my dear , I do n't know just what there is to say . He was a great beau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He used to lead cotillions . ' Cicily smiled at that characterization . Did you dance them with him ? ' Mercy , no . I was much too young . ' How old was he , Mumsy , when he married Aunt Muriel ? ' Jane paused to consider . Why , I ca n't remember exactly . Notvery old , as age seems to me now . I think  --  not forty . ' And she wasTwenty . And as pretty as a picture . ' If he was such a heart-breaker , why had n't he married before ? ' He was n't the marrying kind , I suppose . ' Jane tried to dismiss it . But she did not succeed . Had he had a lot of women ? '  |p117Jane  's eyes widened at this blunt question . My child , what a thing to ask me ! ' You said he was a great beau . ' Jane laughed , very naturally . That was the phrase in those days . But it did n't mean anything . ' Anything ? ' Cicily glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't be a great beau without a girl or two , Mumsy . ' Cicily picked up her dibble and a handful of seedlings . Oh  --  all the girls liked him . ' Liked him ? No more ? ' Jane laughed again . There was n't any more , my child . When I was young we did n't know young men as you do . We were rarely left alone with them . We called them by their last names . Why , I thought of Bert as " Mr. Lancaster " for years after he married your Aunt Muriel , and I was one of their bridesmaids -- In her turn , Cicily burst out laughing . I wish I 'd known you then , Mumsy . You must have been a riot . ' No . I was very tame . ' I did n't mean that kind of riot , ' said Cicily affectionately . She was sorting her seedlings and paused , for a moment , to count them . But what about married women ? ' Well  --  what about them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Did they call their beaux by their last names ? ' They did n't have any . ' Oh , Mumsy -- Well , we never heard about them . ' Never ? ' Hardly ever . ' Cicily 's grin had broadened . Mumsy , what did you hear ? '  | 18 Very little , dear . Honestly . People were n't so  --  articulate . ' But still , you knew ' We did n't know anything . We just sensed  --  occasionally  - -  that there were things that  --  well , that we ought to disapprove of . ' Cicily 's blue eyes were gleaming with amusement . What things ? Adultery ? Mumsy , do try to be clear . ' After an instant , We never heard that word spoken , except by a vested clergyman . ' Jane was not shocked , but she was emphatic . But you knew what it meant ? ' No , we did n't  --  exactly . ' But still you disapproved of it ? ' Cicily smiled . Adultery , ' said Jane , pronouncing the word with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of it , was not a  --  a thing we ever thought of as actually happening . ' But yet you disapproved of those married women ? The ones who had beaux , I mean ? ' Everyone did , dear . But there were very few of them . ' And of their beaux , too ? ' Certainly . Not as much , perhaps , ' Jane added honestly . Sitting back on her heels again , Cicily looked at Jane . Didpeople disapprove of Albert 's father ? ' she asked deliberately . Jane met her eyes and coloured , very faintly . My dear child , ' she said , you 're conducting an extraordinary cross-examination . ' I gather that they did , ' said Cicily dryly . Then , as Jane madeno further comment , Before he married Aunt Muriel ? ' Jane admitted with reluctance , He was said to be somewhat fast . ' What a wonderful word ! Who was she , Mumsy ?

She was much older . She had a daughter who was my age . But I knew her  --  and I loved her . ' The honest emotion in her mother 's voice caught Cicily 's ear and sobered her . Did Aunt Muriel know ? ' she asked . I think she did . ' Did it give her pause for thought ? ' Jane shook her head . Well , I rather like that . ' Though Cicily 's tone was a trifle uncertain . It 's honest and it 's modern . What happened to the woman ? ' In the pause that followed , Jane looked at her daughter so gravely that Cicily knew that she had sounded cavalier . Then , She died , ' said Jane , very quietly . Then and there ? Why , Mumsy  --  how romantic ! Of a broken heart , you mean ? Those were the days --  ' But then she observed that her casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the point where she felt she must do something about it , say something serious to impress on her daughter the solemnity of this story , which seemed so remote , archaic , artificial , a fantasy of the Nineties . She killed herself , ' said Jane . Mumsy  --  she did n't ! ' Cicily was shocked out of modern objectivity . How simply appalling ! ' I should n't have told you , ' said Jane , looking worried . Do n't be silly . Of course you should have . What did Albert 's lather do ? ' Nothing . '  |p120But  he must have What could he do ? ' Gosh , I do n't know . Where was he ? ' Away on his honeymoon . ' Golly ! ' said Cicily . The word spoke volumes . She sank down on the grass , her feet curled under her , her hands playing idly with the dibble she still held . The little green seedlings were now all planted . Some of them drooped , as if they were thirsty . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not yet blown full by the warm spring breezes , the setting sunlight dappledthe green lawn . A bird chirruped suddenly , not far away , from a nest that was hidden in a pink-budded oak tree . The gardenwas sunny , but the air was growing chill . Jane rose from the bench and pulled her coat around her . We 'd better go in , if you 've finished with those seedlings . But you ought to water them . ' The kids can do that , ' said Cicily absently . They 're off playing somewhere , but they 'll soon be home . ' She stood up awkwardly , cramped from kneeling by the flower beds . She stood by the wheelbarrow , slowly pulling off her white cotton gloves , and looked at Jane again . It was n't a very auspicious beginning , was it , for Albert 's parents ' marriage ? Did they feel terribly ? ' My dear , I do n't know . ' They did n't  --  that you saw ? ' I did n't see much . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes grew tender . Mumsy , darling , I think you must always have seen things . ' In spite of the serious mood of the moment , Jane looked very pleased . And after that ? ' asked Cicily , moving nearer to her . What do you mean , dear ? '  |p12IWas  he faithful to Aunt Muriel ? ' My child  --  how would I know ? ' You 'd sense it , would n't you ? ' When Jane did not answer , I think you did sense it , Mumsy , ' said Cicily quietly . She slipped her hand affectionately through her mother 's elbow . Well  --  come in and have some tea . ' They strolled across the lawn together in silence , as if everything had been said that there was need of saying . But as they reached the doorstep , Cicily paused . Her eyes looked troubled , as if , as time passed , her full appreciation of the story Jane had told her was growing and developing . It seems so strange , ' she murmured , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert 's father as a bedridden old man  --  speechless , half-conscious . It was a stroke , was n't it ? ' Yes , dear . It was . ' How old was he when it happened ? Albert never speaks of him . ' Not very old . In the middle fifties . ' Jane turned toward the door . But Cicily detained her . Mumsy , ' she said , all this throws light on something you 've probably forgotten . I was at your house the day Aunt Muriel came to tell you that she was going to marry Ed Brown . Albert was still abroad  --  with Belle . I hardly knew him . His father 'd been dead about two years , I think --  ' She paused , to remember . Yes , dear , ' prompted Jane . When she went away , Aunt Isabel said  --  she was there , too  --  or rather she implied , that Aunt Muriel had had lovers . Had had them for years . I hardly believed her . Was it true , Mumsy ? ' Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , extraordinary to be answered . But Cicily 's eyes refused to be denied. pI22 Well  --  she had a great deal of attention . ' The eyes smiled faintly at the old-fashioned phrase . You mean , she had  --  beaux . ' Oh , ever so many ! ' Jane looked relieved and glad to smile herselfagain . As she continued , her voice accentuated cheerfully in velocity and volume . And why not , my dear ? We were really quite modern by that time . Your Aunt Muriel was a beauty and always a great belle . She had a gay nature and she loved a good time . Nothing ever quenched her high spirits . ' Not even Albert 's father 's death ? ' That seemed to check Jane . Well , dear  --  of course , he 'd been ill a long time . As a matter of fact , I think it left her rather lonely . She 'd taken good care of him - ' But it had n't cramped her style ? ' Well , no . Not exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply in love with Ed Brown and since then ' Jane paused . What ? ' asked Cicily . Jane 's smile had deepened . Not even Aunt Isabel finds anything to criticize . ' Cicily stared . But Mumsy  --  she 's so old . ' She 's fifty-six , ' said Jane , a trifle tartly . That 's not decrepit . ' Oh , of course not ! ' Cicily hastened to correct her error . She opened her door and led the way to the living-room . Sit down , Mumsy . I 'll go and tell Vesta to get tea ready . ' But first she knelt down to light the open fire . Where 's Albert ? ' asked Jane . For the day was Saturday . He 's out riding . ' He rides often , does n't he ? ' The question seemed casual . Yes . Every week-end . He 's awfully interested in that newhorse of Gertrude 's . They 're schooling it together for the horse1p123show in June . She 's going to enter it in the novice hunter class and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two horses abreast , you know . ' You really would have thought that Cicily was a horsewoman , her tone was so enthusiastic . Jane stood on the hearthrug , looking down at her daughter . Conscious of her gaze , Cicily said cheerfully : I 'm so glad he can do it , for he 's working awfully hard . This movie stuff takes time  --  Uncle Ed lets him manage it . They 've rigged up a productionstudio out on the West Side . Sometimes he 's there and sometimes in his office . I ca n't keep track of him . He works nights often , but I think he enjoys it . He writes that foolish dialogue  --  with his tongue in his cheek , of course  --  and sometimes he directs those idiotic plays . They have quite a stock company  --  models and some actors . I 've been out there to watch him  --  a play , it was , about a dear old lady who washed for a large family , starring an electric mangle !  --  and he 's really very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has he really ? ' said Jane , her tone quickening with interest . Yes . It does n't amount to much . Uncle Ed 's pretty thrifty . But of course it helps . I 'll go and get the tea . ' When Cicily came back with the tray , she found her mother sitting in the armchair by the fire . Her eyes were on the flames and she did not look up as she addressed her daughter . Cicily , ' she said humorously , I 've been thinking about you . What put you up to asking me all those questions ? ' What questions , Mumsy ? ' Cicily 's tone was the essence of innocence . She set the tray on a table by her mother 's chair . ' You pour it , Mumsy . You make such good tea . ' But Jane was not distracted by idle compliment . She picked up the teapot and persisted pleasantly , What have you on your mind ? ' pI24 Me ? You 'd never guess . ' Cicily smiled frankly , after an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure irresolution . She pulled up a chair and sat down on it , adding , Mendelian characteristics . ' What on earth  --  ? ' Jane stared at her over the cream pitcher . Cicily leaned forward to pick up a bread-and-butter sandwich . I went to a lecture last night at the Lakewood Progressive School . It was a Parents ' Meeting . Albert wo n't go to them , but he was in town so I thought it a good time to chalk up an appearance . They 're usually crashing bores . But this one was n't . They had a professor there , from the University . He gave us an earful on the Mendelian Law . ' Here 's your cup , dear . What did he say about it ? ' Oh , he talked for an hour and mostly about rodents . ' Cicily managed a laugh that was really very creditable . And quite a lot about eyes  --  brown ones and blue ones , you know  --  recessive and dominant strains . But it set me to thinking of the horrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really are n't responsiblefor , because you only do them because you are what you are . I thought about myself , Mumsy , and about all my ancestors . My goodness , those mice had been bred for twenty generations ! And of course  --  we have been , too . Look at my wrist She pulled up her cuff to expose it . The blood in those veins is probably full of trouble wished on me by perfect strangers like great-great-grandfathers and great-great-grandmothers , and greater ones back of them . It makes it seem so hopeless . ' It makes what seem hopeless ? ' Why  --  to try to behave . Why not let nature take its course ? It probably will , anyway . I tell you those mice were utter pawns of circumstance . ' But probably , ' said Jane , her voice very reasonable , **26;5280;TOOLONG and great-grandmothers behaved very well . What makes you think they did n't ? ' Cicily grinned at her . Because I do n't , Mumsy . It works both ways . ' What does ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ought to . Jane said fondly , You ridiculous child . ' And then I began thinking of how little we know about even our grandparents  --  or our fathers and mothers . That professor said that most people could n't even tell you how their grandparents died . But it seems to me much more important to know how they lived . And we do n't know that either . Not even how our parents lived . I feel very sure that Albert does n't know what you told me today . ' Well , I hope you wo n't tell him , ' said Jane , very quickly . Oh , I should n't dream of it . Or about the mice , either . ' Why not about the mice , dear ? ' He might stop struggling . ' So Cicily made a joke of it . The front door banged open to the clamour of children 's voices . The sound of their feet was loud in the hall . Come in here , kids . Come and kiss your grandmother . ' They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries of joy they fell upon the gingerbread and bread-and-butter sandwiches . Their hands were n't very clean . But their faces were eager and their lips were laughing . Jane never looked happier than when she was talking with them . When the plates were emptied , Cicily said , John  --  I wish you 'd water the plants I put out in the garden . Not very violently - they 're very small . Robin will help you drag out the hose . And after that , Robin , put the wheelbarrow back in the garage for me , will you ? The garden tools are in it . Sis , I wish you'dpI26carry this tray into the pantry . We seem to have thoroughly finished the tea . Tell Vesta please to get Bertie 's supper ready . ' She put her arm around Bertie and pulled him to her side . No , darling . You ca n't go out again . You 're too little . ' The boys ran off on their errands and Sis picked up the tray and carried it out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her , affection and amusement mingled in her eyes . When the child had vanished , she said , I think it 's good for them , Cicily , to have to turn to and help you. , I agree , ' said Cicily . And they do n't seem to mind . They take it for granted  --  the way we live now . You take everything for granted when you are a child . ' She paused , met Jane 's glance , and went on impulsively : Do you know , Mumsy  --  you may not agree with me  --  but I think there 's an awful lot of nonsense preached about the effect of divorce on children . At least , my children never seem to be bothered by it . I suppose it depends on how their parents behave . What they see and hear right under their noses is really what impresses them . Sis and John and Robin mention Jack , now and then , and always very frankly . But they 're just as fond of Albert as Bertie is , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With children , you know , he 's always sweet and gay . ' Jane said gently , I 'm very glad to hear it . ' He has  --  in many ways  --  a very sweet nature , ' said Cicily gratuitously . So has your Aunt Muriel . ' Jane risked the observation . Bertie was scrambling up on Cicily 's lap . Over his dark curls she met her mother 's eyes . She had not missed the reference of that risked observation . Bertie put his plump little arms around her neck to hug her . As she buried her face in the softness beneathp127his ear , tickling his ribs and making him laugh the shrill , happy laugh of excited childhood , she matched it with another . And so has this mouse , ' she said , lifting her head to smile . The Harvest Moon was flooding the Skokie Valley with unearthlyradiance . Yellow as butter , it soared in the cloudless sky . Its light seemed diffused and the sky looked gauzy , for a heat haze hung over the western prairies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipate . The course of the Skokie itself was marked by a mist that shrouded its banks , wraith-like and tenuous , a scarf of vapour , silvered by moonlight . The nearer fields , with the hay still standing in them , were yellow as the moon . Avery Caldwell 's lawn was a rectangle of silver . It began abruptly , separated from the fields by a low , cream-plastered parapet , and stretched past his eighteenth-century sundial , set in a small , geometric plot of rosebushes , to the terrace on the western facade of his house ; it was divided in four triangles of thick , clover-sown turf by two diagonal gravel paths that began at the corners of the terrace , crossed at the sundial , and ended at the parapet , where two balanced clumps of cedar trees marked the ends of the high plastered walls which hid Avery 's grounds from the eyes of his neighbours , yet left the view of fields and Skokie open from the terrace and the lawn . The walls were both lined by a double row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each clump of cedars was an ancient stone statue  --  one of a nymph , the other of a satyr  --  dim now in the moonlight , iut adding mysteriously to the romance of the scene . . This house of Avery 's , French and formal in style and fastidiousin decor , was generally considered to be one of his best , but it waspI28 much too large for one man to live in alone . He and Maisie had had no children , but she had kept the large rooms full of very gay people  --  being addicted to parties of a peculiarly festive nature  --  and Avery now took pleasure in proclaiming whimsically , I miss my wife 's friends . ' As one of the few unattached men in whom Lakewood rejoiced , he had plenty of friends of his own , but  --  being a man  --  he disliked the effort of planning a party of any nature whatever and seldom felt the need of organizing more than one or two a season . On this occasion he had invited his guests to meet the Harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people had gathered on the terrace for an eight-o'clock dinner  --  and Avery had described his plans for the evening as a fete champetre ' on the lawn . Which means , ' he had added engagingly , as you 'll know if you have any feeling for the derivation of words , that I do n't intend to do anything about you . The fields are meant to amuse you . A bucolic people , the French  --  so often misunderstood ! Run along now , boys and girls , and look like a Watteau ! ' As a matter of fact , Avery had actually hung six silken-roped swings from the boughs of his plane trees  --  three on each side of the enclosure of the lawn . They had caused a great deal of merriment as the women ran down to swing in them and the men to swing them , and the women , at least , in their light , filmy frocks , had looked not unlike the little festive figures in a Watteau or Fragonard canvas . And that was before the daylight had faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane trees and the cedars and even that of the high plastered walls softened and sentimentalized by the gauze of the heat haze  --  almost imperceptible , but modifying minutely the quality of the atmosphere  --  the scene took on an aura of enchantment . In a setting like this , you ought to wear lace ruffles and satinp129knee breeches , ' said Cicily to Avery , as they stood on the edge of the terrace , their coffee-cups in hand . And a lovely brocaded coat , tight-waisted and flaring . And carry a three-cornered hat and a tall ivory cane . ' She was thinking , as she spoke , that the sartorial elegance of the eighteenth century would have been very becoming to Albert . You are n't , by any chance , confusing me with my former wife 's present husband , are you ? ' suggested Avery . The costume you outline would seem to me more a comte de Villefort 's line . ' Maisie and Avery had led a cat-and-dog life . But now that she 's left him he thinks of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , romance is dead and comtes are n't what they used to be . He probably has a tailor in Savile Row . ' And owes him ten years ' bills  --  unless Maisie 's paid ' em . That may have been contracted for before the knot was tied . ' Her eyes were compassionate ; Though I ca n't say that his thoughts betray much tenderness , she was thinking . Still , she 's a ghost in his mind  --  a ghost on this lawn , just as Jack is at home . Avery was observing in flattering accents , You 'd make a very charming little French marquise yourself , you know . A blonde cendree  --  they turn the Frenchmen wild . ' She merely smiled , and Avery continued , As for myself , I thank God for modern restraint in haberdashery . ' He patted his waistcoat , which you could n't call concave , though it was n't convex either  --  it was just slightly solid  --  and added : In knee pants and ruffles , I 'd look like the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  the choleric dotard whose young wife or mistress carries on behind a mask with a terrified adolescent  --  a beardless boy , who 's sung , invariably , by a fat-legged girl . ' Cicily laughed , and Avery said , Let me take that coffee-cup . Will you have chartreuse or a dash of cognac ? '  |p130Chartreuse  , ' said Cicily . Avery , it occurred to her , did himself very well . The dinner had been faultless . When he did entertain he took trouble about it . For him a party was merely an extension , pictorial and pleasant , of the general decor . She stood on the terrace looking about her , until he came back with two tiny glasses , filled to the brim with pale yellow liquid , and said , How about drinking these down on the parapet ? From there , on a night like this when they 're swimming in moonlight , the fields have almost the space of the sea . ' She thought , he 's really sensitive to beauty . Natural beauty . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one row of plane trees . The other guests had scattered , sprinkling the lawn . Some were seated on the terrace , where glass-globed candles still flickered on the dining-tables . A few had returned to experiment with the swings . Avery said , It 's going all right , do n't you think ? I mean , they 're enjoying themselves ? ' His tone was anxious and she thought , He misses a woman when he gives a party . He misses Maisie who , for all her faults , was always a hostess who kept her guests in mind . She said , Of course they are . Why would n't they be ? This place is divine . We do n't see it often enough . ' He sighed . A party is a lot of trouble . ' She laughed . Are you telling a woman ? ' I suppose I was . One should n't , should one ? But women take trouble more easily than men . ' That kind , perhaps . ' All kinds , I think . ' Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He looked at her gravely over the two small glasses he wasp131carefully carrying . That has n't , ' he said , been my experience with women . ' Maisie , again . She was devil-may-care , if anyone ever was . But Cicily 's eyes had grown a trifle vague . She kept glancing through the tree-trunks , as she passed them , at the guests in the open . She could recognize them clearly in the light of the moon . Uncle Fred Sewall , his young wife and Sally , Billy Winter and Belle -- By this time they had emerged from the alley under the plane trees  --  dappled with silver , but comparatively dusky  --  into the full glow of moonlight at the end of the lawn . Avery led her to the parapet , dotted , she observed , with cushions that were waiting for guests to come and sit on them . Watch out for the dew , ' he said , with quick concern . They 're not wet . ' She sat down in a corner that was shaded by the cedars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her gaze wandered vaguely over the yellow fields . The ripe hay stretched from the base of the parapet to the scarf of mist that hung over the Skokie . Far down in the lowlands one heavy elm drooped , its pendent boughs motionless , its trunk veiled in vapour , its wineglass outline clear against the sky . Crickets were chirping . A katydid crackled . Six weeks to frost Here 's your liqueur , my dear , ' said Avery gently , his voice atune with the tranquillity of the scene . She raised it to her lips , savouring the syrup and feeling the fire of the sip of chartreuse . And , why do I worry ? she thought helplessly . This is very pleasant . I should be more like Maisie . But even as she thought it , her eyes returned questingly to the wide stretch of lawn . Some swings were in action now , swaying and swooping . A little group of people were clustered around the sundial , trying to read its statement , falsified by the moon . Belle was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned quickly in the direction of the swings . A man and a woman had just stepped from the darkness under the plane trees to take possession of the nearest . She averted her glance , for her quest was ended . She had recognized Albert  --  and Gertrude 's black gown . Avery was saying , his voice still subdued , Do you see what I meant ? The fields are like water . ' She forced her gaze toward them . Yes . The space  --  and the emptiness . ' But nothing was as empty , at that moment , as her heart . She heard Gertrude 's low laugh and turned again to look at her . She was standing now , balanced , on the seat of the swing . Her thin arms were raised , her hands clutching the ropes , her face and her neck blanched white by the moon . Albert was standing on the grass in front of her , his features in shadow . Come on . Jump up . ' So she was commanding him , her tone very peremptory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance over his shoulder , as if faintly preoccupied by a quest of his own . But he did not see her , half-hidden by the cedars . Then he seized the ropes and stepped up , facing Gertrude , on the seat of the swing . His uncertain balance shook her taut equilibrium . His own was precarious . The swing wobbled slightly and threw them together . Then Gertrude recovered her poise and her posture . Come on . Put your back into it . Let 's get it started . ' Her voice rang out gaily . You must have done this when you were a child . ' His reply was inaudible . Albert  --  you fool ! ' Her husky words carried . Her slim body swayed from the ropes by an arm 's length . Thenp ' 33her elbows bent and the swing moved feebly . He gave it a start , with one foot on the ground . Their bodies moved rhythmically , bending and straightening , and soon they were swooping , rising and falling in the arc of the swing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as his dark head brushed the lowest leaves of the plane tree . Her black skirt fluttered like a pirate 's flag . Avery said cheerfully , Gert looks like a bat out of hell , ' and chuckled . Cicily deliberately looked up at the moon . Still stained that queer gold by the haze at the zenith , there it was shining , foolish and full , companionless in the sky . A Mandarin moon . Its sealed yellow face made her think of a Chinaman and , just for an instant , she remembered Audrey Diston . She heard the chorus of crickets mechanically chirping , their comment as indifferent as the stare of the lunar observer . But , absorbed in her thoughts , she did not notice Avery , who was looking at her sharply , his lips pursed gravely for a silent whistle . She was quite unaware that the pause was lengthening . Then he folded his arms and broke it by observing with quiet intent , Do n't take it so hard . ' She started perceptibly . Take what hard ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of her surprise . She regretted it instantly . But he merely said tactfully , Whatever you 're taking . ' I 'm not taking anything . ' Her tone was indignant . I think you are . In fact , I know it . ' Her eyes met his in a glacial stare . You 're taking it on the chin , ' he sighed . Well  --  we all have . to , sometime . ' She said , very coolly , I do n't know what you mean . '  |p134After  an instant , Have it your own way , my dear , ' he murmured acquiescently . In the know where you got such an absurd idea , ' she observed resentfully . What idea did I get ? ' he asked , in mock innocence . Too late , she was conscious that she had made an admission . He did not , however , press home his advantage . Will you have a cigarette ? ' He offered his case and struck a spark from his lighter . She bent her head to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , Cicily . I ca n't quite define you . ' Must I have a definition ? ' The cigarette helped her to take it all lightly . He ignored the interruption . You seem so shocked and somehow  --  unarmed . As if you 'd never been hurt before . Bewildered and girlish , in spite of your experience . I can hardly believe that you 've been the wife of two men and the mother of four children . ' She was thinking , in alarm  --  why , he must n't talk like this ! I hardly know him . And meanwhile , he was saying in a tone so detached that it seemed quite impersonal : Some women , of course , are emotionallyincapable of learning by experience . They remain cool and virginal to the very end . I 'd think you were merely one of those untouchables  --  and therefore uninteresting in spite of your prettiness  --  if I did n't see so clearly that you 're suffering like hell . It does n't do to suffer , you know . There 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tremulous silence , shaken by its content . His taste was at fault , but it seemed very clear to her that his motives were sincere . He wanted to help her  --  though she could n't think why  --  and deserved a rejoinder that wasp135frank and friendly . But what rejoinder ? When she was quite sure that her voice would be steady , she said , I do n't need arms , Avery . ' It sounded too intimate . He lit his own cigarette with some deliberation , then snapped shut the lighter . Cicily , ' he said , as soon as he 'd puffed at it , I have you defined . You 're a pacifist , flung into the battle of the sexes , and pacifists are pathetic when war is declared . Nonresistancewo n't do . It never does , my dear girl . Marauders are at large . If you want to keep what you have ' The tone ofhis voice , for an instant , was questioning  --  You 'll have to fightfor it . And even if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should advise a certain sly cynicism as an armour for spent bullets . Moreover , you 'll find that cynicism will amuse you  --  you 'll pride yourself on it  --  and amusement , after all , gives us something to live for . If you can be really amused , you 'll live pretty well . ' But I never could be . ' She had to protest against this false philosophy . I said you were girlish . You 've never grown up , in spite of all that has happened to you . That sort of amusement is an adult entertainment . ' I think it 's rather childish to pride yourself on cynicism , ' said Cicily tartly . Perhaps he accepted this as a final answer , for he said no more , but sat smoking in silence , his face in the shadow , his back to the moon . Presently he laughed and said , half-pityingly , There 's another suffering soul . ' f Icr glance followed his and she saw Baines Sewall , standing near the plane trees , staring up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p136As  she looked , Baines called curtly , Gert  --  come down off that swing ! ' He 's tight , ' muttered Avery , with a host 's resignation . I hope he wo n't make a scene . ' Why should I ? ' Gertrude 's voice floated down on a dreamy inflection , as if she were bemused by the swing 's rhythmic motion . Cicily could feel it as she sat on the parapet , and feel Albert 's nearness as Gertrude must feel it , a vicarious vibration in her very vitals , as the motion of a ship can be felt on dry land by one too susceptible to the action of the sea . He sometimes does , you know , ' Avery was continuing in a confidential undertone . He never got over her . He 's utterly demoralized and she plays him for a fool . I think , to do her justice , she has a lingering attachment for him . The strong for the weak , perhaps . Or maybe it 's just physical . ' You damn well will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were torn from him by some inner anguish . He started forward , to seize the swing 's ropes . Avery jumped to his feet . That you , Baines ? Come here . ' Baines turned arrested , a trifle unsteady . Avery walked forward and took him by the arm . I agree with you , old man . Those swings are played out . Gertrude ' Yes , ' she answered vaguely , still swinging , but more slowly , apparently unperturbed by Baines 's violent interjection . I need your advice . I 'm feeling my responsibilities in a big way . What would you think of a game of Blind Man 's Buff ? ' Marvellous ! ' cried Gertrude . And so in the picture . ' It had caught her fancy . Stop swinging , Albert . Let the old cat die ! ' That childish idiom , on the lips of Gertrude , seemed a sacrilege , thought Cicily venomously . Avery was speaking . Come help me organize it . You too ,  |p137Baines  . I 've a clean handkerchief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert stepped from the swing and helped Gertrude to descend from it . She slipped her arm through Avery 's and started across the lawn . Baines stumbled after them . Then Albert saw Cicily , alone on the parapet . He joined her immediately . Good party , is n't it ? ' He stood smiling down at her . Oh , I 'm loving it . ' But from her terse accent the contrary was plain . After an instant , he asked punctiliously , Would you like to swing ? ' No , thank you . ' He stood weighing her inflections and drawing his inferences . Then he dropped down on the parapet beside her . Were you sitting here alone , sweet ? ' No . Avery was with me . ' His fingers found her hand . What 's the trouble , dear ? Are you bothered about anything ? ' He knows that it 's safe to ask me such questions , for I never answer them , she thought  --  and wondered if she were being so childish as to enjoy cynicism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't enjoyed yourself . ' She knew that he was and the knowledge exasperated her . The moment of silence that followed was significant . In it , Cicily found herself goaded to utterance and utterance was what , up to now , she had forsworn . Albert , ' she said , her tone cold and critical , has it ever occurred to you that you 're making us conspicuous ? ' His fingers twitched on her hand in surprise . But his voice was guarded . What on earth do you mean ? '  |p138U|p  to this point blind anger had carried her . Now , she felt the need of wisdom . But she could only blurt out miserably , I mean  --  you and Gertrude . ' It was not very wise . He withdrew his hand and looked the very pattern of injured innocence . By simply not speaking he put her in the wrong . She felt the need of support and went on , accusingly , Even Avery noticed , here in the dark , that something was wrong and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , I should say it was you who were making us conspicuous . ' The comment dropped dryly . Oh , Albert  --  how can you ? ' she protested passionately . The passion may have moved him , for he took her hand again . I ca n't stand it , ' she said . It 's badly on my nerves . She never , for an instant , lets you alone . And you  --  you , Albert ' Her voice sank into a despairing silence . After a moment , he slipped nearer on the parapet and said , very gently , Cicily , sweet , do n't be like other women . You never have been . Please , please , do n't spoil What ? ' she asked , as he paused . Your lovely equanimity . ' She was not appeased by this grave compliment . But he was continuing : Darling , we live in a complicated world and we 're going to live in it for a long time together . We must n't allow ourselves to be destroyed by complications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could remind him that he could avoid Gertrude , he was going on , more confidently : But there 's nothing complex about our relation to each other . That 's as simple as it ever was and grows stronger with time . ' She gazed at him doubtfully , not ready to deny this . He smiled into her eyes . I 'm not wrong about that , am I ? '  |p139You  're not wrong about that , ' said Cicily slowly . The distinction she had drawn by her barely perceptible emphasis was not lost on her husband . The other things you 're wrong about . I mean , they do n't matter . They 're not important to me and they should n't be to you . ' Then why do you do them ? ' asked Cicily bluntly . Those fine eyebrows of his knitted slightly in irritation , directed at circumstance as much as at her . Oh , God  --  I do n't know . There 's so much that 's dreary in life . Too little amusement . Perhaps I 'm easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained . ' It was her turn to sound that dry accent . He laughed , good-naturedly . Touche , my dear ! ' Having made t he admission , he went on to justify it . I am entertained by women . I always have been . But , sweet , is it so serious ? Why should n't we pick up a little fun where we find it , as long as we relate it , in its proper proportion , to the things that do matter ? It 's so insignificant that it has no bearing on them . It 's on another plane . ' She was struck by his frankness , his childish irresponsibility , and his obvious sincerity . But she detected a fallacy in the thread of his argument . It 's a question of what you think of as fun , Albert . ' ' , Just what do you mean ? ' I mean , if you loved me  --  if I satisfied you fully  --  she would n't entertain you . ' He broke in impetuously , I do love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ' This declaration , in its simplicity , touched her . She found hersclf smiling . Then why do n't you behave ? You know  --  you might lose me. '  |p140Incorrigible  romanticist ! I 'd go to the dogs . ' He 'd go to the bitches , she could n't help thinking , with a flash of amusement at this play upon words . Then she was horrified at her own callousness and sighed , indulgently , I ca n't see myself how you 'd get along . ' Then , am I forgiven ? ' His arm slipped around her . Oh , dear  --  I suppose so . ' But her body was rigid in his tender embrace . If you 'll try to remember that it  --  it does destroy me when you  --  . you His lips were seeking hers . See here  --  really kiss me . ' She complied , at first reluctantly , then with increasing ardour , feeling slightly ashamed of herself because he could awaken her senses so easily . Well , what have we here ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very Iast witness whom Cicily would have chosen for the scene on the parapet . Ca n't I kiss my own wife ? ' Albert 's inflection was bracingly humorous . But he did n't know what Avery was thinking . Cicily did , and was uncomfortably conscious of a bond between herself and this man she knew so slightly , of which her husband was ignorant . Did a gun go off ? ' asked Avery ironically , smiling down at Cicily . What are you talking about ? There was no gun , ' said Albert , amazed . Cicily had risen and Avery 's next words fell on her ear in an intimate murmur . A first shot , fired in a campaign of conquest ? ' Albert might not have heard them . She frowned slightly , hoping Avery would accept the twitch of her eyebrows as the rebuke she intended , and stood withoutp141speaking , looking up the lawn . The game of Blind Man 's Buff was progressing in the moonlight , Belle blindfolded now , dim figures running . Still pond , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another childish idiom . The figures stood arrested , turned to statues on the grass . Belle moved , arms outstretched , groping blindly for a capture . Let 's play , ' said Cicily , slipping her arm through Albert 's in a conjugal gesture , deliberately designed to put Avery in his place . Between the two men , she strolled to join the players . Avery 's intervention had irritated her extremely , but it had set her thinking . I had no gun , she realized . I never even thought of one . What I said was unpremeditated , utterly sincere . Albert was the protagonist of the little scene of tenderness that Avery had interrupted . Was he armed , she wondered , with any ulterior motive ? She had an inner conviction of the truth of his statement that he loved her and needed her . But it had remained unenforced by any rash promises as to his future conduct . If he had used weapons to accomplish her surrender , they had been concealed.  |p142IT  WAS four o'clock in the afternoon of Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cicily was resting in her bedroom  --  if you could call it rest , ' with four lively children clustered about her chaise-longue  --  in preparation for the party that he was having that evening . It was to be a cobweb party and the twenty-five members of the Fifth Grade of the Lakewood Progressive School were coming to it . The house was twined with parti-coloured strings . Cicily and John and Sis and Robin , with Bertie underfoot , had twisted them all , upstairs and downstairs , around furniture and banisters and doorknobs and electric-light fixtures , in the complicated tangle that represented the spider web , and at the end of each string , in the rafters of the attic , they had tied a little prize . Four other prizes  --  first , second , third , and booby '  --  were wrapped in tissue paper on Cicily 's bureau . Vesta , in the kitchen , was cutting up chicken for creaming . The birthday cake was frosted and the ice cream had come from the caterer 's in the village and the grapejuice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  thank goodness !  --  would n't come for two hours . Cicily , on her chaise-longue , was resignedly girding herself for impending pandemonium . Children 's parties were fun , but they were also exhausting . She hoped they would n't break much ,  |p143unwinding  strings . All portable treasures were put safely away on high closet shelves , but of course there were lampshades and electric-light bulbs and chair legsShe would really have liked to have an hour alone , but that was a luxury she could seldom command . Wherever she was , in her small , crowded house , the children , when idle , were apt to gather around her . This habit fatigued but secretly flattered her . If Albert had been home , he would have been with them , for he gravitated naturally toward a room full of people and he always assumed , like a child , that he was wanted . And he was , so Cicily dutifully noted . But he was in town and would come out , as usual , on the five-fifty , arriving with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting cross-legged on her mother 's bed  --  mussing only slightly the blue taffeta counterpane  --  a crochet hook in hand and her lap full of yarn . She was making herself a scarlet scarf and skating cap . John was idly reclining on his lower lumbar vertebrae in the wing chair by the fire . He sprawled so , lately , Cicily reflected , suppressing vocal criticism . His long , lazy legs were stretched across the hearthrug and Bertie , as he played , stumbled over them continually . John liked to trip him up , very amiably , for fun . Cicily was enured to fifteen-year-old humour in all its manifestations , but she did hope Bertie would n't fall in the fire . Robin , the birthday boy , was lying on the floor at the foot of the chaise-longue , playing with the steam engine that his father had sent him . The rest of the room was twined with string cobwebs . The steam engine was intricate , an accurate little model Standing eighteen inches high , much more than a toy , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most convincingly in its ten-inch boiler , with a chugging of pistons and a hiss of escaping vapour and a small steam whistle which shrilled an alarm . With it had come an affectionate letter , explaining its mechanism , describing the uses to which steam was converted in the engine rooms of commerce , and ending , Now you 're ten years old , Robin , and you children have had a year in which to take root in Lakewood again , your mother must plan to let you come out West to visit me sometime . You could ride a lot , and I 'm sure you 'd like the mountains , inside and out . I 'd take you down in the mines . ' Both engine and letter had thrilled their recipient . John , and Sis , too , had instantly warmed to the thought of a trip to Denver . They were talking of it now . We could go , could n't we , Mother ? Could we go alone ? Could we go in the Christmas holidays ? ' Cicily looked at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its small siren shrieked the quick fright in her heart . But she answered composedly : You could n't possibly go , dears , except at a time when your father explicitly invites you . When he 's in Denver he lives in a boarding-house and has dinner at his club . He travels a great deal , to confer with other engineers and visit different mining camps . It might be very inconvenient to have three children descend on him . ' He says he 'd like to have us , ' Robin pointed out . Yes , dear . But ' Here Cicily permitted herself a maternallapse from logic in the thread of her argument : Denver 's very far away and the trip would be expensive . There 'd hardly be time , at Christmas , to make it worth while . Next summer , perhaps ' She hardly knew why she was making all these objections  --  though they were valid enough . Something beyond reason accounted for her fright . A sharp , instinctive jealousy of which she was heartily ashamed , for she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know his boys while they were still boyish . Sis , too , before she changed from a child into what she was changing so rapidly that her mother could scarcely credit it . Sis was growing taller and a great deal prettier . Her clear brown eyes looked larger and were sometimes somewhat shy . Her sturdy young body was rounding , developing , small touching breasts showing beneath her plain sweaters . John teased her unmercifully about young Sam MacLeod and her equable temper was ruffled when he did it . Could I go , too ? ' asked Bertie . The question startled Cicily . I 'm afraid you could n't , darling . ' Why ? ' Do n't be silly . You do n't belong to Daddy , ' said Robin unfeelingly . He did not , however , intend to be unkind . Would n't he want me ' cause I do n't ? ' Bertie looked rather more curious than discouraged . He had had no experience in not being wanted . Cicily deftly avoided the issue . Precious , you 're too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin sighed wistfully , Gee , I 'd like to see a mine . ' His tone changed abruptly . Hey ! Leave that safety valve alone , Bertie ! ' For Bertie , too was fascinated by the steam engine . No one paid any attention to the scuffle that ensued on the hearthrug . Such scuffles were familiar since Bertie had grown old enough to meddle with Robin 's toys . John said slowly , I 'd like to go out there , because --  ' and stopped . Why ? ' asked Sis interestedly , over her crochet hook . I mean , why in particular ? ' Cicily waited for her eldest son 's answer . He threw a quick glance at her as if , with a reason beyond hisp146years , he knew she was concerned in his feeling for his father . Why , because I really do n't know what kind of man he is , ' he explained simply . That often seems funny to me when I remember I 'm his son . ' Often , noted Cicily . The adverb betrayed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquilly , I never thought of that . It is funny , is n't it ? ' There were the twins , revealed in those two statements . Matterof-fancyand matter-of-fact , as Mumsy had commented some thirteen years before . I think he must be great , ' said Robin abstractedly , as he fiddled with his safety valve . Look what he knows about steam engines . Say , Bertie  --  that 's alcohol ! Gee , Mother , he 'll set the place on fire ! ' What was he like , Mummy ? ' asked Sis brightly . She had n't an iota of her twin brother 's sensibility , his instinctive perception of other people 's feelings , but she possessed qualities that were more practically effective . Come here , Mischief , ' she added to her four-year-old half-brother . Come and hold this yarn for me . I want to wind it . ' As Bertie trotted over to her , she repeated her question , What was he like , Mummy ? ' After a moment , Cicily responded , He was very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like . Very like Robin . ' Sis was draping a hank of red worsted on Bertie 's extended arms . What did he like to do ? ' asked John thoughtfully . Do ? ' Taken by surprise , it really seemed to Cicily that , for an instant , she could only remember how little Jack had liked to do the things that he had done . But conscience demanded that she should n't be negative . ' He  --  he liked to play with you children.  |p147He  liked anything mechanical . ' It was , she admitted , an inadequatedescription . He worked in Grandfather 's bank ? ' Sis put the question . Yes . He was a good banker for so young a man . But he did n't like banking . He was n't at all interested in money or investments . And he did n't like cities . ' But you lived out here in Lakewood . ' Well , he did n't like Lakewood . He did n't call it country . He did n't like the parties ' She paused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note in her voice seemed faintly to echo some old irritation . He had a hankering fir outlandish places . He wanted to see and even to work in them . Of course , he always wanted to be an engineer . ' Then , why was n't he ? ' asked John . I mean  --  from the beginning ? ' Cicily hesitated , for it was hard to answer that question to the full satisfaction of fifteen-year-old simplicity . She had an odd sensation of being called to a tribunal by the insistence of her son . She remembered the questions she had put to her mother while planting her spring garden and understood her reluctance to tell a sad story , now ended , best ignored . We were married so young , dear , ' she said finally , that he had n't gone to technical school . He was a Senior at Harvard when war was declared . He went to the officers ' training camp , here at Fort Sheridan , and then to camp at Rockford to train the enlisted rookies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after that and before he came back you and Sis were born . He had to do something , with a wife and two children . At least , we all thought he did . He thought so , too . Your grandmother offered him a job in the bank and I wanted to live here Her voice trailed off lamely , for she was remembering how much Jack had wanted to go back to Cambridge and take a degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and how foolish that had seemed to her  --  a husband , still in school ! John said , I see . ' For an instant she wondered if he did see  --  and blamed her . But that was impossible . She went on briskly : A great many young men were in just his position when they came back from the War . The man who had a job that was waiting for him was luckyIf he liked it , ' said John . Your father did like it for quite a long time . ' Cicily 's tone held a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life here with me . Grandfather gave us this land and we built this house on it and that was exciting . You always have fun in the first house that 's your own . You twins were adorable and then Robin came along ' She stopped , confused by this picture of domestic felicity . She had painted it to illustrate Jack 's extreme good fortune , but it seemed to have some bearing also on her own . And then what happened ? ' asked Sis bluntly . You know , Mummy , dear , you 've never exactly told us . ' Cicily was appalled to find herself blushing . A slow , painful blush that would not be controlled . John stirred in the wing chair and drew in his long legs and looked somewhat embarrassed . Caught by the tension , Robin sat up on the hearthrug and stared at her . Only Bertie was indifferent , preoccupied with a tangle in his hank of red yarn . John spoke first , perhaps to spare her from speaking . His words were accompanied by a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  about your parents . I mean , you ca n't think what they were like when you were little . '  |p149Sis  broke the tension , though she may have been unconscious of it . That 's because you ca n't imagine their ever being young . ' Cicily laughed , gratefully but ruefully . She met her daughter 's fifteen-year-old eyes . Sis , do I seem old to you ? I mean , really old ? ' Sis considered the question detachedly on its merits . Not old like Grandmother  --  or Granny Isabel or Aunt Muriel . ' She went on winding yarn . Thank you , ' said Cicily . Her well-pointed irony was not lost upon John . He protested defensively , Why , I can imagine Mother young . ' That defence did not help matters . John , Cicily reflected with a smile of resignation , had always had what 's known as a lively imagination ! She murmured reproachfully , I 'm thirty-five years old . ' But no one seemed to hear or to care about that , and Sis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' said Cicily , sparring for time . She lay motionless , thinking it was time they were told . If they asked , it was time . John put in awkwardly , Do n't tell us , Mother , if  --  you do n't want to . ' His young , breaking voice , confused with embarrassment , moved Cicily profoundly . The pathos of the young ! She was suddenly submerged in a rush of feeling . Self-pity for her own youth , tenderness , sorrow , and solicitude for her children were all mixed up in it . She said , impulsively , Oh , John  --  I do n't feel like that . I mean , I do want to . ' But of course she did n't , for they would n't understand . Their lack of comprehension , their vulnerable innocence , were precious and provoking . She felt somewhat ashamed . For an instant she wondered if the best guide for conduct was never to do anything beyond the under/standing of children . But that was ridiculous . Moreover , it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on slowly , picking her words with care : Nothing ever happened that you should n't hear about . There 's nothing I could say to you in criticism of your father . I can tell you truly that he was always good and kind . He was better than I was , more faithful , steadier . ' This much justice demanded . Still , she felt heartened by her own magnanimity . She essayed a faint smile . But I somehow stopped loving him . That , I really ca n't explain to you . Love ' She paused helplessly , floored by the word , meetingthe stare of their intent young eyes . Well , it 's a mystery , ' she went on tritely . It comes and it goes . You ca n't make yourself love anyone  --  or keep yourself from it . I always  --  through it all  --  liked your father tremendously . I respected and admired him . ' How ridiculous words were ! How inadequate , how cold . Liked Jack ? She 'd loved him  --  though not as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not enough , ' she heard herself saying , and because it is n't , you become nervously irritated . I was senselessly irritated by so many little things . And then , I was lonely and very unhappy . For love is  --  it can be  --  the most beautiful companionship . When it leaves you , you find you are very much alone . I was twenty-eight years old and I could n't quite face a long life of loneliness  --  a life that was loveless . ' Then she pulled herself up and thought , Oh , how mawkish ! I must n't sentimentalize and play on their sympathies . And it was n't like that  --  so sweet and so grave . It was terribly tedious . She added abruptly , I was very bored . ' That startled the children . All three of them betrayed it . Robin fairly blinked , Sis 's eyes widened , and John stopped looking at her , turning toward the fire . She thought , That was a mistake . They ca n't face realism.  |p151They  're young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient with youth and romanticism , estranged from it by experience , convinced that the tonic of truth should be salutary , and yet she was conscience-stricken because she had shocked them . Her voice hardened slightly as she went on with the story , but the hardness was due to no more than self-consciousness which , do what she would , she could not control . Then your Uncle Albert came back from Europe . ' This twist of the plot must be delicately handled . Of course he was married to your Aunt Belle . They had n't been happy and he  --  he fell in love with me . ' So she put it quite bluntly . I 'm afraid , at your age , you 'll find that hard to understand . You 'll have to take my word for it and also for the fact that when I knew  --  when he told me '  --  here her voice dropped and faltered  --  it changed the whole world for me . ' No one said anything and she glanced at John , nervously . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the sense of ' the tribunal closed around her again . Darling children , ' she said , her voice still trembling , this you must understand . Love commands respect , wherever it exists ; in itself it is beautiful and it 's wrong to deny it . ' That was the creed , impressed on her by Albert , on which she had acted . But thinking of Albert , she added as an afterthought , When it 's real love , that ' and realized instantly that her appeal had been weakened byqualification and wished that she had omitted it . Sis lookedmcwhat puzzled . Robin 's blank countenance betrayed frankwilderment . John was still staring down at the fire . Not raising his eyes , What did Daddy do ? ' he asked . Again she was conscious of that quick thrust of jealousy because father was the object of his first solicitude . He was really remarkable . ' So the jealousy was atoned for . Very kind , very steady . He thought only of me . ' A grim phrase of Avery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chin , ' and remained unspoken . And  --  later ? ' asked John . She drew a long breath . They were out of the woods now . Oh , later , ' she said with swift , forced vivacity , his life was really simplified . He became an engineer . He studied at Tech and did very well there , and then he took jobs in those outlandish places  --  Mexico  --  South America  --  and settled in Denver . He 's had quite a career . ' Sis said , So it really came out all right ? I mean , for everyone ? ' Mentally , if not bodily , Sis was still a child . She could look half grown-up , demure and provocative , when young Sam MacLeod 's eyes were lit with admiration , but she had no comprehension of the adult world . Oh , yes , dear , ' said Cicily . When they thought as a child , you spoke as a child . So she paraphrased Scripture . Sis had finished winding her ball of red yarn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with finality , as if her mother had been reading a story aloud . A story that was ended . Then she glanced at the clock . Why , it 's half-past four . ' Cicily 's thoughts were recalled to the party , which , in spite of the spider web twined in her bedroom , she had completely forgotten . We ought to begin bathing . ' There was only one bathroom for the use of the four children . Yes . You should , Sis . ' Cicily 's response was automatic , unthinking . The pressure of domesticity was exerting itself subconsciously . Sis never minded the practical chores . She jumped off the bed . Come along , Mouse , ' she said to her half-brother . This was thep153pet name her mother had instituted . You can have the first bath . ' Robin picked up his steam engine with care . As he blew out its lamp , John slowly unlimbered himself from the wing chair and stood by the chaise-longue , looking down at his mother . When the others had gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean , long-legged , loose jointed , tousled and clumsy , he looked younger than Sis  --  as boys do look younger than girls the same age  --  unless you observed the expression in his eyes . Always reflective , they were troubled now , clouded . John , ' said Cicily gently , do n't take this too hard . ' ' I 'm not taking it hard . ' He denied the weakness . ' I do n't wonder you do . ' She ignored the denial . But you must believe me . Love 's the one real right thing in a very wrong world . The simple , stark fact that I went through so much  --  that I thought I was justified , though so many people suffered  --  should impress you and convince you that it has an importance But his hand slipped from hers and went into his pocket . ' Oh , yes , ' he said listlessly , ' I guess it 's important . ' John , dear , what 's bothering you ? ' She could see he was shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he paused . ' What , darling ? ' she urged . ' Did n't Daddy love you ? ' He blurted it out , avoiding her eyes . She was taken aback . Yes . He did , ' she admitted . ' Well , then  --  I do n't see how you ever decided which love was most important . When two loves conflict , is it just a free-forall ? Does God protect the right and the best man win ? And who it the best man ? There ought to be ring rules  --  traffic laws  --  something ' She felt herself flushing . ' But , John dear , there are . State laws and Church laws . Different laws in each State and every Churchp154with its own . It 's very confusing , but the law that really matters is n't written in a statute book . It 's a scruple in your heart . ' Just what do you mean ? ' I mean love must be mutual . At least , it ought to be . Every decent person feels that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion she had expected him to arrive at . She could only nod , speechlessly . Though it made him unhappy ? ' I think so . For a time . ' But you were happy  --  you and Uncle Albert ? ' God , what a question ! thought Cicily desperately . Impossible to answer it , looking at Jack 's boy . But her silence was an answer . Of course , ' said John slowly , as if this mitigated something , he must have been a  --  a very romantic figure . ' He was , dear , ' said Cicily . And he wanted me , needed me Do you mean Uncle Albert ? ' John glanced at her sharply . Again Cicily nodded . ' Oh  --  I meant Daddy . ' She could only stare at him , utterly amazed . The amazement was so evident that John was aware of it . I think he 's still romantic  --  sort of taking refuge in the consolations of the intellect . Living alone and working so hard . And when he gave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word abashed him , by its unwonted splendour , but he backed it up staunchly . Nobility is romantic . I 'd like to see him , Mother . I 'd like to know him . ' Chilled , she spoke stiffly and was helplessly aware of it . I 'm sure it can be arranged . ' He noticed the stiffness and added , apologetically : It is n't ,  |p155of  course , that I do n't like Uncle Albert . He 's always been jolly with Sis and Robin and me . He 's gay and good-natured and he 's sweet with you , Mother . From your point of view , I can see it was worth while . ' This tolerant observation was utterly intolerable . She thought , very miserably , He thinks I was selfish and frivolous and wrong . And while she was thinking it , he continued imperturbably , At least , if you 're sure that this love will last . ' She longed to correct this precocious disenchantment . John , ' she interrupted him , you must n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so trivially . You must always remember that I staked my life on it . ' He stood looking down at her , unmoved by her words . Then he tossed off casually : I really do n't see why . You know what you said  --  love comes and it goes . If you believe that , I should think you would feel that there could always be another love . ' With that , he turned away from her and walked out of the door . Those shocking words continued to echo soundlessly in thesilence of Cicily 's bedroom . Their bitterness distressed her much more than the rebuke that they had consciously implied . Shewas thoroughly convinced that the rebuke was conscious and thather sense of the tribunal had not been imaginary . She had presentedher case and had been judged by her child . Judged andand wanting . But keenly as she felt his immature intolerance , was not as disquieting as his prodigious disillusion . And I onced to Mumsy , she thought in self-abasement , that there was anAwful lot of nonsense preached about the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglecting them , if they werep156loved and cared for , that they would be impervious to spiritual bruises . It seemed really incredible that this had been developing  --  John slowly maturing to that moment of cynicism  --  under her unseeing eyes . Sis was a comfort , with her unquestioning serenity . She would always live in a factual world . She would grow up , undoubtedly , into one of those women  --  so blessedly fortunate !  --  who never were worried by what they could n't control . Robin was too young to take it all in  --  still looking on his father as nothing more disturbingthan a delver in mines and a donor of steam engines  --  but Cicily was glad that he had heard the whole story . For if there was anything in modern psychiatry , it must have sunk deep in the depths of his subconscious and perhaps it would save him from a complex like John 's . Or perhaps it would n't ; for really , when she thought of it , Cicily could n't recall that she had ever heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Bertie  --  ah , Bertie , the child of her last love  --  was happily infantile . He presented no problem of immediate emergency . But then she remembered that , according to the tenets of the best psychiatrists , you were born with your subconscious  --  conceived with it , probably . So Bertie might live to present one in time . Her maternal security was startlingly shaken , her children recalled to her anxious attention . For several months she 'd not had them much in mind . She had worked for them , planned for them , lived under the same roof with them , but they had not been the objects of her inner concentration . She had taken their welfare , their happiness , for granted . She must question it now . She thought for some moments , with increasing bewilderment , of all she had said to them and of how they had listened to it and of what she had done . What she had done was a very old story , butp151it had taken on freshness and colour and poignancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She was not ashamed of it and yet she felt shamed by her eldest son 's censure , debased by his scorn . She could not quite analyze this sense of debasement , so oddly combined with a conviction of rectitude , and she felt it was unworthy of some higher enlightenment . The enlightenment , also , escaped critical analysis , but she should have succeeded in enlightening John . What had gone wrong ? She had been honest and candid and fair about Jack Too fair , perhaps . Was that where the trouble was ? Should she have presentedherself as a heroine , the miserable victim of an unhappy marriage , the Beauty with the Beast , the Maiden with the Minotaur ? But how perfectly ridiculous ! It was not like that at all . Tout comprendre , c'est tout pardonner '  --  she had always believed and quoted that proverb . If you could explain , your critics would be disarmed . For the first time she doubted it . What you explained was the thing that was significant . It might , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentalist would pardon out of hand . Yet John was a sentimentalist . That was really the difficulty . The romance of defeat , lost causes , unknown soldiers  --  that sort of thing appealed to him . Of course , it was his age . He ought to Sec Jack . He was right about that , she thought abruptly . I 'm lure Jack would help me . The thought was a strange one , but essentially sound . For unknown soldiers might be better unknown . She could not suppress the sardonic reflection , though she was ashamed of it : Jack would help her unconsciously because he was so thoroughly en unromantic figure that not even John , when once he was familiar with him , could clothe him with romance . And he would help her consciously because he was a dear . Because he was in ap158position  --  as events had proved she was n't  --  to explain gracefully , to put her case sympathetically , so John would not be alienated . He would do that , she was sure . I must write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and ask his advice . Of course Albert wo n't mind . Albert would n't mind any of it . Of that she was convinced . Albert 's reactions would be simple and sane . Why , the poor little cuss , ' he would say , very kindly . And then he might take John off on some spree . To the theatre , perhaps , in a good thirdrowseat , or out to the studio to watch the making of a movie . In a week he 'd have forgotten it and , if she referred to it , he 'd urge reassuringly , My dear , it was a molehill . Do n't make it a mountain . ' And if she would let him , he 'd forget it again . Nevertheless , it would cheer her to talk with him . And John would be better  --  much better  --  for the spree . He 'd said  --  he 'd admitted  --  that Albert was jolly . ' Jolliness was incompatible with the apprehensive temperament . Albert would n't take seriously the budding neuroses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he would n't believe . He 'd say , He 'll get over it . Boys of fifteen are always difficult . ' And , moreover , this casual touch would be affectionate . It would not arise from step-paternal indifference . If Bertie were in question , he would be no more concerned . The casual touch was a gift Cicily envied . She fretted too much about too many things . With Albert it was natural , springing , she felt , from his native high spirits and his unaffected optimism , and it saved him a great deal of unnecessary care . And yet he could be tender and intimate and kind . These last three months he had been everything delightful ; considerate , confidential  --  confidential to the point of laughing shamelessly with Cicily over his former flirtation with Gertrude . Since that evening at Avery 's ,  |p159back  in mid-August , he had played the role of a decorous husband on all public occasions . And there had n't been private ones . Of that Cicily was sure . She was sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she secretly admitted she had somewhat lost faith  --  as because of Gertrude 's bewilderment . It was perfectly obvious that his sudden change of tactics had left that lady confused . Her confusionwas natural , so Cicily had told Albert , light-heartedly generous in her hour of triumph . She had said to him exultantly , You see , your retreat was beaten so fast . ' Why would n't I beat it as quickly as possible , after the way that you ragged me ? ' he had asked her humorously . What an idiot I was not to rag you much sooner ! ' she had retorted , with a smile . She had thought , as she spoke , of the Honourable Mrs. Diston and wondered if Albert had caught the veiled reference to his former indiscretions or thought that she merely alluded to Gertrude . She did not much care . Her heart was at peace , for she had learned that sharp rebuke was the method by which to manage him and had ceased to feel humiliated by the necessity for management . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio , pleasing Ed Brown by his executive zeal . He had explained to Gertrude that he was too busy to ride over the week-ends , but when the hunts had begun in the middle of September , she had reiterated her offer of a mount , quite carelessly , indifferently , and he had accepted it , riding to the hounds three mornings a week on her mettlesome Ginger , rising at six in the morning to do so . Cicily had raised , indeed felt , no objection . Those community gallops over acres of farmland , organized by commuters with sporting proclivities , presented no opportunities for unobserved dalliance . They were hurried and genuine and very well attended by serious Nimrods , many of them accompanied by hard-riding wives.  |p160When  hunt breakfasts followed them at the Country Club , Albert always urged Cicily to make the effort to come to them . She quite often did , bringing with her his business clothes so he could change for the train . She thought now , with a sigh and a glance at the clock  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that at least it was providential that her anxiety over Gertrude had mercifully subsided before she was harassed by this worry about John . She could give the boy , happily , her considered attention . Too bad that this night , of all nights , the Fifth-Graders were coming . John might be miserable , moody , and conscience-stricken , regretting his outburst , and she could only ignore him until the children were gone . Perhaps , if she hurried , she could have just a word with him , loving , forgiving , before the first child appeared on the doorstep . At that very moment the doorbell rang . It could n't be the children at five in the afternoon and it could n't be Albert , for he had a latchkey and he would n't be home for nearly an hour . She jumped from her chaise-longue in her blue padded wrapper and ran to the staircase and looked down through its string cobwebs to whisper to Vesta , as she came out of the pantry , in the tense , desperate undertone of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood motionless for a moment , waiting to listen and hear who might be calling . Of course it might be Mumsy and she rather hoped it was n't , for Mumsy would notice at once that she was troubled and she did not want to tell her this thing about John . Vesta opened the door . Is Mr. Lancaster home ? ' A woman 's voice , low-pitched and nervous . Vesta 's manners still lacked the high polish of fashion . No , ' she said stolidly.  |p161'Then  , ' sighed the voice , on a faint , relieved accent , can I see Mrs. Lancaster ? ' ' She 's out , ' said Vesta , who had points as a liar . ' Out ? ' the voice echoed , as if it were a calamity . ' Oh , when will she be home ? ' ' Could n't say . ' Vesta 's tone was that of finality . ' Oh , dear ! May I wait for her ? Here in the hall ? ' It might be some agent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , self-deprecating and nervous , that was vaguely familiar . But Cicily could n't place it . Vesta said stonily , ' We do n't allow that . ' By this time curiosity had the better of Cicily . With the utmost discretion she peeked farther through the cobwebs . By bending over the banisters she could see the front door . There was Vesta 's black back , neatly bisected by white apron strings , and facing her a woman whose dowdy appearance explained Vesta 's rudeness . Maids were often such snobs . But  --  why , it was Miss Sadie ! Why should Albert 's secretary appear at her door ? ' Miss Sadie ? ' she called , and wondered what had happened . Vesta turned , crestfallen , to stare at her reproachfully . Miss Sadie pushed by her and was confronted by string cobwebs. ut she did not seem to notice them . She ran to the foot of theStairs . ' Oh , Mrs. Lancaster  --  you are there , are n't you ? ' she gasped , very thankfully , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Cicily 's voice was steady , but perhaps a trifle high . ' Oh , no !  --  Oh , no !  --  Oh , mercy , no , ' said Miss Sadie , redundantly . But she added urgently , ' Shall I come up , or will you me down ? ' ' Come up , please , ' said Cicily . Her breathless thought was  --   | something must have happened and she 's going to break it to me . But why had n't they telephoned ? Miss Sadie stumbled . Oh  --  mind the strings . ' They would have telephoned , she tried to convinceherself . We 're giving a children 's party , ' she explained , more composedly . Oh , I know , ' gasped Miss Sadie . By this time she had reached the top of the staircase and she looked very queer . Her dark eyes were popping behind her pince-nez eyeglasses , her grey hair was disordered , her shabby hat was awry . Cicily pulled her wrapper around her , as if girding herself for impending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper , Mr. Lancaster is n't home ? ' No . ' Fear , more specific than her first apprehensions , clutched Cicily 's throat with its icy fingers . Kidnapping , amnesia , some fatal street accident . Was n't he at the office ? ' She could hear her heart knocking . Miss Sadie looked , if anything , a trifle relieved . Oh , yes , indeed . Oh , he 's perfectly all right . ' Come into my bedroom , ' said Cicily . Fear 's fingers were releasingher , but her heart was still pounding . She closed the door behind them and said at once , What 's happened ? ' Miss Sadie stood silent , a figure of fun and a picture of woe , her mouth twitching nervously , her pop-eyes staring . Sit down , ' said Cicily . I ' 11 get you a glass of water . But first please tell me what 's the matter ? ' Nothing . Oh , nothing . It 's just that I hurried so , up from the station . I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might meet Mr. Lancaster . Yes , I will sit down , thank you . I do n't need any water . ' Miss Sadie dropped limply on the chair nearest the door . It was stiff-backed , uncomfortable , the chair Albert hung his coatp163on when he was dressing for dinner . String cobwebs were twined on it . Cicily stood over her in the blue padded wrapper . Miss Sadie said meekly , You must wonder why I 've come . ' A triumph of understatement . ' I do , Miss Sadie . You seem so disturbed . ' ' I am disturbed . I am --  ' With an effort she controlled herhysterical reiteration and looked up at Cicily with piteous eyes . ' Mr. Lancaster 's quite well . He left the office early to get some toys for the party . That 's why I could get out here . I took the four o'clock train . ' ' But why ? ' ' Because Oh , Mrs. Lancaster , because I knew he was introuble . ' ' Trouble ? ' Echoed Cicily . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you look at it that way . ' Fear clutched again . ' What danger ? ' Miss Sadie looked frightened . Her large hands were twisting herworn brown kid gloves . She went on babbling . ' It 's hard to tell u . I do n't know how you 'll take it . I wish I knew you better . ' ' See here , Miss Sadie ' Cicily lost patience . ' Will I have toshake it out of you ? ' ' Oh , no ! ' Miss Sadie shrank back on her chair as if she really thought that Cicily might lay hands on her . ' There 's nothing you ca n't tell me , ' said Cicily , more kindly . Miss Sadie 's strange reluctance seemed to wilt under kindness . Her mouth opened slowly , then shut , then opened . It was , Cicily thought , like a spiritual stutter . Then , ' It 's just that Mr. Doty 's going to sue him for alienation of affection , ' she said brokenly . Her poor old face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For  --  alienation  --  of  --  affec- tion ? ' The words conveyed their meaning . There was no mistakingit . Good God ! ' she added weakly . Then , Who is Mr. Doty ? ' Miss Sadie looked surprised . Why , you must know Mr. Doty , Mrs. Lancaster . He works in the office . A little sandy man . Pale , very thin . You must know Mrs. Doty ' The last twowords were vibrant with contumely . I never heard of her in my life . ' Mrs. Doty ? Mrs. Harold Doty ? Maybe you know her as Ivy . ' Light broke with the name . Suddenly feeling giddy , Cicily sat down on the nearest chair . You mean  --  you mean Miss Wisconsin ? ' She began to laugh foolishly . Miss Sadie nodded . Yes . He 's terribly in love with her . ' The laughter stopped . Who is ? Mr. Lancaster ? ' Oh , dear , no . Mr. Doty . ' Miss Sadie 's tone was scandalized . Cicily began to pull herself together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said coldly , Well , that 's very interesting . Has he lost his mind ? ' Who ? Mr. Doty ? Oh , dear , no , Mrs. Lancaster . His mind  --  his mind is very active . He 's a great noser . ' A what ? ' In her effort to control herself , she had not caught the words . He noses around . And he 's smart , you know . He 's nobody 's fool . That 's why I 'm afraid  --  why I 'm so dreadfully afraid -- Miss Sadie was fumbling blindly with the catch of her leather bag . Her voice was thick with tears . Cicily watched her , her disordered thoughts racing  --  she 's crying  --  she must love him  --  that 's touching  --  it 's absurd . God ! What ought I to do ? Shut her up ? Not listen ? Ask Albert ? That was the way of pride . Of prudence , perhaps . Of confidence ,  |p165certainly  . But she had no confidence , except , oddly enough , in the shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found her handkerchief  --  damp , Cicily noticed . The poor old thing must have cried in the train . She wiped her reddened eyes and said , I 'm just an old fool . But he seems so  --  young to me . And so courageous . ' Has he discussed it with you ? ' She had to ask that . If he had , she must send her away . Oh , no , Mrs. Lancaster ! ' There was no mistaking that accent of candour . He 's never mentioned it . ' Then it might not be true . How did you hear of it ? ' asked Cicily sharply . From Mr. Doty . ' Cicily recoiled . Miss Sadie resumed : Mr. Doty , you see , has been after me to testify . And he said that he 'd taken it up already with Mr. Lancasterand that Mr. Lancaster just told him to  --  to go to hell . That 's what he said he told him , and I , for one , do n't blame him . I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , raising a stench like this in a respectable office . " And he said  --  he said it was just as respectable as a bawdy-house and he 'd throw a stink bomb if necessary to get his rights . He said he 'd lost his wife and he 'd be damned if he would n't get fifty thousand dollars for her . Of course , I think he 'd take less , but that 's what he said , Mrs. Lancaster , though I hate to repeat such wild words . I always thought him so mild-mannered , but you see , he 's always been crazy for Mrs. Doty and it seems she 's walked out on him . He was n't quite responsible . ' Cicily picked the most salient from this torrent of words . To what could you testify ? ' I would n't testify , ' said Miss Sadie promptly.  | But what do you know ? ' I do n't know anything . I 'd take my Bible oath on that , Mrs. Lancaster , and so I told Mr. Doty . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . Making any excuse to get up those stairs . She 'd come up from the studios and knock on his door and pretend that she had some message . I could n't help seeing that was perfectly ridiculous . We have inside office phones . And sometimes , I think  --  though of course I 'm not sure about it  --  that they used to have lunch together . Mr. Doty said they did . Lunch and dinner , he said . And I said , " Mr. Doty , that 's nothing these days . Mr. Lancaster took me to lunch once and I 'd tell any jury . " He just laughed at me . ' You say she " used to , " ' said Cicily thoughtfully . Had shock dulled her , she wondered , that she could talk of it so quietly ? Think straight , listen calmly ? Having heard so much , she ought to hear more . Find out what Doty knew  --  what cards he held . How long has this been going on , Miss Sadie ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of September . And of course , before that , they did a lot of work together on those movies . But that was in the production studio on the West Side . I do n't know what went on there . But Mr. Doty says there 's a wardrobe woman who does . And a couple of stage hands . And Pete  --  he 's kind of old and not very bright , you know ' Who 's Pete ? ' interrupted Cicily . She did not remember . He 's the night watchman . He thinks a lot of Mr. Lancaster , but Mr. Doty got out of him somehow that the came down a few nights to the office and they rehearsed upstairs . With the door closed , Pete said . He says it 's an open-and-shut case  --  Mr. Doty does . He 's going to claim '  --  she paused to remember exactly  --  that Mrs. Doty 's left him because of what went on and that Mr. Lancaster'sattentions to her have embarrassed and humiliated him inp167his social and professional life and injured his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Well , what ? ' asked Cicily . She could not stand much more . You know he is shot to pieces . Mr. Doty is , I mean . Anyone could see that . And I ca n't help thinking that if a jury of  --  of married men  --  and maybe even single ones  --  and certainly of women  --  should see Mr. Doty and Mrs. Doty and Mr. Lancaster side by side in a courtroom , they 'd think it all possible . Mrs. Doty , you know , is one of those platinum blondes  --  myself ; I do n't care for them  --  but she 's got a lovely figure . And Mr. Doty 's very plain . He 's plainer when he talks about it . He gets kind of mottled and his Adam 's apple moves as if he was trying to swallow it and  --  ' With a visible shudder , Cicily rose from her chair . The picture of ' that courtroom had turned her sick and cold . She walked over to the fire , which had fallen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost of the flame . The warmth that rose from the dead embers , palpable yet invisible , really seemed spectral . Presently she asked , Why did you tell me this ? ' her voice dull and listless . Miss Sadie said simply , I hoped you would help him . I could n't . ' Those last two words touched her . But Albert was past help , if he had done this thing . She felt that , sincerely . A vast disgust invadedher  --  and a stagnant inertia . But  --  was it certain ? He might be innocent . She wondered , once more , what Miss Sadie knew . She was speaking again , now earnestly , practically . I do n't believe he understands that Mr. Doty 's dangerous . That he wo n't i.  --  just go to hell . Someone ought to tell him that and prepare him to meet it . He would n't listen to me . At least , I do n't thinkp168he would , though perhaps I 'm just dodging the difficulty of speaking about it . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do it . It would be even harder than coming to you . ' But how could he meet it ? ' Miss Sadie eyed her , for an instant , in silence . When she spoke , it was persuasively . It might be so terrible if it came to a trial . And even if it did n't it would make so much trouble , if  --  if it got around . I do n't know if you understand about the office , Mrs. Lancaster . Mr. Shanks and Mr. Hessler do n't like Mr. Lancaster . He 's been so successful and they 're dreadfully jealous . If they got wind of it , they 'd go straight to Mr. Brown . And he  --  he feels very strongly about this sort of thing . All the office knows that . He fired his best artist once for getting a model in trouble . A married man he was , too , with a wife and three boys . He 'd go straight to the bottom of it , and I do n't think the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I thought perhaps  --  maybe What ? ' asked Cicily , as she paused . That maybe  --  it seems awful  --  but that maybe it would be better to  --  to square Mr. Doty , somehow -- She thinks he 's guilty , thought Cicily . In fact she knows it  --  perhaps without evidence , because she knows him . She said curtly , dispassionately , You were quite right to come to me and I 'll speak to Mr. Lancaster . I 'll try to make him understand . ' And you understand ? ' asked Miss Sadie timidly . I 'm afraid that I do . ' Miss Sadie 's eyes questioned her . I would n't like to think I made it worse by coming You did the right thing . ' And you 'll do  --  ? ' The anxious eyes pleaded with her . Dark brown , humble , slightly bloodshot and too prominent , they made Cicily think of the eyes of a faithful setter.  |p169'I  'll do what I can . ' Miss Sadie stood up , responding obediently to that note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for listening to me so patiently . I can assure you that I hesitated to come . And I hope you 'll remember that , as far as I am concerned , Mr. Lancaster has always been ' Her voice trembled slightly . ' Well , he 's always been considerate and  --  and friendly and kind . If I thoughtI had injured him ' You have n't , Miss Sadie , ' said Cicily wearily . Then the whirr of a motor on the driveway was audible . Both women started . Brakes ground . A door slammed . Miss Sadie sprang to the window . ' Oh , dear ! It 's Mr. Lancaster ! ' Then her voice changed suddenly . Fright left it . It grew tender . ' Oh , Mrs. Lancaster , will you come here and look at him ? ' Cicily stepped to her side . There on the doorstep , paying off the taxi-driver , stood Albert , grinning . His overcoat pockets were full of tin horns , protruding ' *om torn wrappings , and over his head bobbed a buoyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloons , straining ate strings that were knotted in his hand . ' There ! ' said Miss Sadie , in triumph . ' That 's one side of him . ' Cicily heard the children clattering down the stairs . They werelaughing and shouting . She even heard John 's shout . They ust have seen Albert from the nursery window . ' But he must n't find me here . What can I do ? ' Miss Sadie 's umph , short-lived , had been killed by dismay . ' You can slip down the back stairs and out through the pantry . ere 's a door to the dining-porch . I 'll show you the way . ' At the end of the hall , ' Good-bye , Miss Sadie . ' ' Mrs. Lancaster , you 've been lovely . ' That was all there was c for.  |p170Cicily  walked slowly back to her room . Downstairs she could still hear the clatter of the children . Albert 's gay laugh . A tin horn tooting . She thought , I am actually sick to my stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head feels so queer . As if something were tight there that would presently snap . And yet I do n't realize it . I suppose I will , gradually . It seemed strange , at that moment , that her sensations were all physical . She was a wife betrayed . Ah , Albert , she thought  --  anguish surged at his name  --  my lost love , my darling . A dry sob surprised her . Why was he so dear ? And then  --  Miss Wisconsin . And public scandal threatened . And fifty thousand dollars . She was ashamed of that last thought , almost before it came . Feet sounded on the stairs . Albert 's and Bertie 's . In a moment they were standing on the threshold of her room . Why , sweet , ' said Albert , are n't you dressed yet ? ' If she had n't dived into her closet , he would have kissed her . She stood there trembling , afraid that he would follow her , tremendously shaken by the sound of his voice , intimate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somehow , she felt that it ought to have changed . Bertie was blowing short toots on his horn . Albert spoke again , as he moved toward his bureau . The cobweb 's grand . The house looks as if you 'd all been working like nailers . I 've brought a surprise home that will knock your eye out . ' The sense of his deception was a pit at her feet . She stared at him over it , from her closet door . Suddenly she remembered that she 'd thought she 'd learned to manage ' him  --  her triumph over Gertrude . He turned and met her eyes . Why , Cicily , ' he said , what 's the matter ? You look ill . ' The concern in his tone had the ring of sincerity.  |p171He  really cares , thought Cicily . That 's the queer thing about it . He 's double-hearted . I 'm not . I ca n't be . She said briefly , ' I 've had a hard day . ' ' That 's too bad , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' His eyes were lit by a glow of affection . ' Here they come , now . ' fake your time , dressing . I 'll go down and meet them . ' Cicily , too , had heard the ring of the bell . It brought her faint comfort in a sense of postponement . She pulled herself together . The party must be dealt with . She could n't talk to Albert for hours and hours.  |p172FouR  hours later . And then we heard the taxi and looked out of the window and saw you there with the balloons , ' said Cicily wearily . And Miss Sadie was terrified and left by the side door , and you came up with Bertie and of course I could n't ask you  --  I could n't take it up with you  --  not that I wanted to --  ' Her tired voice broke , but it trembled with conviction as she added nervously , Not that I want to , now . ' Albert , for an instant , refrained from any comment . His fine face immobile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's armchair by the living-room fire . Cicily was standing not three feet away from him , one arm on the mantel-shelf , her head bent a little , her gaze on the flames . Throughout her brief recital of Miss Sadie 's revelation she had not once glanced at him , restrained , by some scruple she could not have defined , from watching her husband take the blow as it fell . She was thinking now , miserably , If he 's going to lie I do n't want to watch him . I do n't want to spy on him . But this did not mean that she wished to be deceived . The room was so quiet that the voices of the children , still raised in excitement as they undressed for bed , could be heard upstairs . Twenty minutes before Robin 's last . guests had reluctantly departed . The disorder of the living-room bore witness to their ' 73presence . The fragile French furniture was pushed against the walls . One Louis Quinze side chair , with a walnut leg cracked , had been placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet was strewn with tangled wads of string , some torn paper caps and the wrappings of the prizes . Four shrunken balloons , with their strings still attached to them , hovered in corners , a few inches from the floor . Cicily had sent the children to bed as soon as the front door had closed on the company , ' making an excuse of the lateness of the hour . She had watched them upstairs and then returned to t he living-room , where Albert had reseated himself at the piano  --  he had provided the music for Going to Jerusalem , ' had indeed been , all evening , the life of the party  --  and was playing ' Happy Birthday to You , ' singing the words in his light , mocking tenor , as a final serenade for his ten-year-old stepson . From the threshold she had looked at his innocent figure , sick ' with distaste for the interview before her . Conscious of her presence , ' That leg can be repaired , ' he had volunteered cheerfully , over the lively tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to talk to you . ' The tension in her tone must have caught his attention , for , asthe last chords crashed under his fingers and the children applauded from the hall upstairs , ' What 's up ? ' he had asked brightly , ' winging around on the piano bench . She had walked across the room without answering his question . t was not until he had risen and followed her to the fire and satwn in the armchair with a mystified ' You look like a Sibyl. hat on earth is the matter with you ? ' that she had said tonelessly , ' Miss Sadie came to see me this afternoon . ' ' Miss Sadie ? ' he 'd echoed on a note of amazement . It was his l lest interruption.  | Now the pause lengthened . When he finally broke it , his concernwas for her . I 'm sorry Miss Sadie brought you into this mess . ' She asked , Is it true ? ' her voice thick with emotion , her glance still averted . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely registered before it was qualified . Doty 's on the rampage . I may have been stupid . Perhaps I provoked him into saying he would sue . I hardly believed him . It sounded so fantastic -- She broke through these irrelevancies . I mean is it true that you  --  you ' But her throat closed convulsively . She found it impossible to phrase his betrayal . He looked at her curiously . Did you really believe it ? ' She did not reply . But her silence was an answer . It admitted her distrust . It accused him of perfidy . Of course I 've been an ass , ' he admitted disarmingly . Her tragic eyes questioned the extent of his asininity ; and then he defined it . It never occurred to me that Ivy Doty was in love with me . ' She came to the point again . Were you in love with her ? ' Perish the thought ! I 'm in love with you , sweet . Ivy Doty isnothing to me but a nuisance and  --  Good Lord !  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert did not trouble to conceal his irritation . Oh , well , ' he said , shrugging , you 're a hanging jury . There 's no use talking to you . ' Her eyes flashed at that . I think you 'll have to . ' His lips twitched and hardened . He looked at her coolly . But after an instant he recovered his good-humour . Darling , ' he said , reasonably , do try to be fair . I 'll tell you all about it . '  |p175She  waited in silence and he resumed presently : You 've never seen Ivy , but Ed showed you her picture . She 's a damn pretty girl . So pretty that she was a joke in the office . But before we began taking those unfortunate movies , I had n't said fifty words to her . Then , of course , I got to know her . She liked my direction and we got on fine together . She seemed just what Ed said she was  --  practical , sensible , very impersonal , a tireless worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ed had said quite all that , but Albert was continuing , his brow clouded by resentment : ' As a matter of fact , it was Ed that got me into this , by saying so emphaticallythat she was happily married . That put me off my guard . ' Cicily would have questioned this artless observation , but he did n't give her time to . ' Every man has one  --  with sense and a wife when a silvery blonde with a suivez-moi figure turns up in an office . But Ed was so positive I suppose I was dumb . I took her out to luncheon , once or twice between rehearsals , at u little Swedish restaurant near the West Side studio , and two or three evenings we had dinner together and worked on the scripts in the evening in my office . That 's all that ever happened . ' ' Did Doty know ? ' asked Cicily . ' After all , I did n't . ' ' Know what ? ' He looked puzzled . ' About all those luncheons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . She never spoke of him and I certainly did n't . Until one evening ten days ago , down in my office , shesuddenly told me she was going to leave him . I advised her not'Why , ' Cicily interrupted , ' was it any of your business ? ' ' Well , of course it was n't , ' he admitted good-naturedly . ' But is good advice to give any restless woman . As a matter of fact ,  | I was slightly alarmed . I did n't like the atmosphere . It was too confidential . I said she might lose her job . I was going on explainingEd 's peculiar moral principles when she burst into tears . She asked me how I could talk like that when I knew that she loved me . It all happened so quickly that I was left speechless . But after a minute I told her for God 's sake to pull herself together , that I did n't know anything of the kind . She said , well  --  Doty knew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't live with him because of her feeling for me . Incredible , is n't it ? Women will do anything . I could hardly believe I was in such a jam . She just sat there sobbing , and I stood up and told her to get up and put on her hat and coat and go home and tell her husband that she 'd spoken to me and that I 'd sent her back to him . She said that she could n't . She 'd actually left him  --  moved out to a boarding-house . I said that , in any case , she 'd have to leave my office after making such a scene at that hour of the night What hour of the night ? ' asked Cicily quickly . Oh , ten o'clock , maybe . Perhaps a little later . And she did leave , crying . I heard Pete speak to her  --  ask what was the matter . He was making his rounds and he met her in the hall . I held my breath , but she did n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first threat of blackmail . I threw him out . But of course I did n't know that he 'd been talking to Miss Sadie . Much less that she 'd dream of taking it to you . She lost her head , obviously . What made her do it ? ' She wanted me to help you . She said that she could n't . ' He looked touched and pleased . The poor old girl ! Really ? But how could you help me ? ' She thought you did n't realize that Doty was in earnest . She hoped a trial could be prevented . ' She was wondering , helplessly ,  |p177if  his story could be true . It all held together , though the Galahad pictured did not seem much like Albert . She was sure that his behaviourhad not been quite as he described it . But minor imprudencesmight be condoned . Must be , in fact , unless she was prepared to break with him definitely  --  Oh , God , she thought desperately , why ca n't he behave ?  --  and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds that united them were strained , but not broken . She still felt responsible for him , as a mother for a child . As a wife for a husband who , whatever his faults , was still an extension of her passionate ego . He broke the slight pause . Miss Sadie and my lawyer see this eye to eye . ' Your lawyer ? ' gasped Cicily . The word and all it implied brought home Albert 's danger . I 've engaged Louis Fox , of Wintringham , Fox and McElroy . ' Familiar as she was with Albert 's powers of concealment , it was hard to believe that he had taken this step without betraying his concern with the trouble that had caused it . They 're an excellent firm and he does most of their trial work . ' She asked , visibly paler , Does he think it will actually come to a lawsuit ? ' It seemed suddenly incredible that  --  even if he deservedit  --  Albert could be subjected to one of the vulgarest processes of law . My dear  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he thinks he 's guilty . This conclusion struck her forcibly , as it d when Miss Sadie had said Doty might be squared . ' Fox robably knew it . Men were honest with their lawyers , though ey deceived their wives . But Albert was saying , Of course he admits it 's nothing but a hold-up . ' acre was a contradiction . She tried to visualize Fox and hisp178obscure mental processes . An unknown attorney was in command of the facts . For him they possessed no emotional significance . He had reduced them impersonally to a client 's dilemma  --  no more sordid , perhaps , than many that had been brought to him  --  and had advised settlement , but said it was a hold-up . It was very confusing , for settlement was confession . Or so it seemed to Cicily , who had had no experience with the subtleties of the law . Albert proceeded to elucidate them calmly : Sue-and-bedamnedwas , of course , my reaction , but Fox keeps on telling me that a jury trial 's risky . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twelve men with their prejudices , social , moral , and economic . Ivy 's thoroughly spectacular , Doty 's rather threadbare , and I look damn prosperous . They 'd think it all likely to happen as he tells it . They 'd think it with a leer . Fox tells me such cases are usually won , and , even if they 're not , the charges are damaging . Of course it would be splashed all over the newspapers . Ed would take it very hard . He lives by publicity and exaggerates its power . I might lose my job , which would be wretched for both of us . And you must remember that he 's my mother 's second husband . I have to think of her , in chancing a row . Anything resembling a real break between us would cut her up fearfully . ' That was quite true and Cicily was impressed by it . She had been so distraught by her passionate uncertainty as to Albert 's behaviour that she had not once thought of her mother-in-law 's position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was continuing , his voice very serious : But back of all that is something much more important . I 'm peculiarly vulnerable to such an attack because I hope to go back to the foreign service . Any public scandal would have repercussions in the State Department . Statesmen , of course , can wink like a juryman , but theyp179insist that their subordinates be pure and undefiled . At least that they seem so . ' The thought of Audrey Diston crossed Cicily 's mind , explaining the bitterness that had crept into his tone , and was instantly dismissedbecause she was dominated by more immediate dismay . Fox thinks you should give him fifty thousand dollars ? ' She could not help thinking  --  though she despised herself for it  --  that as a price for Miss Wisconsin that sum was ridiculous . Albert 's lips curled in scorn . After talking with Fox , he marked his wife down . ' She was shaken by her sense of their mutual degradation in stooping to discuss this infamous barter ; but yet it was with difficultythat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Albert , unasked , supplied the information . To half price , in fact . ' It still seemed to her monstrous . She felt drawn to Albert because he was being victimized and she was much more inclined to believe that he was innocent . For Doty , by compromise , had weakened his position . He said unexpectedly , I had luncheon with Mother today . ' Did you tell her ? ' she asked quickly , hoping fiercely that he had n't . Whatever humiliation might come to her through Albert , she did not want to make it her mother-in-law 's affair . But he did not sense this . Yes , ' he said cheerfully , I asked her if she could lend me the twenty-five thousand-=-Albert ! ' she cried , in utter dismay . I le ignored her interjection . Her own money 's pretty well spent , as you know . But Ed 's given her presents and she thought she could raise it  --  or come pretty close to it  --  by selling what 's kit of her personal securities . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security box , which is extremely awkward if this ruction is to be kept from the attention of my esteemed stepfather . ' Among all the unpleasant emotions she was experiencing , jealousywas the one that moved her to utterance . Why did n't you come to me ? ' He met her eyes frankly . To you ? I never thought of it . To be perfectly honest , I hoped you 'd never hear of it . That was my best reason for consenting to settlement . I wanted to protect you from anything so foul . It broke Mother up , but she advised me to tell you . I said that I could n't , and made her promise not to . Discretion , of course , is Mother 's long suit . She 'll not tell a soul . ' Discretion , thought Cicily , was a flattering word for it . She was not surprised that Aunt Muriel was willing to keep her son 's secret  --  even from her husband . For she adored Albert and could always be counted on to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Cicily was conscious , though she had never referred to it  --  it was one of those peculiarities that her mother and Aunt Isabel had sometimes openly criticized  --  an unmoral slant on life which led her to subterfuge when truth seemed impractical . What really surprised Cicily , and annoyed her as well , was that Albert had been willing to discuss her ignorance with his mother and insist on a deception so gross that Aunt Muriel had advised him against it . Just why she had done so , she could not imagine . Then a horrid suspicion crept into her mind . She voiced it uncertainly , but with evident cynicism . Did  --  did she happen to mention that I still have my bank stock ? ' Obviously shocked , he rose from the armchair . My dear  --  that 's impossible . ' He had flushed like a boy . I could sell some , ' said Cicily . Even to her own ears , her voice was that of a temptress.  |p181He  made no reply , but turned restlessly away from her and strode across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , staring at the chair that lay on the piano . She knew he did n't see it . ' No one would know , except Uncle Alden , ' she said , after a moment . ' And he 's safe in Boston . ' On that he faced her and burst out indignantly , ' My dear , it 's outrageous that you should pay Doty ! ' This display of good taste , after all she 'd been through , struck her as amusing . ' Do you think so , Albert ? ' But her irony was further from laughter than tears . His face showed nothing but the tenderest concern for her , and a dazed admiration . ' You 're wonderful , Cicily . You 're making that offer believing me guilty . ' She came out with the truth . ' I do n't know what to believe . ' ' Then I ca n't accept it . ' His pride touched her poignantly , because it had really no relation to reality . He 'd have to accept it because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Albert , ' she said , ' I ca n't let him sue you . ' He walked slowly back to her , frowning a little , his face very serious . ' Do n't you at least believe that I love you ? ' With all the surprises she had given him that evening , he had reserved completeincredulity till that moment for his tone . She wondered an instant . ' Yes . In your way . ' ' There 's only one way . ' He still had the power to move her profoundly when his voicelook like that with the promise of passion . Whatever he 'd doneand she still was n't sure  --  she knew that she loved him with painful devotion . And yet she was angry , uncertain , humiliated . ' Albert , ' she said , ' you really must tell me . Are you being abominable ? I mean  --  have you lied to me ? '  | The word whipped his face , which whitened and tightened . No , ' he said gravely . She felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you asked such a question , you must abide by the answer . Why else had you asked it ? But she could n't conceive of the next thing to say . Her mind was a desert , arid and barren . But through the cracks of her consciousness a slight trickle of relief was insidiously creeping . For his denial had been unequivocable . Cicily , sweet  --  I ca n't bear you to look like that . ' The compassion in his tone awoke her self-pity and she knew that it was genuine . Albert always hated to witness any pain . When Bertie was born , he had gone all to pieces . She remembered his tenderness in that Peking hospital so much more vividly than she remembered her birth pangs . The memory pleaded for him . What can I say to convince you ? ' asked Albert . Nothing , she thought . He could n't prove anything . An act of faith on her part was all that could save them . She stood silent , longing for a miracle of the heart . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less like a husband than a suppliant lover . Conscious , in the silence , of her utter exhaustion and the grim loneliness of her state of suspicion , she longed to surrender , to weep on his shoulder , to comfort and be comforted . Suddenly she distrusted her very distrust . The luxury of belief was too great a temptation . Oh , Albert , ' she cried , I want to believe you ! ' The miracle took place , as he clasped her in his arms . She awoke the next morning , ridiculously happy , with the clear country sunshine streaming in her east window . She lay for ap183moment testing the happiness , fingering it gingerly as if it were fragile , drowsily aware that some anguish had preceded it . Then she remembered the events of the evening . Of the night that had followed it . She was alone in the room , for Albert  --  as he often did  --  had dressed in the bathroom and slipped downstairs without disturbing her . Wider awake , through the open bedroom door she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children . The aroma of coffee had crept up the stairs . It seemed the perfume of domesticity and she lay sniffing it blissfully , lazy , contented , and conscious of hunger . He loves me  --  he loves me ! ' her spirit was chanting . Suddenly she realized the lateness of the hour . She sprang out of bed and began to dress hurriedly . When she ran down the stairs , some ten minutes later , Albert was putting on his coat in the hall . They had only a moment , with the children around them , so she could say nothing of any significance ; but his kiss sealed their reconciliation once more . She stood on the doorstep to wave him of1 ' for his train , tingling a little with cold and emotion , skipping up and down and hugging her elbows , drawing great breaths of the fresh November air . A beautiful day in sunlit Suburbia . She looked up and down the pleasant , straight street of frame and plaster houses and across her brown lawn to her straw-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oak trees , where the black twigs madetterns against the blue of the sky . She felt young and strong andmuch more than equal to the task that awaited her as soon as she'deaten the breakfast she was hungry for  --  that of writing UncleAlden to sell bank stock at a loss . As she drank her hot coffee and ate her eggs and bacon , she did t try to figure what the loss would amount to ; as indeed shepI84could not , having no clear idea of the value of the shares . But she knew that they had depreciated disastrously since she had inheritedthem , only seven years ago , from her grandfather 's estate . Uncle Alden 's ideas would be painfully clear and the loss would be abhorrent to him . A fussy old gentleman in his seventieth year , he cherished the stock of the Bay State Trust Company as a precious family heirloom and a sacred family trust . Neither he nor her grandfather had ever dreamed of selling it , even at a profit . He would compute her folly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , left to her outright , and she could do with it exactly as she liked . Louis Fox could be counted on , so Albert had assured her , to hold Doty at bay with legal procedure until she had the money actually in hand . It would be to his interest to keep quiet until he received it ; and then , he had promised , he would go back to Waukesha . Miss Wisconsin  --  so Fox said  --  could be placed in New York . He was very resourceful and had a friend in the show business . Ed Brown would never know why she threw up her job . It had astonished Cicily  --  and even disconcerted her  --  to learn how much had been planned between Albert and his lawyer on the hypothesis of settlement . But it had relieved her to find that Fox was so competent and so sure of his advice . In acting upon it she could dismiss personal responsibility for the dreadful decision to buy Doty off . It was horribly repugnant to her and she hated the secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounce him before all the world . In the courtroom , at least , she could have sat by Albert 's side , presenting a picture of conjugal confidence , reinforcing his position by the dignity of her demeanour . Albert had laughed very heartily at this fantasy , saying that if she and Miss Wisconsin should both appear in courtp185they 'd have a hung jury . But then , much more soberly , he 'd reminded her that their safety depended on secrecy . She had noticed his plural pronoun , had even been touched by it , and it was with a sense of facing danger with her husband , of being steadfast and practical at a critical moment , that she sat down at her desk to write to her uncle . She did not question the alchemy that had changed her point of view . She felt , on the contrary , that the night in Albert 's arms had restored her to sanity . His tenderness had been accompanied by the most candid confidence and she knew herself now for a jealous fool . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert , when she 'd turned on him  --  scared stiff , he 'd declared , by his horrified sense of all that was at stake  --  had withheld certain facts that he 'd feared would provoke her beyond hope of reconciliation . Oh , nothing to alarm her at that intimate moment and things he 'd never suspected might be open to misinterpretation ! The barest amenities  --  glances and smiles and words of encouragement , of compliment even , that might  --  as he saw it now , racking his brains to explain his predicament  --  account for Miss Wisconsin 's demoralized outburst . What it all came down to  --  he 'd confesseda trifle foolishly  --  was that he supposed he 'd liked working with a pretty girl . But to think of poor Ivy taking it seriously  --  ! Here was no Galahad , but the Albert she recognized , pursuing idle pleasure without a thought of penalty . She knew too well how he must have behaved . His admissions had confirmed her previous conviction of his probable imprudence and they slightly tempered her opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a contemptuousway . But not too sorry , for no woman was justified in making such a declaration ; and as for the folly of her confession to Doty  --  well , it was unthinkable ! She wrote her Uncle Alden , quite briefly and affectionately ,  |p186that  she and Albert found it hard to live on their income , that some bills had piled up that rather appalled her , and that she would like him to sell twenty-five thousand dollars ' worth of her bank stock , so that she might have a cash fund to draw on for emergencies . She was thinking so intensively of Albert 's embarrassment that it really did not seem to her a remarkable request . As she walked into the hall to place the letter on the table to wait for the postman , she heard the sound of a motor on the drive outside . It was , she observed very much to her surprise , her mother-in-law 's limousine and Aunt Muriel herself was sitting inside . It was barely ten o'clock and Aunt Muriel invariably lay late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty These thoughts were no more than instantaneous impressions ; and then , she remembered  --  God , Albert had told her ! She had given him her promise that she would n't tell a soul . ' And here she was coming , not twenty-four hours later , to take it all up  --  to beg for the bank stock It must be for that . Nothing else could explain her untimely appearance . She could never be trusted not to do something devious  --  with the best of intentions . Cold with aversion for the interview before her , she opened the door and waved very cordially . Aunt Muriel descended from the limousine clumsily . It was one of the few things she could no longer do gracefully , and it made her , for the moment , seem almost her age . But once on the doorstepshe looked as she always did , beautiful , fashionable , carrying her years and her weight with serenity . Cicily clasped her solid , mink-coated figure and smelled the French perfume that she had associated with Aunt Muriel from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' asked Aunt Muriel solicitously . She pressed her soft cheek , with its smooth coat of powder , to Cicily 's firm one.  |p187'Me  ? , I 'm fine . I 'm simply dandy , ' said Cicily defensively . Aunt Muriel looked at her with her bright blue eyes . She smiled very affectionately , and the smile and the eyes  --  in spite of their colour  --  gave her a fleeting resemblance to Albert . It was not a simple similarity of feature , but rather a subtle identity of expression . Cicily felt an increasing embarrassment , for the candour of those eyes could not possibly be ingenuous . Come in , ' she said hastily . I 'm awfully glad to see you . But the children , I 'm afraid , are scattered over the neighbourhood . On Saturday mornings they scoot out after breakfast You 're looking so pretty , dear , ' Aunt Muriel interrupted . Like a child , yourself . ' As Cicily led the way to the living-room her panic subsided . She thought with grim humour , Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's planning to break it to me in some beauway . Sit down in the armchair , while I light the fire , ' she suggested pleasantly . If I sat in that armchair , I 'd never get out of it . ' Aunt Muriel 's habit of taking herself lightly was one of the things that made her seem young . But she always selected a seat that became her , and now she sat down on a small walnut-backed sofa and threw off her coat from her broad-bosomed figure and drew off her gloves to stretch her hands to the fire . The gesture was girlish and yet not ridiculous , for the hands were very pretty , small , white and jewelled , with rosy-red finger-nails . She sat gracefully erect , noteven touching the back of the sofa . Her legs were quite slender  --  seemed so , at least , beneath the bulk of her body  --  and sheed them youthfully , displaying silk-stockinged ankles thatstill slim and fine . This room is so charming , ' she said , looking around it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had cleaned up the mess of the party before breakfast . The pale ivory walls and the warm yellow damask of the hangings and upholstery and the tan of the carpet and deep velvet armchair blended into a colour scheme that harmonized prettily as a background for Cicily , with her milk-white face and her cendre fair hair and her fawn-coloured frock , as she knelt on the hearthrug . Aunt Muriel 's eyes came to rest on her thoughtfully . Cicily , ' she said , if you were my own daughter , I could n't be fonder of you. , This bombardment of compliments was slightly absurd , considered as a prelude for Aunt Muriel 's mission , but Cicily detected real feeling in her tone . You have been , and are , a perfect wife for Albert , ' said Aunt Muriel impressively . That has made me very happy . I hope that you realize that he really adores you and that I am grateful for  --  for your qualities of character . I think you understand him and ' Of course I understand him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , My relations with Albert are none of her business . For a moment Aunt Muriel said nothing more . Cicily sank back to sit cross-legged on the hearthrug and looked up at her mother-in-law with a touch of impatience . What she saw startled her . In that moment of silence , Aunt Muriel 's face had slipped out of control . Anxious and old , it was the measure of her emotion . Muscles were twitching beneath the soft bloom of powder , the carmined lips quivered and the blue eyes were miserable . Slowly , they misted . Cicily , darling  --  I  --  I have something to tell you , ' Aunt Muriel faltered . Cicily felt ashamed of her childish perversity . But she dreaded ,  |p189above  all things , an emotional scene . So her voice was quite curt as she said , almost casually , Albert has told me . ' The words struck Aunt Muriel absolutely motionless . Her face , which a moment before had been so flaccid , seemed to harden instantaneously in a mask of surprise . Her hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; dropped into her lap ; and her eyes , bright with tears , stared wide and expressionless , bits of blue glass stuck between her wet lashes . So you do n't need to , ' added Cicily emphatically . Caution was creeping into those eyes . He 's told you  --  ? About  --  what ? ' She spoke with some difficulty . About Ivy , ' said Cicily . Oh , my poor child ! ' Aunt Muriel 's hands flew up to her face in an abandonment to emotion that seemed wild and inexplicable . Rarely , if ever , had Cicily felt more uncomfortable . He told me about Doty and the lawsuit and Fox and all that Fox said , ' she continued stolidly . I think he 's quite right . We must n't tell Uncle Ed . We ca n't have a scandal . ' For once Aunt Muriel seemed oblivious of appearances . She had sunk back on the sofa as if glad of support and was sitting there collapsed , relief and bewilderment struggling in her gaze . And you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me ? What about me ? ' Her voice sharpened a little . You mean  --  you 've forgiven him ? ' The phrase was pure melodrama , Cicily thought . And it voiced a curiosity that she could not condone . She answered it coolly , for a parade of her emotions for the benefit of Aunt Muriel was physically impossible . Of course I 've forgiven him . Do n't I have to ? You know Albert . He goes down like a ninepin before a pretty girl . He and Miss Wisconsin  --  well , it 's really too ridiculous to take very seriously . Of course I do n't like it . I wish it hadn'tp190happened . It 's going to turn out to be very expensive . But at least it 's over . He really regrets it . ' After an instant of blank , dazed silence , I had no idea that you were such a realist , Cicily , ' her mother-in-law observed in a queer , dry tone . The queerness snagged Cicily 's attention unpleasantly . Somethingnot understandable had risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Aunt Muriel was reviving . She still looked perplexed , but as if she had managed to put her hand on security . I mean , my dear child , that you 're right  --  but remarkable . I did n't expect that you 'd be so wise . At your age , I 'm sure , I did n't have half your composure . But we took sex more seriously . And much more romantically . Whether , my dear , we were deceived or deceiving . ' Cicily stared up at her like a puzzled child . A child vaguely aware that adults were behaving in a way that they should n't . She remembered , parenthetically , all she 'd dragged out of Mumsy about Aunt Muriel 's first marriage and about Albert 's father ; and what , above all , Aunt Isabel had hinted and Mumsy had n't denied about Aunt Muriel 's lovers . So  --  it must be true , then . She had missed a few words of her mother-in-law 's argument . But it was continuing . But women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such escapades are always superficial , and a wife , if she 's sensible , always wins in the end . If she 's pretty , that is , and thinks it worth while . That you do think it that makes me very , very happy . For Albert , my dear child , is simply devoted to you . He told me so yesterday with tears in his eyes . But do n't think that I 'm trying to excuse his conduct . I think it was disgraceful . To forget you  --  and himself  --  to have an affair with a model in Ed 's office ' Her voice sunk disdainfully . It was Cicily 's turn to be struck absolutely motionless . She hadp191in her heart a sensation of sharp agony as distinctly localized as if it were physical . A stitch in her side . She pressed her hands to it . It seemed , for an instant , to still the blood in her veins , to paralyze thought --  Then she heard her lips whispering , ' An affair ? ' She was stupefied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cried Aunt Muriel quickly . Her accent was curiously that of reassurance . ' You could n't call it seduction , as Doty pretends . She was an experienced married woman and she knew what was happening quite as well as Albert did . She admits it , in fact . ' Cicily sat mute , staring up at her mother-in-law . The agony still had its grip on her heart . Aunt Muriel continued : ' Doty 's behaviour has utterly outraged her . I saw her yesterday , in Fox 's office , after Albert had spoken to me . I must say I went down there thinking the worst of her and I have to admit that she behaved very well . She was quiet and dignified and said , rather courageously , that if it were n't for this action that her husband insists on she would n't regret anything . She said she was willing to write it off to experience . That seemed a trifle hard . But she thinks only of Albert and seems perfectlyconciled to fading out of the picture . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable . ' ' You saw her ? ' said Cicily . It seemed so incredible to her poor bruised spirit that this could have happened without Albert 's speaking of it . Almost more incredible than that he was faithless . Aunt Muriel nodded . ' You have n't , I believe ? ' ' Oh , no ! I do n't want to . Do n't tell me about her ! ' This was a reaction that Aunt Muriel was prepared for . ' My dear , ' she said gently , ' he does n't care two straws for her . ' It was , Cicily realized , her idea of consolation . But , ' Please , ' she said , frowning , ' I do n't want to hear about it . ' She felt a dim pity for the woman described . But she could n't think clearly , probe the depth of her betrayal , arrive at any conclusion . It was all she could do to keep her horrible secret from the woman before her who wished to be sympathetic  --  the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you decided , ' asked Aunt Muriel presently , you and Albert , I mean , what you are going to do ? ' Do ? ' The word was a vague echo , no decision behind it . For what , Cicily asked herself , was there now to be done ? Too much , too little For nothing she or Albert could possibly do would ever restore her faith in her husband . About Doty , ' said Aunt Muriel , a slight tremor in her tone betraying her anxiety . Oh  --  Doty , ' said Cicily , as queerly and listlessly as if her wits were wandering . The name seemed to come to her from very far away . But it brought with it the vulgarity of the courtroom . She saw Albert pilloried by a vindictive attorney , heard the sordid revelations of prurient witnesses and love letters read  --  for Albert might have written them  --  to the obscene accompaniment of ribald guffaws . Her sense of the shame of it was horribly intensifiedby the knowledge that Doty was honest and justified . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damages that would certainly be recovered and of Fox 's advice , so cynically sound . Oh , I guess we 'll have to settle , ' she said apathetically . You mean  --  ? ' Aunt Muriel was suddenly eager . Cicily met the bright beam of her eyes . She held it and thought , she has certainly discussed my bank stock with Albert . She knows I still have it and he must have told her . Aloud , she said savagely , I mean that I 'll pay , ' and glared at her mother-in-law . Aunt Muriel looked very grateful for the glare . Or perhaps she only noticed the bounty it illuminated . She had grown a littlep193older , or so Cicily fancied , in the dreadful half-hour that they had just put behind them . But she was recovering , as Albert could recover from any experience , any shattering blow . Sunny was the word for it  --  a sunny nature . She rose from the sofa and stood smiling beatifically , all of her gratitude shining in her eyes . Cicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Albert must have told you that I 'm utterly helpless . Ed has my money . But I 'll see you 're repaid , one way or another . I shall make it my affair . It may take some time , but you shall have every cent of it . ' Aunt Muriel meant this . She was impulsively generous and , in spite of her extravagance , money meant little to her . She cared more for Albert than for anyone else in the world . She was perfectly willing to assume his obligations . In the meantime , of course , the wretch , Doty , must be paid . But Cicily would pay him . So now she dismissed her worry over the lawsuit . That , too , was characteristic . She was not inclined toward morbid analysis . Cicily , ' she said , dear child , I want to kiss you . ' Cicily obediently started to rise . She could hardly accomplish it , for she felt as weak as water . She dragged herself from the hearthrug by clutching the armchair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her daughter-in-law to her feet and clasped her to her bosom . Cicily clung there , submitting to the caress , glad of the support of the well-corseted figure , which felt solid and stolid under her arms . She was , for the instant , entirely preoccupied by her bodily sensations , which rather alarmed her because they were unprecedented . She felt queerlyht-headed and her knees were very shaky . The wall of the roomt Aunt Muriel 's shoulder was wavering strangely . Under the circumstances , it was not surprising that neither ofthe women heard the sounds in the hall . They were not loudsounds ; the click of a latchkey , the noise of the front door openingp194and closing and the footfalls of a man who was evidently in a hurry . It was Cicily who first saw Albert at the door . She saw him framed by the wall that had just been wavering and which instantlysteadied in the shock of her surprise . He had n't taken off his hat or his overcoat and he was breathing unevenly as if he had been running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and his mother , was that of a man who was stricken aghast . On his apparition her body had stiffened in Aunt Muriel 's arms and , feeling its rigidity , Aunt Muriel released it . She wheeled at the sight of her daughter-in-law 's face . Albert ! ' she gasped , in the utmost confusion . And then with a candour , shameless , thoughtless , and disarming , I was going to ask Cicily not to tell you I was here ! ' Well  --  that 's unnecessary , ' said Albert very grimly . He regardedhis mother with fury in his eyes . Aunt Muriel 's confusion was quickly conquered . She gathered her dignity around her like a queen . An outraged queen mother , who would brook no impertinence from a royal stripling . Albert , ' she said , I do n't know what you 're thinking , but I do know this  --  if it 's harsh , it 's unjustified . I came here solely to act in your interest and Cicily and I are thoroughly agreed . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish and impractical  --  and I gather from what she 's said that you must have come to my opinion . I was terribly disturbed about you  --  with very good reason . No harm has been done by my seeing Cicily . She has merely informed me of her generous decision . It has taken a load off my mind and my heart . She is really  --  extraordinary . I am inexpressibly grateful to her . I was trying to thank her when you came into the room . ' While Aunt Muriel had been speaking , Albert had stood stock/still on the threshold , his dark eyes fixed on her in intense concentration , as if he were trying to wring some meaning from her words that was not apparent in their literal context . Now , for the first time , he seemed to become conscious of his own appearance . He removed his hat and , crushing the brim in tense , twitching fingers , he turned toward Cicily , who , standing a little removed by the armchair , had been a mute spectator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked you , ' he said , with hesitation , transferring to his wife the intensity of his gaze . Cicily 's giddiness seemed to be gone . She could not have told the moment when it released her , so absorbed had she been in watching her husband . It was n't a very pleasant subject of conversation , ' she said , not for his , but her mother-in-law 's , ears . She could n't deal with Albert until Aunt Muriel had gone . If she only would go  --  go without realizing the situation she had precipitated . What Albert was realizing was increasingly plain . Cicily saw , and knew he was seeing , the girl who had waved him from the doorstep that morning . He was comparing her with the woman who stood by the chair . What have you done to her  --  what have you said to her ? ' 1 is turned to his mother in bitter accusation . Why in God 's name did you have to come out here ? I called you up as soon as I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lakeood . I caught the first train . But I hardly believed that you'dsuch a fool as to -- Albert ! ' Aunt Muriel 's face was a blank of amazement . She irked up her coat from the walnut-backed sofa . Your reactionsincredible . I 'm not going to stay here to listen to your dis-courtesy. '  | Cicily took the mink coat from her hands . She helped her mother-in-law into it in very thankful silence , received a last kiss , and walked with her , speechless , into the hall . She would n't risk a word that might serve to prolong this precarious conversation . Albert followed them closely . It 's absurd , thought Cicily , in spite of her misery  --  I ca n't trust her with him ; he wo n't trust me with her . Mother , ' he muttered , at the door , I 'm sorry . But really , you know ' Then he noticed that Cicily was looking at a letterthat lay on the table . His glance followed hers and took in the address : Alden Carver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' As she picked it up , he made a quick gesture , unconscious and involuntary , with those fine , nervous hands as if to prevent her from tearing it to pieces , if any such thought should come into her mind . But Cicily merely handed it to Aunt Muriel . Will you mail this in town ? ' Aunt Muriel , too , observed the name and the address . She was somewhat deficient in small , personal decencies and would always glance curiously at a letter in her hand . The four lines of script in Cicily 's square handwriting  --  which always looked so childish  --  seemed to move her profoundly . Oh  --  Cicily ' she stammered . And burst into tears . She knows what it means , thought Cicily dully , as she patted the mink on Aunt Muriel 's shoulder . Albert certainly told her about my financial arrangements . The tears subsided and the damage was repaired  --  with a thought for the chauffeur who was waiting in the limousine  --  with powder and mirror . Then Albert helped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping watch , but no word passed between them , for Aunt Muriel was occupied in retaining , beforcp197her servant , a semblance of composure . When the door of the car closed , she returned to the hall . She heard the whirr of the engine and the crunch of the gravel beneath the moving wheels before Albert rejoined her . He had himself now much better in hand ; looked , indeed , quite as usual . Perhaps a little self-conscious . lie closed the front door and faced her , in silence . Take off your overcoat , ' she suggested absurdly . For the pause was awkward . It was the first observation that came into her mind . He obeyed her without speaking and hung it up in the closet , emerging from the darkness of that small enclosure to inquire ceremoniously , Where shall we talk ? Will you come into the living-room ? ' No , I do n't think so . ' For too many memories of nightmare discussions made that room intolerable . She would have liked to have it out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her a protection ; not only from Albert , but from her treacherous emotions . It had n't the intimacy of a room with a door . But that was impossible . A moment before she had smiled at Aunt Muriel 's concern for her chauffeur . Now she thought of Vesta , who , busy in the kitchen , might hear their raised voices . He said , Then we 'd better go up to our room . ' She preceded him up the stairs , once more aware of the weakness in her knees and that slight , shaky giddiness that made her glad to grasp the banisters . On the threshold of their bedroom she thought , This , of course , is the very worst place to find myself with him . Then the irony of the sunlight , still streaming in the window as it had when she lay in her bed that morning , brought a lump into her throat . The utter indifference of all natural objects to human catastrophe weighed heavily on her spirits . The angle of the sunlight had shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds were made up . Otherwise the room looked exactly the same . Albert closed the door . She retreated before him and sank down on the chaise-longue , dreading unspeakably the immediate ordeal . But her husband walked over to her without an instant 's delay . He said , still with that accent that was faintly ceremonious , Would you mind telling me exactly what Mother said to you ? ' She had known he would begin by asking that question . He would n't risk anything before he was sure . She had her answer ready . She said  --  and I believed her  --  that Ivy Doty had been your mistress . ' She had only a glimpse of the shock it had given him to learn that his very worst suspicions were true . With one stricken glance at her that seemed , more than anything , a distracted comment , not on his own , but on his mother 's indiscretion , he moved abruptly away and passed behind the chaise-longue to stand by the window in the shaft of bright sunlight . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked in a voice she 'd never heard , so choked and subdued was it by emotion , What made her tell you ? ' She did n't exactly . I told her you had . Told me , I mean . Of course , you see , I thought so . And then it came out . She did n't understand . She still does n't , Albert . I hope you wo n't tell her . ' She saw the hand of the shadow move up to its head in a gesture of despair , then drop to its side again . But she heard no sound . She found herself thinking , I wonder if he 's looking at me or out the window . That choked voice had not told her . But it was no matter . She did not turn around . Finally she spoke . Well  --  you made a fine fool of me. ' p , 199The shadow started violently . She knew from its movement that he must have turned toward her . So he had been staring out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't bear you to think that . ' The patch of sunlight was empty on the floor . He appeared at her elbow and stood looking down at her . The ( face that he showed her was ravaged and pale . A lock of dark hair had fallen over his forehead , disarranged by the gesture she had seen silhouetted . It made him look young and romantic  --  and silly . The silliness touched her because it was boyish . He sat down at her feet on the end of the chaise-longue , apparently untroubled by the thought that she might not like him to . Cicily , sweet  --  you really must listen to me . I behaved very , badly . I wo n't try to extenuate it . But let 's , for a moment , not go into that . The thing you suggested  --  that I could make a fool of you  --  is so much more heinous . I want you to believe  --  if you can , my poor darling  --  that I would n't hurt you for anything in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that I could keep you in ignorance , patch up the piecesd save the situation . What possible good would it have done toI you ? What good does it do for you to know it now ? ' ' What good  --  ? ' she faltered , surprised by this defence of hisdefensible treachery . He went on impulsively : ' I was a fool . I frankly admit it . But why , in God 's name , should you suffer for my folly ? To have toldabout it would have been weak , to a degree . I do n't believe confession . It 's just a subtle method of shoving off your burdens someone else 's shoulders . The truth can be so much more el than a lie . What is the truth , anyway ? It 's so difficult to ne it Cicily recalled him from the realm of metaphysics . ' The truth Albert , that you slept with that woman . '  |p200And  I desperately regret it . Do n't you forget that that 's equally true . It was a mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just liked to kid her . And then I went haywire . A woman like you could listen till Doomsday and still not understand how a man can slip into that sort of intimacy . Oh , I know what you 're thinking  --  ! ' She had made a quick movement , but he would n't let her interrupt him . You think that has been said to a great many wives . But it 's said because it 's true . Wives , as a rule  --  sweet wives , like you  --  are relatively immune or else not exposed to that sort of temptation . But a very good husband can think  --  it would be fun . It is fun , damn it ! You ca n't get away from it . But it never once touched my deep feeling for you . Of course it sometimes troubled me , but I thought you 'd never know and no harm would be done . That 's the absolute truth and you see  --  you do n't like it . ' He ended on an accent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His candour had shocked her . It was perfectly true that she did n't understand . Tout comprendre , c'est tout pardonner ? '  --  the proverb she had thought of , after talking with John . Good Heavens , was it yesterday that they had had that conversation in which she had been troubled about her son 's cynicism ? It seemed an eternity . What would John make of the situation now developing ? It had n't occurred to her to think of her children and their unhappy reactions to the immediate coil . It startled her to think that she had really forgotten them in the press of her anguish . Albert said , Well ? ' She wrenched her thoughts back to the things he had said to her . Would the average man , she wondered , think Albert had been kind ? Kind to deceive her ? Were women more fastidious ? His artless irresponsibility seemed not quite human  --  hobgob/linish , elfin  --  as if Albert were a pixie , with a pixie 's conceptions of right and of wrong . She surprised him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , concerned about Ivy ? ' Ivy ? ' He wondered . Well  --  just at the last I could see that it bothered her . Which I had n't anticipated . And then came this row . Doty blew in , just as Miss Sadie told you . And the whole house of cards came tumbling down . Even at that , it was n't bricks and mortar . Just the same , I was certainly in the hell of a hole . I went to Mother , and she , as I told you , advised me to go home and make a clean breast of it . ' Why ? ' Cicily inquired , not quite ingenuously . She said you 'd find out , if I could n't settle . ' That partially explained Aunt Muriel 's reactions which , Cicily knew , were always pragmatic . But she wanted to prove her own painful assumption . Did she think I might help you ? With money , I mean ? ' Albert 's glance flickered slightly . I 'll be honest . She suggested it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really was , Cicily . ' The flush on his cheeks substantiated this claim . Cicily was reflecting that it was very like Albert to shrink from such unpleasantness , when he volunteered , She asked if I thought I could go to your father . ' Albert ! She did n't ! ' she cried in consternation . For that would have been the ultimate shame . He nodded morosely . I did n't tell her , but I even considered it . It was my last hope , if I did n't let you know . Of course he does n't like me , but I thought he 'd come across and take out his disgust in giving me a wigging . I did n't look forward to the interview , I can assure you . And there was a chance that he might take it to you . You never can tell about a Puritan 's conscience . ' Well , I 'm glad that Miss Sadie came in time to prevent that , '  |p202said  Cicily severely . She herself did n't know what her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known that his criticism of Albert was so thoroughly justified was curiously intolerable . I wish you could have seen Miss Sadie this morning , ' said Albert , with a smile that seemed slightly experimental . She looked like a scared rabbit . Of course she did n't say anything about spilling the beans . ' This attempt at the light touch did n't quite come off . He abandoned it instantly and returned to the subject of contention between them . Oh , Cicily , sweet  --  you were so upset and uncertain  --  and adorable . How could I have told you ? It would have been like striking the face of a child . ' After a long moment , I think I could have forgiven you Miss Wisconsin , ' said Cicily . It was his face that was struck by the meaning in her tone . Of course I do n't know just how I should have felt about it , ' she went on wearily . That seems to me now impossible to tell . I ca n't disassociate myself from all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your sleeping with her --  ' A quiver of abhorrence passed over her features . Emotion welled up in her and she lashed out savagely , Oh , Albert  --  how could you ? Where did you do it ? On that couch in your office ? In some cheap hotel ? How do men do such things  --  ? ' Cicily  --  ! ' he remonstrated . It was , for an instant , a satisfaction to have shocked him . But she had shocked herself more . Do n't tell me about it ! I do n't want to listen , ' she hurriedly assured him . She struggled for control and presently she regained it . Perhaps  --  I ca n't tell  --  if you 'd come to me honestly , you might have convinced me that I could condone it . The thing that I ca n't condone is your second deception . ' Her voice sank lower in the shame of that betrayal.  |p203'I  'll never forgive you  --  well  --  last night , Albert . ' She felt herself flushing and could not meet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her confusion . ' Making me love you on a basis of lies , embroidering that tale you had spun from duplicity , laughing  --  I dare say  --  at my complete gullibility . It makes me shudder to look around this room . Its walls should be shaking like the walls of Jericho . That sun should go out like a lamp in the wind -- 'Cicily ! ' he cried , on an accent of horror . ' You 're morbid  --  you 're hysterical . There was no duplicity in my feeling for you . I t made me so happy  --  so humble and grateful  --  to keep you in ignorance of everything that could hurt you . ' She made a very weary gesture of negation . ' Albert , we do n't tee things in the same way at all . Miss Wisconsin is nothing . Or at least she might have been . It 's myself I 'm thinking of and of what you did to me . ' This seemed to her final and she would have risen from the haise-longue , if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eyes were confused by some new bewilderment , or perhaps byold one that had just been recalled . ' If you ca n't forgive me  --  r at least if you think so  --  why , my blessed darling , did you ant to mail that letter ? ' What letter ? she thought for the fraction of an instant . Then , of urse , she remembered it and the moment she had put it in tint Muriel 's hand . She tried to analyze the motivation that d induced her to do so . ' I think  --  because , Albert  --  you still m to belong to me , ' she admitted reluctantly . ' For better , for worse ? ' he ventured the suggestion . ' For worse , ' she said briefly , killing his smile . She rose to her feet , conscious again of the pull of her exhaustion.  | He sat looking up at her . What , ' he asked gravely , are you planning to do ? ' Do ? ' she echoed vaguely . Of course something must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was she could not decide . Suddenly she experienced a grotesque revelation of the task that confronted her . She acted upon it immediately and moved toward his bureau . I 'm going to move your things downstairs to the guestroom , ' she said apathetically . He stood up , staggered . Do you mean that ? ' For answer she opened his upper bureau drawer . But she had not realized how the sight of his neckties and collars and shirts , ranged neatly in order as Albert always kept them , would shake her resolve . She conquered the weakness with an effort of will that set her hands trembling as she picked up the shirts , piled the collars on top of them , seized a handful of neckties . She was startled , on turning , to find him beside her and waited , dismayed , for his inevitable protest . She had forgotten that Albert could always be counted on to do something unexpected , disarming  --  and exasperating . He did not protest . His smile was a comment on her theatric procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said very cheerfully , taking the bundle of shirts from her arms.  |p205As  LONG as she lived , Cicily was to remember that anticlimactic moment . It reduced to absurdity the task she had set herself , which had its own irritations , not the least of which being that Albert would not be irritated . Accepting her decision , he said nothing more about it , but lent himself gravely and pleasantly to its execution , as he might have joined in the game of a child . Silence was awkward , conversation ridiculous , as they traipsed down and up stairs from his bureau in their bedroom to the bureau in the guestroom , from closet to closet and bathroom to bathroom , carrying his clothes and his personal possessions . Albert occasionally made a trivial observation . Here 's a button that 's off , ' or , Do you think that this suit should go to the cleaner 's ? ' Only once was he shaken from this solemn mockery . For God 's sake , Cicily , do n't you carry my shoes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . His jobas a diplomat had held sartorial obligations which were not out oftune with his personal inclinations . It took half an hour to carryeverything downstairs . Underclothes , bathrobes , pajamas , andbusiness suits  --  white flannel trousers , grey-striped ones , plusfours  --  morning coat , dinner coat , tailed coat , and cutaway  --  black satin-seamed trousers , trailing suspenders  --  white piqueWaistcoats , black cloth and black silk ones  --  his scarlet hunting/coat , white breeches , and riding-boots  --  tweed jackets and sweaters  --  socks , mufflers , and gloves  --  hats , shoes , and slippers  --  his crop and his canes . Finally , his hairbrushes , clothesbrushes , toothbrushes , shaving-brush and razor , his small can of toothpowder , his squashed tube of shaving-cream , the brown leather box that held his studs and his cuff links  --  and his picture of Cicily , holding Bertie in her arms . He had picked up that picture , saying , You 're coming with me , ' with more humour than sentiment . Downstairs in the guestroom , he placed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arranging the coat-hangers in the closet . The guestroom was small , blue-and-cream coloured , tidy . Two chintz-curtained windows commanded the side lawn . The floor space was nearly all filled by the furniture , painted pale ivory and simple in design . The walls were quite bare , except for the mirror that hung over the bureau . A chintz-covered armchair stood by one of the windows , a small desk by the other . The immaculate blue blotter , the new pen in the penholder , the embroidered muslin bedspreads , so crisp and so clean that the creases showed faintly where the laundress had pressed them , a glimpse of the guest towels on a rack in the bathroom and the conspicuous absence of any personal possessions gave the room an appearance of purely transient occupancy . As a matter of fact , it was very rarely occupied . Cicily used it as a dressing-room for women when she gave a party ; and for that it was large enough and very convenient , opening as it did from the end of the front hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cicily said civilly , I hope you 'll be comfortable . ' Then , to her horror , she heard the voices of the children and the scuffle of their feet , as they ran from the pantry into the dining/room . They had come home for luncheon through the kitchen door . Almost instantaneously they appeared in the hall , glanced down its length and saw Cicily and Albert standing in the guestroom . They joined them immediately . Sis asked at once , Are we going to have company ? ' For why else would her mother be in that room ? No , dear , ' said Cicily , covering her confusion by kneeling to kiss Bertie and unbutton his reefer . His small face was rosy and felt soft and cold . Robin asked , Is lunch ready ? ' It was John who was observing his stepfather 's brushes , spread neatly on the bureau , and the picture of his mother with Bertie in her arms . Sis 's glance followed his . What are those here for ? ' she asked , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . She found herself glancing instinctively at Albert for support in this emergency . I Ie spoke almost instantly and a trifle huskily . Sis , I 've developed a very bad cold . I coughed all last night and kept your mother awake . Today I went to Doctor Bancroft and he told mee thought it might be slightly contagious . There 's a light type ofppe that 's running around . So , as it was Saturday , I came homely and we moved my things down here . ' Even John was quite satisfied by this simple explanation . A deep wave of gratitude flooded Cicily 's heart . It shone in her es and Albert observed it . He referred to his infection once more at the luncheon table , when Vesta was passing the corned-beef hash . He said , very ually : Remind me , Cicily , to order that gargle . I 'm not going like sleeping down in the guestroom . I want a quick cure . '  | Did the doctor say you must stay in the house ? ' Sis inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh air would be good for me . As a matter of fact , I think I 'll go for a ride . ' His glance , as he spoke , had barely brushed Cicily . She looked faintly puzzled . There was only one person with whom Albert could be riding . But when had he arranged it ? He 'd had a few minutes alone before luncheon --  Her face composed quickly in a mask of indifference . Behind it she was wondering if Gertrude would notice that something had happened . Would Albert be tempted to imprudent half-confidence ? Admit his low spirits , imply that they had quarrelled ? The thought was insufferable . But then she remembered that he was never confidential . Never talked about women to women , if he could help it . He would not betray her  --  at least in that way . When luncheon was over , she went up to her room . She moved a vase from the mantel-shelf and her workbox from her sewing-table to fill the queer emptiness on top of Albert 's bureau . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be done . At least , not yet . The children would notice . Sooner or later they would notice so much that she would have to explain to them the thing that had happened . She found herself postponing the mere thought of explanation . But John would soon be aware . Aware of what ? She did not quite know , unable to estimate the extent of his innocence . Boys of fifteen were rather mature . Her three older children had been blessedly frank with her . She had talked about babies and how they came to be born . Bertie was n't interested  --  he was still too little  --  but the others had listened , asked questions , been answered . But babies were one thing and sex was another . She had n't gone into the emotional intricacies . Did a boy understand themp209any better than a girl ? Had John heard things , read things , that he had n't confided ? She could not be sure . She could not possibly guess how much he would infer from Albert 's move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , or how significant he would think it . Sis did n't trouble her , in that way , at all . Her literal mind was a safeguard from inference . And Robin , like Bertie , would be oblivious of implications . It was of John that she was thinking , rather than of Albert , as she lay down on her bed to rest for an hour . She remembered the conversation she had had with him yesterday . His young voice , breaking , yet cool with disillusion , echoed and re-echoed in that silent room . At least if you 're sure that this love will last . Youi know what you said . It comes and it goes . If you really believe that  --  I should think you would feel that there could always be another love ? ' Why had she felt no foreboding of this hour ? A knock on her door made her spring up , startled . If thatshould be Albert , she 'd have to have a key . Strange that shehad n't one , had never had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriages . She thought , for an instant , ofJack at that door . He had always come in quietly , peering aroundit with his kind , friendly smile , for fear of disturbing her . Jackhad cleared out when the break came between them , moved intown to his club . That was better , less painful . And the childrenhadbeen young enough to take things for granted . But theywere n't any longer . And she was not yet willing to ask Albert toIt was Sis , at the door . ' Uncle Albert wants to know if you want the car . ' ' No . He can take it . ' Later , she heard it move off down the drive.  |p2I0  She lay thinking of Gertrude , her quick wits , her shrewd eyes , and of man 's native transparency . Why do I care what she thinks or suspects ? I have no more illusions , ' she said aloud presently . Talking to myself ; she thought , like an old woman . For a moment she wished that she soon could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passions . That would be restful . But then she remembered that she 'd still have her pride . Pride , the most vulnerable , was the imperishable emotion . She recalled what she 'd said to Albert that morning , You still seem to belong to me . ' It was grievously true . I wonder , she mused , if Gertrude could make a fool of him . She was acutely conscious of Gertrude 's mental processes , of the cunning of her sex , of its sly , feline humour . But why did she care ? If her separation from Albert was permanent Was it ? she asked herself . An unanswerable question . All she was certain of was that she must have time . Time to reflect , readjust herself ; weigh values -- She did not fall asleep for over an hour . It was dusk when she awoke . Vesta had come up to say that Albert had telephoned that he would not be home to dinner . So could we have it early ? ' Vesta inquired . When it was over , Bertie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cicily helped the twins with their homework . A struggle with cube root and a battle fought with Caesar against the Aquitanians did much to compose her . It was refreshing to concentrate on figures and syntax . She was in bed before ten , but she did not sleep well , waking after midnight to black hours of despondency , miserably conscious of the empty bed beside her , wishing that she knew if Albert had come in . It was over the breakfast-tray Sis brought up to her next morning  --  on Albert 's suggestion  --  that she realized it was Sunday and that some people from town were coming out top2IIluncheon , with Alan and Sally MacLeod and Avery Caldwell . She had invited them ten days before . She had given the order to Vesta yesterday , before writing to Uncle Alden , then completely forgotten it . The mere thought of a party filled her with dismay . She had an odd feeling that the house was in mourning . But she could n't put them off . No excuse was conceivable . However , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily and naturally , as she worked in the kitchen , helping Vesta with the luncheon , set the table in the dining-room and arranged a few flowers . Her guests came at one , and she found them a little likeube root and Caesar  --  they distracted her from her misery . She felt a slight rise in her spirits as she greeted them and noticed in Albert a similar reaction . Queer that such contacts , superficial and social , should lighten a melancholy deeply rooted in reality . Her gaiety , however , was very short-lived . When the women were taking off their wraps in her bedroom , lly asked a question that she had not anticipated . Why are we p here ? Have you house guests , Cicily ? ' A harmless question . One perfectly natural from a guest who ew the house as did Sally MacLeod . ' No . ' Cicily offered no further explanation . Sally seemed satisfied . She was always good-natured . She had imagination in kindly control . Besides , there was nothing to in the bedroom  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was suddenly troubled . She was thinking of ry , the marital cynic , taking off his overcoat in the guestroom nstairs . Albert had innocently led the men into it . She shouldwarned him . But you could n't think of everything . Avery  --  &l; people ! He would note every trace of Albert 's occupation . simply could n't miss the story of a room . The very decor was him a revelation . He 'd often said so , laughing a little at hisp2I2 intuitive perception . He had a mind like a woman 's  --  which helped him to plan such satisfactory houses  --  and a tongue like one , too  --  which made him good company . She could not detect from his subsequent behaviour that he had noticed anything . But she was not deceived . She tried to tell herself that it really did n't matter . Everyone in Lakewood would find out eventually . Someone would tell Gertrude  --  if Albert had n't . She found herself thinking morosely of Belle . Her husband 's first wife might well listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poetic justice . Would she tell it to Aunt Isabel ? Would Aunt Isabel tell Mumsy and even Aunt Muriel ? Would anyone have the courage to whisper it to Dad ? Life was so different from fiction or a play . In novels , on the stage , wives forbade their husbands their bedrooms with dignity . But they did n't live in Lakewood , where your private affairs were belled by the Town Crier . How could she have hoped that pride could be preserved or reticence respected in such a community ? She had been subjected to its gossip before . But that had been different . When the startling news of her separation from Jack had swept over the village like a prairie fire , she had been protected by Albert 's devotion , anaesthetized by it to a total indifference toward curious neighbours . Now the same heads would shake and the same tongues would wag And the drug had worn off , she told herself bitterly . She found herself longing for a breath of the sophistication  --  European and decadent  --  that twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests had gone in the late afternoon , she turned at once to Albert , to ask anxiously , awkwardly , Did Avery say anything ? ' Say anything ? ' he repeated.  |p213About  your being downstairs . ' He raised his dark eyebrows in complete stupefaction . ' Of course not . Why should he ? What are you thinking of ? ' Albertwas sincerely a man of the world . But no man of the world could understand Lakewood . ' I 'm thinking of the things he 's now saying to Sally . ' For Avery had walked down the street with the MacLeods . In his eyes blank amazement was turning to compassion . ' Mydear , if they 're vulgar , you must n't let them trouble you . ' The compassion had touched her , but his point was absurd . ' It 's the vulgar things , Albert , that are always most troublesome . ' ' But not really important . ' ' I do n't want to be the talk of the town . ' ' This town talks easily . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You know how you can silence it . ' She felt herself blushing , curiously embarrassed by the smile in his eyes . As if Albert were a stranger . The strangeness had affected her tiniest capillaries . But she conquered the weakness . *Yes . But I wo n't , ' she said , very calmly . ' Cicily ' He moved nearer . ' I 've been wanting to talk toyou -- 'There 's nothing to say on that subject , ' she informed him , ' that I would care to listen to . ' ' Cicily ' But she turned from him . ' I 'm going upstairs . ' An emotional shock can split the mind curiously , stunningmain parts of it , stimulating others to abnormal agitation . Thep214overwhelming fact of Albert 's betrayal , convulsing her life and forcing action upon her , had dominated Cicily like an hysterical obsession , excluding all other premonitions of woe . But the mind can recover , like the body , from disaster . The stunned parts revive , thoughts leap into consciousness , changing the focus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when she was undressing for bed that evening that Cicily was possessed by the fear of Mr. Doty . It sprang upon her suddenly from some lair in her subconscious , like a beast from a jungle . She had n't been thinking of him . Then , instantly , he was there . He appeared as a menace . How could she , she wondered , have been so easily reassured about him ? How could Albert be sure just what he would do ? Why was Fox so certain that he would accept settlement ? Nothing was certain , until it was accomplished . He might change his mind , determine upon vengeance --  Shetried to control herself , to visualize Doty as a clerk in an office , a pathetic little man at work at an adding machine  --  as Ed Brown had described him  --  hoping thus to denude him of his terrible power . But she could not succeed . He remained the avenger . Delay was very dangerous . Uncle Alden would not yet have received her letter . She should have air-mailed it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table byher bed , then glanced at her wrist watch . Eleven o'clock , midnightin Boston . She had a vivid vision of her grandfather 's house , dark and silent on Beacon Street  --  of her elderly uncle , roused from his sleep , testy , inquisitive , slightly hard of hearingNo , the letter would be better . It would arrive in the first morning mail . She thought of reaching Fox , even went so far as to look up his number , then was checked by the horror of having to discuss with him her husband 's deception . Fox did n't even know that she knew she was deceived.  |p215She  stood by her bed , twisting her hands in helpless indecision . Why had Albert rushed back to Lakewood , yesterday morning , without talking with his lawyer ? But she knew why he had . To deceive her again , if it was humanly possible . But why had he let the week-end elapse , without arranging a meeting ? Every moment was precious . Or so it seemed to her , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . Fox might do something , even at that hour . Call up Doty and tell him that his money would be ready He should have , at anyrate , full information . Arriving at this decision , she opened her door . The hall was pitch-black , the stairs a well of darkness . She had hoped that Albert might be still in the living-room , where she had Icft him half an hour before . She had let John and Sis stay up till half-past ten  --  an unheard-of indulgence  --  in order not to be alone with him . When they had run upstairs , he had said , ' Can we talk ? ' But she had replied , ' Not tonight . I 'm too tired . ' Now she snapped on the light and descended the staircase . In the dark lower hall she tapped on his door . An instant of silenceas as audible as sound . Then she heard his quick step and herew the door open , standing in his shirt-sleeves , very much surscd . ' Albert , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said quietly . She pulled her wrapper around her , knotting its sash with nick , nervous fingers , stepped over the threshold and heard him se the door . ' Sweet  --  you must n't worry . ' He appeared at her elbow . ' I ca n't help it . ' She frowned and moved a little away from him , ruptly aware of what he might be thinking . ' I 've been worrying ) ut Doty . ' P216Doty ? ' That had checked him . Why Doty ? ' he inquired . She poured out her fears . He listened , then interrupted , Dear  --  you do think me an utter fool . I saw Fox yesterday . ' Relief flooded over her . Y-yesterday ? ' she stammered . Certainly , darling . ' Cicily sat down on the nearest chair . I drove in town in the car and caught him at his apartment . His office is closed on Saturday afternoons . I told him  --  what you 'd done . ' His voice sank lower . But nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't . Then we got hold of Doty . He 'd hired a lawyer  --  a dogged little man . So it was quite a conference . Fox opened his office . We were there from five to seven . But everything 's fixed up . There 's nothing more to worry about . He 's taking twenty-two thousand . I had dinner with Fox and drove out later , all set to tell you . But you 'd gone to bed . ' Cicily stared up at him . She wanted to cry . Oh , Albert , ' she gasped , I 'm so glad  --  so relieved . I thought you 'd gone riding  --  riding with Gertrude . ' The name had slipped out on th breath of her deliverance from double anxiety . With Gertrude ? ' he repeated , his glance fixed on her sharply . You thought that I dined there ? Spent the evening ? Oh Cicily  --  ! ' You told Robin so , ' she faltered , feeling foolish . That I dined with Gertrude ? ' His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Would you have wanted me to tell him that I was going to my lawyer ? ' He made the point with severity . You might have told me . ' He looked honestly puzzled . Sweet  --  you 're an angel . Th goes without saying . An angel of magnanimity . But whP217chance have you given me to tell you anything ? After luncheon yesterday , you went straight to your room . I could n't follow you . You 'd just thrown me out of it . This morning you would n't look at me  --  entrenched yourself with Vesta . Those damn people came  --  and went , after an eternity . And again you walked out on me . This evening you kept the children downstairs . I could only conclude that you were simply fed up with it . And through with me , definitely . Did n't want to hear how I wriggled before Doty . Would pay  --  that was all . ' After a brief pause , ' Albert , ' said Cicily , slowly and shakily , you did me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through ? Not fed up ? ' he asked eagerly . ' I do n't know , Albert . I do n't know , at all . ' ' But  --  what 's in your mind ? I mean ' ' Nothing  --  but misery . Inchoate misery . But out of it , maybe , will come some definite plan . Just now , I 'm determined to go on as we 're going . It 's the only thing possible ' ' Sweet  --  it 's impossible . ' ' I do n't agree , Albert . ' ' Our marriage will smash . ' ' Perhaps it has smashed . ' ' Darling , that 's nonsense ! We still love each other . If we d n't , we would n't be so utterly miserable . ' She thought that was true , but it brought her no comfort . our way of loving is intolerable , Albert . I really ca n't stand it . ' rose to her feet . ' Now , I 'm going to go . ' ' Cicily , sweetheart  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleaded with her . She shook her head solemnly and moved toward the door. ing down at its knob , she said , somewhat awkwardly : ' But Iwe can learn to  --  to take it more naturally . I mean  --    these two days have been terribly hard . I do n't like to feel that I have to avoid you . It 's absurd , but I 'm confused when I find myself alone with you . We really must start on a different basis . We must n't be emotional . ' He was smiling a little . Sancta simplicitas ! It wo n't work , little Puritan . ' It will , for me . ' She opened the door . For me , it will be hell . ' I 'm sorry , ' she said simply . Good night , ' she added . Oh , a lovely night ! ' His abrupt laugh arrested her . It soundedso unhappy . He stepped quickly in front of her and caught her bythe arms . Why did you come down here ? ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly : You know why I came . Because I was worried . Up there , alone . Albert and his angel . Alone in hell together . ' Please let me go , Albert . ' Her utter passivity compelled him to release her . But he went on , savagely : The angel of the purse strings . Saints and their symbols . I can see you , sweet , in a stained-glass window , with a halo and wings and a palm for a martyr  --  and a fat little money bag in your other hand . It will seem very queer . I 'm sure I do n't know why . A man and an angel could make a fine hell together . They have all the ingredients -- But by this time Cicily had run down the hall . Mrs. Lancaster , ' said Vesta , it 's Mr. Carver . ' Cicily had feared that it might be her mother . A momen before , she had heard the ring of the bell . She was fitting in h bedroom , darning Robin 's stockings and telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never grew tired of and which she could repeat mechanically from memory . She had spent that miserable Monday in a stern endeavour to pull herself together , but she was not yet ready to face Mumsy 's observation . ' Mr. Carver ? ' she repeated , on an accent of astonishment . Her father never made an afternoon call . His habits were fixed  --  had been fixed for thirty years . He always took the train that reached Lakewood at five-fifty and , weather permitting , walked up from the station . She glanced at her wrist watch . It was halfpastfour . ' I said I 'd get you , ' said Vesta informally . ' He went into the living-room . ' Cicily could not teach Vesta to be careful about pronouns . ' I want to see Grandpa ! ' shrilled Bertie delightedly . Of course you can see him . ' Bet-tie hopped gaily before her downstairs . When she entered the living-room , he was on his grandfather 's shoulder . Stephen Carver and his grandchildren were very good ends . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm awfully glad to see you . ' t the brightness was tarnished by an undertone of reserve . The on for this visit perplexed and disturbed her . ' I 'll ring for e tea . ' ' No tea , thank you . ' He put Bertie down and smiled at his ughter . Dad 's such a poker-face she thought uneasily . ' A drink ? ' suggested . ' How about a highball ? ' ' I think that would be fine . ' She left Bertie with him , while she set a tray with the Scotch and the White Rock and the ice and two glasses . She was conedthat her father had something on his mind .   She was right about that . As she returned to the living-room , Now you run away , Mouse , ' he said cheerfully to Bertie . I want to talk to your mother . ' It was like Dad to say it so simply and promptly . In the silence that followed the child 's reluctant departure , Cicily mixed the highballs . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she handed him his drink , he said calmly , appallingly , Cicily , I 've had a wire from Alden . ' She said nothing , struck dumb by surprise and consternation . This was a complication she had not foreseen . It had never crossed her mind that her uncle might communicate with his younger brother , and she hated him for it  --  the silly old man ! This was what came of doing business with your family . Families were incorrigible . Uncles thought you a child . They might be bank presidents , men of affairs and professional discretion , but in dealing with nieces they ignored business ethics A day letter , ' her father amplified mildly . He seems to be disturbed about you . ' She walked over to the table to take her drink from the tray . I need it , she thought , gulping down a great swallow of the whiskey and water , as her father continued , I came here to see just what was the trouble . ' There is n't any trouble , ' said Cicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent blue eyes . Her own were as blue and almost as innocent . But her eyelids fluttered . Elderly , lean , with that high , bald forehead that made him look at once intellectual and ingenuous , and his unassuming air of unconscious authority , he sat in the armchair , waiting and looking . The silence grew strained and Cicily broke it . I  --  I just wanted the money . ' P22ITwenty-five thousand ? ' It 's mine , ' she reminded him . Oh , certainly . Yes . But it 's quite a large sum . You 'll sell at a sacrifice . I think that that bank stock will pay dividends in the spring . If so , it will rise . ' I want it now , ' said Cicily . Yes , ' he said again . Then , after a moment , Alden mentioned debts . Have you let bills run , Cicily ? ' Facing those eyes and the probity in them  --  which her own oddly mirrored as she longed to deceive him  --  a lie seemed impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said her father . At least , I did n't believe that they could have run up into thousands . Have you been playing the market ? That 's foolish , my child . ' I have n't been , ' said Cicily . Has Albert ? ' he inquired . No , ' she said quickly , alarmed as that name slipped into the discussion . Has he been gambling ? ' Of course not , Dad . ' Borrowing ? ' No . ' He looked somewhat puzzled , but by no means satisfied . ' Has he  --  or have you  --  any thought of reinvestment ? I wondered if you 'd heard of some get-rich-quick scheme . If so , you 'd better tell me . They seldom pan out . I 'd be glad to investigate . ' She shook her head stubbornly . I  --  just wanted it , ' she repeated . Then there was a moment of uncomfortable silence . Her other looked down at the drink in his hand . He shook it a little ,   tinkling the ice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well  --  I 'll take it up with Albert . ' On that she burst out with Dad  --  if you do , I 'll never forgive you ! ' He looked up sharply and held her eyes for an instant . Does n't he know that you wrote for the money ? ' Of course he does , Dad . You 're simply hysterical . ' Did you write at his suggestion ? ' Not at all . I offered . ' The admission had slipped out in defence of her husband and it instantly terminated one phase of the discussion . Her father stood up , with an elderly man 's deliberation , set his glass on the mantel-shelf and put his hands in his pockets . Then he 's in some scrape . I 'll see him tonight . ' Dad  --  really  --  I beg of you --  You must n't . It 's all over . ' All over but paying out twenty-five thousand dollars ? ' She felt like a fool . Dad , please do n't mix in . He 's seen LouisFox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the lawyer seemed to dumbfound him . Louis Fox ? ' he repeated . He 's advised  --  us , ' she said , selecting with care and a breath of hesitation the safe plural pronoun . It made no impression upon her father . His cheeks slowly reddened and his eyes were very stern . He asked in a voice that his daughter had never heard , Is Albert involved in a mess with a woman ? ' She was n't prepared  --  she had n't expected it  --  but she raised her head proudly . Why do you ask that ? ' Because I think it more likely to have occurred than embezzlement , ' he said , with grim emphasis . She turned helplessly away from him . P223Cicily , answer me . ' Well  --  it was n't embezzlement , ' she said , very low . She heard him step forward , felt his hand on her shoulder . ' Cicily  --  my child ' His voice broke huskily . Do you wantto come home ? To me and your mother ? ' No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , still turning away from him . It 's hard to explain , but all that I want is  --  for you not to do anything . ' Child  --  that 's impossible . There 's a great deal to do . ' Fox will do it . ' Does he know the facts ? ' Oh , yes , ' she said tonelessly . Will you tell them to me ? ' Dad , what 's the use ? ' She pulled nervously away from him . I do n't want to go into it . We 've had a bad time . I 'm still pretty miserable  --  ' His hand dropped from her shoulder and he walked back to the fireplace . Dad  --  please do n't worry , ' she said ineffectually . On the hearthrug , he faced her . Have you made up your mind ? ' To what ? ' She was puzzled . To stick . To stand by him . ' Yes . ' Is he worth it ? ' He 's worth it to me . ' He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered why she had answered that last question sounequivocably . For was Albert worth it ? She was not quite sure . Her father was speaking . Do you want me to give you thetwenty-five thousand ? ' She controlled her surprise . It is n't quite that , ' she said , as if it mattered . And I do n't , Dad . Really . '   That , too , he accepted . Just stood looking at her gravely . You see  --  it 's my affair . In a way , ' she amended . That seemed to awake in him a certain grim humour . A gleam showed in his eyes that was clearly that of pride . Cicily , ' he said , there was a time when I thought that you did n't show much character . When you divorced Jack  --  well , I told you my views . But now  --  ' He paused and Cicily knew that he was struggling with the diffidence that was his inheritance from his native New England . It always made it hard for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that diffidence in emotional moments . The light touch overcame it . And now I 've reformed ? ' she suggested , smiling . Very much so . ' He nodded . Of course , you may be foolish . I 'm going to call up Fox and ask him just one thing . ' What ? ' she asked breathlessly . If he 's sure that he 's right . I 'll take his word for it . I wo n't go into particulars . Albert need never know that we 've had this conversation , if that 's the way you want it . I wo n't tell your mother . ' At the mention of Mumsy , he stopped , looked aghast . Good Lord , what time is it ? ' He pulled out his watch , an oldfashioneddouble-cased one , and snapped it open . I 've got to be going . It 's a quarter to six and I want her to think I walked up from my train . I planned that ahead . It 's hard to deceive her and I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brought Cicily 's tears . P225STEPHEN CARVER did not linger to console his daughter . There , child , ' he said , as he patted her shoulder , ' you 're a good girl , a brave girl , and you must n't break down . For I have to leave you . I do n't want your mother to know about this . It would worry her dreadfully . If I 'm late she 'll wonder . She might ask where I 've been . I 'll call you in the morning . From the office , I mean Wiping her eyes , Cicily had smiled at this novice in deception who was her grey-haired father . As a matter of fact , she had wanted him to go . Albert , at that moment , might be walking up from the station . If he found them together , like Mumsy , he 'd wonder ; and her father 's discretion might be strained to the breakingpoint . Their future relations  --  if they were to seem amicable - depended on the assumption that the latter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone , she remembered that Bertie had seen his grandfather . She must tell him not to mention it . She found him eating his cereal and his apple sauce in the pantry , for he still had supper early , spread on a tray . Under cover of the whirr of Vesta 's eggbeater in the kitchen , she whispered conspiratorially , ' It 's a secret from Daddy . A surprise . You must n't tell him . ' The innocent faith of her little accomplice pricked Cicily 's con-P226science . Like Christmas , ' he suggested , his dark eyes dancing . It seemed shameful and sordid to make use of a child . She walked back into the living-room , thinking how little her own deceit troubled her and remembering the days when a thought concealed from Albert had seemed a major disloyalty . Presently she heard his latchkey in the door . Cicily ? ' he called , as soon as he 'd opened it . I 'm here . In the living-room . ' She wondered if he 'd notice the traces of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the room . Not yet , ' she said falsely . Then , as his face fell . Has anythinghappened ? ' Oh , no . Not at all . Fox is drawing up the papers . ' He moved a little nearer . Why , sweet  --  have you been crying ? ' Denial would be absurd , so she took refuge in severity . I have plenty to cry about . ' He gazed at her helplessly across the gulf of their estrangement . Why do you torment yourself ? ' How ? ' she asked harshly . He shrugged and turned away from her , unwilling , apparently , to be led into a quarrel . He sat down in the armchair and opened the evening paper . Its pages crackled in the silence before he answered her question . Very unnecessarily  --  by tormenting me . ' Before noon the next day , her father called her on the telephone . I 've talked with Fox , ' he said briefly , and wired to Alden . He 'll send you the money . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cicily , with equal brevity . She hoped that her father would tell her no more . His words had implied that FoxP227had been convincing , but she did n't want to know if he 'd mentionedHarold Doty . You 're sure you do n't want me to have a word with Albert ? ' he asked very briskly , avoiding emotion . I 'd like to , ' he added . Oh , no , Dad  --  please . ' Very well . ' He accepted it . How are you feeling ? ' Much better . Really . Did Mumsy suspect anything ? ' I think that she knew I had something on my mind . ' About me ? ' I do n't think so . We 'll keep her in darkness . ' Stygian , ' said Cicily . Thanks a lot , Dad . ' Good-bye . ' The very next morning , before breakfast was over , the check arrived from Uncle Alden  --  Air Mail , Special Delivery  --  accompanied by a letter expressing shocked disapproval . Cicily rndorsed it , before Albert left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of green paper , with her name and her husband 's written on the back of it in her small , square handwriting , could avert disaster . She had to force herself to realize that it signified a transference of property of very considerable value . As she handed it to Albert , she had no sense of loss . But he , in accepting it , seemed to realize everything . The humblest gratitude shone in his eyes . Do n't make a speech , ' said Cicily hastily . And then they both laughed . I t was very assuaging to laugh again with Albert . Cicily immediatelyfelt more at ease . That laughter marked a moment when " fit seemed quite possible that they might achieve a relationship that was friendly and affectionate  --  and nothing more disturbing . And even maintain it . Albert did nothing to shatter this illusion . He seemed ready , at last , to accept her as a friend . A friend and a partner , to be kept scrupulously informed of the events that followed . That very evening he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reported his departure for his native Waukesha . He had brought home a check for three thousand dollars and ventured a smile , as he said , Here 's your change . ' What about Fox 's bill ? ' Cicily asked anxiously . I 'll settle that myself , ' he was eager to assure her . It 's not very large . ' Finally , one evening when the children were busy with their home work in the dining-room and Cicily sat by the living-room fire , Ivy left for New York today , ' he informed her casually . She could not help asking , Did you see her off ? ' No . I had lunch with her , ' he volunteered calmly . Again she faced the fact that Albert had once emphasized  --  the truth could be unpleasant . She asked , Was that necessary ? ' her voice a trifle sharp . He answered , It was kind . ' She could not deny that . A man owed his former mistress the courtesy of kindness . But she resented this glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivy at a little restaurant table and imagined their talk , coloured by the intimacies that had existed between them , she felt an aversion , profound and instinctive , to all irregular relationships , a horror of the persistence of the memories that must follow them . I 'm glad you were kind , ' she said , somewhat stiffly and very untruthfully . Then suddenly anguish welled up within her and , after a moment of painful irresolution , she asked , Albert  --  does she still love you ? ' with pitiful intensity . The question surprised and a little embarrassed him . Well , ' he said awkwardly , not as she did . '  |p229The  implication that she had , and with passion , shook Cicily , almost as if she had not known it before . But Albert was continuing , his embarrassment conquered . I think she 's very fond of me . She 's a nice , friendly girl . But she 's sensible and ambitious . She 's ready for New York . Excited by the thought of it . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's going to divorce her for desertion and that suits her exactly . She wants to be free . ' Cicily sat silent , trying to visualize the woman he had described . I t seemed strange to her , now , that she had never seen Ivy . She wished she could have managed it , remaining unseen . Men were so queer . They could fall in love with anything . Ivy might be cheap . And again , she might be lovely . Whatever she was , she would remain an enigma . As a portrait of the woman who had perhaps wrecked her marriage , the grotesque , glossy photograph that Ed Brown had displayed last year in his office was hopelessly inadequate . That fair-haired girl , with a Hollywood bob and mascara-lashed eyes and a pearly-toothed smile and a slim , supple body encased in a corset was  --  merely an advertisement . Ivy Doty . Film-Form Foundations with Grip-It Garters . ' The whiteinkedlegend swam before Cicily 's eyes . It was hard to construct , from her memory of that photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered from loving , who was sensible and ambitious and who wanted to be free . In fact , it was impossible . The girl in the photograph remained Miss Wisconsin , the Beauty Queen of Waukesha , the wife of an accountant who had an Adam 's apple . A ridiculous couple , both figures of fun . The Ivy who had possessed Albert and the Doty of doom seemed very different people . She could not merge their identities . Albert inquired , What are you thinking of ? ' with a touch of anxiety .   I 'm thinking of you , ' she said , lunching with Ivy . ' Would you rather I had n't told you ? ' His tone was solicitous . But Cicily pricked that bubble of solicitude . It 's not what you tell , Albert . It 's what you do . ' The distinction she had drawn did not seem to impress him . You said you liked the truth , ' he reminded her plaintively . I told you once before that I knew that you would n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never occurred to you that you might make the truth agreeable ? ' His eyes glinted faintly with a spark of humour . Ah , that , ' he informed her , is difficult to do . ' This philosophy of his , she came slowly to realize , was sincere and immutable . Unnatural as it seemed , it was natural to Albert . It was based on an acceptance , at once amiable and cynical , of the frailties of human nature and the profound conviction that you could do nothing about them . It might have been strengthenedby his experience with women , but it could not be dismissed as bravado or vanity . It was a way of meeting life , of gliding out of difficulties , of preserving the integrity of his happy nature , of protecting those around him from disillusion or pain . Unfortunately , when combined with a philandering temperament , it put a wife 's happiness out of the question . She thought of it as constantly as she did of his unfaithfulness . He had complied , for the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his nature . She knew very well that he would never change . He would remain what he was and what he had always been  --  as she now saw clearly  --  a man peculiarly susceptible to the pleasure to be found in women and possessed ofp231fascinations that they would not withstand . Some of them , anyway , and these the most dangerous and possibly the pleasantest . All this he would consider his private concern , outside a wife 's province , to be concealed from her if possible . For the first time it seemed to her sinister and significant that she knew nothing about the affairs he might have had  --  indeed , must have had  --  with women before he married her . He had told her very little about his life with Belle . That reservation she honestly respected . It was only decent reticence . But he might have touched lightly on his ether adventures . However , he had n't . Albert , she thought gloomily , would never kiss and tell . The virtue of a lover became the vice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapture , when they were first married , he had not once been tempted to intimate confidence . He did not seem to need it to wash his spirit clean . In the days that followed the departure of Ivy , it was this trait of his , this gift of secretiveness , of cheerful omission , that made it very hard to know what he was thinking . For if he did n't care to , t he would never , never say . Now that everything was settled , it became as clear as crystal  --  though perfectly preposterous  --  that he did n't intend to utter another awkward word about either of the Dotys . This disconcerted Cicily , for she had assumed that her own sharp resentment would be the only barrier to further discussion of his deplorable behaviour . She could n't bring it up without seeming to nag him , or else  --  which was worse  --  to hint of reconciliation . As the weeks went by , her dream of a relationshipthat would be friendly and affectionate and nothing more disturbing resolved itself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed on him , her husband seemed rather an acquaintance than a friend . A pleasant acquaintance , polite and obliging . A trifle silent . But nothing more personal . I Albert was not suited to a Platonic role . Neither was she , though she was slower to admit it . It exasperated her to remember his sagacious comment , Sancta simplicitas ! It wo n't work , little Puritan . ' His very civility rasped her nerves . All this was futile and dangerous and undignified . It terrified Cicily in moments of introspection . Sometimes she honestly regretted her stand . But how could she relent when he had ceased to ask her to ? Albert had wearied of playing the penitent . Or perhaps he merely felt that there was nothing more to say . He did n't seem to care in the least for appearances . He very soon abandonedthe fiction of his cold . He offered no explanation to the children  --  or to Vesta  --  of his continued occupation of the downstairsguestroom . And nobody questioned it . Except as it was questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staircase every evening at bedtime , she became increasingly conscious of the suspense of the moment . Then , to her secret sense of humiliation , Ivy Doty , Audrey Diston , and Gertrude Sewall  --  with whom Albert , at parties , had resumed his careless banter  --  seemed strangely unimportant . Nothing was important but the beating of her heart . The blood pulsed in her throat and sang in her ears , for there was always the chance , chimerical but breathless , that Albert might speak and implore her to listen . If he did , she might refuse , perversely and exultantly ; but of this she was not certain , for her husband never tested her . He remained , at such moments , to all outward appearances , unmoved by the drama of her foot on the stair and her hand on the banister  --  which she sometimes prolonged for a perceptible instant , looking down at him wistfully as he stood by the newel post , handsome , unconscious , composed , and debonair . She had other worries to disturb and perplex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . They seemed graduallyp233to sense the discordance in the atmosphere , which arrested and puzzled them as something new and queer . More than once , Sis and Robin had opened wide eyes , as she spoke to Albert with curt irritation . Bertie had asked , Mummy  --  why were you cross ? ' John 's eyes seemed to watch her with reflective intensity and they sometimes glanced at Albert with deliberate hostility . Cicily was conscious of her eldest son 's championship in matters that were far beyond his youthful understanding . But just what John knew , or even what he was discovering , about emotional disturbances of which he had better be ignorant , remained to his mother completely obscure . Mumsy 's mental processes were easier to fathom . In spite of the conspiracy to keep her in darkness , it was not very long that Jane Carver could be deceived to the blissful extent of not noticing that something alarming had occurred in her daughter 's household . Cicily never knew just how she had discovered , or from whom or on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps Sis had mentioned it , or Robin  --  even Bertie . John would n't , she was certain . Of course , it was possible that gossip had reached her . If Avery Caldwell had been rashly articulate about what he saw on that unfortunate Sunday , rumours , already , might be running wild . At any rate , she knew . Cicily was sure of it . As a matter of fact , she might not have been told . She might have drawn her own conclusions from the closed guestroom door ; from the workbox and vase on top of Albert 's bureau ; from the absence there of the photograph of Cicily and Bertie ; above all , from the brightness of her daughter 's manner and the paleness of her face and the rattle of her talk , which fended off confidence and conspicuously deleted all reference to Albert . She tried very hard to keep her brown eyes impersonal and wholly unobservant , but it was n't like Mumsy not to notice what she saw . She did not question Cicily , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to tell . And she would not question Dad . Of that , Cicily was certain . It would not occur to her that he knew more than she did about the distressing situation , for wives dealing with husbands in the realm of the perceptions are always sustained by a feminine sense of superior intuition . And she would not dream of telling him , for she would want to protect him , as he had protected her , from unhappy anxiety . Mumsy seldom wanted a worry to be shared . If Cicily had wished for distraction from these troubles , she could easily have found it . The weeks before Christmas were alwaysgay in Lakewood . The social season was opening in town . Friends in the city took that time to repay , with theatre and opera parties , the hospitality of the summer . In the suburb itself , the young married set , facing the comparative doldrums of the winter , conscientiously organized bridge dinners and cocktail parties and dances at the Country Club . Cicily had always liked that season of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly horrible , with the sun barely up and lights on in the dining-room and a father or a husband a little late for his train . The wintry weather was still a pleasant novelty . Later , it settled down to be definitely a bore . Sometimes there was skating and always the first snowfall , as miraculous as spring and even more ephemeral , its bloom on her hawthorn only lasting a few hours . She liked the excitement of the city in December , with its concerts beginning and its art galleries opening and its crowds of Christmas shoppers jostling on the pavements and its great store windows displaying winter clothes . In town or in country , sheP235had always enjoyed the parties , and in that enjoyment her husband had shared ; to a certain degree , faute-de-mieux as it were , remembering the superior sophistication of the embassies . Social entertainmentwas essential to Albert . If all he could command was the suburban variety , he accepted it indulgently , reserving the right to deride it as provincial . At least , that was the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this month that was saddened by her unhappy meditations , she could hardly believe in the bliss that had been hers . The safety of Lakewood had proved a delusion . Albert carried in himselfthe elements of danger . And she had no heart for gaiety . Parties seemed puerile . Preparing for Christmas was a dreary obligation . She could n't face the irony of her own bedecked reflection in a dressmaker 's mirror . She gave up the concerts , after having wept at one , furtively , desolately , throughout an adagio . Misery , she thought , could be better borne alone . Albert , on the contrary , seemed eager for diversion . Their evenings at home by the living-room fire weighed heavily on his spirits . He made an honest effort to converse with her pleasantly , but there seemed to be increasingly little to say . You could n't say much when the things that you were thinking remained utterly unmentionable . And even that little had a very false ring . I wonder if I bore him ? Cicily often asked herself . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression . Unless it might be his singular silence . At other people 's houses , he always recovered his airy loquacity . Before cocktails were over , he escaped from the spell . He became his old self , to all outward appearances , charming , amusing , gay and light-hearted , and he never seemed ashamed of his sudden transformation . Over the head of the woman he was diverting , his ayes would meet Cicily 's for the fraction of an instant , funny and familiar , as if nothing catastrophic had ever come between them . Sometimes this annoyed her , but more often it awoke in her a fleeting illusion of recaptured happiness and she felt like a wife again , close to him and dear . Then reality swept back and with it new anxiety . Or rather an old one , sharpened to anguish on the steel of experience . For the woman he diverted was apt to be Gertrude Sewall , who , whatever she had heard or whatever she suspected , seemed to sense that Albert was once more at large . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year to Avery Caldwell . But her attitude was rather receptive than aggressive . She had once been rebuffed and she was nobody 's fool . As for Albert 's attitude  --  well , Cicily tried to tell herself that it did n't mean a thing and that she ought to be used to it . Albert merely looked at Gertrude as he looked at every woman not positivelyrepulsive , with a delicate flattery shining in his eyes . How amusing you are ! How really delightful ! ' his glance seemed to comment . It was a reaction as constant as if chemical . And Cicily sometimes thought that Gertrude understood this . She seemed entertained , but faintly derisive . Holding her head back to look at him coolly through the cloud of her cigarette smoke , she might have been applauding a very amusing show . But a show that she had seen and remembered distinctly , which interested her solely from a technical angle . Such applause as this was , Albert responded to it . They drifted together at the early winter parties , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done who liked to play the same game . Watching her husband , searching his features for some betrayal of emotion , Cicily never found it . More than once , at such moments , she became uneasily conscious that Avery Caldwell'sshrewd eyes were fixed on her face with a curious expression , half-compassionate , half-mocking , as if he would warn her againstP237artless transparency . Remembering his perceptions and the opportunityhe had had to indulge them in her guestroom , she pretended not to notice this . His impertinent conclusions seemed very unimportant , as she faced the reality of what he had concluded . I t was one evening at a dinner party , as she watched her husband'sface across the flowers and the candlelight , animated , eager , unaffectedly attractive , that she was fearfully impressed by the risk that she was running . The risk of losing Albert , if she did n't take care . The thought was insufferable that he might ask for hi : freedom . She wondered if the money , her twenty-two thousand that had bought off Doty , would serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it entered his mind . The merest breath of protest on her part would imply that she felt that it had also purchased her husband . He had offered her love , but not in repayment . And she had refused it . Had the option run out or could she renew it ? Should she take the initiative and thrust freedom upon him ? Their present situation was utterly untenable . Her pride would be salvaged if she threw him away . But only a remnant of it , for if it came to divorce she would have to face publicly the bitter humiliation involved in the confession of a second marital failure . And then , there was Bertie . And John 's fragile adolescence , that might be so bruised by another broken marriage . And her own dreary future . It seemed very unfair . For it is n't , she thought wretchedly , as if I 'd done anything . Conscience suggested that she 'd been resentful and obstinate . The resentment was justified . Was the obstinacy wise ? If she broke through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorry But self-respect asserted itself . Sorry forwhat ? she asked herself angrily . Sorry that I objected to his sleeping with Miss Wisconsin ? Obliquely , through the candlelight , she met Avery Caldwell 's eyes .   Cicily ' said Jane , a trifle uncertainly . Yes , ' her daughter answered , not looking up from the table in her bedroom , where she was engaged in wrapping up Christmas presents . Mumsy had come over to discuss the family party , which she was giving in the form of a Christmas luncheon so the children could come to it . She had the connection somewhat on her mind . Steve and Jenny , this year , were remaining in the East , but Aunt Muriel and Ed Brown had , of course , been invited , though the line had been drawn at the Shankses and Hesslers . They were dining in the evening with Aunt Muriel , in town . Mumsy felt rude because she had ignored them and Aunt Isabel presented the same old problem . For if she came to the luncheon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , and her three little girls . Mumsy frankly admitted that she was old-fashioned . Divorce still disturbed her . She did not want to ask Albert to her house with Belle . She had never done so since he had married Cicily . It made her really uncomfortable to see Belle with Cicily and Albert with both of them at other people 's houses . And when all the children were playing together , apparently untroubled by their scrambled parenthood Well , Mumsy did n't like it . Aunt Isabel felt exactly the same way . Then do n't dream of asking them , ' Cicily had said , as much as ten days ago . And Mumsy had n't . But you could see that it troubled her . It would be the second Christmas that she and Aunt Isabel had n't been together . And only the second Christmas in all their long lives . Last year , Belle had met the problem goodnaturedlyby giving a Christmas party and asking her mother to it . Cicily hoped that she would do it again . P239But now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid that she was going to reconsider . She repeated , ' Yes ? ' brightly , in the voice of one brushing trivialities away . In the midst of her dismal preoccupation with Albert , it did seem trivial to be bothered about Aunt Isabel . She looked up from the table toward the chintz-covered wing chair , which her mother had drawn toward the open fire . She was sitting there poking it , though it was burning brightly . For a very long moment , she did not reply . Then she said reluctantly , ' Aunt Isabel telephoned to me this morning . ' ' Darling , ' said Cicily , ' do n't let her worry you . ' She went on cutting her gold and scarlet paper . ' It was about Christmas . ' Jane still poked the fire . ' I 'm sure it was , Mumsy . But really  --  now , listen to me  --  if e came , she would n't like it . ' ' She does n't want to come . ' ' That 's good , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Cicily started , bristled and stared . ' What children ? Mine ? At noon on Christmas Day ? Why , she must be crazy . ' Jane put down the poker and turned to face her daughter . Cicily saw instantly that something was very wrong . Whatever troubled Mumsy , it was certainly not trivial . The thought flashed through her mind , with a pang of compunction , that Aunt Isabeland discovered that she had some mortal malady . She was sixtytwoyears old . It was to be her last Christmas -- said Jane , ' Jack 's coming home . ' ' jack ? ' Cicily sat transfixed . Her hands dropped on her wrappingswith a crackle of paper . The name , as she had sounded it , was a whisper of consternation . ' Mumsy  --  he is n't ! ' P240Her mother nodded solemnly . Aunt Isabel had a letter this morning . He 's going to arrive the day before Christmas . He says he can only stay a few days . Of course , he 's very anxious to see Sis and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They must go to him , ' said Cicily faintly . Will they want to ? ' asked Jane . Oh , dear , yes . They 'll love it . ' Cicily was sure of it . She was already struggling with that serpent of jealousy . Her mother seemed pleased by her ready acquiescence . I do n't know , my dear child , if you 'll care to see him --  ' shebegan , with hesitation . Does he care to see me ? ' He wrote that he did . ' Why , then  --  I 'd love to . ' Cicily had rallied . As a matter of fact , it seemed perfectly intolerable that Jack should turn up , on this of all Christmases , to see her and Albert for the first time since their marriage . What would n't be revealed to his curious eyes ? It seemed a little shabby to accuse Jack of curiosity . Whatever his failings , that had never been one of them . But , after all , he was human . And a superman would be curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aunt Isabel thought you would . ' Her smile was a comment on her sister 's foreboding . And deplored it ? ' grinned Cicily . Well  --  you know we both think such situations deplorable . ' They are  --  rather . ' This unguarded admission had startled her mother and she hastened to qualify it . But not as deplorable as anger and hatefulness . I ca n't see why Jack and I ca n't be friends . ' I hope you will be , ' said her mother promptly . Then , as if to point out the silver lining , Of course , this will make Aunt Isabel'sP241Christmas . She 's planning to have an old-fashioned party , with Jack and Belle and Billy and Belle 's children . If she can have yoursy the day will be perfect . ' The perfection of that day remained to trouble Cicily , long after her mother had left her to go home . It seemed so incredible that she would be absent from that family reunion . Why , I am the family , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be there . And Christmas , without them , simply would n't be Christmas . In spite of Bertie  --  who 'd feel very forlorn . Little and left out , the only child in a party of adults . And she would be wondering , and so would Dad and Mumsy , just what was happening around that other Christmas tree . Wonderingand worrying . She could n't deny that she was worried about John . Would Aunt Isabel say anything , do anything , look anything , that would rouse his resentment against his own mother ? Jack , she was certain , would play a fair game . He ought to be touched that she had brought up his children to be so eager to see him . He undoubtedly would be . But she had a silly feeling that she was delivering them over to the camp of the enemy . When they came in from play in the late afternoon , she called them up to her bedroom . There was really no reason for postponingthe news . She wanted to get it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has asked you all to Christmas luncheon . ' Me ? ' put in Bertie , who was seldom asked anywhere . Cicily stretched out her hand to pull him close to her . No . Not you , Mouse . ' John asked doubtfully , Did she ask you , too ? ' No . She did n't . ' Well , gosh  --  on Christmas Day --  ' he began , somewhat mutinously . P242I thought it was settled that we were going to Grandmother , ' said Sis matter-of-factly . Let 's stick together , ' Robin advised . I 'm afraid that we ca n't , ' said Cicily brightly . I have a surprise for you . Your father 's going to be there . ' Daddy ? ' shrieked Robin . Oh , what a lark ! ' Not really , Mother ? How very exciting ! ' Sis 's face crinkled up in a grin of anticipation . John drew a long breath and his eyes widened , startled , but at first he did n't say anything . Presently , he smiled . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a little . Golly  --  that 's nice , ' he observed inarticulately . Do you know , ' said Robin , I 'd like to take my steam engine and show him how well it works . ' All this excitement was too much for Bertie . His little mouth drooped and his big dark eyes were woe-begone . Mummy , ' he said , I want to go , too . ' Oh , you want to stay with me , ' said Cicily coaxingly . And , of course , with Daddy . ' That seemed rather an afterthought . We 're going to go to Grandmother 's and I think she 'll have a tree . Granny Muriel will be there . You want to see her , do n't you ? ' For Aunt Muriel indulged her only grandson beyond reason . But Bertie said stolidly , I 'd rather see Him . ' His accent had supplied the pronoun with a capital and it rather nettled Cicily . I 'm afraid you ca n't , dear , ' she said briefly . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't you like to ? ' Before Cicily could reply to this blunt interrogation , everyone heard the opening of a door . The opening and the closing of the front door downstairs , and Albert 's quick tread as he entered the hall.  |p243Robin  was wound up . He shrieked out irrepressibly , Oh , Uncle Albert ! The most exciting thing 's happened ! ' What has , Tough Guy ? ' called Albert , good-naturedly . Come up here and hear about it ! ' Robin yelled in reply . It was while Cicily , rigid in her chair , heard Albert 's light footstepsascending the staircase that she became unhappily aware that Bertie was crying . He was crying very softly , his face pressed to her sleeve , his tears soaking through it and wetting her arm . Where are you ? ' called Albert , from the top of the stair . We 're here  --  in Mother 's room . ' Cicily was trying to dry Bertie 's tears , but she heard Albert hesitate , stand still , make no sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm . At least , almost in . Albert stopped on the threshold . What do you think 's happened ? ' Robin was shouting , with really the full force of his ten-year-old lungs . Daddy 's coming to town ! He 'll be here on Christmas Day ! We 're going to have lunch with him ! ' Cicily thought that Albert took it remarkably well . His face tightened perceptibly , perhaps he even blinked in the shock of his surprise , but almost instantaneously he smiled down at his stepson . Is he , really ? Well , that will be fun . Is he coming to your grand-mother 's ? ' No . We 're going to Granny Isabel 's . ' Who is ? Not we ? ' He arched an incredulous eyebrow at Cicily . Oh , no . Just the children . ' What 's Bertie crying for ? ' The child raised a wet , flushed face to answer . I want to go  --  too . ' He had gulped down a sob with the last word he uttered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , you poor little shaver ! ' With that , he crossed the threshold . He walked straight over to Cicily 's side . He picked up his son and set him on his shoulder . See here  --  we Lancasters never , never cry . Do n't let them get you down , Mouse . The world is very wide . It 's proverbially full of a number of things that are much more amusing than other people 's fathers . Even your own father is sometimes a bore . Not always , however . Sometimes he 's around when a feller needs a friend --  ' By this time , Sis and Robin were laughinghilariously . Caught by the contagion , Bertie giggled through his tears . That 's better , Mouse . You 're coming down with me to look at the funnies in the evening paper . ' He walked , as he spoke , with the child to the door . We 'll have to hurry , for it 's almost your suppertime . Maybe you can have it with me in the living-room . Duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand airily to the other children and disappeared into the hall . Cicily could hear his footsteps on the stairs , falling a little heavier because of the weight of his son ; falling , it seemed to her , on her very heart . She was tremendously moved by the silly little scene that had just been enacted . What had Miss Sadie said , on the day of revelation ? That 's one side of him . ' It was touchingly true . Sis said briskly : Was n't he funny ? I 've got to dress for dinner . Robin , your hands are positively filthy . I wish you 'd wash first  --  and get out of the bathroom . ' Then , they left Cicily alone with John . He walked slowly over to her from the corner by the fireplace , where he 'd been standing in silence . Mother , ' he said , would you really like to see him ? ' The directness of this question made Cicily wonder if John had been so lost in his dream of his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of Albert 's intervention Would you ? ' he repeated , with nervous insistence . This was not the moment for prevarication . John , ' she saidP245soberly , I honestly do n't know . I 'd like to , in a way , if we could meet somewhere  --  oh , very far away , where we 'd never been before and where there were no other people . Not even you children . Just meet  --  and talk . But here , as you must have gathered , it 's all rather difficult . It 's even a little awkward . Which is perfectlyabsurd . It ought to be possible for us to be together , quite simply and naturally  --  like very old friends . There 's something between us much closer than friendship . It should n't interfere with other things , at all . I mean , with other people . But I 'm afraid that it would  --  or rather that it might  --  if we talked to each other with any real intimacy . If we talk any other way , it wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like that . So that 's why I think it 's somewhat futile to see him . But I probably will . I think he 'll come to see me . ' John looked frankly puzzled . I do n't see why you ca n't tell him . ' Tell him what , dear ? ' She smiled up at him . Just what you 've told me . ' She pointed out the fallacy . But , John , do n't you see ? That would be the real intimacy . You 're taking it for granted . I doubt if we achieve it . ' He seemed to accept that , frowning a little , obviously doing his best to understand . All right  --  if you say so . But it does seem queer to me . ' Then , after a moment , Do you think he would n't  --  like it ? ' The break in his voice made her want to reassure him . Oh , I 'm quite sure he would . ' The reassurance had done nothing to lighten his perplexity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked a little embarrassed . Abandoning the suggestion , he moved off toward the door . On the threshold , he paused and looked back at her , smiling . That wide , happy smile again . But now it did not trouble her . I intend to be intimate with him  --  if I can . ' P246I WONDER , mused Cicily , staring in her mirror , if I look much older . I never had colour . I 'm thin as a rail . Thinner than I used to be . In the last five weeks , I 've lost eight pounds . It 's not sleeping , of course , and not bothering about lunch and thinkingtoo much . What I look is worn . As if I 'd been through things . That , she thought in a panic , is the very last impression I care to convey . She outlined her lips with a double streak of scarlet and felt better immediately . Thank God for lipstick ! Jack had always hated it . At least , on his wife . On other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or another . If he noticed it this afternoon  --  well , what would it prove ? I 'm not lipsticking for him , she told herself bravely , but for my own self-respect . At that , she reflected , as she rose from her dressing-table , I really do n't think I look quite as old as Belle . The reflection arrested her , for it struck her as queer that Belle still rose from her subconscious as a woman to compete with . Jack would n't count his sister 's grey hairs . Albert had relegated her to the periphery of his consciousness . They were no longer rivals . She walked over to her window and glanced out at the street , nervously , expectantly . Four o'clock , Jack had said , making it early , perhaps to avoid Albert . He had called her up instantly , on arriving in town . The day before Christmas , at ten o'clockP247in the morning , she had answered the telephone without the slightest presentiment . His voice had been a shock to her , soundingso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cicily ?  --  It 's Jack . I 'm here  --  Oh , I 'm feeling fine . Ca n't wait to see the children . You were good to let me have them  --  Yes , you were good , Cicily . When can I see you ?  --  Well , only a flew days . I expect to go back Friday  --  Fine . Wednesday afternoon . Day after tomorrow . Shall I come out to Lakewood  --  Would four be too early ? ' So easily it was settled . So quite without awkwardness . But the timbre of Jack 's tone had rolled seven years away . She had said to Albert , after dinner , Jack called up this morning . He 's coming to tea , Wednesday . ' Albert said amiably , Well , give him a time . ' The words that she did n't say , Can you be here , too ? ' seemed to sound in the silence . But she was determined to prevent , if she could , Jack 's catching a candid camera shot of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert to deceive him was unthinkable . That was a game she preferred to play alone . More than Jack 's imminence had disturbed her that evening . For days she had been dreading the mere thought of Christmas rEve . The children initiated the simple family ceremonies . The stockings were hung by the chimney-piece in the living-room . Bertie 's letter to Santa Clause was sent up the flue . When Albert sat down on the piano bench with Bertie to play the accompanimentfor the traditional carols , Cicily had been afraid that she Would give way to emotion . She did n't want to listen to the dearold tunes . His hands drifted idly over the keys , as if he shared er reluctance . But when Robin demanded , What shall we sing first ? ' her husband had looked up at her with an impish grin . His fingers were sounding a definite melody . Hark , the herald an-gels si-ing  --  ' The children joined in tumultuously ; Glory to the new-born King ; Peace on earth and mercy mi-ild  --  ' His artless tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; God and sin-ners re-con-ciled ! ' The dear old tune left Cicily utterly unmoved . At least , by the tenderer emotions . And if he had n't farced it , she was thinking , resentfully , I might have made a fool of myself . I might have been in tears . Albert had ceased , abruptly , to sing . His eyes had dropped from Cicily 's stony face to his own nimble fingers . He looked a trifle crestfallen , but he went on playing , with mechanicalvirtuosity , until the children 's repertoire was exhausted . It had been an unfortunate prelude to the filling of the stockings , which took place as soon as the children had gone up to bed . Cicily was reflecting that there were all kinds of a fool . Why had she been so grim about Albert 's little joke ? His mood had changed and there was nothing she could do about it . When the last candy cane and the last chocolate Santa Claus had been pushed into position , he sat down in silence to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still before them . Cicily 's eyes had travelled four times over the same page of the book that she was reading , when Albert lowered the financial sheet to inquire , What would you say to going over to the Country Club and taking in the party ? ' There was always a Christmas Eve dinner dance at the Country Club . Cicily never went to it . Parents seldom did . P249An excuse was at her tongue 's tip . ' We ca n't do that . Bertie might wake up and come down to look for Santa Claus . ' ' He wo n't , Cicily . He 'll sleep like a top . He 's worn out with excitement . Tell Vesta to keep an eye on him . We can come home early . ' It occurred to Cicily that Gertrude Sewall was not a parent . Across the touching row of four bumpy stockings that were pinned to the fender , she eyed Albert narrowly . His face betrayed nothing but a desire for amusement . The impulse that prompted her to say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition . Perhaps she merely wanted to see if he would . ' I do n't like to do that . I never have . ' His eyes met hers sombrely . ' Unless  --  you do n't care . ' There was only one possible answer to that . ' Why , I do n't are at all . Run along and enjoy yourself . I want to go to bed early . ' This placid assertion seemed to provoke him beyond measure . ' Cicily , ' he said , ' you 're the damnedest woman . ' With that , he had risen and walked out of the room . Thinking of it now , as she waited for Jack , staring out of the window at her snow-covered lawn , she was willing to admit that she had wanted to provoke him . She knew that desire was perverse and unwise . After he had gone  --  actually out of the house , without another word for her  --  she had faced her folly alone in her bedroom . She had not heard him come in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning when the children had pulled her down thestaircase to open their stockings  --  though it was barely eightclock  --  he was waiting in the living-room , with a box in his hands . A small , square box , neatly wrapped in gold paper , surmountedwith holly .   Merry Christmas , ' he observed , as he handed it to her . Merry Christmas , ' she 'd repeated . She offered him the packageshe had under her arm . It contained the tan sweater she had knitted for him in November . He unwrapped it at once . Oh , thank you , ' he said . It 's just what I wanted . ' She felt somewhat depressed by these festival rites . Feeling his eyes on her and the wretched constraint of the absurd situation , she had opened his box and , within it , a case of the palest blue leather . A fire-opal pendant met her amazed eyes . It burned on its cushion like a little hot ember , a cluster of sparks turned miraculouslyto stone . It was caught to its chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought instantly , have cost his last penny . On top of Fox 's bill , too . God , why had that occurred to her ? Why , Albert  --  ! ' she gasped . It 's lovely . Too lovely And then , she met his eyes . Was n't there  --  there was  --  a superstition about opals . He read her thought , as if he had been waiting for it . Yes . They 're said to be unlucky . But I hope you will wear it . ' She glanced at the children , but concern was unnecessary . They were opening their presents on the hearth in pandemonium . To bring me bad luck ? I do n't quite understand . ' Certainly not . As a symbol of bravado . Wear it , my dear , with your chin in the air . I shall like to look at you , defying the thunderbolt . That 's what you do , you know . It 's sublime , but ridiculous ' He broke off to ask , You 're not really superstitious ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence , chastity , purity I'I 'm not superstitious , ' said Cicily hastily . The opal was hanging at her throat at that moment , burning on her straight , plain gown of black velvet , sparkling in the rays ( ) I '  |p251the  declining sun . Still possessed by nervousness , she turned from her window and walked out of her bedroom and down the stairs to the living-room . She had put it in order in the early afternoon . Picked up the Christmas things , given Vesta her instructions . Now , she must see that the fire was lighted and the tea-table flawless . From the threshold , in the lamplight , it all looked very charming . The yellow damask curtains were drawn at the windows , anticipating the darkness that would fall in half an hour . The firelight glimmered on the sheen of old walnut , on her polished silver tea-set , on the tall crystal vase that held the dark red roses that had come  --  to her surprise  --  from Avery Caldwell , Christmas morning . And , thought Cicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The room struck her suddenly as a little like a stage . Oddly artificial . Not her familiar living-room . It seemed to be waiting for a scene to transpire . She felt faintly ashamed of the coquetry that had set it , knowing its perfection could only cause Jack pain . It was what he had exchanged for his boarding-house in Denver . I 'm slightly contemptible , she thought . I 'm a woman . Women are never willing to let go . I do n't want to hurt Jack , but my vanity 's too much for me . Even at that moment she was turning out one lamp to enhance the flickering firelight . She glanced at her reflection in the mirror between the windows . Contemptible or not , she felt reassured . Her slim , black figure in the golden room , her fair , frizzy hair , and the pale oval of her face looked really young  --  and pleasing . She turned from the mirror as Vesta entered with the sandwiches . Did you make enough , Vesta ? The children will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Mumsy had been pressed into service in the emergency . Cicily had explained , I want to talk with Jack alone . ' That had made her mother look vaguely troubled , and Cicily had added , I want to discuss the children . So please , Mumsy dear , could you have them for luncheon and bring them back home in the late afternoon ? Jack will want to see you . ' So it had been arranged , to Cicily 's satisfaction . For this was the moment to talk with Jack about John . At Aunt Isabel 's luncheon he had captivated his children . His mechanical information , his success with the steam engine , above all his expressed desire to have them come West to visit him next summer  --  on a ranch , Mummy dear , where we can ride horseback  --  he says we can go camping  --  we 'll each have our own pony '  --  had been volubly described . Bertie still clamoured to see this prodigy among men , although Albert 's Christmas present  --  which had even surprised Cicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trunk of Mumsy 's Christmas tree  --  had done much to console him . Well  --  will he be late ? Cicily was wondering , when she heard the doorbell . And of course he was n't . The hands of her wrist watch were exactly on the hour . Now that he was actually standing on her doorstep , not thirty feet away from her , concealed by lath and plaster , she seemed to comprehend what this meeting might mean to him . Or rather to feel it , with a sudden flood of sympathy . Finding her standing here in this room , where he 'd left her seven years ago , on just such another December afternoon . What had he said ? Well  --  so long , Cicily . Try to take care of yourself . ' That had been a bad moment . Then she heard Vesta , walking down the hall . The front door , opening . Jack 's voice distinctly audible , shatteringly familiar , rising composedly on a note of inquiry , Is Mrs. Lancaster at home ? ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on his lips , before he stood in the doorway . The same old JackP253 --  almost . A little harder and heavier . The same plain face , snub-nosed , bright-eyed , now tanned a reddish brown . Some grey in his hair . New lines about his mouth . The eyes were crinkling up with pleasure at the sight of her . Well  --  Cicily ! ' he said , extending both his hands . She clasped them delightedly . Why , Jack  --  you look fine ! ' She regretted her unconscious accent of surprise , but he only laughed at it . You look all right , yourself . ' Holding her at arm 's length , he took her all in . She thought of the lipstick , for an hysterical instant . In fact , you look marvellous . ' He released her hands , but not at all self-consciously . He stood for a moment , looking around the room , his eyes quick and interested . Nice eyes like Robin 's , small but clear grey , with that trick of crinkling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's not as confused as I am . Funny , ' he said , it seems to me small . But all the East does that . It continually surprises me . I counted the steps from the gate to the door . Same thirty-seven steps , but the lawn had shrunk , somehow . Otherwise , it looks exactly the same . Of course  --  your Chinese things . ' He glanced at the square of brocadeon the piano , her collection of jade , a bowl of Ming porcelainBut they have n't changed the atmosphere . ' He strolled over to the fireplace and dismissed the decor . Did you like China ? ' Oh , very much . ' She sat down at her tea-table . Vesta came in with the silver hot-water kettle . Do you think that there 'll be a real rumpus with Japan ? ' I should n't be surprised . ' The British made a very bad mistake about Manchuria . ' We thought so in Peking . ' This was the way that Belle had first talked with Albert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of tea ? Or maybe a cocktail . How about a Martini ? '   Tea , thank you . ' She was struck by the way that he dropped into his old armchair , without turning around to see if it was there . The chair was a habit , she thought . So was I. Aloud , she asked tranquilly , Two lumps and cream ? ' No . One and lemon , now . I 'm watching my waistline . ' She laughed . But it was thicker . You look very fit . ' Are n't you a little thin ? ' That , ' she said lightly , is the basest flattery . ' Vesta came in with the plate of hot toast . Have some , ' said Cicily . He selected a brown piece , as she remembered he had always done . Settled back in his old posture , with his knees crossed comfortably , his teacup precarious on the arm of the chair . When Vesta had gone , the room seemed to close in on them , intimate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . But Jack in his armchair was doing something to her . In the first place , she seemed to see him through Albert , sitting there with his newspaper , as he did every evening , but rather dim and visionary . The spectral double image was very disturbing . Jack said pleasantly , Where are the children ? I hope I 'm going to see them . ' That brought back reality and the sense of her opportunity . They 're coming home soon . They 're over at Mumsy 's . But before they come in ' I want to tell you , ' he interrupted heartily , that I think they 're extraordinary . It simply bowled me over , how glad they were to see me . I had n't expected it . I thought they 'd be shy . After all , it was quite a thing to put up to three kids Not at all , ' said Cicily . They wanted to , awfully . ' That must have been your doing . And Cicily , I appreciate it . P255Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . So eager and natural and friendly and intelligent -- How did John seem to you ? ' asked Cicily abruptly . Quite the head of the family . I had a good talk with him . ' She was somewhat disquieted . What did you talk about ? ' For John had n't referred to any private conversation . Oh , life in the West . Mining engineering . Mexico . South America . I 've done a little mountain-climbing . He seemed to like that . ' Harmless enough . But again that prick of jealousy . I thought he was charming  --  sensitive , observant , delightfully serious . But he was like that when he was a child . He 's awfully fond of you , Cicily . ' Oh , I know that . ' He observed the reservation that shadowed her tone . Why  --  what 's the matter ? I mean  --  is anything ? You 're not worried about him ? ' It 's rather , ' sighed Cicily , that he 's worried about me . ' He caught her glance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of startled attention , that she realized instantly what her words might imply . But also , reassuringly , that he could n't have heard any rumours about Albert from Belle or Aunt Isabel , for the very simple reason that he looked so surprised . The situation troubles him , ' she hastened to explain . What situation ? ' he asked , after a moment . It seemed , with reluctance . Yours and mine , ' she said simply . A certain rigidity of distress or embarrassment crept over his features . His eyes seemed to narrow and steady as he looked at her . She thought , It still hurts him ; and in order to console him she assured him earnestly , But Jack , he thinks you 're glorious . He thinks you behaved . ' Behaved  --  ? ' Jack 's voice was the blankest echo . Yes . When you knew --  ' But she could n't say that baldly . Well  --  when we separated . ' Oh ' said Jack vaguely . And you did behave , Jack . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he might commend her generosity , but he did n't . This omission confused her . She began to speak nervously . And now I wish you 'd do the same thing for me . Of course , I know I did n't . At least  --  not as you did . But it was n't in the nature of the circumstances , was it ? After all , our positions were not at all the same . It 's the circumstances , you see , that he ca n't understand . And how could you expect him to  --  ? ' Jack 's expression , by this time , was wholly bewildered . But relief had seeped into it . Would you mind telling me , ' he asked , what you 're talking about ? ' I 'm talking about John 's attitude . ' He seemed to relax as he sat in the armchair . Some vague apprehension had been stilled by her words . She sensed , in a flash , that he did not want to speak of himself or of her and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not fathom , but his attitude squared with her own inclinationand she went on briskly , I think it 's unfortunate . As far as I 'm concerned , it 's really unfair . With what we know of com-plexes ' Has John a complex ? ' He looked utterly amazed . I hope he has n't . I never suspected it until a few weeks ago . It was when you sent the steam engine . It was on Robin 's birthday ' She drew a quick breath , for she could n't say thosewords without thinking of Miss Sadie . She found herself stumblingp257over the obstacle of pain . She pushed it away and went on hurriedly : They asked about you  --  about us . The children did . And I tried to tell them Of course , it was n't easy . Childrenare idealists . The truth wo n't do . Sis and Robin were all right . I mean , they accepted it . But John was upset . I 'm afraid he 'd been thinking about it for quite a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . ' What sort of questions ? ' asked Jack , very kindly . Posers , ' said Cicily . You see , I tried to tell him a little about love That was rather a large order . ' It certainly was . ' His smile had encouraged her . But I hoped I could impress him with its dignity and importance . He asked me , at once , if you had n't loved me . I said that you had , and he wanted to know how , when two loves conflicted , you knew which was the right love . ' Her voice , which had trembled as she repeated these confidences , was gaining the uncomplicated assurance of vexation , Now , Jack  --  that 's extremely hard to explain . I said that you knew by the feeling in your heart . That every decent person felt that love must be mutual . And ' No , this was too difficult . And what ? ' asked Jack tranquilly . He said you were decent . ' A glitter of amusement shone in Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else did he say ? ' He said you were romantic . He said you were noble . He said he wanted to know you . ' She could n't blame Jack for looking very pleased . He thought I 'd been ruthless and selfish and trivial . ' That roused Jack to protest . My dear girl , you must exag-gerate . ' She shook her head miserably . As if , Jack , I had n't been to hell and back over it I did n't seem able to make him understand . I tried to explain that you could n't make yourself love anyone , or keep yourself from it . But he said , if that were true , he should think I would feel that it might happen again . I did n't mean anything so cynical and unsound . ' Not so unsound , ' said Jack , fundamentally . He had the facts right , but he was wrong about the feeling . That accounts for the cynicism . You ca n't expect a boy of fifteen to understand that while you 're loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , there could be . We both know that , now . ' But he should n't know it , ' she was quick to remonstrate . He does , ' Jack reminded her . He 's had a good object lesson . But he spoke without bitterness and continued cheerfully : Falling in love must be taken on faith . It can happen to anyone , at almost any time . You grow up and older , you change and develop  --  different qualities appeal to you ' Cicily was smiling at him with mild , vague tenderness . She was deeply affected by his selfless understanding . He answered the smile and went on promptly : Let 's say , sentimentally , that it 's a prodigy like spring . The wind blows warm and the sap begins to flow . You ca n't possibly control it . ' But Cicily dissented from this broad statement . For Jack 's vernal simile and his good-natured tone , which was almost one of raillery , had made her think of Albert . But  --  sometimes , you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the moral issue . I was speaking of feeling . ' But ' Cicily paused , abruptly aware of her own inconsistency . How you feel about that depends , I suppose , on who 's doing the loving . ' The truth of that comment fell sadly on her ear . P259You 'd like me to talk to John ? ' Oh , if you would ! ' Her jealousy had vanished and she felt ashamed of it . She thought of the emptiness of Jack 's life and heart . And then , more poignantly , of the emptiness of her own , of Albert 's irresponsibility and lack of moral fibre --  Jack'sinterest in John was identical with hers . In the future , she reflected , I must keep in closer touch with him . A woman with children needs a man to advise herI wanted , in any case , to have a talk with the children . With you , too , Cicily . I really came East to talk with all the family . ' The context of this assertion escaped her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tone . She could not have defined her sudden sense of disquietude . She glanced at him sharply . His expression had changed . Under her eyes , it seemed to go on changing until he sat looking so happy , so confused , and so foolishly excited that she knew with quick clairvoyance what more he had to tell . Knew  --  but incredulously and with dawning dismay . His lips formed the words that confirmed her premonition . Cicily , my dear , I 'm going to be married . ' It was simply preposterous that she felt so betrayed . Why , Jack  --  how nice . I 'm perfectly delighted , ' she heard her voice saying , flatly and blankly . Ile said inarticulately , She 's the dearest girl . ' 1 t made her think , wildly , of some comic character in Victorian fiction . Who used to say that ? Why , of course  --  Tommy Traddles In David Copperfield . A ridiculous lover . A nonsensical young man . But Jack was n't young and he should n't be ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll like her . ' This confidence struck her as the most ludicrous example of masculine obtusity she had ever had to dealP260with . As he spoke , he was drawing a leather case from his breast pocket . Here she is , ' he added , with obvious pride . Cicily accepted the case from his hands , hoping she was concealingher incredible reluctance to look at its enclosure . It framed an informal snapshot of a girl . A bareheaded girl , in loose slacks and sweater , perched on a crag on top of a mountain , with a range of peaks behind her  --  tumbled , Western peaks with snow in their crevices , the waves of the Rockies rising to the sky . The girl 's face was outlined in clearly etched profile above the background of mountains . Her head was held high , facing the wind , which blew back her short , dark hair from her brow . The brow was well-modelled , the nose straight and fine , the mouth smiling and generousIs n't she beautiful ? ' asked Jack impulsively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girl looked too young and too unself-conscious to bother about beauty . More admirable attributes rose in Cicily 's mind . Humour , intelligence , courage , and strength . She sat on her crag , exulting in the wind . How old is she , Jack ? ' She 's just twenty-four . ' How long have you known her ? ' Since she came home from college . Never well , until this autumn . Of course , she ran around with a very young crowd . We met occasionally at parties , but I did n't go to many . Her father 's a great friend of mine . He 's a damn good surgeon . But she seemed like a kid to me . It was only last September that we went on our first hike together . The Rockies , you know , are lovely in the autumn . They 're covered with aspens , with little trembling leaves as round and as golden as twenty-dollar gold pieces . The air is so clear and the sky is so blue -- I see , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' P261'Joan Elizabeth Darby . She 's always called Elizabeth . ' The name seemed , somehow , to give the girl reality . But Cicily could not realize that she would be Jack 's bride . Jack 's second wife . She had , for an instant , a shivering sensation of being dead and buried , green grass growing over her  --  a neatly lettered tombstone . She could not account for this morbid sensitivity which was , of course , farcical , when you remembered Albert . ' She 's charming , ' she murmured , propping the picture up against the sugar bowl , where she could still look at it . ' We 're to be married at Easter , ' said Jack , with satisfaction . ' And going to Honolulu . Back in Denver for the summer . That 's when I want the children . She 's eager to meet them . She 's very 1 and of children . ' But , Cicily was thinking , she 'll have children of her own  --  and he 'll begin life over again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assuming a strange , new aspect . She could not look forward to the peace of the grave . She could not contemplatewith equanimity her own surprising reactions which seemed to her ignoble and grotesquely unreasonable . Had Jack experienced them , seven years before ? Aggravated , too , by the wrench of divorce ' Now that I 'll have a home for them , I hope they 'll come every summer , Jack 's hopes were interrupted by the sound of the doorbell . ' Here they are , ' said Cicily . ' Mumsy is bringing them . ' She felt too depleted by the uses of adversity to deal with the complications immediately at hand . Mumsy 's arrival would be the last straw ' Aunt Jane ? ' Jack was saying . ' I 'll be so glad to see her . ' Vesta 's quick step was heard in the hall . The moment the door opened , they came tumbling in , Sis ,  | Robin , and John , with Mumsy behind them , pausing on the threshold , holding Bertie by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would add his small mite to the general awkwardness . Aunt Jane ! ' cried Jack affectionately , rising from the armchair and pushing past his children to kiss his former mother-in-law . Mumsy 's composure , thought Cicily , was a credit to her . Jack , my dear boy , you look very well . ' How do you do ? ' said Bertie unexpectedly . Jack smiled down at him . And this is Albert , Junior ? ' Bertie extended a small , well-mannered hand . Jack clasped it amusedly . He 's the image of Albert . ' Cicily said hastily , Mumsy , some tea ? ' Her mother looked grateful for the conventional interruption . She hates this , thought Cicily , and she 's going to hate it more . I hate it myself . She filled the cup , wondering what moment Jack would seize to announce his engagement . But perhaps he wo n't , she reflected hopefully , for he knows as well as I do how Mumsy will feel about it . How much knowledge , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perception of family idiosyncrasies , preferences , prejudices Over the heads of the children surrounding him , his eyes met hers as if asking for guidance . She shook her head slightly , as she gave her mother her tea . Sis and John were chattering , one on each side of Jack , about the plans for next summer . Bertie gazed up at them , envy in his eyes . Robin , however , was attracted by the sandwiches . He walked over to the tea-table . Mumsy  --  some toast ? I 'm afraid it 's cold by this time . ' Who 's this ? ' asked Robin , his mouth full of sandwich . He wasstaring at the snapshot , propped up against the sugar bowl . Oh , God ! thought Cicily . How could she have forgotten it ? P263Her eyes sought Jack 's , once more , in dismay . He looked taken aback , and she did n't wonder . After a pause that was more than perceptible , She 's a girl I know . She 's a very good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mumsy , as usual , noticed what she saw . What she heard , too  --  which was perhaps more significant . That note of self-consciousnesshad stiffened Jack 's tone . The glance she threw at Cicily was less questioning than protective . Robin was looking more closely at the snapshot . Was that one of the mountains that you climbed , Daddy ? ' Sis and John edged nearer to look over his shoulder . Yes . It was one of them , ' said Jack uncomfortably . Cicily hoped he would let it drop there . But something impelled him to join the children . Over their heads he stood looking at the picture . How high was it , Daddy ? ' Robin persisted . Jack did n't answer . Dropping his hand affectionately on John 's shoulder , Well  --  what do you think of her ? ' he asked his elder son . Rash , thought Cicily . The boy seemed surprised by his father 's insistence . Why  --  she looks all right . ' Did you go up the steep side ? ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll have to have slacks when we go out there . ' Jack took the snapshot from his children 's hands . He slippedit in his coat pocket . Cicily felt sorry for him . I did n't see it , ' said Bertie mildly . Oh  --  I beg your pardon , ' said Jack absurdly . He produced the case again and handed it down to Bertie . Is there lunch in that basket ? ' was Bertie 's comment . Cicily felt that she must put a stop to this . After all  --  why not seize the opportunity that offered ? Mumsy suspected . The children must be told . She rose from the tea-table and walked over to Jack 's side . She took the snapshot from Bertie and slipped her hand through John 's elbow . She met , for an instant , her mother 's grave eyes . Children , ' she said seriously , your father came here today for a very special purpose . I 'd like to be the one to tell you what it was . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married  --  to the girl in this picture ' John 's arm jerked suddenlyaway from her clasp as he turned toward his father . M-married  --  ? ' he stammered . Gosh ! ' said Robin , not sounding too pleased . To that girl ? ' cried Sis , her voice blank with amazement . Why not ? ' asked Jack sharply . Why  --  she 's so young ! ' Your father , ' said Cicily , is not very old . ' This was greeted as a joke  --  at least by Sis and Robin . John'sface had whitened and he did not smile . Jack , obviously disconcertedand reading all their faces , seemed to become conscious of his eldest son 's consternation , to wonder how to deal withit . Are n't you going to wish me good luck , old man ? ' The boy started violently . Oh  --  yes , ' he muttered . Ofcourse  --  why , certainly --  ' He looked painfully embarrassed . Sis took the snapshot from Cicily 's hand . She looked at it now witha lively interest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? ' This practical question found Jack unprepared . What do theycall Albert ? ' he inquired of Cicily . Just what they always did  --  " Uncle Albert , " ' she replied . Does this make that girl my aunt ? ' asked Robin perplexedly . Of course not , ' said Sis . Uncle Albert was our uncle . She'llbe just your father 's wife . That makes her your stepmother . ' My stepmother ? ' cried Robin , on a note of alarm . P265Cicily was afraid that he was thinking of fairy tales . But you do n't call a stepmother " Mother . " Or do you ? ' Sis sounded puzzled . It seems sort of funny , when your own mother 's alive . ' I think that she 'd like you to call her " Elizabeth , " ' said Jack , rather hastily . That is her name . Joan Elizabeth Darby . ' Me ? ' asked Robin , faintly incredulous . Why , she 's grown up , is n't she ? ' Certainly . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertie 's small voice was a plaint of resignation . Mumsy , on that , arose from her chair . She joined the group around Jack and said , very pleasantly , Let me see the picture . ' She turned a little away from them to gaze at it , silently . Cicily , watching her , saw her face sadden , her lips quiver uncontrollably . But when she looked up there were no tears in her eyes . She had closed the leather case on Joan Elizabeth Darby and now handed it to Jack with a gesture of finality . Jack , ' she said gently , she looks like a sweet girl . You deserve to be happy and I hope that you will be . ' Cicily wondered if she only imagined that a note of apology for all past injustices quavered , for an instant , in her mother 's tone . It brightened immediately , Have you told your mother ? ' Yesterday , ' said Jack . And Belle and Billy . We 're going to announce it when I get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . What she could n't accept , her daughter suspected , was a continuation of a scene that had seemed to her painful and shocking and wholly unnatural . For , I 'm going home , now , ' she said , with a serenity perceptibly steeled by a tacit determination . And the car 's outside , Jack . I can drop you at the station . ' Cicily thought Jack looked quite ready to go . And yet  --  **25;5308;TOOLONG held it out with his face turned back toward us and his mouth hollering , " Watch now ! Watch ! " even after we could n't hear him for the train ; and then it passed . It came roaring up and went past ; the river they had cut through the trees was all full of smoke and noise and sparks and jumping brass , and then empty again , and just Jingus ' old hat bouncing and jumping along the empty track behind it like the hat was alive . But this time what I saw was something that looked like piles of black straws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cut and we could see where they had dug the ties up and piled them and set them on fire . But Cousin Denny was still hollering , " Come see what they done to the rails ! " he said . They were back in the trees ; it looked like four or five men had taken each rail and tied it around a tree like you knot a green cornstalk around a wagon stake , and Ringo was hollering , too , now . " What 's them ? " he hollered . " What 's them ? " " That 's what it runs on ! " Cousin Denny hollered . " You mean hit have to come in here and run up and down around these here trees like a squirrel ? " Ringo hollered . Then we all heard the horse at once ; we just had time to look when Bobolink came up the road out of the trees and went across the railroad and into the trees again like a bird , with Cousin Drusilla ridingp101astride like a man and sitting straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was the best woman rider in the country . " There 's Dru ! " Cousin Denny hollered . " Come on ! She 's been up to the river to see them niggers ! Come on ! " He and Ringo ran again . When I passed the chimneys , they were just running into the stable . Cousin Drusilla had already unsaddled Bobolink , and she was rubbing him down with a crokersack when I came in . Cousin Denny was still hollering , " What did you see ? What are they doing ? " " I 'll tell about it at the house , " Cousin Drusilla said . Then she saw me . She was not tall ; it was the way she stood and walked . She had on pants , like a man . She was the best woman rider in the country . When Granny and I were here that Christmas before the war and Gavin Breckbridge had just given Bobolink to her , they looked fine together ; it did n't need Tingus to say that they were the finest-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Shiloh and so they did n't marry . She came and put her hand on my shoulder . " Hello , " she said . " Hello , John Sartoris . " She looked at Ringo . " Is this Ringo ? " she said . " That 's what they tells me , " Ringo said . " What about that railroad ? " " How are you ? " Cousin Drusilla said.  | " I manages to stand hit , " Ringo said . " What about that railroad ? " " I 'll tell you about that tonight too , " Drusilla said . " I 'll finish Bobolink for you , " I said . " Will you ? " she said . She went to Bobolink 's head . " Will you stand for Cousin Bayard , lad ? " she said . " I 'll see you-all at the house , then , " she said . She went out . " Yawl sho must ' a ' had this horse hid good when the Yankees come , " Ringo said . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no damn Yankee going to fool with Dru 's horse no more . " He did n't holler now , but pretty soon he began again : " When they come to burn the house , Dru grabbed the pistol and run out here  --  she had on her Sunday dress  --  and them right behind her . She run in here and she jumped on Bobolink bareback , without even waiting for the bridle , and one of them right there in the door hollering , Stop , ' and Dru said , Get away , or I 'll ride you down , ' and him hollering , Stop ! Stop ! ' with his pistol out too "  --  Cousin Denny was hollering good now  --  " and Dru leaned down to Bobolink 's ear and said , Kill him , Bob , ' and the Yankee jumped back just in time . The lot was full of them , too , and Dru stopped Bobolink and jumped down in her Sunday dress and put the pistol to Bobolink 's ear and said , I ca n't shoot you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't do any good anyway ; but I wo n't need but one shot for the horse , and which shall it be ? ' So they burned the house and went away ! " He was hollering good now , with Ringo staring at him so you could have raked Ringo 's eyes off his face with a stick . " Come on ! " Cousin Denny hollered . " Le 's go hear about them niggers at the river ! " " I been having to hear about niggers all my life , " Ringo said . " I got to hear about that railroad . " When we reached the house Cousin Drusilla was already talking , telling Granny mostly , though it was not about the railroad . Her hair was cut short ; it looked like Father 's would when he would tell Granny about him and the men cutting each other 's hair with a bayonet . She was sunburned and her hands were hard and scratched like a man 's that works . She was telling Granny mostly : " They began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning . We could n't count them ; men and women carrying childrenwho could n't walk and carrying old men and women who should have been at home waiting to die . They were singing , walking along the road singing , not even looking to either side . The dust did n't even settle for two days , because all that night they still passed ; we sat up listening to them , and the next morning every few yards along the road would be the old ones who could n't keep up any more , sitting orp104lying down and even crawling along , calling to the others to help them ; and the others  --  the young strong ones  --  not stopping , not even looking at them . I do n't think they even heard or saw them . Going to Jordan , ' they told me . Going to cross Jordan . ' " " That was what Loosh said , " Granny said . " That General Sherman was leading them all to Jordan . " " Yes , " Cousin Drusilla said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river itself , dammed up . The Yankees have thrown out a brigade of cavalry to hold them back while they build the bridge to cross the infantry and artillery ; they are all right until they get up there and see or smell the water . That 's when they go mad . Not fighting ; it 's like they ca n't even see the horses shoving them back and the scabbards beating them ; it 's like they ca n't see anything but the water and the other bank . They are n't angry , are n't fighting ; just men , women and children singing and chanting and trying to get to that unfinished bridge or even down into the water itself , and the cavalry beating them back with sword scabbards . I do n't know when they have eaten ; nobody knows just how far some of them have come . They just pass here without food or anything , exactly as they rose up from whatever they were doing when the spirit or the voice or whateverit was told them to go . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , at night , they move again.  |p105We  will hear them later  --  I 'll wake you  --  marching on up the road until the cavalry stops them . There was an officer , a major , who finally took time to see I was n't one of his men ; he said , Ca n't you do anything with them ? Promise them anything to go back home ? ' But it was like they could n't see me or hear me speaking ; it was only that water and that bank on the other side . But you will see for yourself tomorrow , when we go back . " " Drusilla , " Aunt Louise said , " you 're not going back tomorrow or any other time . " " They are going to mine the bridge and blow it up when the army has crossed , " Cousin Drusilla said . " Nobody knows what they will do then . " " But we can not be responsible , " Aunt Louise said . " The Yankees brought it on themselves ; let them pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , " Cousin Drusilla said . " At least there will be one person there who is not a Yankee either . " She looked at Granny . " Four , counting Bayard and Ringo . " Aunt Louise looked at Granny . " Rosa , you sha n't go . I forbid it . Brother John will thank me to do so . " " I reckon I will , " Granny said . " I 've got to get the silver anyway . " " And the mules , " Ringo said ; " do n't forget them . And do n't yawl worry about Granny . She ' cide whatp106she want and then she kneel down about ten seconds and tell God what she aim to do , and then she git up and do hit . And them that do n't like hit can git oaten the way or git trompled . But that railroad  --  " " And now I reckon we better go to bed , " Granny said . But we did n't go to bed then . I had to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to keep even with Ringo ( or even ahead of him , since I had seen the railroad when it was a railroad , which he had not ) than a boy 's affinity for smoke and fury and thunder and speed . We sat there in that slave cabin partitioned , like Louvinia 's cabin at home , into two rooms by that suspended quilt beyond which Aunt Louisa and Granny were already in bed and where Cousin Denny should have been too except for the evening 's dispensation he had received , listening too who did not need to hear it again since he had been there to see it when it happened ;  - -  we sat there , Ringo and I , listening to Cousin Drusilla and staring at each other with the same amazed and incredulous question : Where could we have been at that moment ? What could we have been doing , even a hundred miles away , not to have sensed , felt this , paused to look at one another , aghast and uplifted , while it was happening ? Because this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Yankees ; we had shot at one ; we had crouched like two rats and heard Granny , unarmed and not evenp107rising from her chair , rout a whole regiment of them from the library . And we had heard about battles and fighting and seen those who had taken part in them , not only in the person of Father when once or twice each year and without warning he would appear on the strong gaunt horse , arrived from beyond that cloudbank region which Ringo believed was Tennessee , but in the persons of other men who returned home with actual arms and legs missing . But that was it : men had lost arms and legs in sawmills ; old men had been telling young men and boys about wars and fighting before they discovered how to write it down : and what petty precisian to quibble about locations in space or in chronology , who to care or insist Now come , old man , tell the truth : did you see this ? were you really there ? Because wars are wars : the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parry of iron when there was not  --  one tale , one telling , the same as the next or the one before . So we knew a war existed ; we had to believe that , just as we had to believe that the name for the sort of life we had led for the last three years was hardship and suffering . Yet we had no proof of it . In fact , we had even less than no proof ; we had had thrust into our faces the very shabby and unavoidable obverse of proof , who had seen Father ( and the other men too ) return home , afoot like tramps or on crow/bait horses , in faded and patched ( and at times obviouslystolen ) clothing , preceded by no flags nor drums and followed not even by two men to keep step with one another , in coats bearing no glitter of golden braid and with scabbards in which no sword reposed , actually almost sneaking home to spend two or three or seven days performing actions not only without glory ( plowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ) and in which they had no skill but the very necessity for which was the fruit of the absentoccupations from which , returning , they bore no proof  --  actions in the very clumsy performance of which Father 's whole presence seemed ( to us , Ringo and me ) to emanate a kind of humility and apology , as if he were saying , " Believe me , boys ; take my word for it : there 's more to it than this , no matter what it looks like . I ca n't prove it , so you 'll just have to believe me . " And then to have it happen , where we could have been there to see it , and were not : and this no poste and riposte of sweat-reeking cavalry which all war-telling is full of , no galloping thunder of guns to wheel up and unlimber and crash and crash into the lurid grime-glare of their own demon-served inferno which even children would recognise , no ragged lines of gaunt and shrill-yelling infantry beneath a tattered flag which is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : an interval ,  |p109a  space , in which the toad-squatting guns , the panting men and the trembling horses paused , amphitheatric about the embattled land , beneath the fading fury of the smoke and the puny yelling , and permitted the sorry business which had dragged on for three years now to be congealed into an irrevocable instant and put to an irrevocable gambit , not by two regiments or two batteries or even two generals , but by two locomotives . Cousin Drusilla told it while we sat there in the cabin which smelled of new whitewash and even ( still faintly ) of Negroes . She probably told us the reason for it ( she must have known )  --  what point of strategy , what desperate gamble not for preservation , since hope of that was gone , but at least for prolongation , which it served . But that meant nothing to us . We did n't hear , we did n't even listen ; we sat there in that cabin and waited and watched that railroad which no longer existed , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass was already growing , a few threads of steel knotted and twisted about the trunks of trees and already annealing into the living bark , becoming one and indistinguishable with the jungle growth which had now accepted it , but which for us ran still pristine and intact and straight and narrow as the path to glory itself , as it ran for all of them who were there and saw whenp110Ringo and I were not . Drusilla told about that too ; Atlanta ' and Chattanooga ' were in it  --  the names , the beginning and the end  --  but they meant no more to us than they did to the other watchers  --  the black and the white , the old men , the children , the women who would not know for months yet if they were widows or childless or not  --  gathered , warned by grapevine , to see the momentary flash and glare of indomitable spirit starved by three years free of the impeding flesh . She told it ( and now Ringo and I began to see it ; we were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited ; we were there , we were of them who ( they must have ) would slip into the roundhouse in the dark , to caress the wheels and pistons and iron flanks , to whisper to it in the darkness like lover to mistress or rider to horse , cajoling ruthlessly of her or it one supreme effort in return for making which she or it would receive annihilation ( and who would not pay that price ) , cajoling , whispering , caressing her or it toward the one moment ; we were of them  --  the old men , the children , the women  --  gathered to watch , drawn and warned by that grapevine of the oppressed , deprived of everything now save the will and the ability to deceive , turning inscrutable and impassive secret faces to the blue enemies who lived among them . Becausethey knew it was going to happen ; Drusilla told that too : how they seemed to know somehow the veryp111moment when the engine left Atlanta ; it was as if the gray generals themselves had sent the word , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now we will give to you and your children a glimpse of that for which you have suffered and been denied . " Because that 's all it was . I know that now . Even the successful passage of a hundred engines with trains of cars could not have changed the situation or its outcome ; certainly not two free engines shrieking along a hundred yards apart up that drowsing solitude of track which had seen no smoke and heard no bell in more than a year . I do n't think it was intended to do that . It was like a meeting between two iron knights of the old time , not for material gain but for principle  --  honor denied with honor , courage denied with courage  --  the deed done not for the end but for the sake of the doing  --  put to the ultimate test and proving nothing save the finality of death and the vanity of all endeavor . We saw it , we were there , as if Drusilla 's voice had transported us to the wandering light-ray in space in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of track which existed inside the scope of a single pair of eyes and nowhere else , corningfrom nowhere and having , needing , no destination , the engine not coming into view but arrested in human sight in thunderous yet dreamy fury , lonely , inviolate and forlorn , wailing through its whistle pre- cious steam which could have meant seconds at the instant of passing and miles at the end of its journey ( and cheap at ten times this price )  --  the flaring and streaming smoke stack , the tossing bell , the starred Saint Andrew 's cross nailed to the cab roof , the wheels and the flashing driving rods on which the brass fittings glinted like the golden spurs themselves  --  then gone , vanished . Only not gone or vanished either , so long as there should be defeated or the descendants of defeated to tell it or listen to the telling . " The other one , the Yankee one , was right behind it , " Drusilla said . " But they never caught it . Then the next day they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so we could n't do it again ; they could tear the track up but they could n't take back the fact that we had done it . They could n't take that from us . " We  --  Ringo and I  --  knew what she meant ; we stood together just outside the door before Ringo went on to Missy Lena 's cabin , where he was to sleep . " I know what you thinking , " Ringo said . Father was right ; he was smarter than me . " But I heard good as you did . I heard every word you heard . " " Only I saw the track before they tore it up . I saw where it was going to happen . " " But you did n't know hit was fixing to happen when you seed the track . So nemmine that . I heard.  |p113And  I reckon they ai n't gonter git that away from me , neither . " He went on , then I went back into the house and behind the quilt where Denny was already asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have time to wonder where she was because I was thinkinghow I probably would n't be able to go to sleep at all now though it was late . Then it was later still and Denny was shaking me and I remember how I thought then that he did not seem to need sleep either , that just by having been exposed for three or four seconds to war he had even at just ten acquired that quality which Father and the other men brought back from the front  --  the power to do without sleep and food both , needing only the opportunity to endure . " Dru says to come on out doors if you want to hear them passing , " he whispered . She was outside the cabin ; she had n't undressed even . I could see her in the starlight  --  her short jagged hair and the man 's shirt and pants . " Hear them ? " she said . We could hear it again , like we had in the wagon  --  the hurrying feet , the sound like they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying away up the road . " That 's the third tonight , " Cousin Drusilla said . " Two passed while I was down at the gate . You were tired , and so I did n't wake you before . "  | " I thought it was late , " I said . " You have n't been to bed even . Have you ? " " No , " she said . " I 've quit sleeping . " " Quit sleeping ? " I said . " Why ? " She looked at me . I was as tall as she was ; we could n't see each other 's faces ; it was just her head with the short jagged hair like she had cut it herself without bothering about a mirror , and her neck that had got thin and hard like her hands since Granny and I were here before . " I 'm keeping a dog quiet , " she said . " A dog ? " I said . " I have n't seen any dog . " " No . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't bother anybody any more now . I just have to show it the stick now and then . " She was looking at me . " Why not stay awake now ? Who wants to sleep now , with so much happening , so much to see ? Living used to be dull , you see . Stupid . You lived in the same house your father was born in , and your father 's sons and daughters had the sons and daughters of the same Negro slaves to nurse and coddle ; and then you grew up and you fell in love with your acceptable young man , and in time you would marry him , in your mother'swedding gown , perhaps , and with the same silver for presents she had received ; and then you settled down forevermore while you got children to feed and bathe and dress until they grew up , too ; and then youp115and your husband died quietly and were buried togethermaybe on a summer afternoon just before suppertime . Stupid , you see . But now you can see for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to worry now about the house and the silver , because they get burned up and carried away ; and you do n't have to worry about the Negroes , because they tramp the roads all night waiting for a chance to drown in homemade Jordan ; and you do n't have to worry about getting children to bathe and feed and change , because the young men can ride away and get killed in the fine battles ; and you do n't even have to sleep alone , you do n't even have to sleep at all ; and so , all you have to do is show the stick to the dog now and then and say , Thank God for nothing . ' You see ? " There . They 've gone now . And you 'd better get back to bed , so we can get an early start in the morning . It will take a long time to get through them . " " You 're not coming in now ? " I said . " Not yet , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her hand on my shoulder . " Listen , " she said . " When you go back home and see Uncle John , ask him to let me come there and ride with his troop . Tell him I can ride , and maybe I can learn to shoot . Will you ? " " Yes , " I said . " I 'll tell him you are not afraid too . " " Are n't I ? " she said . " I had n't thought about it . It does n't matter anyway . Just tell him I can ride and that I do n't get tired . " Her hand was on my shoulder ; it felt thin and hard . " Will you do that for me ? Ask him to let me come , Bayard . " " All right , " I said . Then I said , " I hope he will let you . " " So do I , " she said . " Now you go back to bed . Good night . " I went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking me awake ; by sunup we were on the road again , Drusilla on Bobolink riding beside the wagon . But not for long . We began to see the dust almost at once and I even believed that I could already smell them though the distance between us did not appreciably decrease , since they were travelling almost as fast as we were . We never did overtake them , just as you do not overtakea tide . You just keep moving , then suddenly you know that the set is about you , beneath you , overtakingyou , as if the slow and ruthless power , become aware of your presence at last , had dropped back a tentacle , a feeler , to gather you in and sweep you remorselesslyon . Singly , in couples , in groups and families they began to appear from the woods , ahead of us , alongside of us and behind ; they covered and hid from sight the road exactly as an infiltration of flood water would have , hiding the road from sightp117and then the very wheels of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Bobolink breasting slowly on , enclosed by a mass of heads and shoulders  --  men and women carrying babies and dragging older children by the hand , old men and women on improvisedsticks and crutches , and very old ones sittingbeside the road and even calling to us when we passed ; there was one old woman who even walked along beside the wagon , holding to the bed and beggingGranny to at least let her see the river before she died . But mostly they did not look at us . We might not have even been there . We did not even ask them to let us through because we could look at their faces and know they could n't have heard us . They were not singing yet , they were just hurrying , while our horses pushed slow through them , among the blank eyes not looking at anything out of faces caked with dust and sweat , breasting slowly and terrifically through them as if we were driving in midstream up a creek full of floating logs and the dust and the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright under the parasol which Ringo held and looking sicker and sicker , and it already afternoonthough we did n't know it anymore than we knew how many miles we had come . Then all of a sudden we reached the river , where the cavalry was holding them back from the bridge . It was just a sound at first , like wind , like it might be in the dust itself . We did n't even know what it was until we saw Drusilla holding Bobolink reined back , her face turned toward us wan and small above the dust and her mouth open and crying thinly : " Look out , Aunt Rosa ! Oh , look out ! " It was like we all heard it at the same time  --  we in the wagon and on the horse , they all around us in the sweat-caking dust . They made a kind of long wailing sound , and then I felt the whole wagon lift clear of the ground and begin to rush forward . I saw our old rib-gaunted horses standing on their hind feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , and Drusilla leaning forward a little and taut as a pistol hammer holding Bobolink , and I saw men and women and children going down under the horses and we could feel the wagon going over them and we could hear them screaming . And we could n't stop anymore than if the earth had tilted up and was slidingus all down toward the river . It went fast , like that , like it did every time anybody named Sartoris or Millard came within sight , hearing or smell of Yankees , as if Yankees were not a people nor a belief nor even a form of behavior , but instead were a kind of gully , precipice , into which Granny and Ringo and I were sucked pell-mell every time wep119got close to them . It was sunset ; now there was a high bright rosy glow quiet beyond the trees and shining on the river , and now we could see it plain  --  the tide of niggers dammed back from the entrance to the bridge by a detachment of cavalry , the river like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge which the tail of the Yankee column was just crossing . They were in silhouette , running tiny and high above the placid water ; I remember the horses ' and mules ' heads all mixed up among the bayonets , and the barrels of cannon tilted up and kind of rushingslow across the high peaceful rosy air like splitcaneclothespins being jerked along a clothesline , and the singing everywhere up and down the river bank , with the voices of the women coming out of it thin and high : " Glory ! Glory ! Hallelujah ! " They were fighting now , the horses rearing and shoving against them , the troopers beating at them with their scabbards , holding them clear of the bridge while the last of the infantry began to cross ; all of a sudden there was an officer beside the wagon , holding his scabbarded sword by the little end like a stick and hanging onto the wagon and screaming at us . I do n't know where he came from , how he ever got to us , but there he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a long streak of blood on it , bareheadedand with his mouth open . " Get back ! " hep120shrieked . " Get back ! We 're going to blow the bridge ! " screaming right into Granny 's face while she shouted back at him with Mrs. Compson 's hat knocked to one side of her head and hers and the Yankee 's faces not a yard apart : " I want my silver ! I 'm John Sartoris ' mother-inlaw ! Send Colonel Dick to me ! " Then the Yankee officer was gone , right in the middle of shouting and beating at the nigger heads with his sabre , with his little bloody shrieking face and all . I do n't know where he went anymore than I know where he came from ; he just vanished still holding onto the wagon and flailing about him with the sabre , and then Cousin Drusilla was there on Bobolink ; she had our nigh horse by the head-stall and was trying to turn the wagon sideways . I started to jump down to help . " Stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shout ; she just said it . " Take the lines and turn them . " When we got the wagon turned sideways we stopped . And then for a minute I thought we were going backward , until I saw it was the niggers . Then I saw that the cavalry had broken ; I saw the whole mob of it  --  horses and men and sabres and niggers  --  rolling on toward the end of the bridge like when a dam breaks , for about ten clear seconds behind the last of the infantry . And then the bridge vanished . I was lookingp121right at it ; I could see the clear gap between the infantryand the wave of niggers and cavalry , with a little empty thread of bridge joining them together in the air above the water , and then there was a bright glare and I felt my insides suck and a clap of wind hit me on the back of the head . I did n't hear anything at all . I just sat there in the wagon with a funny buzzingin my ears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy men and horses and pieces of plank floating along in the air above the water . But I did n't hear anything at all ; I could n't even hear Cousin Drusilla . She was right beside the wagon now , leaning toward us , her mouth urgent and wide and no sound coming out of it at all . " What ? " I said . " Stay in the wagon ! " " I ca n't hear you ! " I said . That 's what I said , that 's what I was thinking ; I did n't realise even then that the wagon was moving again . But then I did ; it was like the whole long bank of the river had turned and risen under us and was rushing us down toward the water , we sitting in the wagon and rushing down toward the water on another river of faces that could n't see or hear either . Cousin Drusilla had the nigh horse l ) y the bridle again , and I dragged at them , too , and Granny was standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compson 's parasol , and then the whole rotten bridle came off in Cousin Drusilla 's hand . " Get away ! " I said . " The wagon will float ! " " Yes , " she said , " it will float . Just stay in it . Watch Aunt Rosa and Ringo . " " Yes , " I said . Then she was gone . We passed her ; turned , and holding Bobolink like a rock again and leaning down talking to him and patting his cheek , she was gone . Then maybe the bank did cave . I do n't know . I did n't even know we were in the river . It was just like the earth had fallen out from under the wagon and the faces and all , and we all rushed down slow , with the faces looking up and their eyes blind and their mouths open and their arms held up . High up in the air across the river I saw a cliff and a big fire on it running fast sideways ; and then all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a dead horse came shining up from out of the yelling faces and went down slow again , exactly like a fish feeding , with , hanging over his rump by one stirrup , a man in a black uniform , and then I realised that the uniform was blue , only it was wet . They were screamingthen , and now I could feel the wagon bed tilt and slide as they caught at it . Granny was kneeling beside me now , hitting at the screaming faces with Mrs. Compson 's parasol . Behind us they were still marchingdown the bank and into the river , singing.  |p123A  Yankee patrol helped Ringo and me cut the drowned horses out of the harness and drag the wagon ashore . We sprinkled water on Granny until she came to , and they rigged harness with ropes and hitched up two of their horses . There was a road on top of the bluff , and then we could see the fires along the bank . They were still singing on the other side of the river , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down the cliff on this side , and squads of infantry down at the water where the fires were . Then we began to pass between rows of tents , with Granny lying against me , and I could see her face then ; it was white and still , and her eyes were shut . She looked old and tired ; I had n't realised how old and little she was . Then we began to pass big fires , with niggers in wet clothes crouching around them and soldiers going among them passing out food ; then we came to a broad street , and stopped before a tent with a sentry at the door and a light inside . The soldiers looked at Granny . " We better take her to the hospital , " one of them said . Granny opened her eyes ; she tried to sit up . " No , "  | she said . " Just take me to Colonel Dick . I will be all right then . " They carried her into the tent and put her in a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her eyes closed and a strand of wet hair sticking to her face when Colonel Dick came in . I had never seen him before  --  only heard his voice while Ringo and I were squatting under Granny 's skirt and holding our breath  --  but I knew him at once , with his bright beard and his hard bright eyes , stooping over Granny and saying , " Damn this war . Damn it . Damn it . " " They took the silver and the darkies and the mules , " Granny said . " I have come to get them . " " Have them you shall , " he said , " if they are anywhere in this corps . I 'll see the general myself . " He was looking at Ringo and me now . " Ha ! " he said . " I believe we have met before also . " Then he was gone again . It was hot in the tent , and quiet , with three bugs swirling around the lantern , and outside the sound of the army like wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground with his head on his knees , and I was n't much better , because all of a sudden Colonel Dick was back and there was an orderly writing at the table , and Granny sitting again with her eyes closed in her white face.  | " Maybe you can describe them , " Colonel Dick said to me . " I will do it , " Granny said . She did n't open her cycs . " The chest of silver tied with hemp rope . The rope was new . Two darkies , Loosh and Philadelphy . The mules , Old Hundred and Tinney . " Colonel Dick turned and watched the orderly writing . " Have you got that ? " he said . The orderly looked at what he had written . " I guess the general will be glad to give them twice the silver and mules just for taking that many niggers , " he said . " Now I 'll go see the general , " Colonel Dick said . Then we were moving again . I do n't know how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ringo both ; we were in the wagon again , with two Army horses pulling it on down the long broad street , and there was another officer with us and Colonel Dick was gone . We came to a pile of chests and boxes that looked higher than a mountain . There was a rope pen behind it full of mules and then , standing to one tide and waiting there , was what looked like a thousandniggers , men , women and children , with their wet clothes dried on them . And now it began to go fast again ; there was Granny in the wagon with her eyes wide open now and the lieutenant reading from the paper and the soldiers jerking chests and trunksp126out of the pile . " Ten chests tied with hemp rope , " the lieutenant read . " Got them ? . . . A hundred and ten mules . It says from Philadelphia  --  that 's in Mississippi . Get these Mississippi mules . They are to have rope and halters . " " We ai n't got a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get what we have got . Hurry . " He turned to Granny . " And there are your niggers , madam . " Granny was looking at him with her eyes wide as Ringo 's . She was drawn back a little , with her hand at her chest . " But they 're not  --  they ai n't  --  " she said . " They ai n't all yours ? " the lieutenant said . " I know it . The general said to give you another hundred with his compliments . " " But that ai n't  --  We did n't  --  " Granny said . " She wants the house back , too , " the sergeant said . " We ai n't got any houses , grandma , " he said . " You 'll just have to make out with trunks and niggers and mules . You would n't have room for it on the wagon , anyway . " We sat there while they loaded the ten trunks into the wagon . It just did hold them all . They got another set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " One of you darkies that can handle two span come here , " the lieutenant said . One of the niggers came and got on the seat with Granny ; none of us had ever seenp127him before . Behind us they were leading the mules out of the pen . " You want to let some of the women ride ? " the lieutenant said . " Yes , " Granny whispered . " Come on , " the lieutenant said . " Just one to a mule , now . " Then he handed me the paper . " Here you are . There 's a ford about twenty miles up the river ; you can cross there . You better get on away from here beforeany more of these niggers decide to go with you . " We rode until daylight , with the ten chests in the wagon and the mules and our army of niggers behind . Granny had not moved , sitting there beside the strange nigger with Mrs. Compson 's hat on and the parasol in her hand . But she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , she said , " Stop the wagon . " The wagon stopped . She turned and looked at me . " Let me see that paper , " she said . We opened the paper and looked at it , at the neat writing : Field Headquarters ,  - -  th Army Corps , Department of Tennessee , August 14 , 1863 . To all Brigade , Regimental and Other Commanders : You will see that bearer is repossessed in full of thep128following property , to wit : Ten ( to ) chests tied with hemp rope and containing silver . One hundred ten ( z to ) mules captured loose near Philadelphia in Mississippi . One hundred ten ( t to ) Negroes of both sexes belonging to and having strayed from the same locality . You will further see that bearer is supplied with necessary food and forage to expedite his passage to his destination . By order of the General Commanding . We looked at one another in the gray light . " I reckon you gonter take urn back now , " Ringo said . Granny looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " I said . " Yes , " Granny said . " I tried to tell them better . You and Ringo heard me . It 's the hand of God . " We stopped and slept until noon . That afternoon we came to the ford . We had already started down the bluff when we saw the troop of cavalry camped there . It was too late to stop . " They done found hit out and headed us off , " Ringo said . It was too late ; already an officer and two men were riding toward us . " I will tell them the truth , " Granny said . " We have done nothing . " She sat there , drawn back a little again , with her hand already raised and holding the paper out in the other when they rode up . The officer was ap129heavy-built man with a red face ; he looked at us and took the paper and read it and began to swear . He sat there on his horse swearing while we watched him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How many do I what ? " Granny said . " Mules ! " the officer shouted . " Mules ! Mules ! Do I look like I had any chests of silver or niggers tied with hemp rope ? " " Do we  --  " Granny said , with her hand to her chest , looking at him ; I reckon it was Ringo that knew first what he meant . " We like fifty , " Ringo said . " Fifty , hey ? " the officer said . He cursed again ; he turned to one of the men behind him and cursed him now . " Count ' em ! " he said . " Do you think I 'm going to take their word for it ? " The man counted the mules ; we did n't move ; I do n't think we even breathed hardly . " Sixty-three , " the man said . The officer looked at us . " Sixty-three from a hundred and ten leaves forty-seven , " he said . He cursed . " Get forty-seven mules ! Hurry ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can beat me out of three mules , hey ? " " Forty-seven will do , " Ringo said . " Only I reckon maybe we better eat something , like the paper men-tion. "  | We crossed the ford . We did n't stop ; we went on as soon as they brought up the other mules , and some more of the women got on them . We went on . It was after sundown then , but we did n't stop . " Hah ! " Ringo said . " Whose hand was that ? " We went on until midnight before we stopped . Thistime it was Ringo that Granny was looking at . " Ringo , " she said . " I never said nothing the paper never said , " Ringo said . " Hit was the one that said it ; hit was n't me . All I done was to told him how much the hundred and ten liked ; I never said we liked that many . ' Sides , hit ai n't no use in praying about hit now ; ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gits home . The main thing now is , whut we gonter do with all these niggers . " " Yes , " Granny said . We cooked and ate the food the cavalry officer gave us ; then Granny told all the niggers that lived in Alabama to come forward . It was about half of them . " I suppose you all want to cross some more rivers and run after the Yankee Army , do n't you ? " Granny said . They stood there , moving their feet in the dust . " What ? Do n't any of you want to ? " They just stood there . " Then who are you going to mind from now on ? " After a while , one of them said , " You , missy . " " All right , " Granny said . " Now listen to me . Go home . And if I ever hear of any of you straggling offp131like this again , I 'll see to it . Now line up and come up here one at a time while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time until the last one was gone ; when we started again , we had almost enough mules for everybody to ride , but not quite , and Ringo drove now . He did n't ask ; he just got in and took the reins , with Granny on the seat by him ; it was just once that she told him not to go so fast . So I rode in the back then , on one of the chests , and that afternoon I was asleep ; it was the wagon stopping that woke me . We had just come down a hill onto a flat , and then I saw them beyond a field , about a dozen of them , cavalry in blue coats . They had n't seen us yet , trotting along , while Granny and Ringo watched them . " They ai n't hardly worth fooling with , " Ringo said . " Still , they 's horses . " " We 've already got a hundred and ten , " Granny said . " That 's all the paper calls for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanter go on ? " Granny did n't answer , sitting there drawn back a little , with her hand at her breast again . " Well , what you wanter do ? " Ringo said . " You got to ' cide quick , or they be gone . " He looked at her ; she did n't move . Ringo leaned out of the wagon . " Hey ! " he hollered . They looked back quick and saw us and whirled about . " Granny say come here ! " Ringo hollered . " You , Ringo , " Granny whispered.  | " All right , " Ringo said . " You want me to tell um to never mind ? " She did n't answer ; she was looking past Ringo at the two Yankees who were riding toward us across the field , with that kind of drawnbacklook on her face and her hand holding the front of her dress . It was a lieutenant and a sergeant ; the lieutenant did n't look much older than Ringo and me . He saw Granny and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took her hand away from her chest ; it had the paper in it ; she held it out to the lieutenantwithout saying a word . The lieutenant opened it , the sergeant looking over his shoulder . Then the sergeant looked at us . " This says mules , not horses , " he said . " Just the first hundred was mules , " Ringo said . " The extra twelve is horses . " " Damn it ! " the lieutenant said . He sounded like a girl swearing . " I told Captain Bowen not to mount us with captured stock ! " " You mean you 're going to give them the horses ? " the sergeant said . " What else can I do ? " the lieutenant said . He looked like he was fixing to cry . " It 's the general 's own sig-nature ! " So then we had enough stock for all of them to ride except about fifteen or twenty . We went on . The soldiers stood under a tree by the road , with theirp133saddles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant . When we started again , he ran along by the wagon ; he looked like he was going to cry , trotting along by the wagon with his hat in his hand , looking at Granny . " You 'll meet some troops somewhere , " he said . " I know you will . Will you tell them where we are and to send us something  --  mounts or wagons  --  anything we can ride in ? You wo n't forget ? " " They 's some of yawl about twenty or thirty miles back that claim to have three extry mules , " Ringo said . " But when we sees any more of urn , we 'll tell um about yawl . " We went on . We came in sight of a town , but we went around it ; Ringo did n't even want to stop and avid the lieutenant 's message in , but Granny made him stop and we sent the message in by one of the niggers . " That 's one more mouth to feed we got shed of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast now , changing the mules every few miles ; a woman told us we were in Mississippi again , and then , in the afternoon , we came over the hill , and there our chimneys were , standing up into the sunlight , and the cabin behind them and Louvinia bending over a washtub and the clothes on the line , flapping bright and peaceful.  | " Stop the wagon , " Granny said . We stopped  --  the wagon , the hundred and twentytwomules and horses , and the niggers we never had had time to count . Granny got out slow and turned to Ringo . " Get out , " she said ; then she looked at me . " You too , " she said . " Because you said nothing at all . " We got out of the wagon . She looked at us . " We have lied , " she said . " Hit was the paper that lied ; hit was n't us , " Ringo said . " The paper said a hundred and ten . We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But they stole them ' fore we did , " Ringo said . " But we lied , " Granny said . " Kneel down . " She knelt first . Then we all three knelt by the road while she prayed . The washing blew soft and peaceful and bright on the clothesline . And then Louvinia saw us ; she was already running across the pasture while Granny was praying.  |p135When  Ab Snopes left for Memphis with the nine mules , Ringo and Joby and I worked on a new fence . When Ringo went off on his mule and there was just Joby and me . Once Granny came down and looked at Elie new section of rails ; the pen would be almost two acres larger now . That was the second day after Ringo left . That night , while Granny and I were sitting beforcthe fire , Ab Snopes came back . He said that he had got only four hundred and fifty dollars for the tune mules . That is , he took some money out of hisp136pocket and gave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's only fifty dollars apiece . " " All right , " Ab said . " If you can do any better , you are welcome to take the next batch in yourself . I done already admitted I ca n't hold a candle to you when it comes to getting mules ; maybe I ca n't even compete with you when it comes to selling them . " He chewed something  --  tobacco when he could get it , willow bark when he could n't  --  all the time , and he never wore a collar , and nobody ever admitted they ever saw him in a uniform , though when Father was away , he would talk a lot now and then about when he was in Father 's troop and about what he and Father used to do . But when I asked Father about it once , Father said , " Who ? Ab Snopes ? " and then laughed . But it was Father that told Ab to kind of look out for Granny while he was away ; only he told me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ab was all right in his way , but he was like a mule : While you had him in the traces , you better watch him . But Ab and Granny got along all right , though each time Ab took a batch of mules to Memphis and came back with the money , it would be like this : " Yes , ma'am , " Ab said . " It 's easy to talk about hit , setting here without no risk . But I 'm the one that has to dodge them durn critters nigh a hundred miles into Memphis , with Forrest and Smithp137fighting on ever side of me and me never knowing when I wull run into a Confed'rit or Yankee patrol slid have ever last one of them confiscated off of me right down to the durn halters . And then I got to take them into the very heart of the Yankee Army in Memphisand try to sell them to a e-quipment officer that 's liable at any minute to recognise them as the same tonics he bought from me not two weeks ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk that sets here gettingrich and takes no risk . " " I suppose you consider getting them back for you to sell taking no risk , " Granny said . " The risk of running out of them printed letterheads , sho , " Ab said . " If you ai n't satisfied with making just five or six hundred dollars at a time , why do n't you requisition for more mules at a time ? Why do n't you write out a letter and have General Smith turn over his commissary train to you , with about four wagonloads of new shoes in hit ? Or , better than that , pick out the day when the pay officer is coming around and draw for the whole pay wagon ; then we could n't even have to bother about finding somebody buy hit . " The money was in new bills . Granny folded them fully and put them into the can , but she did n't t the can back inside her dress right away ( and she cr put it back under the loose board beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat there looking at the fire , with the can in her hands and the string which suspended it looping down from around her neck . She did n't look any thinner or any older . She did n't look sick either . She just looked like somebody that has quit sleeping at night . " We have more mules , " she said , " if you would just sell them . There are more than a hundred of them that you refuse  --  " " Refuse is right , " Ab said ; he began to holler now : " Yes , sir ! I reckon I ai n't got much sense , or I would n't be doing this a-tall . But I got better sense than to take them mules to a Yankee officer and tell him that them hip patches where you and that durn nigger burned out the U. S. brand are trace galls . By Godfrey , I  --  " " That will do , " Granny said . " Have you had some supper ? " " I  --  " Ab said . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I done et . " " Then you had better go home and get some rest , " Granny said . " There is a new relief regiment at Mottstown . Ringo went down two days ago to see about it . So we may need that new fence soon . " Ab stopped chewing . " Is , huh ? " he said . " Out of Memphis , likely . Likely got them nine mules in it we just got shet of . " Granny looked at him . " So you sold them furtherp139luck than three days ago , then , " Granny said . AbStarted to say something , but Granny did n't give him c . " You go on home and rest up , " she said . " Ringo .11 probably be back tomorrow , and then you 'll havechance to see if they are the same mules . I may even vc a chance to find out what they say they paid u for them . " AI ) stood in the door and looked at Granny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yessum . You got my pecr . John Sartoris , himself , ca n't tech you . He Is all over the country day and night with a hun-d armed men , and it 's all he can do to keep them crowbait to ride on . And you set here in this cabin , ' thout nothing but a handful of durn printed letter- 's , and you got to build a bigger pen to hold thestock you ai n't got no market yet to sell . How many d of mules have you sold back to the Yankees ? " " A hundred and five , " Granny said . " A hundred and five , " Ab said . " For how much active cash money , in round numbers ? " Only he n't wait for her to answer ; he told her himself : or six thou-sand and seven hun-dred and twen-ty-o dollars and six-ty-five cents , lessen the dollar and thirty-five cents I spent for whisky that time the snake one of the mules . " It sounded round when he said like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a year ago with two . You got forty- odd in the pen and twice that many out on receipt . And I reckon you have sold about fifty-odd more back to the Yankees a hundred and five times , for a grand total of six thousand , seven hundred and twentytwodollars and sixty-five cents , and in a day or so you are aiming to requisition a few of them back again , I understand . " He looked at me . " Boy , " he said , " when you grow up and start out for yourself , do n't you waste your time learning to be a lawyer or nothing . You just save your money and buy you a handful of printed letterheads  --  it do n't matter much what 's on them , I reckon  --  and you hand them to your grandmaw here and just ask her to give you the job of counting the money when hit comes in . " He looked at Granny again . " When Kernel Sartorisleft here , he told me to look out for you against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if somebody had n't better tell Abe Lincoln to look out for General Grant against Miz Rosa Millard . I bid you one and all good night . " He went out . Granny looked at the fire , the tin can in her hand . But it did n't have any six thousand dollars in it . It did n't have a thousand dollars in it . Ab Snopes knew that , only I do n't suppose that it was possible for him to believe it . Then she got up ; she looked at me , quiet . She did n't look sick ; that was n't it . " Ip141reckon it 's bedtime , " she said . She went beyond the quilt ; it came back and hung straight down from the rafter , and I heard the loose board when she put the can away under the floor , and then I heard the sound the bed made when she would hold to the post to kneel down . It would make another sound when she got up , but when it made that sound , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cold , but when the sound came I had been there long enough for them to begin to get warm . Ab Snopes came and helped me and Joby with the new fence the next day , so we finished it early in the afternoon and I went back to the cabin . I was almost there when I saw Ringo on the mule turning in at the gates . Granny had seen him , too , because when I went inside the quilt , she was kneeling in the corner , taking the window shade from under the loose floor board . While she was unrolling the shade on the bed we heard Ringo getting off the mule , hollering at it while he hitched it to Louvinia 's clothesline . Then Granny stood up and looked at the quilt until Ringo pushed it aside and came in . And then they sounded like two people playing a guessing gamecode. "  --  th Illinois Infantry , " Ringo said . He came on and the map on the bed . " Col. G. W. Newberry . Eight days out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the bed . " How many ? " she said . " Nineteen head , " Ringo said . " Four with ; fifteen without . " Granny just watched him ; she did n't have to speak at all for the next one . " Twelve , " Ringo said . " Out of that Oxford batch . " Granny looked at the map ; they both looked at it . " July the twenty-second , " Granny said . " Yessum , " Ringo said . Granny sat down on the saw chunk before the map . It was the only window shade Louvinia had ; Ringo had drawn it ( Father was right ; he was smarter than me ; he had even learned to draw , who had declined even to try to learn to print his name when Loosh was teaching me ; who had learned to draw immediately by merely taking up the pen , who had no affinity for it and never denied he had not but who learned to draw simply because somebody had to. ) with Granny showing him where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done the writing , in her neat spidery hand like she wrote in the cookbookwith , written on the map by each town : Colonel or Major or Captain So-and-So , Such-and-Such Regimentor Troop Then , under that : 12 or 9 or 21 mules And around four of them , town and writing and all , in purple pokeberry juice instead of ink , a circle with a date in it , and in big neat letters Complete . They looked at the map , Granny 's head white andp143still where the light came through the window on it , and Ringo leaning over her . He had got taller during the summer ; he was taller than me now , maybe from the exercise of riding around the country , listening out for fresh regiments with mules , and he had got toating me like Granny did  --  like he and Granny were the same age instead of him and me . " We just sold that twelve in July , " Granny said . " That leaves only seven . And you say that four of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , " Ringo said . " It 's October ow . They done forgot about hit . ' Sides , look here " he put his finger on the map . " We captived these ore fourteen at Madison on the twelf of April , sontto Memphis and sold urn , and had all fourteen Jack and three more besides , here at Caledonia on the ird of May . " " Rut that was four counties apart , " Granny said . " Oxford and Mottstown are only a few miles apart . " " Phut , " Ringo said , " these folks is too busy keepingconquered to recognise no little ten or twelve headstock . ' Sides , if they does recognise um in Memphis , that 's Ab Snope 's trouble , not ourn . " " Mister Snopes , " Granny said . " All right , " Ringo said . He looked at the map . " Nineteen head , and not two days away . Jest forty- hours to have urn in the pen . "  | Granny looked at the map . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have been successful so far . Too successfulperhaps . " " Nineteen head , " Ringo said . " Four to keep and fifteen to sell back to urn . That will make a even two hundred and forty-eight head of Confed'rit mules we done recovered and collected interest on , let alone the money . " " I do n't know what to do , " Granny said . " I want to think about it . " " All right , " Ringo said . Granny sat still beside the map . Ringo did n't seem patient or impatient either ; he just stood there , thin and taller than me against the light from the window , scratching himself . Then he began to dig with his right-hand little fingernail between his front teeth ; he looked at his fingernail and spat something , and then he said , " Must been five minutes now . " He turned his head a little towardme without moving . " Get the pen and ink , " he said . They kept the paper under the same floor board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how or where Ringo got it . He just came back one night with about a hundred sheets of it , stamped with the official letterhead : UNITED STATES FORCES . DEPARTMENT OF TENNESSEE . He had got the pen and the ink at the same time , too ; he took them from me , and now it wasp145Ringo sitting on the saw chunk and Granny leaning ovcr him . Granny still had the first letter  --  the order that Colonel Dick had given us in Alabama last year - she kept it in the can , too , and by now Ringo had learned to copy it so that I do n't believe that Colonel Dick himself could have told the difference . All they had to do was to put in the right regiment and whatevernumber of mules Ringo had examined and approved , and sign the right general 's name to it . At first Ringo had wanted to sign Grant 's name every time , end when Granny said that would not do anymore , Lincoln 's . At last Granny found out that Ringo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any dealings with anybody under the General-in-Chief . But at last he realised that Granny was right , that they would have to be careful about what general 's name was on the letter , as well as what mules they requisitioned . They were using General Smith now ; he and Forrest were fighting every day Up and down the road to Memphis , and Ringo always remembered to put in rope . He wrote the date and the town , the headquarters ; wrote in Colonel Newberry 's name and the first line . Then he stopped ; he did n't lift the pen . " What name you want this time ? " he said . " I 'm worried about this , " Granny said . " We ought Sot to risk it . "  | " We was on last time , " Ringo said . " It 's H ' now . Think of a name in H. ' " " Mrs. Mary Harris , " Granny said . " We done used Mary before , " Ringo said . " Flow about Plurella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Granny said . " Miz Plurella Harris , " Ringo said , writing . " Now we done used up P ' too . ' Member that , now . I reckon when we run out of letters , maybe we can start in on numbers . We will have nine hundred and ninety-nine before we have to worry , then . " He finished the order and signed " General Smith " to it ; it looked exactly like the man who had signed the one Colonel Dick gave us was named General Smith , except for the number of mules . Then Granny turned and looked at me . " Tell Mr. Snopes to be ready at sunup , " she said . We went in the wagon , with Ab Snopes and his two men following on two of the mules . We went just fast enough so that we would reach the bivouac at suppertime , because Granny and Ringo had found out that that was the best time  --  that the stock would all be handy , and the men would be too hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they happened to think , and we would just have time to get the mules and get out of sight before dark came . Then , if they should decide to chase us , by the timep147they found us in the dark , there would n't be anything but the wagon with me and Granny in it to capture . So we did ; only this time it was a good thing we did .. We left Ab Snopes and his men in the woods beyond . the bivouac , and Granny and Ringo and I drove up to Colonel Newberry 's tent at exactly the right time , and Cranny passed the sentry and went into the tent , walking thin and straight , with the shawl over her shoulders and Mrs. Compson 's hat on her head and the parasol in one hand and hers and Ringo 's General Smith order in the other , and Ringo and I sat in the wagon and looked at the cook fires about the groved smelled the coffee and the meat . It was always themc . Granny would disappear into the tent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody would holler inside the tent or the house , and then the sentry et the door would holler , and then a sergeant , or even sometimes an officer , only it would be a lieutenant , would hurry into the tent or the house , and then Ringo ' end I would hear somebody cursing , and then they would all come out , Granny walking straight and stiff end not looking much bigger than Cousin Denny at Hawkhurst , and three or four mad Yankee officers behind her , and getting madder all the time . Then they would bring up the mules , tied together . Granny and Ringo could guess to the second now ; it would be just enough light left to tell that they were mules , and Granny would get into the wagon and Ringo would hang his legs over the tail gate , holding the lead rope , and we would go on , not fast , so that when we came back to where Ab Snopes and his men waited in the woods you could not even tell that they were mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would turn off into the woods and Granny and I would go on home . That 's what we did this time ; only this time it happened . We could n't even see our own team when we heard them coming , the galloping hoofs . They came up fast and mad ; Granny jerked up quick and straight , holding Mrs. Compson 's parasol . " Damn that Ringo ! " she said . " I had my doubts about this time all the while . " Then they were all around us , like the dark itself had fallen down on us , full of horses and mad men shouting " Halt ! Halt ! If they try to escape , shoot the team ! " with me and Granny sitting in the wagon and men jerking the team back and the team jerking and clashing in the traces , and some of them hollering " Where are the mules ? The mules are gone ! " and the officer cursing and shouting " Of course they are gone ! " and cursing Granny and the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and we saw the officer sitting his horse beside the wagon whilep149to of the soldiers lit one light-wood splinter from another . " Where are the mules ? " the officer shouted . " What mules ? " Granny said . " Do n't lie to me ! " the officer shouted . " The mules you just left camp with on that forged order ! We have got you this time ! We knew you 'd turn up again . Ordcrs went out to the whole department to watch r you a month ago ! That damn Newberry had hisy in his pocket while you were talking to him . " to cursed Colonel Newberry now . " They ought to t you go free and court-martial him ! Where 's the Eget. boy and the mules , Mrs. Plurella Harris ? " " I do n't know what you are talking about , " Granny id . " I have no mules except this team I am driving . And my name is Rosa Millard . I am on my way home beyond Jefferson . " The officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . " So that 's your real name , hey ? Well , well , II . So you have begun to tell the truth at last . Come w , tell me where those mules are , and tell me where c others you have stolen from us are hid . " Then Ringo hollered . He and Ab Snopes and the tiles had turned off into the woods on the right side the road , but when he hollered now he was on the left side . " Heyo the road ! " he hollered . " One busted loose ! Head um off the road ! "  | And that was all of that . The soldier dropped the light-wood splinter and the officer whirled his horse , already spurring him , hollering , " Two men stay here . " Maybe they all thought he meant two others , because there was just a big noise of bushes and trees like a cyclone was going through them , and then Granny and I were sitting in the wagon like before we had even heard the hoofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already getting out of the wagon . " Are we going to leave the team and wagon ? " I said . " Yes , " Granny said . " I misdoubted this all the time . " We could not see at all in the woods ; we felt our way , and me helping Granny along and her arni did n't feel any bigger than a pencil almost , but it was n't trembling . " This is far enough , " she said . I found a log and we sat down . Beyond the road we could hear them , thrashing around , shouting and cursing . It sounded far away now . " And the team too , " Granny said . " But we have nineteen new ones , " I said . " That makes two hundred and forty-eight . " It seemed like a long time , sitting there on the log in the dark . After a while they came back , we could hear the officer cursing and the horses crashing and thumping back into the road . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Granny and me , end the two men he had told to stay there . He waspill cursing while they turned the wagon around . Then they went away . After a while we could n't hearthem . Granny got up and we felt our way back to theroad , and we went on , too , toward home . After awhile I persuaded her to stop and rest , and while wewere sitting beside the road we heard the buggy corn- . We stood up , and Ringo saw us and stopped the " Did I holler loud enough ? " he said . " Yes , " Granny said . Then she said , " Well ? " " All right , " Ringo said . " I told Ab Snopes to hide t with them in Hickahala bottom until tomorrow ht . All ' cep ' these two . " " Mister Snopes , " Granny said . " A I I right , " Ringo said . " Get in and le 's go home . " ( ; rainy did n't move ; I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get this buggy ? " " I borrowed hit , " Ringo said . " ' Twar n't no Yankees dy , so I never needed no paper . " We got in . The buggy went on . It seemed to me like had already been all night , but it was n't midnight t I could tell by the stars  --  we would be home by &night; almost . We went on . " I reckon you wenttold urn who we is now , " Ringo said . " Yes , " Granny said.  | " Well , I reckon that completes that , " Ringo said . " Anyway , we handled two hundred and forty-eight head while the business lasted . " " Two hundred and forty-six , " Granny said . " We have lost the team . " It was after midnight when we reached home ; it was already Sunday and when we reached the church that morning there was the biggest crowd waiting there had ever been , though Ab Snopes would not get back with the new mules until tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they knew too , like Ringo , that this was the end and that now the books would have to be balanced and closed . We were late , because Granny made Ringo get up at sunup and take the buggy back where he had got it . So when we reached the church they were already inside , waiting . Brother Fortinbride met us at the door , and they all turned in the pews and watched Granny  --  the old men and the women and the children and the maybe a dozen niggers that did n't have any white people now  --  they looked at her exactly like Father 's fox hounds would look at him when he would go into the dog run , while we went up thep153aisle to our pew . Ringo had the book ; he went up to c gallery ; I looked back and saw him leaning his anus on the book on the balustrade . Wc sat down in our pew , like before there was awar , only for Father  --  Granny still and straight in herday calico dress and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ; straight and quiet , it lt her hands holding her prayer book in her lap likeays , though there had n't been an Episcopal servicethe church in almost three years now . Brotherinlbride was a Methodist , and I do n't know whatpeople were . Last summer when we got back withfirst batch of mules from Alabama , Granny sentthem , sent out word back into the hills where theyin dirt-floored cabins , on the little poor farmsbout slaves . It took three or four times to get themcome in , but at last they all came  --  men and womenchildren and the dozen niggers that had got freeaccident and did n't know what to do about it . Ion this was the first church with a slave galleryof them had ever seen , with Ringo and the otherve sitting up there in the high shadows wherewas room enough for two hundred ; and I couldtither back when Father would be in the pew withand the grove outside would be full of carriagesthe other plantations , and Doctor Worsham instele beneath the altar , and for each white personp154in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I reckon that on that first Sunday when Granny knelt down in public , it was the first time they had ever seen anyone kneel in a church . Brother Fortinbride was n't a minister either . I lc was a private in Father 's regiment , and he got hurt bad in the first battle the regiment was in ; they thought that he was dead , but he said that Jesus came to hint and told him to rise up and live , and Father sent hint back home to die , only he did n't die . But they said that he did n't have any stomach left at all , and everybodythought that the food we had to eat in 1862 and ' 63 would finish killing him , even if he had eaten it with women to cook it instead of gathering weeds from ditch banks and cooking them himself . But it did n't kill him , and so maybe it was Jesus , after all , like he said . And so , when we came back with the first batch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent word out for all that needed , it was like Brother Fortinbride sprang right up out of the ground with the names and histories of all the hill folks at his tongue 's end , like maybe what he claimed was true  --  that the Lord had both him and Granny in mind when He created the other . So he would stand there where Doctor Worsham used to stand , and talk quiet for a little while about God , with his hair showing where he cut it himself and the bones looking like they werep155coming right out through his face , in a frock coat that had turned green a long time ago and with patches onthat he had sewed on himself  --  one of them wastt horsehide and the other was a piece of tentvas with the U. S. A. stencil still showing a littlen it . He never talked long ; there was n't much anybodycould say about Confederate armies now . Ikon there is a time when even preachers quit beingthat God is going to change His plan and givevictory where there is nothing left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is mockery anddelusion , but that defeat with God is not defeat . Thenquit talking , and he stood there with the old menthe women and children and the eleven or twelvers lost in freedom , in clothes made out of cottong and floursacks , still watching Granny  --  onlyit was not like the hounds used to look at Father , like they would watch the food in Loosh 's handsen he would go in to feed them  --  and then he " Brethren and sisters , Sister Millard wishes to bear public witness . " Granny stood up . She would not go to the altar ; shestood there in our pew with her face straightin the shawl and Mrs. Compson 's hat and thethat Louvinia washed and ironed every Saturholdingthe prayer book . It used to have herp156name on it in gold letters , but now the only way you could read them was to run your finger over them ; she said quiet , too  --  quiet as Brother Fortinbridc  --  1 have sinned . I want you all to pray for me . " She knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denny ; it was only Mrs. Compson 's hat above the pew back they had to look at now . I do n't know if she prayed herself or not . And Brother Fortinbridc did n't pray either  --  not aloud anyway . Ringo and I were just past fifteen then , but I could imagine what Doctor Worsham would have thought up to say  --  about all soldiers did not carry arms , and about they also serve , and how one child saved from hunger and cold is better in heaven 's sight than a thousand slain enemies . But Brother Fortinbride did n't say it . I reckon he thought of that ; he always had plenty of words when he wanted to . It was like he said to himself , " Words are fine in peacetime , when everybody is comfortable and easy . But now I think that we can br ; excused . " He just stood there where Doctor Worsham used to stand and where the bishop would stand , too , with his ring looking big as a pistol target . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her ; she stood up , and then the long sound went through the church , a sound kind of like a sigh that Ringo said was the sound of the cotton bagging and the floursacking when they breathed again , and Granny turned andp157Aced back toward the gallery ; only Ringo was already moving . " Bring the book , " she said . It was a big blank account book ; it weighed almost teen pounds . They opened it on the reading desk , nny and Ringo side by side , while Granny drew 0 tin can out of her dress and spread the money on c book . But nobody moved until she began to call It the names . Then they came up one at a time , while Ringo read the names off the book , and the date , and 0 amount they had received before . Each time tunny would make them tell what they intended towith the money , and now she would make them II her how they had spent it , and she would look atbook to see whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaned the brand-blotted mules thatSnopes was afraid to try to sell would have to tellhow the mule was getting along and how muchit had done , and now and then she would takemule away from one man or woman and give it toer , tearing up the old receipt and making theor the woman sign the new one , telling them ont day to go and get the mule. it was afternoon when Ringo closed the bookgot the new receipts together , and Granny stoppedg the rest of the money back into the can andand Brother Fortinbride did what they did eachp158time . " I 'm making out fine with the mule , " he said . " I do n't need any money . " " Fiddlesticks , " Granny said . " You 'll never grow enough food out of the ground to feed a bird the longest day you live . You take this money . " " No , " Brother Fortinbride said . " I 'm making out fine . " We walked back home , Ringo carrying the book . " You done receipted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " What you gonter do about that ? " " They will be here tomorrow morning , I reckon , " Granny said . They were ; Ab Snopes came in while we were eating breakfast ; he leaned in the door with his eyes a little red from lack of sleep and looked at Granny . " Yes , ma'am , " he said , " I do n't never want to be rich ; I just want to be lucky . Do you know what you done ? " Only nobody asked him what , so he told us anyway : " Hit was taking place all day yestiddy ; I reckon by now there ai n't a Yankee regiment left in Mississippi . You might say that this here war has turned around at last and went back North . Yes , sir . That regiment you requisitioned on Sattidy never even stayed long enough to warm the ground . You managed to requisition the last batch of Yankee livestock at the last possible moment hit could have been donep159by living man . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules just too late to have ybody to sell them back to . " It was a bright warm day ; we saw the guns and theshining a long way down the road . But this time go did n't even move . He just quit drawing and kcd up from the paper and said , " So Ab Snopeslying . Gre't God , ai n't we gonter never get shet them ? " It was just a lieutenant ; by this time Ringo and I uld tell the different officers ' ranks better than we Id tell Confederate ranks , because one day we ntcd up and the only Confederate officers we had r seen were Father and the captain that talked to with Uncle Buck McCaslin that day in Jefferson fore Grant burned it . And this was to be the t time we would see any uniforms at all except the walking symbols of defeated men 's pride d indomitable unregret , but we did n't know thatSo it was just a lieutenant . He looked about forty , and kind of mad and gleeful , both at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not beenp160in the wagon with us , but I did  --  from the way he sat the horse , or maybe from the way he looked mad and happy both , like he had been mad for several days , thinking about how much he was going to enjoy being mad when the right time came . And he recognised me , too ; he looked at me once and said " Hah ! " with his teeth showing , and pushed his horse up and looked at Ringo 's picture . There were maybe a dozen cavalry behind him ; we never noticed especially . " Hah ! " he said again , then he said , " What 's that ? " " A house , " Ringo said . Ringo had never even looked at him good yet ; he had seen even more of them than I had . " Look at it . " The lieutenant looked at me and said " Hah ! " again behind his teeth ; every now and then while he was talking to Ringo he would do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up the grove to where the chimneys rose out of the pile of rubble and ashes . Grass and weeds had come up out of the ashes now , and unless you knew better , all you saw was the four chimneys . Some of the goldenrod was still in bloom . " Oh , " the officer said . " I see . You 're drawing it like it used to be . " " Co-rect , " Ringo said . " What I wanter draw hit like hit is now ? I can walk down here ten times a day and look at hit like hit is now . I can even ride in that gate on a horse and do that . "  |p161The  lieutenant did n't say " Hah ! " this time . He did n't do anything yet ; I reckon he was still enjoying waiting a little longer to get good and mad . He just kind of grunted . " When you get done here , you can move into town and keep busy all winter , ca n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't say " Hah ! " now either ; it was his eyes that said it , looking at me . They were a kind of thin milk color , like the chine knucklebone in a ham . " All right , " he said . " Who lives up there now ? What 's her name today , hey ? " Ringo was watching him now , though I do n't think he suspected yet who he was . " Do n't nobody , " he said . " The roof leaks . " One of the men made a kind of sound ; maybe it was laughing . The lieutenant started to whirl around , and then he started not to ; then he sat there glaring down at Ringo with his mouth beginning to open . " Oh , " Ringo said , " you mean way back yonder in the quarters . I thought you was still worrying about them chimneys . " This time the soldier did laugh , and this time the lieutenant did whirl around , cursing at the soldier ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . He cursed at them all now , sitting there with his face swelling up . " Blank-blank-blank ! " he shouted . " Get to hell on out of here ! He said that pen is down there in the creek bottom beyond the pasture . If you meetp162man , woman or child and they so much as smile at you , shoot them ! Get ! " The soldiers went on , gallopingup the drive ; we watched them scatter out across the pasture . The lieutenant looked at me and Ringo ; he said " Hah ! " again , glaring at us . " You boys come with me . Jump ! " He did n't wait for us ; he galloped , too , up the drive . We ran ; Ringo looked at me . " He ' said the pen was in the creek bottom , " Ringo said . " Who you reckon he ' is ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " Well , I reckon I know , " Ringo said . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive . The lieutenant had reached the cabin now , and Granny came out the door . I reckon she had seen him , too , because she already had her sunbonnet on . They looked at us once , then Granny went on , too , walking straight , not fast , down the path toward the lot , with the lieutenant behind her on the horse . We could see his shoulders and his head , and now and then his hand and arm , but we could n't hear what he was saying . " I reckon this does complete hit , " Ringo said . But we could hear him before we reached the new fence . Then we could see them standing at the fence that Joby and I had just finished  --  Ganny straight and still , with her sunbonnet on and the shawl drawn tight over her shoulders where she had her armsp163folded in it so that she looked littler than anybody I could remember , like during the four years she had n't got any older or weaker , but just littler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indomitable ; and the lieutenant beside her with one hand on his hip and waving a whole handful of letters at Granny 's face with the other . " Look like he got all we ever wrote there , " Ringo said . The soldiers ' horses were all tied along the fence ; they were inside the pen now , and they and Joby and Ab Snopes had the forty-odd old mules and the nineteennew ones hemmed into the corner . The mules were still trying to break out , only it did n't look like that . It looked like every one of them was trying to keep the big burned smear where Granny and Ringo had blotted the U. S. brand turned so that the lieutenantwould have to look at it . " And I guess you will call those scars left-handed trace galls ! " the lieutenant said . " You have been using cast-off band-saw bands for traces , hey ? I 'd rather engageForrest 's whole brigade every morning for six months than spend that same length of time trying to protect United States property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he shouted . " Defenseless ! God help the North if Davis and Lee had ever thought of the idea of forming a brigade of grandmothers and nigger or/phans , and invading us with it ! " he hollered , shaking the letters at Granny . In the pen the mules huddled and surged , with Ab Snopes waving his arms at them now and then . Then the lieutenant quit shouting ; he even quit shaking the letters at Granny . " Listen , " he said . " We are on evacuation orders now . Likely I am the last Federal soldier you will have to look at . And I 'm not going to harm you  --  orders to that effect too . All I 'm going to do is take back this stolen property . And now I want you to tell me , as enemy to enemy , or even man to man , if you like . I know from these forged orders how many head of stock you have taken from us , and I know from the records how many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I even know what we paid you . But how many of them did you actually sell back to us more than one time ? " " I do n't know , " Granny said . " You do n't know , " the lieutenant said . He did n't start to shout now , he just stood there , breathing slow and hard , looking at Granny ; he talked now with a kind of furious patience , as if she were an idiot or an Indian : " Listen . I know you do n't have to tell me , and you know I ca n't make you . I ask it only out of pure respect . Respect ? Envy . Wo n't you tell me ? " " I do n't know , " Granny said.  | " You do n't know , " the lieutenant said . " You mean , you  --  " He talked quiet now . " I see . You really do n't know . You were too busy running the reaper to count the  --  " We did n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ringo and me that watched him fold the letters that Granny and Ringo had written and put them carefully into his pocket . He still talked quiet , like he was tired : " All right , boys . Rope them together and haze them out of there . " " The gate is a quarter of a mile from here , " a soldier said . " Throw down some fence , " the lieutenant said . They began to throw down the fence that Joby and I had worked two months on . The lieutenant took a pad from his pocket , and he went to the fence and laid the pad on the rail and took out a pencil . Then he looked back at Granny ; he still talked quiet : " I believe you said the name now is Rosa Millard ? " " Yes , " Granny said . The lieutenant wrote on the pad and tore the sheet out and came back to Granny . He still talked quiet , like when somebody is sick in a room . " We arc under orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation , " he said . " This is a voucher on the quartermaster at Memphis for ten dollars . For the fence . " He did n't give the paper to her at once ; he just stood there , looking at her . " Confound it ,  | I do n't mean promise . If I just knew what you believed in , held  --  " He cursed again , not loud and not at anybody or anything . " Listen . I do n't say promise ; I never mentioned the word . But I have a family ; I am a poor man ; I have no grandmother . And if in about four months the auditor should find a warrantin the records for a thousand dollars to Mrs. Rosa Millard , I would have to make it good . Do you see ? " " Yes , " Granny said . " You need not worry . " Then they were gone . Granny and Ringo and Joby and I stood there and watched them drive the mules up across the pasture and out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , hit looks like that 's all they are to hit . But you still got that ere hundred-odd that are out on receipt , provided them hill folks do n't take a example from them Yankees . I reckon you can still be grateful for that much anyway . So I 'll bid you , one and all , good day and get on home and rest a spell . If I can help you again , just send for me . " He went on too . After a while Granny said : " Joby , put those rails back up . " I reckon Ringo and I were both waiting for her to tell us to help Joby , but she did n't . She just said " Come , " and turned and went on , not toward the cabin but across the pasture toward the road . We did n't know where we werep167going until we reached the church . She went straight up the aisle to the chancel and stood there until we came up . " Kneel down , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small between us , little ; she talked quiet , not loud , not fast and not slow ; her voice sounded quiet and still , but . t rang and clear : " I have sinned . I have stolen , and I have borne false witness against my neighbor , though t hat neighbor was an enemy of my country . And more than that , I have caused these children to sin . I hereby take their sins upon my conscience . " It was one of t hose bright soft days . It was cool in the church ; the floor was cold to my knees . There was a hickory branch just outside the window , turning yellow ; when the sun touched it , the leaves looked like gold . " But I did not sin for gain or for greed , " Granny said . " I did not sin for revenge . I defy You or anyone to say I did . I sinned first for justice . And after that first time , I sinned for more than justice ; I sinned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could not help themselves  --  for children who had given their fathers , for wives who had given their husbands , for old people who had given their sons to a holy cause , even though You have seen fit to make it a lost cause . What I gained , I shared with them . It is true that I kept some of it back , but I am the best judge of that because I , too , have dependents who may be orphans ,  |p168too  , at this moment , for all I know . And if this be sin in Your sight , I take this on my conscience too . Amen . " She rose up . She got up easy , like she had no weight to herself . It was warm outside ; it was the finest Octoberthat I could remember . Or maybe it was because you are not conscious of weather until you are fifteen . We walked slow back home , though Granny said she was n't tired . " I just wish I knew how they found out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? " Ringo said . Granny looked at him . " Ab Snopes told them . " This time she did n't even say , " Mister Snopes . " She just stopped dead still and looked at Ringo . " Ab Snopes ? " " Do you reckon he was going to be satisfied until he had sold them last nineteen mules to somebody ? " Ringo said . " Ab Snopes , " Granny said . " Well . " Then she walked on ; we walked on . " Ab Snopes , " she said . " I reckon he beat me , after all . But it ca n't be helped now . And anyway , we did pretty well , taken by and large . " " We done damn well , " Ringo said . He caught himself , but it was already too late . Granny did n't even stop . " Go on home and get the soap , " she said.  |p169I  lc went on . We could watch him cross the pasture and go into the cabin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring . We were close now ; when I left Granny and went down to the spring , he was just rinsing his mouth , the can of soap in one hand and the gourd dipper in the other . He spit and rinsed his mouth and spit again ; there was a long smear of suds up his cheek ; a light froth of colored bubbles flicking away while I watched them , without any sound at all . " I still says we done damn well , " he said . We tried to keep her from doing it  --  we both tried . Ringo had told her about Ab Snopes , and after thatwe both knew it . It was like all three of us shouldhave known it all the time . Only I do n't believe nowthat he meant to happen what did happen . But I believethat if he had known what was going to happen , he would still have egged her on to do it . And Ringoandd I tried  --  we tried  --  but Granny just sat there beforethe fire  --  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shawl and with that look on her faceWhen she had quit either arguing or listening to youall , saying just this one time more and that even arogue will be honest for enough pay . It was Christ- mas ; we had just heard from Aunt Louisa at Hawkhurstand found out where Drusilla was ; she had been missing from home for almost a year now , and at last Aunt Louisa found out that she was with Father away in Carolina , like she had told me , riding with the troop like she was a man . Ringo and I had just got back from Jefferson with the letter , and Ab Snopes was in the cabin , telling Granny about it , and Granny listening and believing him because she still believed that what side of a war a man fought on made him what he is . And she knew better with her own ears ; she must have known ; everybody knew about them and were either mad if they were men or terrified if they were women . There was one Negro in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned him up in his cabin . They called themselves Grumby 's Independents  --  aboutfifty or sixty of them that wore no uniform and came from nobody knew where as soon as the last Yankee regiment was out of the country , raidingsmokehouses and stables , and houses where they were sure there were no men , tearing up beds and floors and walls , frightening white women and torturingNegroes to find where money or silver was hidden . They were caught once , and the one that said he was Grumby produced a tattered raiding commis/lion actually signed by General Forrest ; though you could n't tell if the original name was Grumby or not . But it got them off , because it was just some old men that captured them ; and now women who had lived alone for three years surrounded by invading armies were afraid to stay in the houses at night , and the Negroes who had lost their white people lived hidden in caves back in the hills like animals . That 's who Ab Snopes was talking about , with his hat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the back of his head where he had slept on it . The band had a thoroughbred stallion and three mares  --  how Ab Snopes knew it he did n't say  --  that they had stolen ; and how he knew they were stolen , he did n't say . But all Granny had to do was to write out one of the orders and sign Forrest 's name to it ; he , Ab , would guarantee to get two thousand dollars for the horses . He swore to that , and Granny , sitting there with her arms rolled into the shawl and that expression on her face , and Ab Snopes ' shadow leaping and jerking up the wall while he waved his arms and talked about that was all she had to do ; to look at what the had made out of the Yankees , enemies , and that these were Southern men and , therefore , there would not even be any risk to this , because Southern men would not harm a woman , even if the letter failed to work.  | Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ringo and I had no chance against him  --  about how the business with the Yankees had stopped without warning , beforeshe had made what she had counted on , and how she had given most of that away under the belief that she would be able to replace that and more , but as it was now , she had made independent and secure almosteveryone in the county save herself and her own blood ; that soon Father would return home to his ruined plantation and most of his slaves vanished ; and how it would be if , when he came home and looked about at his desolate future , she could take fifteen hundred dollars in cash out of her pocket and say , " Here . Start over with this "  --  fifteen hundred dollars more than she had hoped to have . He would take one of the mares for his commission and he would guarantee her fifteen hundred dollars for the other three . Oh , we had no chance against him . We begged her to let us ask advice from Uncle Buck McCaslin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with that expression on her face , saying that the horses did not belong to him , that they had been stolen , and that all she had to do was to frighten them with the order , and even Ringo and I knowing at fifteen that Grumby , or whoever he was , was a coward and that you might frighten a brave man , but that nobody dared frightenp173a coward ; and Granny , sitting there without moving at all and saying , " But the horses do not belong to them because they are stolen property , " and we said , " Then no more will they belong to us , " and Granny said , " But they do not belong to them . " But we did n't quit trying ; all that day  --  Ab Snopes had located them ; it was an abandoned cotton compresson Tallahatchie River , sixty miles away  --  while we rode in the rain in the wagon Ab Snopes got for us to use , we tried . But Granny just sat there on the rear between us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tin can under her dress and her feet on some hot bricks in a crokersack that we would stop every ten miles and build a fire in the rain and heat again , until we came to the crossroads , where Ab Snopes told us to leave the wagon and walk . And then she would not let me and Ringo go with her . " You and Ringo look like men , " she said . " They wo n't hurt a woman . " It had rained all day ; it had fallen gray and steady and slow and cold on us all day long , and now it was like twilight had thickened it without being able to make it any grayer or colder . The crossroad was not a road any more ; it was no more than a faint gash turning off at right angles into the bottom , so that it looked like a cave . We could see the hoof marks in it . " Then you sha n't go , " I said . " I 'm stronger thanp174you are ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm felt little and light and dry as a stick . But it was n't that ; her size and appearance had no more to do with it than it had in her dealings with the Yankees ; she just turned and looked at me , and then I began to cry . I would be sixteen years old before another year was out , yet I sat there in the wagon , crying . I did n't even know when she freed her arm . And then she was out of the wagon , standing there looking at me in the gray rain and the gray darkening light . " It 's for all of us , " she said . " For John and you and Ringo and Joby and Louvinia . So we will have something when John comes back home . You never cried when you knew he was going into a battle , did you ? And now I am taking no risk ; I am a woman . Even Yankees do not harm old women . You and Ringo stay here until I call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I know now that I did n't . I could have held her , turned the wagon , driven away , holding her in it . I was just fifteen , and for most of my life her face had been the first thing I saw in the morning and the last thing I saw at night , but I could have stopped her , and I did n't . I sat there in the wagon in the cold rain and let her walk on into the wet twilight and never come out of it again . How many of them there were in the old compress , I do n't know , and when and why they took fright and left , I do n't know.  |p175We  just sat there in the wagon in that cold dissolvingDecember twilight until at last I could n't bear k any longer . Then Ringo and I were both running , trying to run , in the ankle-deep mud of that old road pocked with the prints of ingoing hoofs , but of no Wheel , knowing that we had waited too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because there was o sound nor sign of life at all ; just the huge rotting uilding with the gray afternoon dying wetly uponand then at the end of the hall a faint crack of light beneath a door . I do n't remember touching the door at all , because the room was a floor raised about two feet from the earth , so that I ran into the step and fell forward into and then through the door , onto my hands and kneesthe room , looking at Granny . There was a tallow tip still burning on a wooden box , but it was the powder I smelled , stronger even than the tallow . I could n't seem to breathe for the smell of the powder , yoking at Granny . She had looked little alive , but ow she looked like she had collapsed , like she had seen made out of a lot of little thin dry light sticks etched together and braced with cord , and now c cord had broken and all the little sticks had colpsedin a quiet heap on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calico dress over them.  |p177They  all came in again when we buried Granny , Brother Fortinbride and all of them  --  the old men and the women and the children , and the niggers  --  the twelve who used to come in when word would spread that Ab Snopes was back from Memphis , and the hundred more who had returned to the county since , who had followed the Yankees away and then returned , to find their families and owners gone , to scatter into the hills and live in caves and hollow trees like animals I suppose , not only with no one to de- pend on but with no one depending on them , caring whether they returned or not or lived or died or not : and that I suppose is the sum , the sharp serpent 's fang , of bereavement and loss  --  all coming in from the hills in the rain . Only there were no Yankees in Jeffersonnow so they did n't have to walk in ; I could look across the grave and beyond the other headstonesand monuments and see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their hips where Granny and Ringo had burned out the U. S. brand . Most of the Jefferson people were there too , and there was another preacher  --  a big preacher refugeeing from Memphis or somewhere  --  and I found out how Mrs. Compson and some of them had arranged for him to preach the funeral . But Brother Fortinbride did n't let him . He did n't tell him not to ; he just did n't say anything to him at all , he just acted like a grown person coming in where the children are getting ready to play a game and telling the children that the game is all right but that the grown folks need the room and the furniture for a while . He came walking fast up from the grove where he had hitched his mule with the others , with his gaunted face and his frock coat with the horsehide and the Yankee-tent patches , into where the town people were standing around under umbrellas with Granny in the middle and the bigp179refugeeing preacher with his book already open one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashing slow and cold and y on the umbrella and splashing slow on the yellowboards where Granny was and into the dark red beside the red grave without splashing at all . her Fortinbride just walked in and looked atumbrellas and then at the hill people in cotton ing and split floursack clothes that did n't haveumbrellas , and went to Granny and said , " Come , youThe town men would have moved . Some of them Uncle Buck McCaslin was the first man of them town and hill , to come forward . By Christmas his matism would be so bad that he could n't hardly his hand , but he was there now , with his peeled hickory stick , shoving up through the hill men with crsacks tied over their heads and the town menumbrellas getting out of his way ; then Ringo I stood there and watched Granny going down the earth with the quiet rain splashing on the w boards until they quit looking like boards and n to look like water with thin sunlight reflectedk , sinking away into the ground . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cis darting and flicking slow and steady and hill men waiting to take turns with the shovelsp18obecause Uncle Buck would not let anyone spell him with his . It did n't take long , and I reckon the refugeeing preacher would have tried again even then , but Brother Fortinbride did n't give him a chance . Brother Fortinbridedid n't even put down his shovel ; he stood there leaning on it like he was in the field , and he sounded just like he used to in the church when Ab Snopes would be home from Memphis again  --  strong and quiet and not loud : " I do n't reckon that Rosa Millard or anybody that ever knew her has to be told where she has gone . And I do n't reckon that anybody that ever knew her would want to insult her by telling her to rest anywhere in peace . And I reckon that God has already seen to it that there are men , women and children , black , white , yellow or red , waiting for her to tend and worry over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ai n't come far , and you came that distance in carriages with tops .

And what do you reckon Rosa Millard would say about you all standing around here , keeping old folks and children out here in the rain ? " Mrs. Compson asked me and Ringo to come home and live with her until Father came back , and some1p181did  --  I do n't remember who  --  and then , whenI thought they had all gone , I looked around , and  --  was Uncle Buck . He came up to us with one jammed into his side and his beard drawn over c side like it was another arm , and his eyes red mad like he had n't slept much , and holding his like he was fixing to hit somebody with it and I n't much care who. hat you boys going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft now , dark and red rain , so that the rain did n't splash on Granny ; it just dissolved slow and gray into the dark- round , so that after a while the mound began to vc , too , without changing shape , like the softcolor of the boards had dissolved and stained rough the earth , and mound and boards and rain all inciting into one vague quiet reddish gray . want to borrow a pistol , " I said. began to holler then , but quiet . Because he older than us ; it was like it had been at the oldss that night with Granny . " Need me or not , " crcd , " by Godfrey , I 'm going ! You ca n't stopou mean to tell me you do n't want me to go you ? " do n't care , " I said . " I just want a pistol . Or a l hers got burned up with the house . " All right ! " he hollered . " Me and the pistol , or youp182and this nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even got a poker at home , have you ? " " We got the bar'l of the musket yet , " Ringo said . " I reckon that 's all we 'll need for Ab Snopes . " " Ab Snopes ? " Uncle Buck hollered . " Do you think it 's Ab Snopes this boy is thinking about ? . . . Hey ? " he hollered , hollering at me now . " Hey , boy ? " It was changing all the time , with the slow gray rain lane inslow and gray and cold into the red earth , yet it did not change . It would be some time yet ; it would be days and weeks and then months before it would Ise smooth and quiet and level with the other earth . Now Uncle Buck was talking at Ringo , and not hollering now . " Catch my mule , " he said . " I got the pistol in my britches . " Ab Snopes lived back in the hills too . Uncle Buck knew where ; it was midafternoon by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between pines when Uncle Buck stopped . He and Ringo had crokersacks tied over their heads . Uncle Buck 's hand-worn stick stuck out from under his sack with the rain shining on it like a long wax candle . " Wait , " he said . " I got a idea . " We turned front the road and came to a creek bottom ; there was a faint path . It was dark under the trees and the rain did n't fall on us now ; it was like the bare trees themselveswere dissolving slow and steady and cold into X83end of the December day . We rode in single file , inwet clothes and in the wet ammonia steam of the ales . The pen was just like the one he and Ringo andJoby and I had built at home , only smaller and better'widen ; I reckon he had got the idea from ours . We pled at the wet rails ; they were still new enough the split sides to be still yellow with sap , and on far side of the pen there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it moved . And then we saw that it was a claybank stalandthree mares . " I thought so , " Uncle Buck said. because I was mixed up . Maybe it was because go and I were tired and we had n't slept muchely . Because the days were mixed up with the Ins , all the while we had been riding I would keep thinking how Ringo and I would catch it from nny when we got back home , for going off in the without telling her . Because for a minute I satand looked at the horses and I believed that Snopes was Grumby . But Uncle Buck begun to r again. im , Grumby ? " he hollered . " Ab Snopes ? Ab lies ? By Godfrey , if he was Grumby , if it was Snopes that shot your grandmaw , I 'd be ashamed have it known . I 'd be ashamed to be caught catch/ing him . No , sir . He ai n't Grumby ; he 's better than that . " He sat sideways on his mule with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it while he talked . " He 's the one that 's going to show us where Grumby is . They just hid them horses here because they thought this would be the last place you boys would think to look for them . And now Ab Snopes has went off with Grumby to get some more , since your grandmaw has gone out of business , as far as he is concerned . And thank Godfrey for that . It wo n't be a house or a cabin they will ever pass as long as Ab Snopes is with them , that he wo n't leave an indelible signature , even if it ai n't nothing to capturebut a chicken or a kitchen clock . By Godfrey , the one thing we do n't want is to catch Ab Snopes " And we did n't catch him that night . We went back to the road and went on , and then we came in sight of the house . I rode up to Uncle Buck . " Give me the pistol , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Buck said . " He ai n't even here , I tell you . You and that nigger stay back and let me do this . I 'm going to find out which a way to start hunting . Get back , now . " " No , " I said , " I want  --  " He looked at me from under the crokersack . " You want what ? You want to lay your two hands on the man that shot Rosa Millard , do n't you ? " He looked at me . I sat there on the mule in the slow gray cold rain , in the dying daylight . Maybe it was the cold . I did n't feel cold , but I could feel my bones jerking and shaking . " And then what you going to do with him ? " Uncle Buck said . He was almost whispering now . " Hey ? Hey ? " " Yes , " I said . " Yes . " " Yes . That 's what . Now you and Ringo stay luck . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I reckon there were a thousandof them just like it about our hills , with the same canted plow lying under a tree and the same bedraggledchickens roosting on the plow and the same gray twilight dissolving onto the gray shingles of the roof . Then we saw a faint crack of fire and a woman 's face looking at us around the crack of the door . " Mr. Snopes ai n't here , if that 's what you want , " she said . " He 's done gone to Alabama on a visit . " " Sho , now , " Uncle Buck said . " To Alabama . Did he leave any word when to expect him home ? " " No , " the woman said . " Sho , now , " Uncle Buck said . " Then I reckon we better get on back home and out of the rain . " " I reckon you had , " the woman said . Then the door closed . We rode away . We rode back toward home . It was like it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't got darker exactly , the twilight had just thickened . " Well , well , well , " Uncle Buck said . " They ai n't in Alabama , because she told us so . And they ai n't toward Memphis , because there are still Yankees there yet . So I reckon we better try down toward Grenada first . By Godfrey , I 'll bet this mule against that nigger'spocket knife that we wo n't ride two days before we come on a mad woman hollering down the road with a handful of chicken feathers in her hand . You come on here and listen to me . By Godfrey , we 're going to do this thing but by Godfrey we 're going to do it right . " So we did n't get Ab Snopes that day . We did n't get him for a lot of days , and nights too  --  days in which we rode , the three of us , on relays of Granny 's and Ringo 's Yankee mules along the known roads and the unknown ( and sometimes unmarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron frost , and nights when we slept in the same wet and the same freeze and ( once ) in the snow , beneath whatever shelter we found when night found us . They had neither name nor number . They lasted from that DecemberP187afternoon until late February , until one night we realised that we had been hearing geese and ducks going north for some time . At first Ringo kept a pine stick and each night he would cut a notch in it , with a big one for Sunday and two long ones which meant Christmas and New Year 's . But one night when the stick had almost forty notches in it , we stopped in the rain to make camp without any roof to get under and we had to use the stick to start a fire , because of Uncle Buck 's arm . And so , when we came to where we could get another pine stick , we could n't rememberwhether it had been five or six or ten days , and so Ringo did n't start another . Because he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grumby and that it would n't need but two notches on it  --  one for the day we got him and one for the day Granny died . We had two mules apiece , to swap onto at noon each day . We got the mules back from the hill people ; we could have got a cavalry regiment if we had wanted it  --  of old men and women and children , too  --  with cotton bagging and flour sacking for uniforms and hoes and axes for arms , on the Yankee mules that Granny had loaned to them . But Uncle Buck told them that we did n't need any help ; that three was enough to catch Grumby . They were not hard to follow . One day we had about twenty notches on the stick and we came ontoP188a house where the ashes were still smoking and a boy almost as big as Ringo and me still unconscious in the stable with even his shirt cut to pieces like they had had a wire snapper on the whip , and a woman with a little thread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding light and far away like a locust from across the pasture , telling us how many there were and which way they would likely go saying , " Kill them . Kill them . " It was a long way , but it was n't far . You could have put a silver dollar down on the geography page with the center of it at Jefferson and we would have never ridden out from under it . And we were closer behind them than we knew , because one night we had ridden late without coming to a house or a shed to camp in , and so we stopped and Ringo said he would scout around a little , because all we had left to eat was the bone of a ham ; only it was more likely Ringo was trying to dodge helping to get in the firewood . So Uncle Buck and I were spreading down pine branches to sleep on when we heard a shot and then a sound like a brick chimney falling onto a rotten shingle roof , and then the horses , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ringo yelling . He had come onto a house ; he thought it was deserted , and then he said it looked too dark , too quiet . So he climbed onto a shed against the back wall , and he saidP18.9he saw the crack of light and he was trying to pull the shutter open careful , but it came loose with a sound like a shot , and he was looking into a room with a candle stuck into a bottle and either three or thirteen men looking right at him ; and how somebody hollered , " There they are ! " and another man jerked out a pistol and one of the others grabbed his arm as it went off , and then the whole shed gave way under him , and he said how he lay there hollering and trying to get untangled from the broken planks and heard them ride away . " So he did n't shoot at you , " Uncle Buck said . " Hit war n't none of his fault if he never , " Ringo said . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't let us go on that night . " We wo n't lose any distance , " he said . " They are flesh and blood , the same as we are . And we ai n't scared . " So we went on at daylight , following the hoofprintsnow . Then we had three more notches in the stick ; that night Ringo put the last notch in it that he was going to , but we did n't know it . We were sitting in front of a cotton pen where we were going to sleep , eating a shote that Ringo had found , when we heard the horse . Then the man begun to holler , " IIello ! Hello ! " and then we watched him ride up on a good short-coupled sorrel mare , with his neatP190little fine made boots , and his linen shirt without any collar , and a coat that had been good , too , once , and a broad hat pulled down so that all we could see was his eyes and nose between the hat and his black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Howdy , " Uncle Buck said . He was eating a sparerib ; he sat now with the rib in his left hand and his right hand lying on his lap just inside his coat ; he wore the pistol on a loop of lace leather around his neck and stuck into his pants like a lady 's watch . But the stranger was n't looking at him ; he just looked at each of us once and then sat there on the mare , with both his hands on the pommel in front of him . " Mind if I light and warm ? " he said . " Light , " Uncle Buck said . He got off . But he did n't hitch the mare . He led her up and he sat down opposite us with the reins in his hand . " Give the stranger some meat , Ringo , " Uncle Buck said . But he did n't take it . He did n't move . He just said that he had eaten , sitting there on the log with his little feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two hands on his knees as small as a woman 's hands and covered with a light mat of fine black hair right down to the finger nails , and not looking at any of us now . I do n't know what he was looking at now .   " I have just ridden out from Memphis , " he said . " I tow far do you call it to Alabama ? " Uncle Buck told him , not moving either , with the sparerib still raised in his left hand and the other hand lying just inside his coat . " You going to Alabama , hey ? " " Yes , " the stranger said . " I 'm looking for a man . " And now I saw that he was looking at me from under his hat . " A man named Grumby . You people in these parts may have heard of him too . " " Yes , " Uncle Buck said , " we have heard of him . " " Ah , " the stranger said . He smiled ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ink-colored beard . " Then what I am doing does not have to be secret . " He looked at Uncle Buck now . " I live up in Tennessee . Grumby and his gang killed one of my niggers and ran my horses off . I 'm going to get the horses back . If I have to take Grumby in the bargain , that will suit me too . " " Sho , now , " Uncle Buck said . " So you look to find him in Alabama ? " " Yes . I happen to know that he is now headed there . I almost caught him yesterday ; I did get one of his men , though the others escaped me . They passed you all sometime last night , if you were in this neighborhoodthen . You would have heard them , because when 1 last saw them , they were not wasting any time . IP192managed to persuade the man I caught to tell me where they are to rondyvoo . " " Alabama ? " Ringo said . " You mean they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger said . He looked at Ringo now . " Did Grumby steal your hog , too , boy ? " " Hawg , " Ringo said . " Hawg ? " " Put some wood on the fire , " Uncle Buck told Ringo . " Save your breath to snore with tonight . " Ringo hushed , but he did n't move ; he sat there staring back at the stranger , with his eyes looking a little red in the firelight . " So you folks are out to catch a man , too , arc you ? " the stranger said . " Two is correct , " Ringo said . " I reckon Ab Snopes can pass for a man . " So then it was too late ; we just sat there , with the stranger facing us across the fire with the mare 's reins in his little still hand , looking at the three of us from between his hat and his beard . " Ab Snopes , " he said . " I do n't believe I am acquainted with Ab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grumby too . " He was looking at all of us now . " You want to catch Grumby . Do n't you think that 's dangerous ? " " Not exactly , " Uncle Buck said . " You see , we done got a little Alabama Grumby evidence ourselves . That something or somebody has give Grumby a ( lunge of heart about killing women and children . " He and the stranger looked at each other . " Maybe it 's the wrong season for women and children . Or maybe k 's public opinion , now that Grumby is what you might call a public character . Folks hereabouts is got used to having their menfolks killed and even shot from behind . But even the Yankees never got them Used to the other . And evidently somebody has done reminded Grumby of this . Ai n't that correct ? " They looked at each other ; they did n't move . " But you are neither a woman nor a child , old man , " the stranger said . He stood up , easy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the reins over the mare 's head . " I reckon I 'll get along , " he said . We watched him get into the saddle and sir there again , i with his little black-haired hands lying on the pommel , looking down at us  --  at me and Ringo now . " So ou want Ab Snopes , " he said . " Take a stranger 's advice and stick to him . " I Ic turned the mare . I was watching him , then I was thinking " I wonder if he knows that her off back shoe is gone , " when Ringo hollered , " Look out ! " and then it seemed to me that I saw the spurred mare jump before I saw the pistol flash ; and then the mare was galloping and Uncle Buck was lying on the ground cussing and yelling and dragging at his pistol , end then all three of us were dragging and fighting over it , but the front sight was caught in his suspenders , and the three of us fighting over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the gallopingmare dying away . The bullet went through the flesh of the inner side of the arm that had the rheumatism ; that was why Uncle Buck cussed so bad ; he said the rheumatism was bad enough , and the bullet was bad enough , but to have them both at once was too much for any man . And then , when Ringo told him he ought to be thankful , that suppose the bullet had hit his good arm and then he would n't even be able to feed himself , he reached back and , still lying down , he caught up a stick of firewood and tried to hit Ringo with it . We cut his sleeve away and stopped the blood , and he made me cut a strip off his shirt tail , and Ringo handed him his stick and he sat there cussing us while we soaked the strip in hot salt water , and he held the arm himself with his good hand , cussing a steady streak , and made us run the strip back and forth through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure enough , looking a little like Granny looked , like all old people look when they have been hurt , with his beard jerking and his eyes snapping and his heels and the stick jabbing into the ground like the stick had been with him so long that it felt the rag and the salt too . P195And at first I thought that the black man wasnmiby , like I had thought that maybe Ab Snopes  --  . But Uncle Buck said not . It was the next morn- ; we had n't slept much because Uncle Buckould n't go to sleep ; only we did n't know then thatwas his arm , because he would n't even let us talk shout taking him back home . And now we tried again , after we had finished breakfast , but he would n't listen , already on his mule with his left arm tied acrossis chest and the pistol stuck between the arm and his chest , where he could get to it quick , saying , " Wait . Wait , " and his eyes hard and snapping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got yet , " he said . " Something he was telling us last night without aiming to have us know yet that he had told us . Somethingthat we are going to find out today . " " Likely a bullet that 's fixing to hit you halfway betwixtboth arms stid of halfway betwixt one , " Ringo said . Uncle Buck rode fast ; we could watch his stick rising and falling against the mule 's flank , not hard , just steady and fast , like a crippled man in a hurry that has used the stick so long he do n't even know k any more . Because we did n't know that his arm was making him sick yet ; he had n't given us time to realise it . So we hurried on , riding along beside a slough , and then Ringo saw the snake . It had beenP196warm for a week , until last night . But last night it made ice , and now we saw the moccasin where it had crawled out and was trying to get back into the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its body on the land and its head fixed in the skim ice like it was set into a mirror , and Uncle Buck turned sidewayson his mule , hollering at us : " There it is , by Godfrey ! There 's the sign ! Did n't I tell you we would  --  " We all heard it at once  --  the three or maybe four shots and then the sound of horses galloping , except that some of the galloping came from Uncle Buck 's mule , and he had his pistol out now before he turned from the road and into the trees , with the stick jammed under his hurt arm and his beard flying back over his shoulder . But we did n't find anything . We saw the marks in the mud where the five horses had stood while the men that rode them had watched the road , and we saw the sliding tracks where the horses had begun to gallop , and I thinking quietly , " He still do n't know that that shoe is gone . " But that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol raised in his hand and his beard blown back over his shoulderand the leather thong of the pistol hanging down his back like a girl 's pigtail , and his mouth open and his eyes blinking at me and Ringo.  | " What in the tarnation hell ! " he said . " Well , let 's go k to the road . Whatever it was has done gone at way too . " S we had turned . Uncle Buck had put the pistol up slid his stick had begun to beat the mule again when We saw what it was , what it meant . It was Ab Snopes . He was lying on his side , tiedd and foot , and hitched to a sapling ; we could seemarks in the mud where he had tried to rollck into the underbrush until the rope stopped him . I k had been watching us all the time , lying there with his face in the shape of snarling and not making a sound after he found out he could not roll out of sight . He was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't thought to look any higher yet , end so he did not know that we could see him ; he must have thought that we had just spied him , because all of a sudden he began to jerk and thrash on the ground , hollering , " Help ! Help ! Help ! " We untied him and got him onto his feet , and he was still hollering , loud , with his face and his arms iv-king , about how they had caught and robbed him , and they would have killed him if they had n't heard us coming and run away ; only his eyes were not holIcring . They were watching us , going fast and quick from Ringo to me to Uncle Buck , and then at Ringo and me again , and they were not hollering , like his eyes belonged to one man and his gaped and yelling mouth belonged to another . " So they caught you , hey ? " Uncle Buck said . " A innocent and unsuspecting traveler . I reckon the name of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like we might have stopped and built a fire and thawed out that moccasin  --  just enough for it to find out where it was , but not enough for it to know what to do about it . Only I reckon it was a high complimentto set Ab Snopes up with a moccasin , even a little one . I reckon it was bad for him . I reckon he realised that they had thrown him back to us without mercy , and that if he tried to save himself from us at their expense , they would come back and kill him . I reckon he decided that the worst thing that could happen to him would be for us not to do anything to him at all . Because he quit jerking his arms ; he even quit lying ; for a minute his eyes and his mouth were telling the same thing . " I made a mistake , " he said . " I admit hit . I reckon everybody does . The question is , what are you fellows going to do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everybody makes mistakes . Your trouble is , you make too many . Because mistakes are bad . Look at Rosa Millard . She just made one , and look at her . And you have made two . " P199Al ) Snopes watched Uncle Buck . " What 's them ? " " Being born too soon and dying too late , " Uncle Buck said. lie looked at all of us , fast ; he did n't move , still talking to Uncle Buck . " You ai n't going to kill me . You do n't dast . " " I do n't even need to , " Uncle Buck said . " It was n't Inv grandmaw you sicked onto that snake den . " Helooked at me now , but his eyes were going again , k and forth across me at Ringo and Uncle Buck ; itas the two of them again now , the eyes and the voice . " Why , then I 'm all right . Bayard ai n't got no hard feelings against me . He knows hit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sake and his paw and them niggers at home . Why , here hit 's a whole year and it was me that holp and tended Miss Rosa when she never had ara living soul but them chil  --  " Now the voice began to tell the truth again ; it was the eyes end the voice that I was walking toward . He fell back , crouching , his hands flung up . Behind me , Uncle Buck said , " You , Ringo ! Stay back . " He was walking backward now , with his handsng up , hollering , " Three on one ! Three on one ! " " Stand still , " Uncle Buck said . " Ai n't no three onyou . I do n't see nobody on you but one of themchildren you was just mentioning . " Then we were bothP200down in the mud ; and then I could n't see him , and I could n't seem to find him any more , not even with the hollering ; and then I was fighting three or four for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I could see him again , lying on the ground with his arms over his face . " Get up , " Uncle Buck said . " No , " he said . " Three of you can jump on me and knock me down again , but you got to pick me up first to do hit . I ai n't got no rights and justice here , but you ca n't keep me from protesting hit . " " Lift him up , " Uncle Buck said . " I 'll hold Bayard . " Ringo lifted him ; it was like lifting up a half-filled cotton sack . " Stand up , Mr. Ab Snopes , " Ringo said . But he would not stand , not even after Ringo and Uncle Buck tied him to the sapling and Ringo had taken off his and Uncle Buck 's and Ab Snopes ' gallusesand knotted them together with the bridle reins from the mules . He just hung there in the rope , not even flinching when the lash fell , saying , " That 's hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me three to one . " " Wait , " Uncle Buck said . Ringo stopped . " You want another chance with one to one ? You can take your choice of the three of us . " " I got my rights , " he said . " I 'm helpless , but I can still protest hit . Whup me . " I reckon he was right . I reckon if we had let himP201go clean they would have circled back and killed him themselves before dark . Because  --  that was the night it began to rain and we had to burn Ringo 's stickcause Uncle Buck admitted now that his arm wastting bad  --  we all ate supper together , and it was Ab Snopes that was the most anxious about Uncle Buck , saying how it was n't any hard feelings and that he could see himself that he had made a mistake in trusting the folks he did , and that all he wanted to do now was to go back home , because it was only the folks you had known all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in a stranger you deserrved what you got when you found that what you had been eating and sleeping with was no better thanpassel of rattlesnakes . But as soon as Uncle Buck tried to find out if it actually was Grumby , he shut up and denied that he had ever seen him . They left us early the next morning . Uncle Buck was sick by then ; we offered to ride back home with him , or to let Ringo ride back with him , and I would keep Ab Snopes with me , but Uncle Buck would n't have it . " Grumby might capture him again and tie him to another sapling in the road , and you would lose time burying him , " Uncle Buck said . " You boys go on . It ai n't going to be long now . And catch them ! " He begun to holler , with his face flushed and his eyes bright , taking the pistol from around his neck and giving it to me , " Catch them ! Catch them ! " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ; now it began to rain all the time . We had the two mules apiece ; we went fast . It rained ; sometimes we had no fire at all ; that was when we lost count of time , because one morning we came to a fire still burningand a hog they had not even had time to butcher ; and sometimes we would ride all night , swapping mules when we had guessed that it had been two hours ; and so , sometimes it would be night when we slept and sometimes it would be daylight , and we knew that they must have watched us from somewhereevery day and that now that Uncle Buck was not with us , they did n't even dare to stop and try to hide . Then one afternoon  --  the rain had stopped but the clouds had not broken and it was turning cold again  --  it was about dusk and we were galloping along an old road in the river bottom ; it was dim and narrow under the trees and we were galloping when my mule shied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself before I went over his head ; and then we sawP203the thing hanging over the middle of the road from a limb . It was an old Negro man , with a rim of white air and with his bare toes pointing down and his cad on one side like he was thinking about something quiet . The note was pinned to him , but we couldn'tad it until we rode on into a clearing . It was a /crap of dirty paper with big crude printed letters , ke a child might have made them : st mooning not thret . Turn back . The barer of this my promise and garntee . I have stood all I aim to Stand children no children . G.And something else written beneath it in a hand neat and small and prettier than Granny 's , only you knew that a man had written it ; and while I looked at the dirty paper I could see him again , with his neat littleea and his little black-haired hands and his fine soiled hirt and his fine muddy coat , across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others beside G. , one of wh ' ' in particular hae , less scruples re children than he has . Nethless unders " d desires to give both you and G. one more chance . Take it , and some day become a wan . Refuse it , and cease even to be a child . Ringo and I looked at each other . There had beena house here once , but it was gone now . Beyond the iP204clearing the road went on again into the thick trees in the gray twilight . " Maybe it will be tomorrow , " Ringo said . It was tomorrow ; we slept that night in a haystack , but we were riding again by daylight , following the dim road along the river bottom . This time it was Ringo 's mule that shied ; the man had stepped out of the bushes that quick , with his fine muddy boots and coat and the pistol in his little black-haired hand , and only his eyes and his nose showing between his hat and his beard . " Stay where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be watchingyou . " We did n't move . We watched him step back in to the bushes , then the three of them came out  --  the bearded man and another man walking abreast and leading two saddled horses , and the third man walkingjust in front of them with his hands behind pim-a thick-built man with a reddish stubble and pale eyes , in a faded Confederate uniform coat and Yankee boots , bare-headed , with a long smear of dried blood on his cheek and one side of his coat caked with dried mud and that sleeve ripped away at the shoulder , but we did n't realise at once that what made his shoulders look so thick was that his arms were tied tight behind him . And then all of a sudden we knew that at last we were looking at Grumby . We knew it longP205before the bearded man said , " You want Grumby . I ! ere he is . " We just sat there . Because from then on , the other two men did not even look at us again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Get on your horse . " The other man got on one of the horses . We could ace the pistol in his hand then , pointed at Grumby 's back . " Hand me your knife , " the bearded man said . Without moving the pistol , the other man passed his knife to the bearded man . Then Grumby spoke ; he had not moved until now ; he just stood there with his shoulders hunched and his little pale eyes blinkingat me and Ringo . " Boys , " he said , " boys  --  " " Shut your mouth , " the bearded man said , in a cold , quiet , almost pleasant voice . " You 've already talked too much . If you had done what I wanted done that night in December , you would n't be where you are now . " We saw his hand with the knife ; I reckon maybe for a minute Ringo and I and Grumby , too , all thought the same thing . But he just cut Grumby 's hands loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned right into the pistol in the bearded man 's hand . " Steady , " the bearded man said . " Have you got him , Bridger ? " " Yes , " the other man said . The bearded man backed to the other horse and got on it without lowering his pistol or ceasing to watch Grumby . Then he sat there , too , looking down at Grumby , with his little hooked nose and his eyes alone showing between the hat and the ink-colored beard . Grumby began to move his head from side to side . " Boys , " he said , " boys , you ai n't going to do this to me . " " We 're not going to do anything to you , " the bearded man said . " I ca n't speak for these boys there . But since you are so delicate about children , maybe they will be delicate with you . But we 'll give you a chance though . " His other hand went inside his coat too fast to watch ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned once and fell at Grumby 's feet ; again Grumby moved , but the pistolsstopped him . The bearded man sat easy on the horse , looking down at Grumby , talking in that cold , still , vicious voice that was n't even mad : We had a good thing in this country . We wouldhave it yet , if it had n't been for you . And now we'vegot to pull out . Got to leave it because you lost yournerve and killed an old woman and then lost yournerve again and refused to cover the first mistake . Scruples , " he said . " Scruples . So afraid of raising the country that there ai n't a man , woman or child , black or white , in it that ai n't on the watch for us . And allP207because you got scared and killed an old woman you never saw before . Not to get anything ; not for one single Confed bank note . But because you got scared ' if a piece of paper on which someone had signed Bedford Forrest 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket now . " 1 Ic did n't look at the other man , Bridger ; he just said , " All right . Ease off . But watch him . He 's too tender-hearted to turn your back on . " They backed the horses away , side by side , the two pistols trained on Grumby 's belly , until they reached the underbrush . " We 're going to Texas . If you should leave this place , I would advise you to go at least that far also . But just remember that Texas is a wide place , and use that knowledge . Ride ! " he shouted. lie whirled the mare . Bridger whirled too . As they did so , Grumby leaped and caught the pistol from the ground and ran forward , crouching and shouting into the bushes , cursing . He shot three times toward the fading sound of the horses , then he whirled back to face us . Ringo and I were on the ground , too ; I do n't remember when we got down nor why , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once at Ringo 's face and then how I stood there with Uncle Buck 's pistol feeling heavy as a firedog in my hand . Then I saw that he had quit whirling ; that he was standing there with the pistol hanging against his right leg and that he was looking at me ; and then all of a sudden he was smiling . " Well , boys , " he said , " it looks like you have got me . Durn my hide for letting Matt Bowden fool me into emptying my pistol at him . " And I could hear my voice ; it sounded faint and far away , like the woman 's in Alabama that day , so that I wondered if he could hear me : " You shot three times . You have got two more shots in it . " His face did n't change , or I could n't see it change . It just lowered , looking down , but the smile was gone from it . " In this pistol ? " he said . It was like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and careful it was that he passed it from his right to his left hand and let it hang again , pointing down again . " Well , well , well . Sholy I ai n't forgot how to count as well as how to shoot . " There was a bird somewhere  --  a yellowhammer  --  I had been hearing it all the time ; even the three shots had n't frightened it . And I could hear Ringo , too , making a kind of whimpering sound when he breathed , and it was like I was n't trying to watch Grumby so much as to keep from looking at Ringo . " Well , she 's safe enough now , since it do n't look like I can even shoot with my right hand . " Then it happened . I know what did happen , but even now I do n't know how , in what order . Because he was big and squat , like a bear . But when we hadP209first seen him he was a captive , and so , even now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though we had watched him leap and catch up the pistol and run firing after the other two . All I know , one second he was standing there in his muddy onfederate coat , smiling at us , with his ragged teeth showing a little in his red stubble , with the thin sun-'gilt on the stubble and on his shoulders and cuffs , n the dark marks where the braid had been ripped way ; and the next second there were two bright range splashes , one after the other , against the middle of the gray coat and the coat itself swelling slow down on me like when Granny told us about the balloonshe saw in St. Louis and we would dream about it . I reckon I heard the sound , and I reckon I must have heard the bullets , and I reckon I felt him when he hit me , but I do n't remember it . I just remember the two bright flashes and the gray coat rushing down , and then the ground hitting me . But I could smell hint  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grindinginto my face and smelling of horse sweat and wood smoke and grease  --  and I could hear him , and then I could hear my arm socket , and I thought " In a minuteI will hear my fingers breaking , but I have got to hold onto it " and then  --  I do n't know whether it was under or over his arm or his leg  --  I saw Ringo , in the air , looking exactly like a frog , even to the eyes , with his mouth open too and his open pocket knife in his hand . Then I was free . I saw Ringo straddle of Grumby'sback and Grumby getting up from his hands and knees and I tried to raise the pistol only my arm would n't move . Then Grumby bucked Ringo off just like a steer would and whirled again , looking at us , crouched , with his mouth open too ; and then my an n began to come up with the pistol and he turned and ran . He should n't have tried to run from us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because now my arm had come up and now I could sec Grumby 's back ( he did n't scream , he never made a sound ) and the pistol both at the same time and the pistol was level and steady as a rock . It took us the rest of that day and part of the night to reach the old compress . But it did n't take very long to ride home because we went fast with the two mounts apiece to change to , and what we had to carry now , wrapped in a piece of the skirt of Grumby'scoat , did n't weigh anything . It was almost dark when we rode through Jeffer- ; it was raining again when we rode past the brickand the sooty walls that had n't fallen down yet ,  --  went on through what used to be the square . Wehed the mules in the cedars and Ringo was justing off to find a board when we saw that some  --  y had already put one up  --  Mrs. Compson , I kon , or maybe Uncle Buck when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wire. he earth had sunk too now , after two months ; Was almost level now , like at first Granny had not nted to be dead either but now she had begun toreconciled . We unwrapped it from the jagged square of stained faded gray cloth and fastened it the board . " Now she can lay good and quiet , " go said . " Yes , " I said . And then we both began to cry . We stood there in the slow rain , crying . We had ridden lot , and during the last week we had n't slept much d we had n't always had anything to eat . " It was n't him or Ab Snopes either that kilt her , " Ringo said . " It was them mules . That first batch of ales we got for nothing . " " Yes , " I said . " Let 's go home . I reckon Louvinia worried about us . " So it was good and dark when we came to the cabin . ml then we saw that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the big fire and the lamp , clean and bright , when Louvinia opened the door long before we had got to it and ran out into the rain and began to paw at me , crying and hollering . " What ? " I said . " Father ? Father 's home ? Father ? " " And Miss Drusilla ! " Louvinia hollered , crying and praying and pawing at me , and hollering and scolding at Ringo all at once . " Home ! Hit done finished ! All but the surrendering . And now Marse John done home . " She finally told us how Father and Drusilla had come home about a week ago and Uncle Buck told Father where Ringo and I were , and how Father had tried to make Drusilla wait at home , but she refused , and how they were looking for us , with Uncle Buck to show the way . So we went to bed . We could n't even stay awake to eat the supper Louvinia cooked for us ; Ringo and I went to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep all in one motion , with Louvinia 's face hanging over us and still scolding , and Joby in the chimney corner where Louvinia had made him get up out of Granny 's chair . And then somebody was pulling at me , and I thought I was fighting Ab Snopes again , and then it was the rain in Father 's beard and clothes that I smelled . But Uncle Buck was still hollering , and Father holding me , and Ringo and I held to him , and then it was Drusilla kneeling and holding me and Ringo , and we could smell the rain in her hair , too , P213hue she was hollering at Uncle Buck to hush . Father 's nd was hard ; I could see his face beyond Drusilla and I was trying to say , " Father , Father , " while she as holding me and Ringo with the rain smell of her it all around us , and Uncle Buck hollering and Joby ) king at Uncle Buck with his mouth open and his es round . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him but brought back the actual proof of to where Rosa Millard could rest quiet . " " The which ? " Joby hollered . " Fotch back the hich ? " " Hush ! Hush ! " Drusilla said . " That 's all done , all nished . You , Uncle Buck ! " " The proof and the expiation ! " Uncle Buck holred . " When me and John Sartoris and Drusilla rode p t o that old compress , the first thing we see was that urdering scoundrel pegged out on the door to it like coon hide , all except the right hand . And if anybody wants to see that , too , ' I told John Sartoris , just r them ride into Jefferson and look on Rosa Millard 's grave ! ' Ai n't I told you he is John Sartoris ' boy ? Hey ? n't I told you ? "  |p215When  I think of that day , of Father 's old troop on their horses drawn up facing the house , and Father ml Drusilla on the ground with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite them the women  --  Aunt Louisa , Mrs. Habersham and all the others  --  on the porch and the two sets of them , the men and the women , facing one another like they were both waiting for a bugle to sound the charge , I think I I , now the reason . I think it was because Father 's troop like all the other Southern soldiers too ) , even though   they had surrendered and said that they were whipped , were still soldiers . Maybe from the old habit of doing everything as one man ; maybe when you have lived for four years in a world ordered completely by men 's doings , even when it is danger and fighting , you do n't want to quit that world : maybe the danger and the fighting are the reasons , because men have been pacifists for every reason under the sun except to avoid danger and fighting . And so now Father 's troop and all the other men in Jefferson , and Aunt Louisa and Mrs. Habersham and all the women in Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in and admitted that they belonged to the United States but the women had never surrendered . I remember the night we got the letter and found out at last where Drusilla was . It was just before Christmas in 1864 , after the Yankees had burned Jeffersonand gone away , and we did n't even know for sure if the war was still going on or not . All we knew was that for three years the country had been full of Yankees , and then all of a sudden they were gone and there were no men there at all anymore . We had n't even heard from Father since July , from Carolina , so that now we lived in a world of burned towns and houses and ruined plantations and fields inhabited only by women . Ringo and I were fifteen then ; we felt almost exactly like we had to eat and sleep andP2/7change our clothes in a hotel built only for ladies and children . The envelope was worn and dirty and it had been opened once and then glued back , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it even though we did not recognise Aunt Louisa 's hand It first . It was addressed to Granny ; it was six pages cut with scissors from wallpaper and written on both sides with pokeberry juice and I thought of that night eighteen months ago when Drusilla and I stood outside the cabin at Hawkhurst and listened to the niggerspassing in the road , the night when she told me about the dog , about keeping the dog quiet , and then asked me to ask Father to let her join his troop and ride with him . But I did n't tell Father . Maybe I forgotit . Then the Yankees went away , and Father and his troop went away too . Then , six months later , we had a letter from him about how they were fighting in Carolina , and a month after that we had one from Aunt Louisa that Drusilla was gone too , a short letter on the wallpaper that you could see where Aunt Louisa had cried in the pokeberry juice about how she did not know where Drusilla was but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately tried to unsex herself by refusing to feel any natural grief at the death in battle not only of her affianced husband but of her own father and that she took it for granted that Drusilla was with us and though she did not expect Drusilla to take any steps herself to relieve a mother 's anxiety , she hoped that Granny would . But we did n't know where Drusilla was either . She had just vanished . It was like the Yankees in just passing through the South had not only taken along with them all living men blue and gray and white and black , but even one young girl who had happened to try to look and act like a man after her sweetheart was ' killed . So then the next letter came . Only Granny was n't there to read it because she was dead then ( it was the time when Grumby doubled back past Jefferson and so Ringo and I spent one night at home and found the letter when Mrs. Compson had sent it out ) and so for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to tell us . This one was on the same wallpaper too , six pages this time , only Aunt Louisa had n't cried in the pokeberry juice this time : Ringo said because she must have been writing too fast : Dear Sister : 1 think this will be news to you as it was to me though 1 both hope and pray it will not be the heartrendingshock to you it was to me as naturally it cannotsince you are only an aunt while I am the mother . But it is not myself I am thinking of since I am aP219woman , a mother , a Southern woman , and it has been our lot during the last four years to learn to bear anything . But when I think of my husband who laid down is life to protect a heritage of courageous men andotless women looking down from heaven upon a daughter- who had deliberately cast away that for which he died , and when I think of my half-orphan son who will one day ask of me why his martyred father 's sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  That 's how it sounded . Ringo was holding a pineknot for me to read by , but after a while he had to light another pineknot and all the farther we had got was how when Gavin Breckbridge was killed at Shiloh before he and Drusilla had had time to marry , there had been reserved for Drusilla the highest destiny of a Southern woman  --  to be the bride-widow of a lost cause  --  and how Drusilla had not only thrown that away , she had not only become a lost woman and a shame to her father 's memory but she was now living in a word that Aunt Louisa would not even repeat but that Granny knew what it was , though at least thank God that Father and Drusilla were not actually any blood kin , it being Father 's wife who was Drusilla 's cousin by blood and not Father himself . So then Ringo lit the other pineknot and then we put the sheets of wallpaper down on the floor and then we found out what it was : how Drusilla had been gone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , and then one night she walked into the cabin where Aunt Louisa and Denny were ( and now it had a line drawn under it , like this : ) in the garments not alone of a man but ofa common private soldier and told them how she had been a member of Father 's troop for six months , bivouackingat night surrounded by sleeping men and not even bothering to put up the tent for her and Father except when the weather was bad , and how Drusilla not only showed neither shame nor remorse but actuallypretended she did not even know what Aunt Louisa was talking about ; how when Aunt Louisa told her that she and Father must marry at once , Drusilla said , " Ca n't you understand that I am tired of buryinghusbands in this war ? That I am riding in Cousin John 's troop not to find a man but to hurt Yankees ? " and how Aunt Louisa said : " At least do n't call him Cousin John where strangers can hear you . " The third letter did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Compson . Drusilla and Father were home then . P221It was in the spring and the war was over now , and we were busy getting the cypress and oak out of the bottomto build the house and Drusilla working with Joby and Ringo and Father and me like another man , with her hair shorter than it had been at Hawkhurst and her face sunburned from riding in the weather and her body thin from living like soldiers lived . After Granny died Ringo and Louvinia and I all slept in the cabin , but after Father came Ringo and Louvinia moved back to the other cabin with Joby and now Father and I slept on Ringo 's and my pallet and Drusillaslept in the bed behind the quilt curtain where Granny used to sleep . And so one night I remembered Aunt Louisa 's letter and I showed it to Drusilla and Father , and Father found out that Drusilla had not written to tell Aunt Louisa where she was and Father said she must , and so one day Mrs. Compson came out with the third letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom at the sawmill and I saw that one too , on the wallpaper with the pokeberryjuice and the juice not cried on this time either , and this the first time Mrs. Compson had come out since Granny died and not even getting out of her surrey but sitting there holding to her parasol with one hand and her shawl with the other and looking around like when Drusilla would come out of the house or from around the corner it would not be just a thinP222sunburned girl in a man 's shirt and pants but maybe something like a tame panther or bear . This one sounded just like the others : about how Aunt Louisa was addressing a stranger to herself but not a stranger to Granny and that there were times when the good name of one family was the good name of all and that she naturally did not expect Mrs. Compson to move out and live with Father and Drusilla because even that would be too late now to preserve the appearance of that which had never existed anyway . But that Mrs. Compson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman too , and had suffered too , Aunt Louisa did n't doubt , only she did hope and pray that Mrs. Compson had been spared the sight of her own daughter if Mrs. Compson had one flouting and outragingall Southern principles of purity and womanhoodthat our husbands had died for , though Aunt Louisa hoped again that Mrs. Compson 's husband ( Mrs. Compson was a good deal older than Granny and the only husband she had ever had had been locked up for crazy a long time ago because in the slack part of the afternoons he would gather up eight or ten little niggers from the quarters and line them up across the creek from him with sweet potatoes on their heads and he would shoot the potatoes off with a rifle ; he would tell them he might miss a potato but he was n't going to miss a nigger , and so they would stand mightyp223still ) had not made one of the number . So I could n't make any sense out of that one too and I still did n't know what Aunt Louisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compson knew either . Because it was not her : it was Mrs. Habersham , that never had been out here before and that Granny never kid been to see that I knew of . Because Mrs. Compson did n't stay , she did n't even get out of the surrey , sitting there kind of drawn up under the shawl and looking at me and then at the cabin like she did n't know just what might come out of it or out from behind it . Then she begun to tap the nigger driver on his head with the parasol and they went away , the two old horses going pretty fast back down the drive and back down the road to town . And the next afternoon when I came out of the bottom to go to the spring with the water bucket there were five surreys and buggies in front of the cabin and inside the cabin there were fourteenof them that had come the four miles out from Jefferson , in the Sunday clothes that the Yankees and the war had left them , that had husbands dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what he was doing , because they were strange times then . Only like I said , maybe times are never strange to women : that it is just one continuous monotonous thing full of the repeated follies of their menfolks . Mrs. Compson was sitting in Granny 's chair , still hold- ing the parasol and drawn up under her shawl and looking like she had finally seen whatever it was she had expected to see , and it had been the panther . It was Mrs. Habersham who was holding back the quilt for the others to go in and look at the bed where Drusilla slept and then showing them the pallet where Father and I slept . Then she saw me and said , " And who is this ? " " That 's Bayard , " Mrs. Compson said . " You poor child , " Mrs. Habersham said . So I did n't stop . But I could n't help but hear them . It sounded like a ladies ' club meeting with Mrs. Habersham runningit , because every now and then Mrs. Habersham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be sent for at once . But lacking her presence . . . we , the ladies of the community , mothers ourselves . . . child probably taken advantage of by gallant romantic .. . before realising the price she must  --  " and Mrs. Compsonsaid , " Hush ! Hush ! " and then somebody else said , " Do you really suppose  --  " and then Mrs. Habersham forgot to whisper good : " What else ? What other reasoncan you name why she should choose to conceal herself down there in the woods all day long , lifting heavy weights like logs and  --  " Then I went away . I filled the bucket at the spring and went back to the log-yard where Drusilla and Ringo and Joby were feeding the bandsaw and theP225blindfolded mule going round and round in the sawdust . And then Joby kind of made a sound and we all stopped and looked and there was Mrs. Habersham , with three of the others kind of peeping out from behind her with their eyes round and bright , looking at Drusilla standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweated overalls and shirt and brogans , with her face sweat-streaked with sawdust and her short hair yellow with it . " I am Martha Habersham , " Mrs. Habersham said . " I am a neighbor and I hope to be a friend . " And then she said , " You poor child . " We just looked at her ; when Drusilla finally spoke , the sounded like Ringo and I would when Father would say something to us in Latin for a joke . " Ma'am ? " Drusilla said . Because I was just fifteen ; I still did n't know what it was all about ; I just stood there and listened without even thinking much , like when they had been talking in the cabin . " My condition ? " Drusilla said . " My  --  " " Yes , " Mrs. Habersham said . " No mother , no woman to . . . forced to these straits  --  " kind of waving her hand at the mules that had n't stopped and at Joby and Ringo goggling at her and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer you not only our help , but our sympathy . " " My condition , " Drusilla said . " My con . . . Help and sym  --  " Then she began to say , " Oh . Oh . Oh . " 226 THE UNVANQUISHEDstanding there , and then she was running . She began to run like a deer , that starts to run and then decides where it wants to go ; she turned right in the air and came toward me , running light over the logs and planks , with her mouth open , saying " John , John " not loud ; for a minute it was like she thought I was Father until she waked up and found I was not ; she stopped without even ceasing to run , like a bird stops in the air , motionless yet still furious with movement . " Is that what you think too ? " she said . Then she was gone . Every now and then I could see her footprints , spaced and fast , just inside the woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't see her . But the surreys and buggies were still in front of the cabin and I could see Mrs. Compson and the other ladies on the porch , looking out across the pasture toward the bottom , so I did not go there . But before I came to the other cabin , where Louvinia and Joby and Ringo lived , I saw Louvinia come up the hill from the spring , carryingher cedar water bucket and singing . Then she went into the cabin and the singing stopped short off and so I knew where Drusilla was . But I did n't hide . I went to the window and looked in and saw Drusilla just turning from where she had been leaning her head in her arms on the mantel when Louvinia came in with the water bucket and a gum twig in her mouth and Father 's old hat on top of her head rag . DrusillaSKIRMISH AT SARTORIS 227was crying . " That 's what it is , then , " she said . " Corningdown there to the mill and telling me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw any of them before and I do n't care a damn what they  --  But you and Bayard . Is that what you believe ? that John and I  --  that we  --  " Then Louvinia moved . 1 lcr hand came out quicker than Drusilla could jerk back and lay flat on the belly of Drusilla 's overalls , then Louvinia was holding Drusilla in her arms like she used to hold me and Drusilla was crying hard . " That John and I  --  that we  --  And Gavin dead at Shiloh and John 's home burned and his plantation ruined , that he and I  --  We went to the war to hurt Yankees , not huntingwomen ! " " I knows you ai n't , " Louvinia said . " Hush now . I lush . " And that 's about all . It did n't take them long . I do n't know whether Mrs. Habersham made Mrs. Compson send for Aunt Louisa or whether Aunt Louisa just gave them a deadline and then came herself . Because we were busy , Drusilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Father in town ; we would n't see him from the time he would ride away in the morning until when he would get back , sometimes late , at night . Becausethey were strange times then . For four years we had lived for just one thing , even the women and children who could not fight : to get Yankee troops out228 THE UN VANQUISHEDof the country ; we thought that when that happened , it would be all over . And now that had happened , and then before the summer began I heard Father say to Drusilla , " We were promised Federal troops ; Lincoln himself promised to send us troops . Then things will be all right . " That , from a man who had commanded a regiment for four years with the avowed purpose of driving Federal troops from the country . Now it was as though we had not surrendered at all , we had joined forces with the men who had been our enemies against a new foe whose means we could not always fathom but whose aim we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day long . They were building Jefferson back , the courthouse and the stores , but it was more than that which Father and the other men were doing ; it was something which he would not let Drusilla or me or Ringo go into town to see . Then one day Ringo slipped off and went to town and came back and he looked at me with his eyes rolling a little . " Do you know what I ai n't ? " he said . " What ? " I said . " I ai n't a nigger any more . I done been abolished . " ' Then I asked him what he was , if he was n't a nigger any more and he showed me what he had in his hand . It was a new scrip dollar ; it was drawn on the United States Resident Treasurer , Yoknapatawpha County , Mississippi , and signed " Cassius Q. Benbow , ActingSKIRMISH AT SARTORIS 229Marshal " in a neat clerk 's hand , with a big sprawling X tinder it . " Cassius Q. Benbow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Uncle Cash that druv thenhow carriage twell he run off with the Yankees two years ago . He back now and he gonter be elected Marshal of Jefferson . That 's what Marse John and the other white folks is so busy about . " " A nigger ? " I said . " A nigger ? " " No , " Ringo said . " They ai n't no more niggers , in Jc ( Terson nor nowhere else . " Then he told me about the two Burdens from Missouri , with a patent from Washington to organise the niggers into Republicans , and how Father and the other men were trying to prevent it . " Naw , suh , " he said . " This war ai n't over . I lit just started good . Used to be when you seed a Yankee you knowed him because he never had nothing but a gun or a mule halter or a handful of hen feathers . Now you do n't even know him and stid of the gun he got a clutch of this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the yuther . " So we were busy ; we just saw Father at night and sometimes then Ringo and I and even Drusilla would take one look at him and we would n't ask him any questions . So it did n't take them long , because Drusilla was already beaten ; she was just marking time without knowing it from that afternoon when the fourteen ladies got230 THE UN VANQUISHEDinto the surreys and buggies and went back to town until one afternoon about two months later when we heard Denny hollering even before the wagon came in the gates , and Aunt Louisa sitting on one of the trunks ( that 's what beat Drusilla : the trunks . They had her dresses in them that she had n't worn in three years ; Ringo never had seen her in a dress until Aunt Louisa came ) in mourning even to the crepe bow on her umbrella handle , that had n't worn mourning when we were at Hawkhurst two years ago though UncleDennison was just as dead then as he was now . She came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking just like the letters sounded , like even when you listened to her you had to skip around fast to make any sense : " I have come to appeal to them once more with a mother 's tears though I do n't think it will do any good though I had prayed until the very last that this boy 's innocence might be spared and preserved but what must be must be and at least we can all three bear our burden together " ; sitting in Granny 's chair in the middle of the room , without even laying down the umbrellaor taking her bonnet off , looking at the pallet where Father and I slept and then at the quilt nailed to the rafter to make a room for Drusilla , dabbing at her mouth with a handkerchief that made the whole cabin smell like dead roses . And then Drusilla came inTSKIRMISH AT SARTORIS 231n the mill , in the muddy brogans and the sweaty t and overalls and her hair sunburned and full of dust , and Aunt Louisa looked at her once and betocry again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mercy that Dennison Hawk was taken before he d to see what I see .

And he came and ked into the cabin where Aunt Louisa was still sitinGranny 's chair with the handkerchief before mouth . " This is a pleasant surprise , Miss Louisa , " her said . " It is not pleasant to me , Colonel Sartoris , " Aunt isa said . " And after a year , I suppose I can not call uprise . But it is still a shock . " So Father came out and we went down to the spring and found Druhidingbehind the big beech , crouched down like was trying to hide the skirt from Father even while raised her up . " What 's a dress ? " he said . " It do n't ttcr . Come . Get up , soldier . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them put dress on her she was whipped ; like in the dress could neither fight back nor run away . And so she n't come down to the log-yard any more , and now t Father and I slept in the cabin with Joby and232 THE UN VANQUISHEDRingo , I did n't even see Drusilla except at mealtitn And we were busy getting the timber out , and no everybody was talking about the election and ho Father had told the two Burdens before all the men ' town that the election would never be held withBenbow or any other nigger in it and how the Bt dens had dared him to stop it . And besides , the uth cabin would be full of Jefferson ladies all day ; y. would have thought that Drusilla was Mrs. 11 ; 11 ) . sham 's daughter and not Aunt Louisa 's . They wo . begin to arrive right after breakfast and stay all day- , that at supper Aunt Louisa would sit in her hI , t mourning except for the bonnet and umbrella , with wad of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that never got finished and the f ltl handkerchief handy in her belt ( only she ate fine ; ate more than Father even because the election was j a week off and I reckon he was thinking about t Burdens ) and refusing to speak to anybody exc . Denny ; and Drusilla trying to eat , with her f strained and thin and her eyes like somebody 's that I been whipped a long time now and is going just nerve . Then Drusilla broke ; they beat her . Because she strong ; she was n't much older than I was , but she I let Aunt Louisa and Mrs. Habersham choose the g. and she had beat them both until that night wSKIRMISH AT SARTORIS 233nt Louisa went behind her back and chose a game could n't beat . I was coming up to supper ; I heardt inside the cabin before I could stop : " Ca n't you cvc me ? " Drusilla said . " Ca n't you understand that the troop I was just another man and not much ofat that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there mouth for John to feed , just a cousin of John 's c and not much older than his own son ? " And I Id almost see Aunt Louisa sitting there with that ' tting that never progressed : " You wish to tell me that you , a young woman , asatedwith him , a still young man , day and night for ear , running about the country with no guard nor ck of any sort upon  --  Do you take me for a cornfool ? " So that night Aunt Louisa beat her ; we  --  just sat down to supper when Aunt Louisa looked me like she had been waiting for the noise of thech to stop : " Bayard , I do not ask your forgivenessthis because it is your burden too ; you are an inno-t victim as well as Dennison and I  --  " Then she  --  Iced at Father , thrust back in Granny 's chair ( the  --  Iy chair we had ) in her black dress , the black wad knitting beside her plate . " Colonel Sartoris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must request what the husband hom I have lost and the man son which I have not o iid demand , perhaps at the point of a pistol .  --  Will ni marry my daughter ? " 234 THE UN VANQUISHEDI got out . I moved fast ; I heard the light sharp sound when Drusilla 's head went down between her flungout arms on the table , and the sound the bench made when Father got up too ; I passed him standing beside Drusilla with his hand on her head . " They have beat you , Drusilla , " he said. 3Mrs . Habersham got there before we had finished breakfast the next morning . I do n't know how Aunt Louisa got word in to her so quick . But there she was , and she and Aunt Louisa set the wedding for the day after tomorrow . I do n't reckon they even knew that that was the day Father had told the Burdens Cash Benbow would never be elected marshal in Jefferson , I do n't reckon they paid any more attention to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after tomorrow all the clocks in Jefferson were to be set back or up ahour . Maybe they did n't even know there was to be an election , that all the men in the county would be riding toward Jefferson tomorrow with pistols in their pock ets , and that the Burdens already had their nigge voters camped in a cotton gin on the edge of town under guard . I do n't reckon they even cared . Becaus0 like Father said , women can not believe that anythingSKIRMISH AT SARTORIS 235n be right or wrong or even be very important thatn be decided by a lot of little scraps of scribbled per dropped into a box . It was to be a big wedding ; all Jefferson was to be inedand Mrs. Habersham planning to bring the three tics of Madeira she had been saving for five years w when Aunt Louisa began to cry again . But they tight on quick now ; now all of them were patting tint Louisa 's hands and giving her vinegar to smell d Mrs. Habersham saying , " Of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , would be public notice of the . . . " So they decided it would a reception , because Mrs. Habersham said how a option could be held for a bridal couple at any time , cn ten years later . So Drusilla was to ride into town , ct Father and be married as quick and quiet as poslc , with just me and one other for witnesses to make legal ; none of the ladies themselves would even be esent . Then they would come back home and we ould have the reception . So they began to arrive early the next morning , with skets of food and tablecloths and silver like for a urch supper . Mrs. Habersham brought a veil and a rcath and they all helped Drusilla to dress , only Aunt iuisa made Drusilla put on Father 's big riding cloak cr the veil and wreath too , and Ringo brought the orses up , all curried and brushed , and I helped Dru-236 THE UN VANQUISHEDsilla on with Aunt Louisa and the others all watching from the porch . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , not even when I heard Aunt Louisa hollering for Denny while we rode down the drive . It was Louvinia that told about it , about how after we left the ladies set and decorated the table and spread the wedding breakfast and how they were all watching the gate and Aunt Louisa still hollering for Denny now and then when they saw Ringo and Denny come up the drive riding double on one of th mules at a gallop , with Denny 's eyes round as doorknobsand already hollering , " They kilt urn ! They kilt urn ! " " Who ? " Aunt Louisa hollered . " Where have yo been ? " " To town ! " Denny hollered . " Them two Burden They kilt um ! " " Who killed them ? " Aunt Louisa hollered . " Drusilla and Cousin John ! " Denny hollered . " I he Louvinia said how Aunt Louisa hollered sure enoug " Do you mean to tell me that Drusilla and that ma are not married yet ? " Because we did n't have time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the squa we saw the crowd of niggers kind of huddled beyon the hotel door with six or eight strange white tttherding them , and then all of a sudden I saw the JefSKIRMISH AT SARTORIS 237fcrson men , the men that I knew , that Father knew , inning across the square toward the hotel with each c holding his hip like a man runs with a pistolhis pocket . And then I saw the men who were other 's troop lined up before the hotel door , blocking off . And then I was sliding off my horse too and arching Drusilla struggling with George Wyatt . But c did n't have hold of her , he just had hold of the oak , and then she was through the line of them and nning toward the hotel with her wreath on one sideof her head and the veil streaming behind . But George held me . He threw the cloak down and held me . " Let o , " I said . " Father . " " Steady , now , " George said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote . " " But there are two of them ! " I said . " Let me go ! " " John 's got two shots in the derringer , " George said . Steady , now . " But they held me . And then we heard the three shots ml we all turned and looked at the door . I do n't know ow long it was . " The last two was that derringer , " George said . I do n't know how long it was . The old igger that was Mrs. Holston 's porter , that was too old veil to be free , stuck his head out once and said Gret Gawd " and ducked back . Then Drusilla came out , carrying the ballot box , the wreath on one side of her head and the veil twisted about her arm , and then238 THE UN VANQUISHEDFather came out behind her , brushing his new beaver hat on his sleeve . And then it was loud ; I could hear them when they drew in their breath like when t ho Yankees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Father raised his hand and they stopped . Then you could n't hear anything . " We heard a pistol too , " George said . " Did they touch you ? " " No , " Father said . " I let them fire first . You all heard . You boys can swear to my derringer . " " Yes , " George said . " We all heard . " Now Father looked at all of them , at all the faces in sight , slow . " Does any man here want a word with me about this ? " he said . But you could not hear anything , not even moving . The herd of niggers stood like they had when I first saw them , with the Northern white njen herding them together . Father put his hat on and took the ballot box from Drusilla and helped her back onto her horse and handed the ballot box up to her . Then he looked around again , at all of them . " This election will be held out at my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting commissioner until the votes are cast and counted . Does any man here object ? " But he stopped them again with his hand before it had begun good . " Not now , boys , " he said . he turned to Drusilla . " Go home , I will go to the sheriff , and then I will follow you . " SKIRMISH AT SARTORIS 239 " Like hell you will , " George Wyatt said . " Some of e boys will ride out with Drusilla . The rest of us III come with you . " But Father would not let them . " Do n't you see weworking for peace through law and order ? " heid . " I will make bond and then follow you . You do s I say . " So we went on ; we turned in the gates with Drusilla in front , the ballot box on her pommel  --  us ml Father 's men and about a hundred more , and rode n up to the cabin where the buggies and surreys werefstanding , and Drusilla passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box again and was walking toward the cabin when she stopped dead still . I reckon she and I both remembered at the same time and I reckon that even the others , the men , knew all of a sudden that something was wrong . Because like Father said , I reckon women do n't ever surrender : not only victory , but not even defeat . Because that 's how we were stopped when Aunt Louisa and the other ladies came out on the porch , and then Father shoved past me and jumped down beside Drusilla . But Aunt Louisa never even looked at him . " So you are not married , " she said . " I forgot , " Drusilla said . " You forgot ? You forgot ? " " I . . . " Drusilla said . " We . . . " Now Aunt Louisa looked at us ; she looked along240 THE UN VANQUISHEDthe line of us sitting there in our saddles ; she looked at me too just like she did at the others , like she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray ?

Since you have forced your mother and brother to live under a roof of license and adultery you think you can also force them to live in a polling booth refuge from violence and bloodshed , do you ? Bring me that box . " But Drusilla did n't move , standing there in her torn dress and the ruined veil and the twisted wreath hanging from her hair by a few pins . Aunt Louisa came down the steps ; we did n't know what she was going to do : we just sat there and watched her snatch the polling box from Drusilla and fling it across the yard . " Come into the house , " she said . " No , " Drusilla said . " Come into the house . I will send for a ministc myself . " " No , " Drusilla said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am voting commissioner . " " So you refuse ? " " I have to . I must . " She sounded like a little gi that has been caught playing in the mud . " John said that I  --  " SKIRMISH AT SARTORIS 241Then Aunt Louisa began to cry . She stood there in c black dress , without the knitting and for the firstc that I ever saw it , without even the handkerchief , ying , until Mrs. Habersham came and led her back to the house . Then they voted . That did n't take long ' there . They set the box on the sawchunk where Louiniawashed , and Ringo got the pokeberry juice and n old piece of window shade , and they cut it into allots . " Let all who want the Honorable Cassius Q. cnbow to be Marshal of Jefferson write Yes on his ballot ; opposed , No , " Father said . " And I 'll do the writing and save some more time , " George Wyatt said . So he made a pack of the ballots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would write them the men would take them and drop them into the box and Drusilla would call their names out . We could hear Aunt Louisa still crying inside the cabin and we could see the other ladies watching us through the window . It did n't take long . " You need n't bother to count them , " George said . " They all voted No . " And that 's all . They rode back to town then , carrying the box , with Father and Drusilla in the torn weddingdress and the crooked wreath and veil standing beside the sawchunk , watching them . Only this time even Father could not have stopped them . It came back high and thin and ragged and fierce , like when242 THE UNVANQUISHEDthe Yankees used to hear it out of the smoke and clic galloping : " Yaaaaay , Drusilla ! " they hollered . " Yaaaaaay , John Sartoris ! Yaaaaaaay ! " N ODOR OF VERBENAiv* t yam yi , , IIt was just after supper . I had just opened my Coke on the table beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall and then the instant of silence as he put his hand to the door knob , and I should have known . People talk glibly of presentiment , but I had none . I heard his feet on the stairs and then in the hall approaching and there was nothing in the feet because although I had lived in his house for three college years now and although both he and Mrs. Wilkins called me Bayard in the house , he would no more have243244 THE UN VANQUISHEDentered my room without knocking than I would have entered his  --  or hers . Then he flung the door violentl inward against the doorstop with one of those gestures with or by which an almost painfully unflagging preceptoryof youth ultimately aberrates , and stood there saying , " Bayard . Bayard , my son , my dear son . " I should have known ; I should have been prepared . Or maybe I was prepared because I remember how I closed the book carefully , even marking the place , before I rose .
