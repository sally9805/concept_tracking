txt Putting White Elephants to Work . To the Editor or The New York Times : Soon we will hear another appeal for funds for the unemployed . These funds take care of only heads of families . This work is necessary and praiseworthy , but there are thousands of others to be cared for  --  the unmarried men and women , the boys and girls , and the old men and women . Soon Winter will be here . Where will the unemployed now sleeping in ( be parks go then ? I suggest we allow them to sleep in " Hylan 's folly "  --  the docks on Staten Island , and in the Bronx market . If necessary , I think the unemployed should be taken by ferry to Staten Island . These places are not ideal sleeping quarters . But at least they would keep out some of the cold , and all the rain and snow . DANIEL LIDZ . New York , Sept. 25 , 1932.                 @ @ @ @
