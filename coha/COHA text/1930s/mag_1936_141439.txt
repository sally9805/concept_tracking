Chief casualty of the famed 1932 crash of Samuel InsulTs public utilities empire was the gigantic catch-all corporation called Middle West Utilities . Not to be confused with Insult 's three Grade A Chicago properties ( Commonwealth Edison , Peoples Gas Light &; Coke and Public Service of Northern Illinois ) , Middle West was a holding company for a heterogeneous parcel of small and large utility companies serving 5,321 villages and towns in 36 States from Maine to Texas . <P> Receivership and bankruptcy proceedings riddled this catch-all with holes through which slipped many a subsidiary by foreclosure and receivership . Over-capitalized at nearly a billion dollars , Middle West Utilities was reorganized into Middle West Corp. , remained the groggy skeleton of a Midwest power empire which still included 44 active subsidiaries giving electricity , gas , ice to 2,100 communities in 15 Midwest States and Ontario , Canada . For this empire Middle West 's creditors and stockholders fought bitterly for three and a half years in Chicago 's Federal District Court . Winners were the banks who for their secured loans got 1,710,000 shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bondholders got 1,290,000 new shares . The rest went to the 600,000 stockholders who for their original $220,000,000 got some 300,000 shares at the rate of one new one for 100 old common or 4 old preferred . <P> For the long job of rehabilitating Middle West , the old creditors put into the presidency long-headed Daniel Crandall Green , able , onetime vice president of Electric Bond &; Share . The principal banks in whose portfolio Samuel Insull 's empire had ended were Manhattan Bankers Trust with 568,000 shares ( 18% ) , and two Chicago banks , First National with 14% and Continental Illinois National Bank with 14% . The RFC had taken over the 5% holdings of Central Republic Trust Co . <P> The real value of Middle West stock remained a blank mystery . Some subsidiaries were earning , some losing money . The job of drawing up a consolidated financial statement was described by its officers as " nearly impossible . " President Green had estimated that net income for 1936 would be more than $1,000,000 or better than 30 a share on the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation to make and stake a guess on Middle West 's real value last week proved too much for two Chicago brokers . <P> In Chicago , glib , young polo-playing Charles Foster Glore , president of Chicago Corp . as well as a partner in the brokerage house of Field , Glore &; Co. , told newshawks that Chicago Corp. , an investment company , and A. G. Becker &; Co. , investment bankers , had bought Continental Illinois National Bank 's holdings in Middle West Corp . Chicago Corp . takes three-fifths of the purchase , Becker &; Co the rest . The price : $12 a share , giving Continental , in which Chicago Corp . has large holdings , a small profit on its once forlorn investment in Middle West Corp .
