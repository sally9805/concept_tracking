FROM the time when Hollywood was 11 nothing but a bleak suburb of Los Angeles where , in rambling , barnlike buildings a group of fly-by-night mountebanks made vigorous gestures before badly constructed , noisy cameras , until today when the city ? for it has become a city ? is proud to claim as its principal industry the enormous business of making motion pictures , beauty has been the town 's chief by-product . And all during those changing years of cinema history , from the era when no movie heroine could get a job unless possessed of an abundance of yellow curls which , when properly lighted by the sputtering kliegs , made a golden aura about her head as the final romantic fillip of the fade-out , until now when hair is sleek and " glamour " is the mood , the movies have set a standard of beauty and charm which can not be overlooked . There are three times more beauty shops in Hollywood than in any other town of its size in the world . There are a hundred times more beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice teachers . The theory seems to be that the ability to act is a gift of nature , whereas beauty is handmade . It is entirely true that loveliness is quite as necessary to a film star as emotional fervor is to a love scene . But the curious part is that girls are actually made over in face and figure by the time they have been in Hollywood a few months . And , stranger still , the worn- en of the screen who have been stars for a long time seem to have drunk from some deep pool of eternal youth . Mary Pickford has been performing before the camera for the past twenty-five years . Although she was a very young girl when she started , that still brings her to the fortyyear mark , yet I give you my word that I 've seen her off screen , without flattering gauzes over the lights to dim their glare , without one bit of camera illusion , looking not a day over twenty-five . I would have said eighteen , but I was afraid you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter . The radiance of youth seems to shine forever about Mary Pickford . Along with other Hollywood citizens I have shaken my head in doubt when a new group of " contract players " ? as heterogeneous and conglomerate a bunch of young women as you would find in any graduating class of the local high school ? arrived at the studios . Surely , I 've told myself , there is nothing to recommend these girls , nothing can be done to make them meet the demands of that one-eyed ogre , the camera . But they have invariably emerged , almost under one 's gaze , as the svelte , well-groomed -- and sometimes astonishingly beautiful ? young women you see on the screen . It is as if the entire bone formation of the face were changed ? so complete is the metamorphosis . The contrast between early photographs of the raw recruits and the " stills " from their most recent motion pictures is often startling . In the office of Perc Westmore , one of the most expert studio make-up men , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Perc ? You go into his office looking like an ugly duckling and come out like the lovely swan . " What actually happened was that Joan had no idea of her own possibilities until Westmore studied her face carefully and saw what was wrong . With a few deft strokes he brushed her hair off her forehead , changed the contour of her mouth with lipstick , and wiped the mascara off her lower eyelashes , leaving the cosmetic on the upper ones only . That was the first step in Joan Crawford 's metamorphosis . The rest she has done herself ? experimenting constantly , never becoming satisfied with herself , making a few bad beauty mistakes and rectifying them when she found she had been wrong , changing almost from month to month . Not a year ago a little Pasadena highschool girl was chosen by her school to ride on a float in the famous New Year 's Day Tournament of Roses parade . She wore a white bathing suit . and her picture was published in the paper . Ida Coverman , Louis B. Mayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . She telephoned the girl and asked if she would like to come to the studio for a screen test , but was told she was going hiking that day . Such methods have often been used deliberately in Hollywood , but jean Parker was not being " cagey . " At that time a hike was more important to her than a screen test . She did , however , say she could come the next day instead , and Ida Coverman , amused by the child 's lack of interest in picture acting , gave her the second chance . When she arrived , she was a fresh , pretty youngster much like any high-school girl . She was taken immediately to a dressing room where make-up women and hair dressers seemed suddenly to surround her . All they did was to arrange her hair correctly , to thin  | out her eyebrows , and to put upon her face a shade of powder that exactly suited her complexion . But they did more than that , somehow . They seemed truly to perform some magic upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge she had nothing but average prettiness and a good figure . But when she went to the test stage she was a well-groomed , thoroughly smart young woman . And another actress had been discovered and revised by the cinema . Perhaps you remember Jean Parker in " Rasputin " with the three Barrymores . She is also in " Little Women , " and I assure you that the girl today looks entirely different from the child who rode in the Tournament of Roses Parade . When Bette Davis , a young actress from the New York stage , was given a studio contract , executives of the first company for which she worked visualized her only in plain , oldersister , country-girl roles . And these she was given . Bette protested that she had played smart parts in New York but , since she had come from the legitimate stage and it was therefore supposed that she knew all about make-up and since Bette herself had not yet learned the Hollywood trick of dramatizing , heightening , and accenting her face , they did not listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the verge of returning to New York . In fact her trunks were packed ? and I 'm not writing a scenario , either ? when she received a call from George Arliss who was , at that time , looking for a leading woman for " The Man Who Played God . " He saw something in Bette that the others had missed and she , realizing that she was to have one more chance , got busy improving herself . She made her naturally blonde hair a bold golden color , used brown eye-shadow upon the heavy lids of her eyes to make them look to the camera the size they are , and widened her thin lips with rouge . The result was startling as well as successful , and one now hears her spoken of as " a miniature Constance Bennett . " In just a few months she transformed herself from the little brown wren to the sophisticated damsel you see upon the screen . And not only pretty girls with unrealized possibilities are thrust into the hands of the make-up artists . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hollywood as they are anywhere in the world , " Pere Westmore told me one day . " The make-up man is called to the front office and told that a Miss Somebody will come to him so that he can prepare her for a test . When he sees her , he wishes he had gone into some nice sane business like selling shoes . But he has to make her beautiful before tomorrow at three when we will make the tests . ' " So he takes the young woman by the arm and leads her to his shop . He puts her into a chair under strong lights and studies her face carefully , hoping for some ray of inspiration . Sometimes the gods are good , and he finds that the hair line is so wrong that simply by uncovering the forehead the whole ugly swoop of the face will be changed . But more often than not there is no redeeming feature . So he has but one alternative : he must make her startling , make her so striking in appearance that those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not even pretty , will not analyze her face , will only discover that her appearance causes them to gasp . And that is the way many a Hollywood star has been made . It would n't be fair to tell you their names , but perhaps you can figure them out for yourself . " But it is not only the experts at this professional beauty who make the stars what they are . It is the actresses themselves who , with constant thinking about beauty , with unfailing attention to hair , face , hands , and figure , with never-ending care of themselves , re-create themselves and keep young . Kaleidoscopic and advanced as Hollywood is , its women have learned that to remain youthful and lovely they must not abide by fixed rules but must strike out , boldly creating new fads and making continual changes . Karen Morley , Bette Davis , Joan Crawford , Constance Bennett , Norma Shearer change make-up and coiffure with every new film . They have the courage to experiment , which few non-professional women have . How much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fads in screen make-up can not be taken too literally nor copied too exactly . When they appear before the camera , the stars must , to catch the imagination of a capricious public , be dramatic and sensational ? over-dramatic and over-sensational for drawing room purposes . The hundreds of girls throughout the United States who imitate Garbo 's long-hair bob , her quizzical , suddenly upturned eyebrows , would be much wiser if they applied themselves merely to adapting her screen suggestions to their own shape of face and contour of feature . Both for beauty and health the arch of the eyebrows should follow the bone construction of the brow since , if the hair is taken completely away , the light rays will hit the pupil of the eye more directly than nature intended they should , thereby weakening the orb . Nor are the false eyelashes worn by Marlene Dietrich ( put on separately , one hair at a time , each hair taken up with a tweezer and the end dipped into a gluish mixture which is stuck on the eyelid ) exactly suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up her lip stick and drew with it upon her face a mouth that stretched to such outlandish proportions that she looked like a circus clown . Joan believed that she was creating this mouth for a certain screen character she portrayed . That was partly the reason , but what she was really doing was making a brave attempt at individuality , the spirit of which can be copied , if not the outcome . For these startling brows , these over-long lashes , these heavy lips typify not in actuality but in substance the lesson that women can learn from Hollywood ? that wearing one 's hair the same way year in and year out , using the same dabs of powder and rouge week after week are what make the average face so uninteresting . The stars have made glaring beauty mistakes ? sometimes with the purpose of creating an effect ? but since the rosebud lips and the golden curls went out of screen fashion , the stars have come to realize that it is better to be smart and individual than merely pretty . I HAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any woman can keep herself well-groomed and lovely , only to have them answer , " But the Hollywood women have the time and the money to keep that way . " It does take time , I 'll grant , but it takes much less money than one imagines . What it takes more than money , more than time , even , is thought . For the average woman an occasional trip to the beauty parlor is enough . The rest can be done at home , but creative thought and interest in beauty must be included in the day 's schedule . Constant awareness of changing trends plus an active desire for beauty is as important as your face creams . Mary Pickford creates that radiant , vital illusion of youth by giving not only constant care to her face and body , but by keeping her mind alert . " Keeping young is n't just those trips to the beauty parlor , " she once told me . " It 's a combination of two things ? the never-ending care , which has become second nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , suit my particular skin , and then that something in my mind which tells me that I ca n't grow old . It does n't take money . I can ? and often do ? take care of my own hair . I always do my own nails . I give myself the facials that my skin needs . If women get old and saggy  | its their own fault , and shows that they do n't want youth as much as they think they do . " Of course , every star has her pet beauty tricks . Joan Crawford washes her hair every day . An iron is never touched to it . The famous coiffeur , Sib , gives her finger waves instead . " The first year Miss Crawford took sun baths , " Sib says , " the oil she put on her face and body got into her hair , and it had to be washed out . It came to be a habit , and her hair is just as healthy and thick and glossy as it ever was . " Norma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water only every other week . Alternate weeks she gives herself a dry shampoo , careful always to use one that has some oil in it . Also no matter how tired she is at night , she brushes her hair long and vigorously .. Although Norma has changed the length and arrangement of her hair innumerable times , she always keeps the same hair line . She ca n't do anything else since she has a front " cowlick . " As for street make-up , that is often different from the make-up in which the actresses face the camera . The Hollywood girls have notoriously good complexions , and that 's because ? according to Pere Westmore ? they wear heavy greasepaint for such long hours . This would lead one to believe that a creamy powder base is excellent for the skin . Norma Shearer 's eyes are rather small . She makes them appear larger both on and off screen ? by very careful use of mascara on the lashes , each lash touched separately , and by drawing a tiny line under the eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tip of the eye . Norma believes in washing her face with good old soap and water . For this she uses gauze squares which she folds by hand between scenes on the set . For street , Katharine Hepburn keeps her face shiny , and instead of trying to cover what most people consider a defect ? freckles ? she lets them show by washing her face thoroughly and then polishing it briskly with a rough towel until it gleams like a school boy 's apple . Her mouth , she will readily point out to you , is not beautiful ; therefore she changes its outlines with lipstick and succeeds in camouflaging its lack of beauty by making it unusual . JEAN HARLOW , having studied her famous face carefully in the mirror , has realized that she could easily look hard and cheap in street make-up . The roles she plays require her to do this , hence she must be doubly careful off screen . Her eyelashes are light and need to be darkened , but if she mascaraed both upper and lower lashes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's youth . Therefore she uses the mascara only on the upper lashes and allows the lower ones to remain nude . Little Patricia Ellis , a newcomer to the screen who appeared with Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. , in " The Narrow Corner , " has what we used to call " a dish face " and the mouth that goes with that type of physiogonomy ? a rather flat mouth with both upper and lower lip on the same plane . The trick which overcomes this is the rouging of the upper lip more than the lower to make a contrast and give the face an accent which it otherwise would not have . She also parts her hair in the middle with two loose dips on either side to break the monotony of a very high and somewhat bulging forehead . Constance Bennett 's broad jaw line is partly concealed by a hair line ? the long bob which curls at the ends and loosely falls forward at the back of the jaw . Except when their pictures demand something different you will find that the simple coiffure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has recently had her hair cut much shorter , and Mary Pickford 's bob is not so long as it was originally . Sylvia Sidney and  | Miriam Hopkins , on the other side , have let their hair grow longer . That , of course , is a matter of taste . Lilyan Tashman is one of the exceptions who displays a new and almost incredible coiffure every month because she has to maintain a reputation for the spectacular . But extreme coiffures are expensive because they look frouzy if not kept in absolutely perfect condition every second , and the slightest breeze , or just once taking off and putting on a hat , can disarrange them . The stars have discovered that contrasting eye shadows make the eyes bright and bring out the natural color , so the brown-eyed stars , as a rule , use blue eye shadow , and the blue-eyed stars use brown . A smart trick discovered in the use of grease paint is one which the stars continue in their street make-up . For the camera grease paint is applied to the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the face and smoothed in with the grease . This makes the powder go on much more smoothly , therefore the stars who use a cream powder base take this dressing-room idea into their own boudoirs and blend cold water with the powder base . Incidentally , most stars mix their- own powders , using several colors of standard makes until just the right shade is discovered . Nor is good old-fashioned face slapping spurned by the stars . I 've seen lovely Claudette Colbert vigorously slapping and patting her face for minutes at a time to bring the blood to the surface and stimulate the skin . Ruth Chatterton , besides being one of the champion gum chewers of Hollywood , improves her moments between scenes by giving herself a miniature facial . Using her fingers as if they were an electric vibrator , making them tremble , she presses the cheek bones at the spot closest to the hair line and also by the ears under the cheek bones . Also with a gentle rotating movement she sends her fingers around and around at the corner of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping off to sleep after a strenuous day at the studio . And studio days are guaranteed to put the steadiest nerves on edge . Tiny gentle taps with the fingers upon the eyelids she finds efficacious . In every star make-up box there is a tiny baby brush . After the powder is patted on with a puff this brush is used to take up the surplus . A plain pipe cleaner is also often used to take off powder from the eyebrows and around the nose , and if rubbed along the natural indentation in the upper lip from tip of the nose to the middle of the lip makes that indentation appear deeper and more attractive . Most of the actresses keep pads of cotton and a bottle of eye lotion handy so that , when they have a few minutes ' rest , they can soak the cotton in the liquid and place it over the eyes . It rests and refreshes the eyes . I COULD go on telling star beauty tricks indefinitely , but it is not these things alone which create the startling changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older stars attractive . Beauty , they have discovered , is so much more than these physical gestures . It is an attitude of mind . This attitude , bits of which have been gleaned from every star I know , is a difficult thing to epitomize , but I 'm going to have a try at it . In the first place , one must have the courage to try new make-up methods ; and second , one must believe in oneself . These stars must , before they create the illusion of beauty ? and illusion it is , since so many of them are not actually beautiful ? become sure of themselves . This sureness is not only the cause but the effect of beauty . They must believe in themselves before they can begin to change , but the more their loveliness unfolds the more poise they acquire . They must bring their minds into a state of beauty , never regretting the mistakes , and teach themselves to think in terms of beauty . It requires much vigilance , but the results are eminently worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
