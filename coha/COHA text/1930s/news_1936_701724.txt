txt Dr. Herbert T. Kalmus , president and general manager of Technicolor Motion Picture Corp , just back from Europe , states that rapid progress is being made toward the erection of the British Technicolor plant , a short distance from London , and that establishment of a Technicolor subsidiary for central Europe in Berlin is not unlikely when the British Technicolor plant is completed . While in London Dr. Kalmus completed negotiations with Alexander Korda for the latter 's first all-Technicolor feature for London Films , " Lawrence of Arabia " . Robert Kane will produce his first feature length Technicolor production early in May . This is to be the 9icturization of Mary Borden 's " King of Jews " and will be made by Kane for Twentieth Century Fox at the Denham studios . " Volume of American Technicolor business for 1935 was about double that of the preceding year and the volume of business already contracted for 1936 indicates a further corresponding increase for this year , " he stated .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
