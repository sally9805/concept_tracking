In Philadelphia last week the Northern Baptist Convention wound up its annual gathering ( TIME , May 31 ) after paying its respects to its late benefactor , John D.

Y. ) , members of a Movement for World Christianity ( Rochester , N. Y. ) , a Fellowship of Southern Churchmen ( Nashville , Tenn. ) deliberated , prayed , resolved . Most news worthy conventions of the week : <P> Presbyterians- For the sixth time since the Civil War , Columbus , Ohio was host last week to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U. S. A. Among the 900 " commissioners " to the Assembly was one who had stayed away from its last meeting in Columbus four years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would arise over the schism led by Fundamentalist Dr. J. Gresham Machen . This absentee was Rev. Dr. William Hiram Foulkes , moderate Presbyterian , sonorous orator , pastor of Old First Church in Newark , N. J. By last week the acrimony had subsided , Dr. Machen had died , his rebel church was rent by theological squabbles over millennialism , * and Dr. Foulkes turned up in Columbus as a commissioner . The Assembly was marked by businesslike calm . Commissioner Foulkes and his colleagues learned that the Presbyterian Church had recovered $1,600,000 in property , and counted on $400,000 more , which Dr. Machen 's church had tried to take with it when it split off from the parent body . And to Dr. Foulkes , 59 , big , well-beloved leader of youth , writer of hymns and Presbyterian mission board member , there went without fuss the office-moderator-ship of the General Assembly-which year after year is handed around among members of the inner circle which runs the Presbyterian Church from the top . <P> During the year past , Presbyterian pacifists worked to get two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Confession of Faith the following : " Christians may lawfully under the New Testament , wage war . " Last week they learned that the repealer had failed of adoption by nine votes . <P> Rabbis . Two hundred members of the world 's largest rabbinical assembly , the Central Conference of American Rabbis ( Reform Jews ) , also met last week in Columbus , exchanged greetings with the Presbyterians . Rabbi Samuel Marcus Gup told the Christians : " The world needs just this sort of demonstration in which you and we are taking part today . "
