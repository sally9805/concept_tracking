Spanish hearts have had room for nothing but political hatred since the overwhelming victory of the Left parties in the general elections last month ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) . Last week , after a month of passionate and random violence , the mobs had burned some 17 churches , eleven convents , 33 Rightist political clubs , ten newspaper plants and 22 miscellaneous buildings . Killed : 51 . Wounded : 194 . In a fog of censorship and an official " state of alarm , " a wild rumor spread that land-hungry peasants had overrun the estates of President Niceto Alcal Zamora and his 78-year-old spinster aunt . <P> Half-sympathetic toward the Spanish peasant 's belief that Jesuits and Rightist politicians are to blame for peasant poverty , squat , sack-faced Republican Premier Manuel Azaa last week moved to end the violence . He called in Socialist Leader Francisco Largo Caballero , roared at him to call off his mobs , was met with evasions . He issued a decree re-seizing for distribution to the peasants lands which Spain 's Left Government had seized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandees in 1933 . <P> The one thing Left-Centre Premier Azaa knew that he could not do was to crack down on the Left mobsters of the Socialist and Communist parties , whose 99 seats in the new Cortes , added to the 165 seats of his own Republican parties , give him his mandate . Nor could he use direct action against the powerful Right coalition of Catholic Leader Gil Robles without inviting civil war . He did , however , espouse the theory that the month 's violence had been the work of Rightist agents provocateurs trying to make the victorious Left look bad . Then suddenly he discovered the perfect goat-Fascism . <P> Spain has an extreme political fringe to the Right , its only true Fascist Party , called Falange Espaola ( Spanish Phalanx ) which did not win a single Cortes seat in the election . Its chief is the handsome , 34-year-old lawyer-son of Spain 's famed Dictator under the monarchy , the late General Primo de Rivera . Eldest of a hot-headed trio of born troublemakers , Jos Antonio Primo de Rivera was closeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returned to Spain in time to lead his blue-shirted pistoleros against Spain 's October 1934 Revolution of the Left . <P> Last week Premier Azaa ordered Jos jailed for prosecution on charges of inciting armed rebellion . The Phalanx was outlawed , all its clubhouses closed and many of its leaders locked up . The police , given this official support , went merrily into the streets and began cracking Rightist and Leftist skulls without fear or favor .
