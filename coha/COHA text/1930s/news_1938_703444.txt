txt District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey reported to the public yesterday on the conduct of his office in the first six months of his incumbency and showed that his staff had obtained a higher percentage of trial convictions than any ? New York County prosecutor since the turn of the century . This high mark was 63 per cent of all the felony actions taken into the courts . It was three points higher than the 60 per cent obtained by Charles S. Whitman - in the years from 1910 to 1914 . Mr. Whitman , whose record as District Attorney made him Governor , was the last organization Republican elected as prosecutor prior to Mr. Dewey . Mr. Dewey 's decision to - inform the public , in an unprecedented interim accounting , as to what manner of public service he had performed was described as ' having been the result of pressure from newspapers and other sources . For months would-be detractors - of the District Attorney have been declaring that his youthful staff was losing an abnormal number of cases in the courts , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be made on a statistical basis . First Report Since Whitman 's Mr. Dewey 's report was said to be the first of its kind since the District Attorneyship of former Governor Whitman , and the only instance that could be recalled in which the prosecutor made a six monthe survey of his work . In recent years the Democratic holders of this office dispensed with reports to the electorate altogether . The r ? sum ? of the six months was actually a statement to the District Attorney made by Morris Schneider , chief clerk of the office , and it bore Mr. Schneider 's signature . In the compilation of comparative statistics , by which Mr. Dewey 's six months ' record was compared with the records of all his predecessors back to and including William Travers Jerome , Mr. Schneider reported that a snag had been struck . Since 1929 a more detailed system of record keeping has been used in the District Attorney 's office than before , and so , to achieve a fair basis of comparison , the figures for the first six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this reason the comparison is based upon cases taken into - court , and shows only the percentage of convictions out of the court trials . Cases terminated by pleas of guilty did not figure in the simpler system . 63% Convictions Obtained The statistics showed that in the first six months of 1938 Mr. Dewey 's office had obtained 63 per cent convictions in all cases . The rest ran as follows : Jerome , 1902-09 , 44 per cent ; Whitman , 1910-14 , 60 per cent ; Charles Albert Perkins , 1915 ? he served the unexpired term vacated by Whitman 's elevation to the Governorship-50 per cent ; Edward Swann , 1916-21 , 49 per cent ; Joab H. Banton , 1922-29 , 47 per cent ; Thomas C. T. Crain , 1930-33 , 45 per cent ; William . Copeland Dodge , 1934-37 , 51 per cent. - Mr. Dodge was Mr. Dewey 's immediate predecessor . A more detailed comparison was made between the first six months of the Dewey tenure and the first six months . of each year from 1929 to 1937 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Dodge served ? and for which the more detailed accounting could be made . In the following figures , the 1938 numbers are actual , the comparative numbers are an average for the period from 1929 to 1937 . Thus , in the first six months of the Dewey service there were 271 convictions , as compared to 199 for the averaged period ; 159 pleas of guilty during trial , as compared to 157 ; 958 guilty pleas , as - against 1,109 ; juries acquitted .116 under Dewey , compared to 134 ; courts directed 45 acquittals , as against 97 ; the District Attorney recommended the discharge of 251 , - as against 490 ; 18 were found insane , as against 20 ; 85 were disposed of by superseding or new indictments , as compared to 227 and , finally , with the aid of these detailed figures it was shown that Mr. Dewey 's administration of the office had produced a " proportion of successful trials to acquittals " of 72.8 per cent of the 1,903 cases disposed of in General Sessions Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparative period used . This percentage of 72.8 constituted the " highest in the history of the office so far as statistics are available , " Mr. Schneider reported , adding : " The number of convictions is greater than in the corresponding period in any year since the present system of statistics was adopted in 1929 and the number of cases discharged is less than in any such year . " After drawing the comparison with other District Attorneys Mr. Schneider continued : " The above statistics include all felony ' cases . The conspicuous contrast , however , lies in the handling of major offenses against society , as shown by a detailed comparison between the figures for the first six months of this year and last year . Conviction figures include only convictions by jury and defendants who pleaded guilty to the crime as charged in the indictment after the trial had commenced ; acquittals include all acquittals both by jury and by direction of the court . " The following table was appended : First half First half of 1937. of ** Acg . Conv .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree 2 0 1 Manslaughter 10 5 13 Felonious assault 36 29 43 Robbery 49 40 39 Burglary 24 13 16 Grand larceny ' 39 24 23 Forgery 10 1 5 Criminally receiving stolen goods 21 4 8 Dangerous weapons ( felony ) ... 13 2 13 215 121 162 188 64 Per Cent Were Convicted " In these major crimes convictions resulted in 64 per cent of the cases put to , trial in the first six months of this dear , compared with 46 per cent in the same period last year , " . the report said . The report then took up the homicide bureau , headed by Assistant District Attorney Jacob Rosenblum , who has personally handled ten trials since the beginning of the year and won them all , including-one in which Samuel Leibowitz , the criminal lawyer whose string of victories in capital cases has extended through the years to a total of nearly a hundred , represented the defense . Mr. Schneider set forth that when Mr. Dewey took office there were 44 defendants in homicide cases awaiting grand jury action and 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , including all the new cases , eight defendants were awaiting grand jury action and 48 awaiting trial , a 40 per cent reduction . It was in the tabulated statistics of homicides that the greatest disparity with the record of the office under Mr. Dodge was shown . In this table the comparison was between the first six months of 1928 and the same period of 1937 : Thus in 1938 there were eleven first-degree-murder convictions , as against one ; three acquittals , as against four ; two discharges , as against twenty-two ; none held insane , as against four . Record In ? Special Sessions In the Court of Special Sessions , where there are no juries and three judges hear each case , there . were 7,159 dispositions in the first six months of 19$8 . There were 2,133 trials , 3,702 guilty pleas , 1,266 discharges and 56 cases dismissed and abated . The trials resulted in 1 ? 294 convictions and 839 acquittals , a per cent of successes figured at 60.7. ' this was compared to the average for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which there were 2,309 trials and 1,058 convictions , or 45.5 per cent of successes . ' The system started by Mr. Dewey of having a call calendar in Part 6 of this court every Wednesday afternoon , at which definite dates are set for future trials instead of the old method , ' which was to call a case when ' it was ' reached , was cited as having " resulted in a tremendous saving of time for complainants , witnesses , defendants and defense attorneys . " ' Increased efficiency and speed in the operation of the indictment bureau , headed by Stanley H. Fuld , was reflected in the report . On Jan. 1 156 prisoners were in the Tombs awaiting grand jury action . This was reduced by February , and since that time the number of prisoners held pending grand jury . action has been made to average the approximate number of such offenders arrested by the police within the preceding forty-eight hours ? an average of thirty . A total of 2,533 cases has been handled by the- indictment bureau since Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints brought to his office rose by nearly . 1,000 over the comparative period of - the year before . There were 4,513 over 3,679 in the previous comparable six months ' period , and 3,297 for the first . six months of 1936 . " A filing system , " Mr. Schneider said , " has been devised by which a complete record is kept of the disposition of every complaint brought - to the District Attorney 's - office . The tabulation of complaint bureau records also has been greatly expanded so as to give a day-to-day picture of the channels through which complaints brought to the District y ' Attornes office are direct . ed . " Thousands of persons unfamiliar with the law come to the office ofl the District Attorney with legal problems . Many which is the point of contact with these persons , makes a careful study of their stories and , where in its judgment the complaint does not come within the jurisdiction of this office , it directs the complainant to the proper channel . Many impoverished complainants , whose remedy lies in the civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legal Aid Society . " Arrangements have been made with a number of the departments of the city government , ' With the State Department of Labor , Workmen 's Compensation Bureau , and other State agencies , and with the Works Progress Administration and other Federal agencies for ' the expeditious handling of matters brought to the attention of this office which are judged to come within the jurisdiction of the above mentioned agencies . " Working agreements have been made with these agencies - for the transfer of such cases directly from this office with ? the least possible waste of the complainant 's time . " The Appeals Bureau , under Assistant District Attorney Felix Benvenga , who also served under Mr. Dodge and Mr.aCrain ; also showed an increase in the percentage of its successful cases . This bureau handled , in the first six months of 1938 , twenty-seven cases before the Court of Appeals , 177 cases before the Appellate Division and eighty-six before the Appellate Part of Special Sessions . Its percentage of successful appearances ' was 86 per cent in the first group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1934 to 1937 as averaged ; 84 per cent in the second group compared to 78 and 70 per cent in the third compared to 62.8 . The racket- and fraud bureaus , headed by Assistant District Attorneys Murkay , Gurfein and - Barent Ten Eyck , respectively , were not comparable to , anything in the past because they , , had been set up with the beginning of the Dewey tenure . The bail-bond- bureau ? in the first six months of 1938 , gassed on $1 , - 094,650 in bail , accepting $901,350 in ? 477 bonds , . and rejecting $193,300 on eighty-two applications . Forfeitures were listed as amounting to $79,691 , described as . " unusually low as compared with previous years . " On old forfeitures where real estate had been offered as security , this bureau collected $6,603.50 in the first six months of 1938 , a figure that " exceeds the aggregate amount collected on similar - forfeitures . for all of the last four years put together .
