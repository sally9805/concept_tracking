Last week the U. S. Government did the following for and to U. S. Business : <P> Effected regulation of over-the-counter security trading after three years ' study by SEC . Passed by Congress just before adjournment was the Maloney bill granting SEC indirect control over 0-T-C trading through dealers ' associations . The 9,000-odd active 0-T-C dealers are supposed to band together in geographical groups , draw up rules , elect officers and police themselves ( all subject to SEC approval ) . If SEC decides that this has failed to prevent manipulation , excessive commissions , other unfair practices , it may step in . Though last week 's act exempted dealers in Government , State and municipal securities , Washington insiders predicted that the next Congress will tackle legislation to regulate municipals . <P> Refused , then offered new hope of , aid to the stricken railroads . Congress adjourned without passing any railroad emergency legislation , but the Interstate Commerce Commission agreed to reconsider its recent 6-to-5 decision against allowing a basic coach-passenger fare-increase from 2 to 2 a mile . ICC also approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Pend d'Oreille Railway calling for the merger of the two . Total trackage of these two roads is 161 miles , but the event was a milestone : the first ICC approval of a Class I reorganization since Section 77 of the Bankruptcy Law was extended to railroads in 1933 . <P> Launched what may become the biggest trust-busting expedition in U.S. history as President Roosevelt signed a resolution for a $500,000 monopoly study by a committee of six Congressmen , six members of Government executive agencies . Named chairman of the committee was Wyoming 's trust-busting Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney , named a member was Idaho 's trust-busting Senator William Edgar Borah , who declared : " I venture the belief that the committee is not proposing any witch-hunting program . . . . " <P> Proposed further limitations of speculative trading in grain futures . Under the Commodity Exchange Act this right is given to a Commodity Exchange Commission consisting of the Secretaries of Agriculture and Commerce and the Attorney General . The Secretary of Agriculture is chief and has under his direction the Commodity Exchange Administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Joseph William Tell Duvel , who has been with the Department of Agriculture off and on since 1902 . Last week Dr. Duvel submitted the CEA 's proposals for speculative limits . Thereupon , Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace announced that to prevent undue price fluctuation from speculation , the Commission proposed : 1 ) a 2,000,000 bu. limit on net long or short positions in all futures combined or any one contract market ( 3,000,000 in " spread positions " ) except during the delivery month when the limit would be cut to 1,000,000 ; 2 ) a daily trading limit per person of 2,000,000 bu. in all futures combined , also cut to 1,000,000 in the delivery month , These limitations , which will not apply to bona fide hedging operations , will go into effect shortly after July 10 unless there are convincing objections . <P> Reshaped the bankruptcy laws to give SEC more authority ( see p. 10 ) .
