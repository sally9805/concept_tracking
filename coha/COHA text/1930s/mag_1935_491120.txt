By GENERAL HUGE S. JOHNS VII I WAS fairly well acquainted with the whole corps of Washington correspondents during the war and much better acquainted with the present group . I do n't know whether it was the war atmosphere and the strong cohesion of Government itself under war conditions , or whether it is a most astonishing improvement in technique , but , as between the trying for anything that would make news by that old crowd , and the literal excavation of it by the new , there is about the comparison of a gimlet and a battery of five-ton steam shovels . Nothing of importance goes on in the capital that they do not know it as soon as it starts , and usually as soon as somebody begins thinking about it . A favorite method is for one man to come to you and say : " There is some pretty bad stuff coming out of AAA about you and NRA " and so  --  bzz , bzz , bzznever anything definite  --  never any names . And , if , in comment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a controversial or even argumentative nature , the trick has been done . Back hotfoot to AAA . " You really ought . to hear Johnson on suchand-such " ? something definite now and a name to use , and thereafter back and forth like a shuttle . Pretty soon a fabric has been woven which , with at least some faint color , can be headlined WA LLACE AND JOHNSON IN BIG RIFT . The Washington Whispering Gallery Mli LTIPLY the possibilities of that by several scores of subordinate officials in both administrations . Combine and permutate it as between officials in the same administration  --  which leads to such headlines as : NRA TORN WITH STRIFE  --  and some idea can be gathered of the source of most of the unsettling and disturbing news stories and the labyrinthine whispering gallery which Washington is today . During the first year of NRA I was unequivocally alleged to have had hot controversies with : The President , Attorney-General Cummings , Secretaries Morgenthau , Ickes , Wallace , Roper and Perkins , Budget Director Douglas , Administrators Hopkins and Peek , Assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a matter of fact , the only one of these officials with whom I had even a few tart words was George Peek , and he and I had been enjoying them for seventeen years , whenever we wanted to . It has come to a pretty pass if you have to give up such a time-mellowed habit of soul-satisfying shindy. ; with your best and oldest friends ! As to the rest , right up to the very end no unkind word was ever passed . I say this to remove the false idea that NRA was a sort of stormy petrel of the New Deal so far as wars or even saber-rattling is concerned . But I do not say it to create an equally false idea that NRA lay in a nest of eiderdown . It did n't . It would have been far better to have had a few robust rows than to try to carry the load beset by phantom and nameless opposition such as I had outside and  --  in the last few months  --  inside NRA . I never had to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army nor in the administration of the draft , or the mobilization of industry or in any industrial company I ever knew . To the extent that aptitude or training for playing it is necessary to NRA , I was utterly unqualified for the job . We began to plan NRA in two anterooms of Ray Moley 's office in the State Department . Even before the Bill was passed this became impossible . Visit , ors waiting for interviews had to sit in rows around the walls of the same room in which important and sometimes confidential conferences were taking place . It was bedlam , and all thinking and writing had to be done at night . I asked for temporary quarters and got several stalls in the Commerce Building  --  the worst-planned office building in the world . These were small steel-enclosed alcoves opening on a common corridor  --  like nothing so much as the pay toilet in the Union Station . A vast press of work was upon us , and it was becoming very clear what the organization would eventually look like , what space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments would be grouped . There was an ideal building for this purpose in the Old Post Office Building at 7th and F Streets . It was available . I knew that building because it was there that I had done the biggest job of my life  --  the selective draft  --  and I knew just how NRA would fit in there . I got a promise from the committee that was then allocating space that we could have it . We were getting ready to move when , without any consultation with me , I got orders to stay where / was . Why , I do not know . It may seem a very little thing , but in my opinion it was one of the greatest handicaps we had to bear . From that day to this , NRA has never been housed in a manner that encouraged efficiency . It gave us a constant appearance of haste and confusion . I have mentioned the Cabinet Board under which NRA at first tried to function and have tried to make it clear that I am not criticizing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that duty , and they did it . But I am very sure that Cabinet officers , each with his own department to run , can not sit in judgment , singly or jointly , on the acts of another absolutely new department , working furiously on a thing of such new intendments and such wide and all-inclusive operation as NRA . They felt that they had to edit orders and regulations that NRA might publish and they actually proposed to pass cavalierly on the validity and substance of all Codes after our weeks of negotiation and study . The only criticism of one epoch-making bulletin was that the pronoun " 1 " had been used  --  until I pointed out that it was in a quotation from a speech by the President . Of course , that came from unfamiliarity with the nature and extent of our work , but I was put in the peculiarly unpleasant position of " wanting to be a dictator , " or " a prima donna , " or " not co-operating , " if I pointed out that we could not possibly do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This did not make for unity of action . The heads of PWA and AAA sat in the NRA Board , but the head of the NRA Board had nothing to do with the PWA or the AAA Board . Integration was impossible on this formula , the effect if not the purpose of which was repression . I laid claim to no place in the official hierarchy . I was perfectly willing to be less than the idiot beneath anybody 's chariot wheels . I repeatedly said that 4 had neither political nor personal ambition , and I certainly conducted myself as though I mearsk it . I pride myself that during my entire administration of NRA I never made one concession to expediency for political or personal reasons . But I did want an opportunity to do the job . I did not want to interfere with anybody else , and I did not want anybody else to interfere with me . I do not mean that I objected to co-ordination  --  I was the constant exponent of it . I recommended and insisted on it over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Frank Walker 's Council , pledged him my willingness to abide by any decision he might make and to support him to the limit , and then , in our intimate friendly conferences , chided him for not making more use of his authority . No other administration or department ever asked me to do anything that I did not do or to refrain from doing anything that I did not cease , nor did any other department or official of any other department ever ask me to sail on any other course than the one NRA took , or protest or admonish or seek to counsel with me about varying views that they might have . It would have been far better if there had been more of that . I realized that I was hitting pretty hard in frequent speeches , and I asked more than once if I was doing anything that I ought not to do , or omitting anything that I ought to do , or talking too much or too vehemently , but I was always encouraged to go on as I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Richberg had asked me to do all that I could to bring him in contact with the President . Frank Walker had to take a long leave to attend to his own affairs , and I suggested Mr. Richberg to the President to serve during Frank Walker 's absence . Still feeling the crying need of co-ordination , especially among AAA , NRA , PWA , FERA , FTC , and the Department of Labor , I also suggested the Industrial Emergency Committee , composed of the heads of these administrations , and that Mr. Richberg be also made Executive Secretary of that . But I am getting away ahead of the story of wars and rumors of wars on the NRA front . After the merger of the Recovery Board with the Emergency Council , I expected a period of comparative calm , but I have since discovered that snipers were in continuous action . Mr. Richberg was very restless , telling me from time to time that his private affairs were going to make it necessary for him to resign and , once again becoming quite disturbed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by me to people in the organization not " through channels . " I found that there were little cobwebs of complaint about this stirred up by somebody . As to not " going through channels , " there were emergencies wherein I had to act , and act at once . " Through channels " is a military expression connoting the old War Department red-tape system , which , before it was cleaned up , was a fearful and wonderful thing . I tried to avoid such terms and methods in NRA because people were too apt to say that I was a top sergeant anyway . But here it came back to haunt me with reverse English . Yet if criticism of NRA methods were to be put on that ground , I think I knew more about how the old Army game worked than anybody around NRA . And , with all I know of it , this was the first time I ever heard that a commanding officer  --  if so it must be put  --  could not give an order on the spot , on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and passing it through half a dozen hands . The present paralysis of NRA is due in part to the adoption of a system that , before its abolition , cursed the Army for a century  --  no decision , no responsibility and a continuous passing of the buck from Dan to Beersheba . The instances of my " orders on the spot " were few , of no importance and far between , but they were used as a constant irritant to create dissatisfaction within and complaint outside the organization . I did not know that then , but I know it beyond peradventure now . Some of these incidents seem so petty that I am ashamed to write them . But the fact is that these small things were constantly churned to a harassing froth which kept the organization in uneasiness and turmoil . There was a constant story that my ante office had too much authority in dealing with visitors and requests for action , rulings and decision . We had in our outer office one of the most courteous and able receptionists in Washington  --  Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and of me . He had been an important industrialist himself  --  the full peer of several of our divisional administrators . I offered him the office of deputy several times but he declined the larger dignity and salary because he knew , as I knew , that his position was of great importance , even if it carried no title , and that he would be difficult to replace . We tried to rid the Administrator 's staff of the insolence of office , and to see that people got taken care of promptly and courteously , and I have heard of very few instances where such was not the ease . Miss Robinson , my Administrative Assistant , often disposed of calls where she could do so to the satisfaction of the applicant  --  never otherwise . And she never did anything without my specific consent , or , if it were an emergency , without reporting it to me at once . I had tried half a dozen people in those general outside contact places , with such unfortunate results and so much complaint that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I backed them up . There was some complaint about this , but it was not from the public whom we were charged to serve . Along about May , 1933 , some protesting friends who have been since disclosed as something less than loving began coming to me saying with singular persistency and cohesion : " Hugh , you need a rest . Just put NRA in the hands of a committee and go away and hide yourself for a month . We 'll see that it rocks along . " Rumors began to come to me of casual meetings outside of NRA to discuss the same project , which I was finally to hear at the White House after months of this persistent effort . Late in the spring of 1934 , Mr. Rich-berg came to me again and said he thought I still harbored some thought that he was trying to get control of NRA . He said he thought so because when he had expressed the last of many intentions to resign I had received the suggestion sympathetically instead of protesting as I always had before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so scheming is beyond me . In the first place , there was nothing that I hid from that man of either my personal or my official troubles . While he had never been charged with any responsibility except giving advice , I had a genuine affection for him before we had worked together a month . I let him act for me in a more confidential relation than anybody else . I had no secrets from hini and I trusted him as I would have trusted my own brother . I liked his society in the very few chances we had to sit down and talk about things far removed from NRA  --  of people we had known years before or of incidents that we knew about in common . I had even talked about practicing law with him after our work should be done . Conference With the President I never neglected an opportunity to praise him or to advance his interests . I had never suspected him of any such thing as a desire to change NRA or control it , and being in my full confidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain with NRA for only a little while longer . My resources were being rapidly exhausted , and there were other compelling reasons . I had told all this to him with the utmost freedom . I again reassured him that I suspected him of no attempt to control NRA and again it passed from my mind . On June twenty-sixth , I submitted to the President my thoughts on reorganization of NRA in order that he might have it on his trip to Hawaii . . About this time the Industrial Emergency Committee was formed . Also the President had a talk with me  --  an affectionate conversation in which he said he wished I would go away for a vacation while he was gone to Hawaii , and leave NRA to any temporary setup I desired  --  no committee was proposed . I told him about my engagement in San Francisco and several other places and said that I would take my mother to the Colorado mountains after that trip and try my best to get a. rest . Mr. Riehberg was going away too . I was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought very well of my suggestions about reorganization of NRA , but to my suggested resignation , waved his bands and said : " Later , perhaps , but not now . " My memorandum of June 26 , 1934 , to the President recommending a form of reorganization of NRA , including my own elimination therefrom will be included in my book but although it is of the utmost importance it is too long to quote here . It showed that we were passing from the phase of Code-making to Code Administration  --  the real test of the new idea of industrial self-government in the United States  --  and that this required an entirely different form of organization . It proposed to maintain our Research and Legal staffs and a small unit for Code-revision but to recast the whole experienced personnel of NRA into a new overhead to perform the Government 's duty of watchfulness , in the public interest , over what industry , given a chance to cooperate in economic groups , might do . The Reorganization Proposal It proposed one Advisory Council representative of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It insisted on a rigidly impartial system of tribunals for the settlement of labor controversies , absolutely divorced from the control or even suggestion of any other governmental agency  --  a purely judicial body unaffected by politics , policy or expediency . It proposed a Board of Directors to be composed of outstanding leaders in Industry , Labor and the professions to be wholly divorced from other governmental functions . The Board was to create NRA policy in the broadest terms , but the memorandum emphatically warned against ever permitting the Board to attempt executive functions , which were to be left to some effective administrator to replace myself . One of the most important paragraphs in this absolutely vital document was , viz : " 7 . Present Conflicts . This Government must take a clean-out decision between the theory of the Recovery Act  --  regulated competition to support and stabilize wage rates  --  or the theory of the Federal Trade Commission Acts  --  absolutely uncontrolled competition in spite of wage rates . The two ideas can not exist side by side without composition of some inherent conflicts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be done at the earliest possible moment . At present NRA has not the support of the FTC , and neither has it the full support of the Department of Justice . " Mr. Riehberg had undertaken to try to work out a modus nieendi on this absolutely vital point . his not worked out . It is a stark conflict of essential principle . It must lie composed in one way or another . As things have turned out , the following paragraph was also important : " Application of the foregoing recommendation would shortly make superfluous the present Administrator , who will always be at your disposal in any capacity , important or otherwise , as long as this emergency lasts , but who feels that the task of pioneering this great experiment is about over and that a different form of organization and method is more appropriate for the future problem . " On July second , the President wrote me one of the kindest notes a man could receive from another , telling me that be and I and some others had been too close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quite specific that I should . go away for a month and not come back unless it should prove absolutely necessary . He said that he wanted me to get in racing trim to carry on with him to the close . I was very much affected by that and made up my mind that , in spite of all my apprehensions about staying away too long from NRA , I would remain for a month , as he wished , regardless of anything else  --  and because he so evidently did wish it . I left Washington on July eleventh , intending a leisurely trip with only a few speaking engagements . It was fearfully hot . We did . not fly high enough , got our engine overheated and had to go back from a point halfway between Laramie and Omaha . It was at the height of the great drought . I had often flown over the Mississippi Basin , but I had never seen it like this . The seared checkerboard of ruined fields and the yellow and white sandy ribbons of such parched streams as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , disclosed the distress of the whole shriveled valley . At Waterloo , Iowa , I made a speech and adverted to the Hitler massacre with horror . I had seen the results of Villa 's summary executions in Mexico , and I linked the two together . This , I understood , caused two diplomatic protests . After three days we picked up the snow top of Mount Hood , one hundred and fifty miles away , and finally came down at Portland . The Walk.Out on the Coast That is where I got my first sight of the general strike on the Pacific Coast , but was determined to have no more to do with strikes . I made a speech at Portland commending settlement to the President 's Longshoremen 's Board , and left there hoping to renew acquaintance with many old friends in San Francisco and not - to do anything else . Though I did not then suspect it , events at San Francisco , all of which have been previously related , were really the beginning of the end of NRA . I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general strike . I thought I was serving the interests of the whole administration and , as I have related , did nothing at all until I had communicated with both the White House and Madam Secretary Perkins . After settlement was under way , I was shown a newspaper clipping of several days before indicating that the Secretary had declined to comment on the strike except to say that the general strikers were just " bad boys . " William Green , of the A. F. of L. , had condemned the strike vigorously . So , of course , had I. But even this little crossing of wires had not indicated to me then that I was doing any thing objectionable toMadam Secretary , because I thought she and I were such good friends that she would have told me in that ease . I made a speech at Los Angeles , and I put my neck out again there , because  --  though making it very clear that I was speaking for myself alone , and had no connection whatever with the political end of the administration  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger  --  Mr. Sinclair , The Stockyards Strike I had to fly immediately back to San Francisco to see about final reference of the longshoremen 's dispute to the President 's Board . The whole incident of the general strike had taken up so much time , and an engagement to speak at Chicago was now so near , that the plan to rendezvous my scattered family in the Colorado Rockies did not seem very promising . I went to San Diego and Tia Juana and Ensenada , where I spent the time fishing and getting some real rest and exercise . From there I went to Okmulgee , Oklahoma , to visit my mother , and , on August second , arrived at Chicago to make a speech . The settlement of the Stockyards strike was literally forced on me , as has been earlier related . But that , too , apparently stirred up and kept the home fires burning , as I was later to learn . I had had only about ten days ' vacation in my month 's absence from Washington , and I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach at Bethany , where almost absolute se-elusion is possible . There was serious illness in my family , and this time I could let nothing interfere with a real vacation . While I was planning it , I began to get some idea of what was happening in and about NRA . Somebody had spread a rumor that the whole policy was going to be changed and its entire personnel recast . Just at that time the press began to be filled with a variety of the most disturbing kind of conjecture and comment . In the usual anonymous and impalpable fashion , it was intimated to me that the sources of all this would be found somewhere in Government itself  --  trial balloons . I could not put my fingers on the center of infection , but the symptoms were unmistakable  --  the morale of NRA was literally shattered . Action slowed , died down and almost ceased . Mr. Riehberg came to me just before I went away and practically demanded that I set up the board I had mentioned in my memorandum of June 26 , 1934 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him that I had not yet selected the board and would not recommend one until I had . He still insisted that I constitute a board out of some of my staff , and when I said rather abruptly that I would not , he replied ; You will get a lot of resignations of your principal officials at once if you do n't . " I laughed and left him , but it gave me something to think about . I did not appoint that board and there were no resignations . At this point it is appropriate to say that he knew next to nothing about administrative problems in ( ContInu  --  d /rpm Par . 70 ) NRA outside of its legal aspect and the Stool Code . He is responsible for neither the mistakes nor the accomplishments of NRA . Now , 1 have seen my work kicked over and been licked lots of times in my life in lusty combat in the light of day , and I think the record will show that I never winced or cried aloud . But no issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one ever came to grips on any point except such things as whether a particular department should be classified by the Budget Bureau as all others were , whether I should give instructions through one channel or another , and where this or that official should sit on the platform at the April roundup for criticism , when the President was to speak . The Newspaper Barrage In this other field I am not even competent to fight . I think an official should give loyalty to those who work at his direction , and I assume it in everybody close to me , to the extent that I could n't even allow my own people to talk to me confidentially against one of their associates . Some of them began to try that late in 1933 . Because of these activities , NRA was frustrated and stalled during my absence  --  indeed , from early August . It was stalled and it is still stalled . As stated earlier , from about August 18th to about September 10 , 1934 , I was absent from Washington , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind that 1 would not even read the newspapers . I was trying to get a complete rest . I had been told that during that period a perfect newspaper barrage of apparently inspired statements was laid down , but never until today  --  November 15 , 1934 ? did I check up this report by reading the newspaper files of those weeks . It would resolve anybody 's doubts to read them . The burden of that whole publicity , repeated day after day , was that during my absence Madam Secretary and Mr. Richberg were bombarding the President with plans of reorganization of NRA drawn up by them , which would put NRA under controls unsympathetic with what had been done and would face the policy of NRA squarely about . In other words , my plan of reorganization was intended to make NRA effective in its new phase . Their plan , according to the press , was to scrap the old NRA and start a new one . Now not one word of this was said to me by anybody . No plan of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even directly quoted later as saying that he had never been in disagreement with me on policy , and I repeatedly said that I knew of no disagreement . Madam Secretary had never suggested any change of policy or method to me . I know , from the President 's frank talks with me , that he had no such plans . Of course , that kind of publicity was more than enough not only to demoralize the NRA organization itself but to kill the co-operation of business with NRA and the confidence of the public in NRA  --  all of which it duly and effectively did . If , after a year of such effort and accomplishment as NRA had shown , I needed any justification for making these developments clear herein , the facts and circumstances are ample . The public is not interested in these personal squabbles but it has a vital stake in N RA . As I have said in my first article , I regard NRA as a holy thing . I think it did more for millions of desperate people than all other emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social and economic experiment as  --  once failing  --  can never be revived . I gave it everything a man can give without hope of reward or fear of consequence and with accurate and announced prevision of exactly what it would do to me . I have not a single complaint of the fulfillment of that prophecy . I have been amply rewarded by a glorious adventure . But if I were willing to defend NRA in the open , I had a right to have it attacked in the open . Whether its policy under me was right or wrong I do not know . I only know that whereas it lived and was indeed vibrant with life  --  now look at it . It was on August eighteenth , several days of ter his return from Hawaii , that I saw the President , although I had talked to him over the telephone . When I did see him I told him that , due to all the constant sniping , I thought it would be far better for him if wo should complete the reorganization at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target for attack  --  which did not concern me , but which was having a murderous effect on NRA , and , in part , on the whole Recovery Program . I had become a sort of Arnold von Winkelried . I had expected that and it had its advantages . I was the person in the administration best fitted to take it because I had no political possibilities , but now that I was convinced that this and other things had practically stopped NRA , it seemed clear that further continuation would do more harm than good . Also my own personal situation had reached a point where it seemed impossible to continue . The President did not agree . He said very flatteringly : " I need you and the country needs you , " He insisted that I stay until NRA organization was complete . I told him that the uncertainty that had been created in NRA during my absence required some kind of decision to be made at once to preserve a shattered morale , that the newspapermen were waiting for me , and that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said to tell them I was to stay right where I was . The press reported that he had said practically the same thing to newsmen . I went out , to be swarmed over by newspapermen , who seemed to know more about what was going on than I did . The reporters had but one question : " Are you going out ? " I said : " I guess my feet are nailed to the floor for the present . I am not going to resign now . " NRA Resurrection That news reached NRA before I did . If there were any principal officials who were ready to resign if I did not at once abdicate to a board to be set up , presumably , by Mr. Rich berg , I do not know who they were . When I got back to my office after the press announcement that I was to remain for the present and until we could complete reorganization , I found it full of NRA officials . The whole organization seemed to return to life . Before that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lilies . I confirmed that feeling by a large number of short interviews with principal divisional administrators , who told me of the condition of uncertainty that had been created in my absence . I began vigorously to plan a series of important moves to restore the morale which had so obviously been shattered . I went to the White Howie again on Monday , as I had been requested . To my surprise , I found Mr. Richberg and Madam Secretary there ahead of me . I feel justified in relating the details of that conference also , because somebody leaked that , too , and the principal points were recited , however inaccurately , in news stories at the time . I knew intuitively what was coming , The President spoke to me pleasantly and then , using the exact words of June 16 , 1933 , said : " I am going to explode a bombshell . " He proposed that I go abroad with a commission  --  B. M. Baruch , Gerard Swope  --  anybody I wanted to take , to study recovery in European countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would happen to NRA , and he said that was a detail . I replied : " Mr. President , of course there is nothing for me to do but resign immediately . " I did not protest . I did not argue for any other conclusion . I did not complain . Madam Secretary instantly protested that and added that I must be given full credit for the work I had done . I said : " You can neither give nor take credit from me . " I had set up a small committee to act temporarily on policy while I was at Bethany , among them Alvin Brown . Mr. Rich-berg immediately , attacked it . " Pulling and Hauling** The President said that I did not realize the importance of what he wanted me to do and referred  --  rather wearily , I thought  --  to " all this pulling and hauling " and to the constant publicity about it . They , and not I , were responsible for the " pulling and hauling " and I certainly was not responsible for the attendant publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I instantly concluded that the only possible removal from him of this bickering burden was for me to resign , and do it quickly . It was the only thought I bad just then . It was conspicuously apparent that NRA had become such a bone of contention , such a center of attack , such a source of official disharmony , that both it and I bad been made a burden rather than a benefit to the President . There was no tenable consideration for me but to remove myself , as I had repeatedly publicly promised to do whenever I thought that any such situation had arrived . Beyond peradventure of doubt , it had arrived now , Pulling and hauling ! " ? nobecly will ever know how much of it goes on around that devoted desk . I had scrupulously avoided it . I had endeavored to avoid making issues because it seemed to me to he a cruel disservice to bring there one single thing that could possibly be diverted . It is clear to me now that I did not make issues enough . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true picture was not presented to him . There were insurmountable personal reasons why I could not go abroad  --  reasons which I had confided both to Mr. Richberg and the President . There seemed , to me , absolutely no course but to resign . Yet the whole incident had happened so suddenly and with so little warning  --  no warning at all  --  and was such a reversal of our previous talk , that I realized the need to be alone for a little while and asked for that consideration . I told the President that I would have to think the situation over and perhaps consult some friends . Everybody stood up . I left the room , supposing the interview to be at an end . Mr. Richberg and Madam Secretary remained . That was reported by the press as my " stamping out " of the President 's office . With my West Point and Army training , I simply could not do such a thing . It did not occur to me at any moment of that interview , and it has not occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never criticized or said or done a disrespectful thing toward him . I will go a step further and say that I have never even had a disloyal or disrespectful thought toward him , much less taken that kind of action . It is not unusual for a few people in a conference to remain for postmortems with the chairman or chief  --  and it has always seemed to me to be wrong . I do n't like to have it done in my own conferences , and I have never done it myself . If there is anything to say affecting other conferees , it should be said in their presence . If not , the time of a busy executive should not be consumed by taking advantage of such an occasion . Furthermore , it will be remembered that these two were in conference before I arrived , and , considering the nature of the talk after I came , it did not seem proper for me , at least , to hang around after it was over . I have never suffered more than I did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation and in writing it . I consulted nobody and confided in nobody . / tried to call my best friend , Bernie Baruch , in Prague , but could not reach him . Suddenly it became crystal-clear to me that there was nothing in the situation to consult anybody about . It was open and shut . How could I ever again expect to protect NRA organization , policy or morale under the title of Administrator , but with Mr. Richberg in opposition in a position of real control for which I had suggested him and to which I had done everything in my power to make him available ? Madam Secretary and I had apparently never agreed on my view that labor tribunals should not be influenced by the Labor Department , and , with stronger reason , I could not agree that the Labor Department should control NRA also . Both of these officials had just demonstrated an ability to change the situation of NRA without according me a hearing or raising with me a single point for discussion . The Story of a Letter Somebody else might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it had passed beyond my power , NRA was very dear to me , but , after all , it was not my property . It was just one element in a Federal mosaic for which the President , and not I , was responsible . It was better for him and better for the whole enterprise for me to erase myself . It must be very clear that the only other conceivable alternative would have been for me to raise a great issue that might and probably would have created nothing but further dissension and a greater impasse . Several people have been accused of advising my course of action thatnight . It is not true . I cleared my office of even my confidential secretary and locked the door , I was alone for several hours until that letter was written . A purported account of that letter reached the press through some channel which I have vainly tried to identify . It was published in an Associated Press dispatch . It recited the substance of portions of the manuscript but not all of it . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen my carbon , which I did not send to the files . That letter contained some purely personal matter growing out of close and affectionate relations . Relating to this narrator , it recited the circumstances of my taking my job , of the organization of NRA , of its divorce from PWA , of the facts exactly as related in this article which had compelled me to the conclusion that I must go at once , and especially a narrative of the afternoon 's conversation precisely as stated here . My letter went over to the White House at about ten o'clock on the night of the day of the events related . An answer came back within an hour  --  an answer so affectionate , kind , considerate , understanding and long-suffering that I felt lower and more ashamed of myself than ever . Abraham Lincoln never wrote a more human and beautiful letter . If I had been the President , I would probably have boxed my ears and written " finis " to the tale . It asked me to see him again and to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Lynch  --  a classmate at West Point  --  in charge of NRA and returned to Bethany Beach . Friday morning I flew back to Washington , where I stayed only long enough to see the President , who was shortly going to Hyde Park . Then I flew back to Bethany . In this interview the President asked me to work on a plan for NRA reorganization in more detail , bring it up to Hyde Park when it should be ready , and in the meantime to let him run NRA so that he could see at firsthand what its problems were . I went off and tried faithfully to do this . Of course , there were things in my own office that I wanted , and also the question of the extension of the Automobile Code came up  --  which I knew neither Pat Lynch nor anybody but myself could handle , on account of its history and background . I found that Lynch would n't talk to me over the telephone . I learned later that Blackwell Smith ? Mr. Riehberg 's NRA assistant  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it had ever been doubtful , it was then perfectly clear that the policy and form of NRA were out of my hands . From that time on , I was practically hermetically barred from action toward reorganization in NRA  --  although I was still nominally Administrator . That was wrong . I was wholly and personally responsible for NRA up to the time when I finally insisted on leaving . I had tried my best to go . I had a right and the public had a right either to my responsibility or my elimination . Except for a few days after my return from Bethany , and because of Lynch 's peculiarly difficult situation , NRA was practically paralyzed again , and from that time forth for weeks , which , in addition to the paralysis of morale which occurred during my earlier absence , meant that for nearly three months NRA had been comatose  --  and it is comatose still . About the tenth of September I went to Hyde Park with the NRA reorganization plan which I had been requested by the President to submit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again next morning . It was a meeting altogether affectionate and pleasant . I think that we were never closer in heart and mind in all our association than we were that last night that we spent together . There is no more question in my mind about the President 's personal feeling about me than there is of my feeling about him . Neither is there any question of our substantial agreement about NRA . It is just that it does not lie among human possibilities to keep intimate contact with so many snarls as confront that job . I had been remiss in not going oftener to see him . But others camped on his doorstep and doubtless painted for him a picture of NRA which by this time it seemed hopeless to refute . A Letter to the President The plan of reorganization of NRA which I submitted to him at Hyde Park has been stated with partial accuracy and discussed at length in public prints . When I got back to Washington from Bethany about September fifteenth , and saw the new and far more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been plunged by the events which I have related , it became overwhelmingly evident to me either that I must now make an outright issue that would be embarrassing to the whole administration  --  and to nothing more than to NRA itself  --  or else I must remove myself entirely . The latter seemed to me to be the only manly course . I accordingly wrote the President on September twenty-fourth , as follows : " NEW YORK CITY , " September 24 , 1934 . " THE PRESIDENT , " HYDE PARK , N. Y. " Dear Mr. President : The reorganization of NRA which has been the subject of so many conferences and memoranda between us , is becoming momentarily more urgent . We are in agreement upon the general form of reorganization and I do hope you will now also see eye to eye with me on the subject of my resigning from a job which as reorganizated seems altogether superfluous . Added to this are private considerations which are becoming more and more poignant . I therefore urge again your acceptance of my resignation . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it unnecessary to say that you will continue to have my loyalty and , when circumstances permit , my services in the new duties you have in mind . " While I feel that my executive responsibility should cease at once , may I suggest that this resignation be effective October 15 , in order to give me time to make such study of records as will enable me to make my final report . " Sincerely , " Since this correspondence has been made public , I feel justified in including the text of the President 's reply : " HYDE PARK , N. Y. , " September 25 , 1934 . " Dear Hugh : It is because you and I have felt for some time that NRA has fulfilled its first phase and calls for revision of its organization , that I am accepting your resignation , to take effect October fifteenth , as you suggest , in order that you may study the records preliminary to the making of your final report . " I repeat what I have so often said to you  --  that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that in a time of great stress and fear your courage , enthusiasm and energy were a very potent factor in restarting a stalled machine . More than that , it will always be remembered that under you the NRA , in only a little over a year , accomplished long overdue reforms in our social and business structures . The elimination of child labor , the recognition of the principles of a fair wage and of collective bargaining , and the first efforts to eliminate unfair practices within business  --  these among many others are chalked up to your credit . " I hope much that during these next few months you will get a thoroughly deserved rest , and that then you will be able to help me further in new duties and new tasks of public service . " I shall see you in Washington very soon . Faithfully yours , " /s/ FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT . " HON. HUGH S. JOHNSON , " NATIONAL RECOVERY ADMINISTRA-TION , " WASHINGTON , D. C. " There is the whole record . There have been many deliberate if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let out " on account of some personal shortcoming , some open breach of policy , some clear-cut issue , some failure to do my job . To take the last one first , I think I can stand on the record . On June 16 , 1933 , the whole commercial and industrial pattern of the United States was unorganized . It was just a congeries of millions of separate units  --  like a quart of sea sand . On that date the Congress gave NRA a mandate to assemble and compact them into a cohesive and interrelated system , like a brick . But the plan for doing this , the organization or machine to accomplish it , the leadership to secure voluntary action and public support were without form and void  --  not a scratch of a pen on paper , except our own anticipatory effort and the President 's general directive of June 16 , 1933 . The End of a Task One year later that part of the task assigned to NRA was practically done . I have tried to narrate here the record of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not tell it half so well as the President 's gracious half page , just quoted . If anybody can show me anywhere in all the record one instance of self-seeking , of grasping for power , of interfering with others , of disloyalty , of furtive scheming for personal advancement or of any act or purpose , save to do the task assigned , I will cancel my own defense . As to the general policy of NRA , that was laid down in the President 's directive of June 16 , 1933 . I stand on that . I never departed from it . I am a soldier and those were my marching orders . Not only were they never changed , they were never even debated by anybody after they were issued . The NRA job was done as it had been laid out . The kind of thing related in this chapter indicates some of the difficulties . Whatever may be thought // of errors , it surely can not be said that the work was not done . As to personal shortcomings and ineptitude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I have them by the score . I do not approve of me at all . I am a I sort of Jack-of-all-trades and master of none  --  impulsive and full of sins and bad habits  --  to all of which " Peccavi I Peccavi I " But so long as among them are not ' charged laziness , crookedness , disloyalty , self-seeking , inaction , incompetence , inattention or dereliction of duty , I do n't just know what they have to do with the construction and accomplishment of NRA , Perhaps the answer to all this may be found in what has happened since control of NRA passed into other hands . 1 was told that a certain very competent official could not be utilized in an important position because " they will say he is a Johnson man . " It has also been circumstantially stated to me that the Blue Eagle must die because as long as it flies " it stands for Johnson . " It is one thing  --  and a thing very necessary to concerted action  --  for a newly elected or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to replace strangers by sympathizers . But this is not that case . There is hardly one of the present NRA Administration that I did not bring there . There is not one of them that did not serve side by side with me , professing loyalty and agreement . No issue on which I left was ever made . It was never intimated to me that they were not all " Johnson men . " Contrary Opinions Sought Johnson was nothing but a figure representing NRA and if any there were not Johnson men , in that . sense , how could they in conscience serve at all ? I supported every associate of mine to the limit . If any did not agree with what was done after a decision had been made , there was always a clear course . Repeatedly at staff meetings I urged and demanded robust adherence by every man to his ovirripointof view , whether I agreed or not . Time after time I brought men into NRA not because they agreed with me , but because they did n't . I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon Henderson and Tom Hammond . Bothproved to be as loyal and true as men can he , and both stood manfully to their contrary opinions . I hardly think that anybody could have attended our NRA farewell meeting and believed there were many there who were not loyal . I know there were not many . It may he that the whole NRA idea was wrong . If it was , it ought to be discarded . But if it was not , it ought to be supported . If it is to be retained , I fear for its future . I fear because little is being done to support the Blue Eagle , and without the Eagle NRA can not survive . I fear because Code administration is not vigorous , and the Code Authorities have to have action and decision to continue . I fear because I think NRA depends wholly on public support , and NRA must continue its goldfish-bowl policy or die . I fear because control has been unbalanced , and NRA must remain impartial or perish . Finally , I fear because every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinions of groups who have opposed NRA from the beginning . Take from NRA public support and confidence , control against cutthroat competition , enforcement of Code provisions  --  especially of unfair trade practices and labor safeguards  --  and it will not last six months . That , I fear , is exactly what is happening , and it does not lie within my repressive powers to suffer this in silence . Upon the publication of my resignation , thousands of letters and telegrams came to me from all parts of the country , and I am told a large number were received at the White House . Some of the principal members of the organization and employees came to me to say that they were going to resign . George Buckley , George Berry and Ed McCrady did resign , in spite of all I could do or say to dissuade them . All kinds of threats and rumors of defection in Code Authorities and immediate withdrawal of Codes came to me . Some labor leaders had said they were through with NRA . I had intended to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about NRA . But these threatening circumstances required something of me . I thought highly of the whole board . They had all served with me . Upon whatever has happened to NRA and in respect of all I fear for it , I am sure that they have little choice . They have been uniformly kind and courteous to me . At that critical time for them , the important thing  --  as it seemed to me  --  was to keep the NRA organization together and efficient , and to retain the support of it by both labor and industry ; so I did all I could to sidetrack the condemnatory resolutions and to prevent withdrawal of Codes and resignations of officials . It was for this reason that on October first I announced that I wanted to say good-by to the people who had worked with me so devotedly . They crowded the large auditorium of the Department of Commerce and all the corridors . The National and Columbia Broadcasting Systems had coupled their national hook-ups . It was pretty hard to stand there and look down at hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any departmental organization ever worked before . To most employees NRA was not a Government bureau  --  it was a Crusade . My Farewell to NRA There were people there  --  just clerks and messengers  --  who , to my knowledge , had worked as hard as I had , who , regardless of our night shifts , had to be driven away from their desks because they thought , as I did , that they were doing something not only to relieve present distress but to improve the lot of working people in this country forever . It just tore at my vitals to think of being separated from them and to have to give up a place in the ranks of such an army . I thought of them as my own kind of people , and it was hard even to begin to speak . That speech . which I think is familiar to most people , was delivered as written , up to the last few lines -- the Mosaic blessing : " The Lord bless thee and keep thee , " etc . Then my attention was diverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but . which  --  in the little pause that I made to look around  --  was unmistakable . People were sobbing audibly , and when I looked down at the first four rows , which I could see clearly , they all seemed to be weeping . I had n't counted on that . The papers said I wept . I did n't  --  as a snapshot taken at the moment shows . But I could n't go on with the beautiful Mosaic benedietion  --  my voice just choked , and all I could say was : " God bless you . "
