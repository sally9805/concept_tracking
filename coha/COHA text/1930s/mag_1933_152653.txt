In Haiti ; in East St. Louis <P> Anti-occupationists in Haiti could smile wryly at the U. S. Government 's discomfiture last week . For months rumors had seeped through the steaming black republic that crookedness was being investigated in the U. S.-controlled customs house at Port-au-Prince . <P> Three weeks ago the Brothers Zrike , rich Syrian-American merchants , were clapped into jail for participating in customs frauds . Their stores throughout the island were locked up under Government seal . But what , the opposition Press wanted to know , was to be done about their accomplices ? Was there one law for Haitians , another for Yanquis ? Last week U. S. prestige definitely fell when Collector of Customs David P. Johnson of Hyde Park , Mass. , an efficient , frugal man who had been stationed in Haiti twelve years , confessed to cheating Haiti in return for bribes from the Brothers Zrike . <P> Two days later U. S. prestige recovered a bit when the State Department announced that " the fraud consisted in underweighing bales of merchandise consigned to the importers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunity as a treaty official , turn him over to the Haitian courts for trial . <P> East St. Louis , Ill. , is St. Louis ' Hoboken , a riveredge district thick with foundries , chemical plants , railroad yards . Many mules are sold there and , periodically , there is a scandal . Last week 's scandal concerned Addison J. Throop , an elderly printer and collector of Indian relics who became chairman of the St. Clair County Board of Tax Review in 1928 " when Alfred E. Smith had a great following and I was elected by a fluke . " <P> Through a " reputable professional man , " the vigilant St. Louis Post-Dispatch got hold of a letter which indicated that Tax Reviewer Throop had taken bribes to scale down assessments for certain East St. Louis manufacturers . Docile Mr. Throop , while denying the authenticity of the letter , consented at once to accompany a reporter to Springfield , where he resigned his office and confessed all to the Attorney General . Only the case of the local Elks ' Club , whose tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . Investigation of others was promptly instituted . <P> An unnamed lawyer was the man who first tempted him . Mr. Throop confessed . The lawyer offered a $5,000 bribe in behalf of a tax-burdened firm . " I refused even to touch it , " said Mr. Throop . " After that he began to cultivate me . He was very nice and subsequently he took me out several times in a motorboat . Later I took $1,500 from him . "
