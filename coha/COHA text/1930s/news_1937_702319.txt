txt Accounts reaching Paris regarding German infiltration into Spanish Morocco present the situation somewhat as follows : Soon after the outbreak of the Spanish civil war twenty German officers replaced Spanish officers in the direction of native affairs in Morocco , of police and of civilian control . Other officers who arrived later are living in the Ceuta fortress . There is evidence of the increasing authority in Moroccan affairs of these German " volunteers " who have taken the places of officers who went to Spain with General Francisco Franco 's army . The head of this small contingent of experts seems to be Commandant Frauler of the cruiser Wolf , who recently made a long trip along the Riff frontier between Spanish and French Morocco and made a thorough examination of strategic points . A German engineer general is said also to be at Tetuan . Following these pioneers another contingent of twenty-five officers arrived a few weeks ago in Portuguese airplanes . Almost simultaneously there arrived 1,500 German " volunteers " for the Spanish Foreign Legion to replace legionnaires who had gone to fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish Foreign Legion , and technically it is admitted that the German claim that the only German troops in Morocco are Foreign Legionnaires is probably correct . The chief complaint is that 1,500 men with twenty-five officers constitute an excessive contingent . There is a report , too , that another 1,500 Germans debarked at Melilla , Spanish Morocco , Jan. 6 , but this is not positively confirmed and may be due- to confusion . In. addition- to these officers and men , a party of civilians said ' Lbtotal about 300 , arrived recently . " They have become very active in winning the good-will of the natives . Some of their number have organized a Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca under extremely advantageous conditions . Others seem to be acting as bankers for natives on extremely generous terms . More have taken the places of Spaniards in direction and working in the mines under the direction of a German named Langenheim . As yet- no reply has been received to the French warning , but the press ' here today is filled with reports of international action in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge that German officers quartered in the Ceuta barracks were taking an active part in the direction and strengthening of the fortifications of that port , and that large shipments of German guns and other war materials were arriving . Among other things being done is the enlargement of the Tetuan air field , which seems unnecessary at this moment , when General Franco 's forces might be expected to be devoting all their strength to the conquest of Madrid . In the Dar Riffin district , where the Spanish Foreign Legion is quartered , there has also been reported a great deal of activity in the way of reorganization since these 1,500 volunteers for the Legion arrived . It is to be noted that German protests against French reports do not deny the arrival of a certain number of " technicians " and " some troops sent there to protect these technicians and incorporated in the Legion . " Under the Franco-Spanish conventions of 1904 and 1912 , Spain engaged not to appeal to any foreign power to maintain her authority in Morocco and not to alienate or cede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territory composing the Spanish zone of influence in the Empire . Denial by Spanish Chief CASABLANCA , French Morocco , Jan. 10 ** Commissioner Beigbeder ' of Spanish Morocco declared flatly in a telephone interview today there were no foreign troops in his territory . Speaking from Tetuan , be denounced reports of German troop arrivals as " an odious Marxist manoeuvre  --  both Spanish and Russian ? intended to poison the international situation . " Commissioner Beigbeder , who was formerly Spanish military attach ? hi Berlin , continued : " You can declare no soldier , German , Italian or even Japanese ? for they will soon invent news of a Japanese landing  --  has crossed our frontiers . " Concerning the charge that fortifications are being constructed in Ceuta in violation di treaties , he said : " I am distressed by that report . It is not true . Moreover , you can easily see for yourself . There are no restrictions in the Spanish zone against a visit by members of the international press . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
