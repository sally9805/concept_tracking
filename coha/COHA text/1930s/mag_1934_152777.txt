Cowardly Slur Sirs : <P> As one of those obscure citizens who believes the minority is often right , permit me to thank you for your clear , fair and newsworthy article on the William Jennings Bryan University and its first graduating class TIME , June 25 . Mr. Bryan was an ordained elder in our Presbyterian Church U.S.A. and although he was hopelessly outvoted by a church which is fast slipping into Modernism and Apostasy , he was never afraid to inform the church of her danger , and in the face of ridicule and hostility , his superb moral courage showed that he feared God more than he feared man . The last cowardly slur with which an ungrateful America besmirched his memory was the canard that he died from overeating . Mr. Bryan was crucified by a loose-moraled Christian citizenship and a false religious leadership . <P> JOHN R. STEVENSON <P> Pastor <P> Grace Presbyterian Church San Francisco , Calif . <P> Rolling Chapels <P> Sirs : <P> I have read with interest your article entitled , " ST . PETER " under the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this article you say that ST . PETER and ST . PAUL ... are the only two chapel cars in U. S. railroading . I may say that The American Baptist Publication Society has been doing business with chapel cars on the railroad manned by a good preacher and his wife with well-equipped pulpit and auditorium and living quarters for 44 years . <P> Our first chapel car called " Chapel Car Evangel " was built in 1891 and used in new towns along the railroads in the West . In 1892 we built our second chapel car , " Emmanuel , " and sent it to the Pacific Coast . It was later brought back to Colorado for service . In 1894 we built our third chapel car , " Glad Tidings , " with money given by Mr. William Hills , of New York , in honor of his wife , and it operated in the Southwest . In 1895 we built our fourth chapel car , " Good-will , " given by Baptists in general who were inspired by the generosity of Mr. Hills and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built our fifth chapel car , " Messenger of Peace , " and it has operated in Oregon for many years . In 1900 we built our sixth chapel car , " Herald of Hope , " the gift of Baptist young men of the country . <P> In 1917 we built our seventh chapel car , " Grace , " given by Mr. and Mrs. Conaway of Los Angeles , Calif. , in memory of a departed daughter and it was set at work in Wyoming . This last car was built at a cost of $25,000 . The other cars cost somewhat less . . . . <P> Our chapel cars are not as active now as they were in the years of rapidly developing frontiers . New towns are not now springing up along new railroads , hence some of our cars have been given to churches and built into permanent meeting houses . . . . <P> OWEN C. BROWN <P> Executive Secretary <P> The American Baptist Publication Society <P> Philadelphia , Pa . <P> Sirs : <P> I have been wondering whether many alumni and students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ind. ) will not write to correct your statement in the June 25 issue under Religion , article " ST . PETER . " . . . <P> They will know that the University has maintained a chapel car for the use of its football teams on their travels for many years , to the best of my knowledge since 1923 . . . . <P> WILLIAM C.
