txt The S. S. President Harrison has arrived with three consignments of gold bars from Bombay . aggregating $1,625,000 in value . Of this amount . National City Bank received 26 boxes . valued at $650,000 ; French American Banking Corp . 26 boxes containing $630,000 , and Chase National Bank 14 boxes valued at $345,000 . This is the largest shipment which New York has received from that country since early January . Gold has been moving out of India regularly since the suspension of the gold standard by England a year ago , but because of the persistent weakness in dollar exchange up to early this summer little of the metal has actually come here , most of it being sold in London for Continental account . Position of the exchanges has noW changed to such an extent that New York can go directly to Bombay to buy the metal rather than being forced to bid against the Continent in London . An even larger shipment is now on the water . Last Saturday , $5,900,000 gold left India , of which about $3,125,000 is consigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be en k route , although exact details have not yet been received . Foreign exchange circles believe that in the coming months New York will receive considerable amounts of metal from India . It is said that the only factor which would slow down the efflux is a rapid appreciation in sterling exchange , which is not looked for . Foreign exchange circles claim that much of the significance of the India gold movement has been overlooked in New York , largely because so little of the metal has actually come to this center . In the past year , India , traditionally a large importer of gold , has exported approximately $300,000,000 to the Western World , an amount greater than the annual production of the Rand mines , the world 's largest producers . When the movement first got under way , many estimates were made regarding the probable extent . All estimates appeared farfetched and some were even fanciful , but finally best authorities agreed that it was possible that $1 : - 000.000,000 could come . Now it is said that it the conditions leading up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is quite possible that such an amount may be added to the world 's gold reserves . Eventually , the receipts of Indian gold may have a profound effect upon credit and movements of world prices , it is said . The totally unexpected additions to the world 's monetary gold stock have been offset thus far because of the breakdown in the currency systems . There has been a world scramble for gold but the metal , which has been shunted back and forth in the last year , has not been alolwed to fulfill its normal credit functions . This condition will be alleviated , it is said , when the restrictive artificial control of the foreign exchanges is gradually lifted , permitting a freer flow of investment capital from one country to another . In the meantime the world 's potential credit base is being enlarged through receipts of the hitherto " lost " Indian gold at the rate of approximately $5,000,000 a week , thus making larger every week the amount of credit which will be available when more normal business conditions prevail .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
