Recuperating from an appendectomy at the age of 19 , Linnea Fransson of East Orange , N. J. was told by the doctor to eat what she liked . What she liked was candy , lemonade , ginger ale . She ate nothing else . She left business school , retreated to her home , sucked lollipops to her heart 's content . When she began suffering from starvation , doctors at Orange Memorial Hospital tried in vain to give Linnea tube feedings and intravenous injections . For a while they persuaded her to eat an apple a day , and half a teaspoonful of raw , grated vegetables . But anything besides her candystore diet made her sick at her stomach . After ten years of living on sweets she weighed 66 lbs . <P> Last week Linnea stitched up two dresses for her sisters , sucked her last lollipop , quietly lay down and died . " Chronic malnutrition killed her , " said Dr. George Potts Olcott Jr. , Assistant Essex County Medical Examiner . " The autopsy performed showed no reason for starvation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> To psychiatrists , Linnea 's case was no puzzle . Anorexia nervosa ( hysterical lack of appetite ) often occurs in unstable women who are unconsciously afraid to grow up , and , according to Freudians , derive a childish sexual pleasure from finicky eating ( oral eroticism ) . Some , like Linnea , gorge themselves on childish foods , others retreat all the way back to the suckling stage , stubbornly take nothing but milk . From such disastrous whims , say doctors , few recover .
