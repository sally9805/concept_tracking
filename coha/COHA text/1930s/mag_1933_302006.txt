The U.S. Treasury was overflowing with ready cash last week when the Government completed its Aug. 15 refinancing operations . On that date it had sold $1,188,901,650 worth of U.S. securities- $835,036,650 in 3% bonds and $353,865,000 in 1 ? % Treasury notes . The bond issue was announced for only $500,000,000 ( TIME , Aug. 14 ) but this limit was greatly exceeded to accommodate an army of small investors whose subscriptions were allotted in full . After the Treasury had deducted its exchange of old securities for new , met a batch of maturing obligations and paid a small slice of interest on the Public Debt , it had a cash surplus of $489,755,150 on the day 's transaction . When this was dumped into the national till , the Treasury 's total cash balance amounted to $1,247,389,348-a peacetime record .
