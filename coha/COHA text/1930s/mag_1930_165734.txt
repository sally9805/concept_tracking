No whale boats interested Los Angeles last week , but tuna-fishing boats worth $250,000 were prepared for trial runs , and contracts calling for another $250,000 worth were signed . Plans were likewise drawn up for a super-tuna boat , to cost approximately $200,000 . It will contain freezing compartments capable of holding 600 tons of frozen tuna ; the boat will be able to cruise tropical waters for two months at a stretch .
