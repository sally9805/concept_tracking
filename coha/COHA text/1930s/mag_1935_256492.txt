Nearly every lawyer , broker , banker and businessman in the land last week was almost wholly preoccupied with the overthrow of NRA . Full implications of the Supreme Court 's decision were by no means clear , and while U. S. Business was more relieved than downright joyful , it was also jittery . Overnight , the stock-market greeted the return of business freedom with an opening rally , then dropped sharply , declined for the rest of the week . Uncertainty over the future of NRA and other New Deal legislation precipitated a general break in commodities . Wheat sank 5 per bu. to the lowest price this season , 81 . Cotton dropped under 11 per lb . Sugar lost most of its recent gains in the wildest trading in a decade , and Cuban sugar securities nose-dived on the fear that the island 's reciprocal trade pact might be annulled as an unconstitutional delegation of the Senate 's treaty-making powers . And with all codes and coercion swept from the U. S. Business structure , endless readjustments were obviously in order . What those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prime concern . <P> Some readjustments came swiftly-notably in cigarets , books and branded drugs , the retail price of which had been maintained by codes . Schulte Retail Stores promptly resumed the issuance of premium coupons and joined other big chains in cutting leading cigarets from 12 per pack to 11 . Macy 's , Gimbel 's and Bloomingdale 's , the three big Manhattan department stores whose legendary price vendettas are a merchandising tradition , were at it again as soon as their doors opened the morning after the Supreme Court 's decision . In one day 's skirmish cigarets at Macy 's dropped from $1.14 per carton to 64 - of which 60 represented the Federal tax . Edna Ferber 's Come and Get It sank from $2.50 per copy to $2.04 . Franz Werfel 's The Forty Days of Musa Dagh , a $3 volume , opened at $2.82 the first day , closed at $2.64 , plummeted to $1.83 before the weekend . Modern Library editions , usually retailed at 95 each , were quoted as low as 29 . <P> Other lines by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flared from Los Angeles to Boston last week were over " loss leaders " - popular items sold at a loss to pull in customers , a practice outlawed by the codes . Loss leader price wars are merely cheap advertising for big chain and department stores but they are often disastrous for small independent grocers , druggists or tobacconists , who count on fast-selling brands for a large part of their profits . And the little fellows , who objected so strenuously to NRA wages &; hours , were last week howling to the White House about " predatory price-cutting " and " cutthroat competition .
