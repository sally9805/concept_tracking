txt Gov . Joseph D. Ely today urged the Massachusetts Legislature to . pass the so-called deductible automobile insurance bill which would make careless motorists pay the second $100 in damage claims out of their own pocketbooks . Ina special message the Chief Executive told the legislators that the deductible plan was the only proposal before them that would enable the Insurance Commissioner to promulgate rates which would be as low or lower than the 1031 figures , Unless this plan is adopted in the short time the Legislature has left before closing its special session , the Ooveinoi declared that he Would be obliged to permit the Insurance Commissioner to put his proposed schedule of higher rates for 1032 into effect at once . For the Legislature to take it into its own hands to force the Insurance Commissioner to promulgate 1031 rates in 1032 , without any change in the policy of the law , would be without precedent , the Governor declared . Following preliminary remarks in which he called attention to the rapidity with which insurance proposals have been tossed out of the legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more progressive proposals , the deductible policy bill is the one which will furnish momentary relief , at least , from mounting insurance rates . Governor Ely called the plan a safety measure which , in effect , imposes n penalty upon the careless operator and allows the careful driver to take out insurance at slightly lower rates than those who are involved in accidents . Two kinds of compuismy policies have been proposed , he said ; first , n full policy under the present law , and , secondly , a deductible policy . Rates for both forms would be fixed by the commissioner , he said . Under provisions of the law , which would make it optional with motorists ns to which form they would choose , those who endeavor to be careful would be allowed to buy compulsory insurance that the State compels them to take out , at lower rates , while those who are careless under the deductible form , he pointed . out , would be compelled to contribute to damage costs . M a further explanation , the Governor said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilies under $100 , or 45 per cent of nil claims , would be eliminated .
