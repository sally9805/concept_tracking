For months , in corridors and cloakrooms , at cocktail parties and committee hearings , Washington has been talking about three " baskets . " These " baskets " were neither wicker containers nor scoring points in a game but Congressional slang for different sections of the new tax bill-each basket being designed to&gt; catch a certain type of taxpayer . Most discussed has been the " third basket , " for it carried the largest load of a pet Administration theory-the tax on undistributed profits . <P> In the proposed Revenue Act of 1938 , reported by the House Ways &; Means Committee last fortnight , the undistributed profits tax was retained more in principle than in fact . But the principle is about as popular with businessmen as was the Stamp Act of 1765 . Franklin Roosevelt in a strategic retreat last autumn intimated that the obnoxious levy might be modified-provided Congress could find a substitute method to make up for lost revenues . <P> With the able aid of Undersecretary of the Treasury Roswell Magill and what amounts to an increase in the normal corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modify the principle beyond recognition without loss of revenue . In the first basket all corporations earning $25,000 or less were exempted entirely from the undistributed profits tax . The second basket placed a trifling undistributed profits tax ( maximum : 4% ) on all other corporations- with certain exceptions . One exception was closely-held corporations making more than $75,000 . For this group-in the third basket-the surtax and income tax together would work out in most cases at less than the highest effective rate at present : 32.4% . But the third basket would catch relatively few corporations . <P> That even this face-saving ghost of the Administration 's pet tax project might well be further modified the Committee was well aware when it reported the bill . What it did not expect was that a 326 to 104 Democratic majority in the House would , especially in an election year , prove so much more responsive to the wishes of business than to the wishes of the Administration as to kill the third basket entirely . This last week was precisely what occurred . So eager was Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was willing to risk its dignity by attacking a ghost . <P> Having heard the Committee 's Chairman Robert Doughton say in defense of his bill that it might face Presidential veto if the third basket were removed , the House proceeded to cock an appreciative ear when Massachusetts ' John McCormack urged that it be removed anyway . When the matter was put to a vote , the House amazingly and resoundingly approved Mr. McCormack 's amendment-to empty the third basket by striking it out of the bill - by a vote of 165 to 126 . Disconcerted , Mr. Doughton asked for a teller count . This time , as more members appeared from the coat rooms , the vote was 180 to 124.
