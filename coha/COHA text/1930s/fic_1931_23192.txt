THE TIN VELASQUEZ A STORY BY PHILIP CURTISS W E ALL have our dreams , and Andy Payson had his . He liked to dream of a day  --  oh ! an utterly impossible day  --  when he could come down to breakfast and sip at his leisure through two , three , or as many cups of coffee as he wished . Then  --  still in the dream , of course  --  he would go out on the west piazza with a long , thin cigar and have the whole morning paper all to himself . While bees hummed in the garden and birds twittered in the ivy , he would follow the latest murder from Page One to Page Twenty-Four and then settle down to the fascinating leader headed " City Swelters Under Heat Wave , " Next , after the morning paper was finished .. . But what was the use of thinking beyond the impossible ? Even Cinderella 's dreams never went any farther than the golden slippers . Not but what Andy made diligent efforts to attain his dream . He was attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh summer morning , but just as he had allowed his eye to wander to a little " box " item entitled , " American Women Have Biggest Feet in World , Says Medical Authority , " he was aware that Molly , his wife , had come out on the piazza with an air of silent calculation that portended great events . " I 'm sorry to trouble you , dear , " she began , " Nut you know that we 've got to clear the whole piazza before ten o'clock and , first of all , we must have that hammock . " Andy placed his finger on his paper and looked up , like an eminent scholar who bad just discovered a new Greek gerundive . " Clear the piazza ? " he repeated . " What for ? " Molly rested her hands on her hips with an air of utter hopelessness . " Andy Payson , " she exclaimed , " I sometimes wonder whether your life and mine even touch at the outer corners . have you completely forgotten that this is the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy . He rose to his feet and , hardly had he done so , when Edwin , the colored butler , and Peale , the chauffeur , appeared on the piazza and , under Molly 's brisk direction , unhooked the hammock from the tent-shaped metal frame which supported it . Behind them came Miss Beedle , who had once been the children 's governess but now was that long-suffering and indispensable feminine personage that can always be found in the background of any large country house . In her arms Miss Beedle bore eight or ten new print frocks , with price tags and coat hangers , which at once she proceeded to hang in a row on the crossbar that had previously held the hammock . Even to Andy 's eyes the effect was startling . Already the piazza was quite an amazing imitation of Wanamaker 's . In the meantime Edwin and Peale had rolled up the rug and were moving the wicker furniture , but at last a look of compassion did come into Molly 's eye . " Sweetheart , " she suggested , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing and , to be perfectly frank , you would be more in the way than a help . Why do n't you go over to the club for lunch ? I 'm sure that the sale will be over by six o'clock . " " Well , if you do n't mind . . . " replied Andy . He turned to the screen door to enter the house , but Molly stopped him . " Oh , before you go , " she commanded , " just leave me that newspaper . There 's a little sports frock advertised by De Mar for twenty-three sixty , and I can show them exactly the identical thing for seventeen ninety-five . " Without his newspaper and , to tell the truth , without much of his heart , Andy sauntered down the gravel drive to the highway and down the highway to the pleasant little village of West Gosset . The idea of the country club was not appealing for , attractive as it might sound in theory , a small , village country club on a mid-week morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instinctively , Andy knew what he should find there : out on the links two stoutish ladies playing peckish golf ; down on the tennis courts half a dozen children hitting red balls and , in the clubhouse itself , nothing but a pale , lonely steward and a smell of varnish . With much better judgment , Andy 's leaden feet passed on through the village and out on the other side where , presently , they slowed down before an attractive , remodeled white farmhouse surrounded by equally spotless white paddocks and kennels . In front of the house was pacing back and forth a tall , handsome man with a very tanned face and smooth , iron-gray hair , who was smoking a short brier pipe . Someone had once described August Perrier as the perfect example of country gentleman and , as a matter of fact , his appearance was so distinguished that for one brief term he had actually been elected governor of the State , but the turmoil of public life had left no visible impression upon him and , for the greater part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing now  --  pace up and down and face life with an untroubled eye . At Andy 's dejected appearance the ex-governor took his pipe from his mouth , while little wrinkles of amusement appeared around his strong , sportsman 's lips . " Hello , " he greeted . " What in the world 's the matter with you ? " " If I were a drinking man .. . " began Andy . " But you are a drinking man , " replied Perrier . " Well , anyway , that 's not the trouble , " explained Andy . " It 's this damned drygoods business of Molly 's . " " So ? " answered Perrier . " Oh , it 's all very well for you to say so , ' " burst out Andy , morosely , " but how would you like it if every time you settled down for a little quiet thought on life and affairs the telephone would ring and some silly woman over in Lebanon would call up to say that the green charmeuse was ripped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ou the velvet organdy ? And now Molly 's having a fire sale or something ? great price slashing , regardless of consequences . I 'm even kicked out of my own house until six o'clock . " Perrier put his pipe back in his teeth and puffed thoughtfully . " Is that any worse , " he asked , " than having a perfect stranger come into your study and offer to buy your own desk right out from under your feet ? " Andy looked at him in perplexity . " What do you mean ? " THE TIN VELASQUEZ 5t5 " Young man , " replied Perrier firmly , " I do n't think that you keep your eyes open . Look here . " Taking Andy by the arm , he led him back into the road by which he had come . There , suspended from a fine old elm tree , like a tavern sign , was a white notice hoard with the words , HELEN PERRIER . ANTIQUES " Oh , good heavens ! " exclaimed Andy . " And I thought that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a little peace . " " Well , perhaps you will , for a few hours at least , " replied Perrier . " Helen 's gone clear to Barrington to look at a Sheraton fireback or something and after that she 's promised to stop in at Molly 's big clearance sale . " " I hope she gets stuck with a dozen bum dresses , " murmured Andy . " But what does she want of a fireback at this time of year ? " " Well , " replied Perrier , with a twinkle , " I think that she has very lively hopes of selling it to Molly . " Andy broke into a laugh . " Life is hell , is n't it ? " he suggested . " Completely , " agreed Perrier . With a common impulse they moved into the yard where three iron chairs with an iron tea table stood invitingly under a spruce tree ; but scarcely were they seated when a rattletrap car speeded into the drive , and out leaped Bob MacGregor . MacGregor was a landscape painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his appearance one would never have guessed it , for he always looked and acted much more like a garage keeper on a holiday . He was a big , bouncing man , with a shock of unruly hair and a booming voice . His idea of proper gents ' wear for the country was a pair of soiled khaki trousers and a black and white shirt , open at the neck , while he also had an unfortunate fondness for practical jokes . Indeed , as he now approached the disconsolate pair seated under the spruce tree , his air became mincing , and he held out a hand in languid , mock courtesy . " Ah , Mr. Payson , I believe . And , may I ask , are you any relation to the famous Madame Molly Payson , the great modiste ? " " Oh , shut up , " replied Andy , but it took more than that to quiet Bob MacGregor . He turned to Perrier . " I am looking , " he drawled , " for Mrs. Perrier , the well-known expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her secretary ? " As usual , Perrier never turned a hair . " Your name ? " he asked , promptly . " MacGregor is my name . Mac-Gregor . " " Oh , yes , " answered Perrier . " And are you any relation to Mrs. MacGregor , the big real estate agent ? " MacGregor burst into a roar but at the same time all his burlesque dropped from him . " Oh , come , " he exclaimed , " that 's not fair ! You and Andy are the landed gentry , the idle rich , and , if your wives want to amuse themselves selling needles and pins , that 's a proper subject for joking . But I am nothing but a poor , struggling artist , and when my wife goes out and in one morning brings in more money than I 've earned in six months , ( hats something that hurts . As a matter of fact , " concluded Bob , sinking into the third chair , " this feminine situation in West Gosset is getting serious . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , go ahead and talk about it , " replied Andy . " What is there to say ? " For a moment there was apparently nothing to say , and the three men sat in gloomy silence , but Bob MacGregor could not remain long repressed . With a widening grin he suddenly looked around the little circle . " Parasites ! " he mused . " That 's what we all are  --  nothing but parasites ? just male clinging vines ! " Even to this there seemed no disagreement , and MacGregor turned to Perrier , as the older man . " Look here , Gus , " he argued . " I 'm really serious . What 's the answer to all this business of every woman in America going suddenly to work ? " " They want the money , I guess , " broke in Andy , grimly . " Well , it is n't that that bothers me , " replied Bob . " What bothers me is the fact that they not only want the money but actually get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go broke to-morrow could you go down on Main Street and start a successful clothing store ? " " I could n't start a peanut stand , " admitted Andy . " But neither could you or Gus . " " There you are ! " exclaimed MacGregor . " Yet Molly has done it as easy as sneezing . Now take my case . As painters go , I think I can say that I am pretty successful , but for twenty years I had to scratch and struggle , learning a difficult trade . Until I was thirty I never earned more than eighteen hundred a year , and when I got a. thousand dollars for a single canvas I felt like Rockefeller  --  virtue rewarded and all that sort of stuff . Then what happens ? One pleasant evening , my good wife , Sylvia , the sheltered little darling , suddenly decides to go into the real estate business . She did n't know a lease from a quitciaira , but that did n't matter . Within a week she had sold the old Prentice place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars tucked into her stocking . Now how can I call myself the man of the family after that ? " Perrier laughed . " Has she sold another ? " " No , " confessed Bob , " but I 'm afraid she 's going to . She 's been purring around old Mrs. Todd for a month . " " Well , there 's your answer , " replied Perrier . " Where 's my answer ? " demanded MacGregor , while Andy also stirred with interest in his chair . With his usual deliberateness , August Perrier took his tobacco pouch from his pocket , blew into his pipe , then slowly filled it . " I will admit , " he began , " that you have raised a very interesting social question . But first , Bob , let me ask you something . You are a painter , but until this moment have you ever told me so ? " " What do you mean ? " demanded MacGregor . " I mean this , " explained Perrier . " I have blown you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time have you ever brought me one of your canvases ? Have you ever invited me down to your studio , filled me up with tea and good cigars , and then subtly wheedled me into buying a picture ? " " Of course not , " answered MacGregor , indignantly . " I 'm not that kind of a painter and I 'm not that kind of a man . " " Well , then , consider Andy , " continued the older man . " But by the grace of fate and his father 's steel business , Andy would probably have been a bond salesman . Now suppose that every time I asked Andy to dinner he immediately started in with the cocktails and tried to sell me a block of Westchester Fives . What would happen then ? " " He might sell you some bonds , right enough , " replied Bob , " but he would jolly well soon stop coming to dinner . " A sudden light came into his eye . " You mean , " he asked , " that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least not in social hours ? " " Precisely , " affirmed Perrier . " But when a woman goes into business the very first people she thinks of are her friends . And the funny part is that her friends do n't mind it either . Two women see no more reason why they should not swap jackknives over the soup than why they should not talk golf or bet or the races . When you come down to it , with whom have the women in this town done business except one another ? Molly sells dresses to Helen , Helen sells antiques to Sylvia and , sooner or later , I have no doubt that Sylvia will sell half the lakefront to Molly . " " Except , of course , " broke in Andy , with a grin , " that each one of them has some prize , wealthy sucker ? " " Whom she squeezes dry and then passes on to the others , " laughed MacGregor . " Good old Sylvia had no sooner unloaded the Prentice place on old Mrs. What's-her-name than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ripe to fill up the house with antiques . " " But what does it mean ? " suggested Andy . " Does it mean that the women are rotters or that we men are dumbbells ? " " I do n't know what it means , " replied Perrier , seriously . " It may very well mean that the feminine code of business ethics is the modern , sound one and that our own code is old-fashioned and ridiculous . For , after all , if one is going to be in business at all , one might as well be in it heart and soul , every minute of the day and night . That 's what the immigrants do and get rich . And women , in a way , are immigrants in business . They have no traditions , no code to bother them . " MacGregor leaped up with a sudden grin . " By Jove ! " he exclaimed . " That 's an idea ! " He turned abruptly to his host , launching his shoulders and waving his arms in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meester Perrier . Vould n't you like to buy a nice leetle picture ? " Perrier laughed . " I do n't know that I would n't . Provided , of course , that you are interested in a secondhand station wagon . " Five or six days later , Molly Payson , returning home about tea-time , was instantly conscious that something unusual was happening in her husband 's smoking room . Going to the door , she looked in , then stepped back aghast , for , in the middle of the room stood Andy , gazing up in rapture , while in the wall space over the mantel there hung what was probably the most terrible object ever created by the hand of man . It was one of those immense " oil paintings " which thirty or forty years ago were distributed by generous brewers to country hotels . Inside a colossal gilt frame could be seen an old sportsman seated at a table , while a setter dog gazed up affectionately from his knee . So far as these figures were concerned , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this momentary success , the artist had proceeded to fill the rest of his picture with every object that he knew how to paint . On the wall hung a Winchester rifle , a landing net , and a coaching whip , while on the floor rested a deer 's head , complete with antlers , and a brace of mallard ducks . On the table in the foreground were a bowl of fruit , a vase of flowers , a box of cigars , a salmon , and a violin . In the lower corner of the picture , as a sort of signature , was an exceptionally lifelike replica of a one-dollar bill . Andy turned to his wife . " Pretty nice , what ? " Poor Molly could only gasp , " Andy Payson ! Where in the world did you get that ? " " I bought it , " replied Andy . " From Gus Perrier . " " You what ? " " I bought it , " repeated Andy , " for three hundred dollars . And I got a bargain at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , not an hour before . " " For goodness ' sake ! To whom ? " " Bob MacGregor . Bob says that in twenty years those pictures will be rarer than Rembrandts . " At MacGregor 's name Molly began to weaken for , after all , MacGregor was one of the country 's recognized artists . She looked more closely at the picture , as if there might be something that she had missed . " Oh , you need n't be afraid of hurting it , " explained Andy , stepping briskly forward . He rapped the picture smartly with his knuckles . " You see , that 's one of its rarest features . It is n't really canvas . It 's painted on tin . " " But , Andy , " pleaded Molly , " three . .. hundred ... dollars ! " " Oh , do n't worry about that , " said her husband lightly . " I did n't pay him in money . I gave him six shares of that Behring Box stock that I inherited from Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , Andy , that stock is n't worth a cent . " " I know it , " chuckled Andy , " but I did n't tell Gus that . I merely said that ten years from now the stock would be just as valuable as it is to-day . " In her seat in an armchair Molly was visibly turning pale . " Andy Payson , " she demanded , " have you suddenly gone crazy ? Do you mean to say that you would palm off worthless stock on one of your friends ? " " Well , I took the picture on his say-so , " retorted Andy , " his and Bob MacGregor 's . Why should n't he take the securities on mine ? " " But somehow that 's different , " replied Molly , faintly . " Why is it different ? " insisted Andy . He turned suddenly and faced her . " Now , look here , Molly . I 've never interfered in your business . Did I say a word when you paid Helen Perrier eight dollars for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county for fifty cents ? " " I know it was n't worth it , " admitted Molly , " but Helen had just brought in a friend from Stockbridge to whom I sold a ninety-dollar evening gown . And I still do n't see , " she added , " why Gus Perrier has n't been cheated . At least , you have the picture , and Bob MacGregor has two hundred and fifty dollars . " " Oh , no , he has n't , " replied Andy , " because , just as soon as Gus had delivered the picture , he went back and sold Bob five shares of the stock . " Molly rose from her chair with a troubled sigh . " It 's too deep for me . But , anyway , do n't forget that we 've got people for dinner . In fact it 's the MacGregors and the Perriers  --  if you can still look them in the eye . " " Oh , speaking of that , " said Andy , suddenly , " I hope you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . He said that some friends of his had landed suddenly in town and he wanted to know whether he could bring them along . I told him certainly ; it would be all right . " Under ordinary circumstances this would have been a very common request , but , in her present state of mind , Molly was not especially expansive . " How many friends ? " she asked . " And who are they ? " " Only two , " replied Andy . " A man and his wife . You see , this is some big oil man or something  --  sheer slathers of money . He already owns two or three of Bob 's pictures and naturally , I suppose , Bob would like to sell him some more . " Molly looked at him suspiciously . " Is this another of Bob 's practical jokes ? " Her husband answered with wide-open eyes . " No , honestly , Molly . Cross my heart . I will admit that we 've been spoofing you a bit about that tin picture but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't , Bob 's fooling me also . I never heard anything about him until a few minutes ago . " " Oh , well , I suppose they can come , " answered Molly , turning away , yet even now she was far from convinced . She went up to dress but at the first sound of a motor car on the driveway she was at the door before even Edwin could reach it . The arrivals , however , were only the Perriers , walking up the steps with their usual nonchalance . Molly faced them both . " Tell me , " she whispered . " What is this trick that Bob MacGregor is working  --  something about a big oil man ? " Perrier looked at her blankly . " I 'm sure / do n't know , " he answered . Molly knew very well that August Perrier could do anything but lie . She shrugged uncertainly and gave a nervous little laugh , but if any doubts still lingered the next moment they were completely dispelled . For , scarcely were the Perriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense , glistening , imported limousine with a liveried chauffeur . Molly realized at once that even Bob MacGregor in his wildest moments could never have invented that car . Neither could he have invented the two persons who presently followed him out of it . The man was a little , bald-headed , unpleasant creature who looked as if he had stepped out of the Sunday comics , while his wife looked like the last survivor of " The Broadway Belles . " Furthermore , with a manner which was too much embarrassed to be anything but genuine , Bob waved his hand . " Mrs. Payson , may I present Mrs. Kloppf  --  and Mr. Kloppf ? " As soon as the strangers had been introduced to the Perriers , Sylvia MacGregor signalled Molly back into the hall . " Molly , " she begged , " will you ever forgive us ? But , honestly , we could n't help it . You see these people own three of Bob 's pictures and to-daythey stopped off at the Inn with a letter of introduction from Bob 's dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races in Saratoga . We never saw them in our lives before . " " That 's perfectly all right , " answered Molly pleasantly . " I merely thought when Bob telephoned that it might be one of his practical jokes . " " Oh , if it only were ! " exclaimed Sylvia . " That is  --  well , anyway , you know what I mean . " " Do n't worry about it for a second , " assured Molly . " If I can help Bob in any way I 'm glad to do it . " " Perhaps , " suggested Sylvia , " they wo n't be as bad as they look . " It was a vain hope , for when they rejoined the others on the west piazza Mr. Kloppf was already squeezing August Perrier by the arm and calling him " Governor " while through the hors d'cruvres , and all through dinner both Kloppf and his wife grew steadily worse and worse . Molly and Andy had read of such people , had heard of such people , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment could they have believed that such people really existed . In the first place , Kloppf himself could talk of nothing but money , while his wife could talk of nothing at all . She sat at Andy 's right but at every attempt of his to draw her into conversation she merely stared at him blankly and answered , " That so ? " At the same time , at the other end of the table , her husband was trying to compliment Molly by making coarse , coy advances . Failing in that line , he told her how much he had paid for his yacht , for his country place , and his race horses , and added that when the market had tumbled he had been the one man shrewd enough to get out . On only one other subject did he seem to have a genuine knowledge and this , curiously , was art . Yet even in this line he seemed to know pictures and painters largely by their prices and sagely remarked of this and that picture that he was " holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anyone wished to prolong , and it was with an immense feeling of relief that at last Molly nodded to her husband . " Will you have your coffee served in the smoking room ? " In long familiarity with the ways of the house , Perrier and MacGregor sauntered into the hall , while Andy followed with Kloppf . " Would you prefer . . . " he began , at the door of the smoking room , but the sentence was never finished , for , standing on the threshold , the visitor had given a sudden , gurgling cry and , looking around in surprise , Andy saw that his popping eyes were fixed on the barroom Velasquez , which was still hanging over the mantel . Without a word Kloppf turned and ran up the hall to the drawing-room , where the women were gathered . " Lily ! Lily ! " he cried . " I have found it ! I have found it at last ! " The next moment , dragging his wife by her bare , jewelled arm , he returned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed in their train . Looking neither to right nor to left , Kloppf ran to the picture , felt it tenderly with his fingertips , then tapped it with his knuckles , exactly as Andy had done a few hours before . " It is ! It is ! " he kept saying , over and over . " It 's the genuine one ! " Only after a full minute did he seem to remember that he was not alone in the room , then he turned to Andy . " Mr. Payson , where in the world did you get that painting ? " Luckily Andy had had some moments to prepare . With only the faintest glance of his eye in Perrier 's direction he answered casually : " Oh , I picked it up not long ago . " Kloppf took a large silk handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his brow . " Mr. Payson , " he said , " would you believe me if I told you that I saw every stroke painted on that picture ? " At the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fortunately Kloppf did not see him . His eyes were still fixed on Andy but now into his manner there was creeping a certain faint caution . " And may I ask , " he suggested , " what you paid for that picture ? Twenty ? Twenty-five ? Perhaps forty dollars ? " Andy stiffened slightly . " Why , no , since you ask me . The price was three hundred . " Kloppf looked at him sharply , then gave a quick shrug . " Oh , well , " he remarked , " then you know what it 's worth . " He laughed a bit harshly . " I guess you would have known anyway  --  the fool way I acted . " As if lost in thought he turned back to the picture , studied it for a moment , then slowly faced Andy . " Mr. Payson , there 's no use beating around the bush . Will you take a thousand dollars for that picture right as it stands ? " With a rather strained smile Andy shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think I care to sell it . " " All right , then . Two thousand ? " By the doorway , somebody gasped  --  probably Molly  --  while on the whole room a sudden , dead silence had descended . The smile had left Andy 's lips . He shook his head . " Two thousand , five hundred ? " said Kloppf . " Three thousand ? " Only then did Andy stir and , oddly , he seemed to grow about three inches taller . " Mr. Kloppf , " he said , icily , yet very politely , " if you do n't mind , I think that I 'd rather not sell anything to any of my guests . " For an instant it seemed as if something terrible were about to happen in the room  --  a blow , perhaps , or possibly an oath . One of the women stirred uneasily . One of the men moved closer . Then suddenly Kloppf himself broke into a grin . He held out his hand . " Mr. Payson , I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more freely and somebody lighted a match , but to suppose that Kloppf was really discomfited was not to know Kloppf . If anything , he seemed rather pleased to have regained the center of the stage . " Well , Mr. Payson , " he continued , blandly , " since you feel that way about it , I 'll tell you the truth . That picture is worth ten thousand dollars l " At that even Andy 's poise seemed to fade , and Kloppf 's grin grew wider . " Oh , do n't think , " he added , hastily , " that the picture is worth that much to the Metropolitan Museum . But it is worth that much to ow . " Abruptly he took Andy 's arm in a manner that was almost fatherly . " Sit down , Mr. Payson , " he commanded , " and I 'll tell you a story . " Still thoroughly in a daze , Andy obeyed him . Then Kloppf began . " Forty-five years ago my father brewed the finest ale that was sold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had n't done it , I should n't be buying pictures to-day . " As a matter of fact nobody had laughed , and the visitor continued . " Kloppf 's Pale Ale , " he remarked , meditatively . " Everybody knew it . And it was also just forty-five years ago that my father had that picture painted . It was done by a queer old fellow named Healey . I was just a youngster at the time and I stood by while he put in every line of it . I guess that was where I got my first love of pictures . " You see , " explained Kloppf , " after they got that first one they could reproduce hundreds more by a lithographic process , even down to the smallest of the brush marks . " " But is n't that a lithograph ? " demanded Perrier , in surprise . Kloppf looked around sharply to see who had asked the question . " No , Governor , " he replied , " that is the original painting but , for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others . My father wanted it to hang in his office , but he could never find it . " " But how did you know , " suggested MacGregor , " that that was the original ? You seemed to know it at the very first glance . " " I 'll tell you how I knew , " answered Kloppf , smiling quietly . He pointed to the lower corner of the picture . " By that dollar bill . You see , when we took the picture to have it copied we found that it was against the law to reproduce a dollar bill on a lithographer 's stone , so that was the only one that had it . " The visitor paused while he looked over the tray of liqueurs that had suddenly appeared . " Well , anyway , " he resumed , " I grew up , and my father died and , as you see , Prohibition put an end to the liquor business . I made a lot of money in the olive-oil trade and a lot more in the stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But about five years ago I happened to wonder what really had become of that original picture . Of course I knew that it was n't great art , but my father had wanted it , and I myself was sort of sentimental about it . I put some agents on the trail , and they brought me in any number of the copies hut , the harder it was , the keener I got to find the original . And , after all , it was n't any more foolish than looking for a certain old vase or a certain old postage stamp . For two years I have had a standing offer with antique dealers all over the country to pay ten thousand dollars for that original . You see , Mr. Payson , for a minute I thought that possibly you had heard of that offer . " Andy shook his head . " No , I never heard of it . I  --  I just happened to buy it . " " But now you understand , " concluded the visitor , " why I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused a moment , wiped his hands with his handkerchief , then almost pathetically he turned back to Andy . " And at last when I have found my picture , you wo n't let me have it . " Andy stared fixedly at the floor while again the dead silence descended on the room . " Mr. Kloppf , " he replied , " I think that you misunderstood me . I did n't say you could n't have the picture . I merely said that I could n't take money from one of my guests . As a matter of fact , if anyone ought to have that picture , it is you . Wo n't you kindly take it  --  with my very best wishes ? " For a moment Kloppf stared at him , only half comprehending , then suddenly he blushed to the top of his little bald head . " Oh , no , you do n't ! " he answered quickly . " If you wo n't accept any money from a guest , neither will I take advantage of my host ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars for that picture and , unless you take it , that picture stays right where it is . " Still Andy sat in uncomfortable silence , and Kloppf broke out again . " I tell you what I 'll do , Mr. Payson . Tonight we wo n't say another word about it , but there must be some place where even you will talk shop . " " Almost anywhere , " grinned Andy , " except in this house . " " All right , then , " said Kloppf , " the office of the Inn . To-morrow morning at nine o'clock . " " Very well , " replied Andy . " I will be there . " At the other side of the crowded little smoking room , Molly rose to her feet and suggested the larger spaces of the west piazza ; but as the company milled and shu ed into the hall , Bob MacGregor leaned over August Perrier 's shoulder .
