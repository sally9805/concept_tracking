txt George Creel , author , publicist and chairman of the convention which nominated Upton Sinclair as the Democratic candidate for Governor of California , disclosed yesterday that he had withdrawn his support of the party 's choice . His action , he revealed , in a letter to Mr. Sinclair which was made public yesterday through The New York World Telegram , was based upon an alleged violation of an agreement for modification of the candidate 's EPIC program . Mr. Creel , who was an unsuccessfu ' candidate for the Democratic nomination , alleged that Mr. Sinclair had violated a pledge , made before the convention , to abandon his platform of " immediate EPIC " I in favor of a compromise plan . THE CREEL LET'T'ER . The letter , which was given out here , was dated Oct. 18 . It announces his abandonment of the candidate , after analyzing at length the EPIC proposal . The text follows : Oct. 18 , 1934 . Washington , D. C. Hon. Upton Sinclair , Pasadena , Calif . My Dear Sinclair : I had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine jobs may keep me East until Nov. 1 . After eight months of unpaid public service , followed by the primary campaign , I can not afford to disregard employment . As a consequence I am compelled to write you about importances I would prefer discussing face to face . Quite frankly , " immediate EPIC . " announced by you as the final statement of your plan , seems to me to be at utter variance with our understandings . As you will remember , in our various conversations between primary day and the election , I stated my inability to stomach Merriam and his medieval owners and stressed a desire to support you . I had , however , attacked major features of your EPIC plan throughout my campaign , not merely to create a distinction between our candidacies , but because I believe them to be absolutely unrealizable , bound to betray hope and leading inevitably to a tragedy of disappointment . Unless . therefore , we could reach agreement on a platform that would be the last word in progressivism. yet demonstrably workable , I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own self-respect would bar me from going before Californians in advocacy of your election . No less than you I had stood whole-heartedly for a State income tax , increased inheritance taxes and adequate taxes on personal property and intangibles , feeling that wealth must be forced to bear its just share of the tax burden . We also saw eye to eye in the matter of developing self-help cooperatives and in condemning the destruction of foodstuffs . The proposals I protested were your 5300,000.000 bond issue , your scrip scheme for an independent currency system . your farm communes , your State stores , your pension of $50 a month to all 60 and to every blind person and those physically incapacitated from earning a living ; your exemption of all homes and ranches where the assessed value was less than $3,000. and the declared intent to substitute a tax on stock transfers for the present sales tax . I asked how you expected to market your bonds ; also how you expected to evade the constitutional prohibition against the coinage of money or the emission of bills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension promises would cost California close to $300,000,000 a year and argued that we wait on the announcement of President Roosevelt 's plans for the care of the old : that the exemption of homes and ranches of an assessed value of $3,000 meant an actual value of S$.000 to $10,000 , and that this would rob the majority of counties of all revenue for the provision of local governmental services ; that your scheme for taking over land sold for taxes ignored the law that gave owners a full five years for redemption . I showed by your own figures that a tax on stock transfers would net less than one million a year , and that it was either dishonest or insane to claim that it would take the place of a tax producing $50,000,000 a year . In particular I attacked your land colonies and your State stores , where the products of farms and factories would be sold to the general public at cost , holding that it meant the ruin of private industry and private agriculture if compelled to compete with State-owned enterprises . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment or any idle land with an available supply of cheap water . Of the first importance , it seemed to me , was that those who had given their lives to the land should be kept on the land . I favored State aid to return to original owners the ranches lost by foreclosure . Instead of the State grabbing farms and turning them over to the unemployed , many of whom never saw a ranch , I wanted California to accept a first lien for delinquent taxes , spreading amortization over a long term at a low rate of interest . My further argument was for a scientific soil survey , the retirement of submarginal land from cultivation and the establishment of properly qualified persons on farms under long term amortization leases with State aid . At no point did I question your sincerity , but at the same time I made no secret of my belief that hare-brained , unworkable schemes of social reform led to disaster no less surely than the programs of the charlatan and the demagogue . As a result of prolonged discussion we drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the Democratic convention , I was able to state honestly and happily that our declaration of purpose was one to which every true Democrat , every true progressive , could subscribe without loss of faith ) r sacrifice of principle . In " Immediate EPIC , " however , what do I find on the back page but your original plan , set forth exactly as it was in the first edition of " I ? Governor of California . " The fact that the contents admit various changes and acknowledge necessity for certain postponements only aggravates the offense . With even greater enthusiasm you urge your scheme for insulated communities ? farm communes  --  where the colonists will live in handsome , air conditioned homes , enjoying community kitchens , dining rooms , nurseries , theatres , State-made motion pictures , &c.,; exchanging their agricultural products through the medium of State-owned stores for the output of factory communes , each with its model village . In the support of your dream you write that " the Federal Government has furnished funds for a project which is practically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we inventors of the EPIC plan are happy to have this vindication from our Federal Government . " Every word of this Is untrue . EPIC derives directly from Plato , More , Bellamy and Wells . Farm communes are as old as ancient Sparta , and California herself is still paying the bills for two disastrous experiments in land colonization at Delhi and Durham . As for self-help cooperatives , I studied them first in Oregon and Washington three years ago . EPIC insists that its barter plan will free taxpayers from the burden of relief , making every destitute man and woman in California self-supporting , independent and secure . The Ohio plan does not reduce ' the cost to the taxpayer by one single penny . Monthly relief is paid to every worker in the leased factories and all they do is to make clothing , bedding , furniture and other things they can not afford to buy . With its model villages and model farm communes , EPIC contemplates barter as a permanent part of America 's industrial system . The New Deal refuses to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards the Ohio plan as a distinctly temporary expedient . The Relief Administration stands pledged to return a factory to private enterprise the moment it shows signs of being able to manufacture profitably for general consumption , and if any worker is given opportunity to work for a private employer he must accept it under penalty of dismissal . Let me say again that I do not question your honesty , but you have a most amazing faculty of making yourself believe the things you want to believe . As an example , take your repeated statement that you can and will end poverty in California , and that you wo n't take more than one or two of your four years to do it . This is an optimism carried to the point of delirium . Your dream of creating an ' economic island , ' alien and antagonistic to its immediate environment and to the rest of the country as well , is damned by every economist , yet you persist in it . " Immediate EPIC , " I am sorry to confess , puts me back exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence it is the original EPIC Plan that I Sttacked ns unsound , unworkable and un-American , designed to appeal to the credulities of ignorance and despair , and immeasurably hurtful in its effect on true progressivism . It is , therefore , with the very real regret that must always be stirred by lost opportunities that I withdraw my offer to campaign in your behalf . Very truly yours , GEORGE CREEL . Merriam Leads in Poll . Frank F. Merriam , the Republican nominee for Governor of California , leads Upton Sinclair , Democratic candidate , by about two and a half to one , in the first State-wide returns of the poll being conducted by The Literary Digest , and made public by that magazine yesterday .
