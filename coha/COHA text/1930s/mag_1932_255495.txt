Heavy , heavy over the head of International Telephone &; Telegraph Corp . hangs the threat that Spain 's Cortes ( parliament ) will declare the franchise for its big subsidiary . Compania Telefonica Nacional de Espana , null &; void . The threat has hung over I. T. &; T. 's head for eleven months , and last week Left-wing Deputies in the Cortes were shouting loudly for a vote on the bill , a hefty item in the pre-Revolution program against His Catholic Majesty Alfonso XIII . The shouting Deputies claim the franchise was illegal , that it was obtained only after a thumping bribe was slipped to " a high personage . " Telefonica Nacional was given until Dec. 3 to file a formal protest . Granted in the days of Dictator Primo de Rivera , the franchise contract has been recognized by two succeeding governments including the present , which appointed a representative to the board .
