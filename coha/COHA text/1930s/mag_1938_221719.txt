On the upswing in British public life today is tall , trim-mustached Major Herwald Ramsbotham ( pronounced Rams-bottom ) , Minister of Pensions , who wears behind his icy monocle an engaging twinkle . He became active last year as an oratorical scout , reconnoitring British public opinion in advance of the isolationist policies formally adopted by His Majesty 's Government last week . In his preliminary skirmishes last year handsome Major Ramsbotham , the epitome of a British officer with a gallant War record , characteristically declared : <P> " We can not become the universal policeman and patrol all the back streets of Europe and Asia . ... It is all very well to talk about the brotherhood of man , sanctity of treaties , rights of minorities and the rule of law . . . . Let us realize that our power to deal with the world as it is and the realists who inhabit it is not unlimited . <P> " We must realize that some of the rulers of the States we have to deal with are not idealists and sentimentalists , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such men are more easily impressed by high explosives than by high objectives . " We are not our brother 's keeper and we can not go running about all over Europe like a knight-errant rescuing damsels in distress . It is not our job to play the part of an amiable Don Quixote . " <P> With the official adoption of an anti-Don Quixote policy by the Prime Minister last week , it becomes the duty of Major Ramsbotham and other Conservative leaders to popularize it with the British masses . The engaging twinkle behind the monocle was working overtime last week as Orator Ramsbotham made headlines and scored chuckles all over the United Kingdom with a speech in which he referred to Adolf Hitler 's annexation of Austria thus : <P> " The nation whose conduct has recently perturbed us all is a nation of beer drinkers . Beer is a peaceful drink . Beer is the drink for the ordinary , kindly , simple workingman in the street-the man who can be found in millions all over the world . If he could get together with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should hear much less of dictators and all the other high and mighty political personages that at present bully and bewilder the ordinary man . In these unstable , quarrelsome days . I think I can give you a slogan for all peaceful , genial , companionable folks of all countries : ' Beer Drinkers of the World Unite . ' " <P> The editors of Punch , meanwhile , came out with what was intended to be a side-splitting full-page article calculated to impress the English mind with a notion that Czechoslovakia is a funny name , that even the fate of Czechoslovakia is not far from an affair for English mirth , and that as for an Englishman taking up arms to fight for Czechoslovakia-well that , implies Punch , is a simply hilarious idea . <P> Thus His Majesty 's Government were again profiting last week from the natural tendency of the typical John Bull never to take Central European troubles seriously , his incurable taste for chuckling with the rulers of the British Empire at the rest of the cockeyed world .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
