txt Indeed to carry his own section , let alone the rest of the United States . Today 's highlight , however , was the episode of the watermellon stand . Let me tell you about it . The Missouri River creeps alone between banks of silt where highway 24 crosses It just south of Carrolton . Only a mile or so past the bridge I spied a sign on the highway which advertised watermelon , ice cold , at five cents per slice . The brakes held , and the proprietor bestirred himself within his little shack , built on top of an old iron-wheeled wagon . " Come arount tether side and sit down , " said he , pulling a piece of watermelon from an , ancient ice-box . Competing strongly with 11,357 flies , I attacked the slice with a teaspoon furnished for that purpose . Drastic Measure Planned " I 'm gon na screen this place in , " commented the proprietor , who turned out to be an aged farmer with a walrus moustache , " then I 'll either get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the flies out . One or th ' other . " When the inevitable discussion of the weather was finished , the talk veered towards politics . " I do n't take no Interest in politics , " the old man said . " There 's nothin ' in it fer me . " Those fellers in Washington ? they draw eight or ten thousand dollars a year , and there 's somethin ' in it . " Still , there was one congressman from up In town here ? " pointing with a thumb ? " and It never seemed like he accumulated anything . I s'pose they spend it as fast as they make it . " Why some of ' em makes as much in a month as I make in a year . Let 's see . I had about 800 bushel of wheat this year . Got 90 cents for it , right at harvest time . And I 'll make mebbe a hundred dollars off these melons . Got to buy a hundred pounds of ice ever morning and that Costs fifty cents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred dollars this year , countin ' board for me and my team . Takes half the crop o ' course to pay rent on th ' land . " Local Politics Hold Attention At this point another farmer in a somewhat dilapidated truck drew up along the roadside . He , too , ordered a slice of melon . " Well sir , " replied the proprietor of the stand , " I hai n't got any good melon left no more . Here 's a couple o ' pieces you can have , but I wo n't charge you for ' em . " The newcomer tried the melon , pronounced it passing fair , and insisted on paying a nickel for it . After a decent interval , I asked him what he thought of the political outlook . He immediately launched into a discussion of who he thought was going to he elected sheriff of the county and why . But he finally got to the national election . " Landing 's my man , " he declared flatly . " That other fellow is taxin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw a couple of Missouri 's " milk hotUe cap " tax tokens on the counter , scattering some 8.000 of the 11,357 flies . ( That was not the first . time I had heard state taxes blamed on Washington , by the way . ) " Lot 's o ' farmers around here is gon na vote for him , " the other customer continued , in support of the Republican nominee whose name be mispronounced . I asked whether the farmers in that section were n't getting payments from the federal farm program . " Yes , " he replied . " But they take the money back in fast as they pay it out . " Young Folks AVIll Pay At this point the proprietor pulled his other foot up on the counter and asked , with all the wisdom of a man with a total income of $300 a year , how it came that the government 's debt was going on up , maybe to 35 or 40 billion dollars , if they took the money back in as fast as they paid it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar bills would ' most fill this shack would n't It ? " he asked . " I read somewhere it would take a lifetime just to count a billion dollars . " Well , 1 ai n't gon na be here to pay it back . " be continued . " It 's the young folks that 'll have to worry about that . " The farmer with the truck attacked a second piece of melon in silence . How , I asked him , is the Government 's soil conservation benefit plan working out ? " I did n't sign up , " he replied . I told him I thought there were n't any contracts to sign this year . " Oh , there was more red tape this year than ever before , " he answered . -I signed up the first year , but that 's all . Too much red tape . " Used Winter Expected There was another period of silence . " It 's gon na be a hard Winter . " he commented at last . " No work . it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No corn to harvest . No feedin ' to do . There ai n't any feed . That wheat crop this year Was a God-send . " The aged proprietor agreed that , indeed , it would be a hard Winter . " Still , " he said , leaning his head back against a post at the end of the counter , ... we 've always thrashed through somehow . And anyway it wo n't make much difference a Minded years from now . " " No , " agreed the other , starting back towards his truck , " it wo n't make much difference . "
