Time was when a course in oratory was standard preparation for a political career . Today a shrewd campaigner takes lessons in radio technique . But radio campaigning is a young art , ripe for experiments , knotty with problems . Last week New York 's ding-dong gubernatorial race produced one of each . <P> The experiment : When Governor Herbert Lehman spoke from Albany over Station WOR ( Newark ) , Announcer Richard Brooks stood by , slipped murmured interpolations into the microphone . As though the Governor were talking some foreign language the listeners could not understand . Announcer Brooks used intervals of applause to repeat and interpret sections of the speech . Not only did he report a sip of water the speaker took , but he also declared repeatedly that his candidate had scored heavily on Republican Opponent Thomas E. Dewey . Listeners capable of understanding the speech without translation protested . Others kicked about the announcer 's editorializing . The Brooks murmuring was promptly silenced . <P> The problem : Does a candidate who takes the customary air time of a popular program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program 's audience ? Candidate Dewey* last week bought on Station WJZ ( Manhattan ) 30 minutes of Tuesday evening time , half of which usually goes to the Information Please program . Although he was still talking when his time was up , WJZ cut him off to pick up the second half of Information Please , on which Harpo Marx was a noisily silent guest juror , + By telephone Information Please fans berated NBC for giving part of the program 's time to Candidate Dewey . <P> Dewey fans slated the station for not letting their candidate finish . The telephone score : For Information Please , 920 . For Dewey , 8 . <P> * Because his radio style was criticized by Republican Herbert C. Hoover , who himself is no great radiorator , Republican Thomas E. Dewey goes to New York University 's Speech Teacher Richard C. Rorden to brush up his microphone technique , reported " Daily Washington Merry-go-Round 's " Drew Pearson and Robert S. Allen . A baritone before he was a politician , Candidate Dewey is generally regarded as a professionally polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did not speak for the microphone but answered questions by whistling and pantomime.
