For several recent weeks a Senate investigation gave the 20 partners of J. P. Morgan &; Co. plenty to think about . Last week they had something far more serious on their joint minds : What they were going to do with their own business ? For the Banking Act of 1933 ( passed last week by accident because a Presidential blunder kept Congress in session four days longer than expected ) requires private bankers to give up either their banking or their securities business . <P> To a great many private bankers this forced choice caused little or no worry . Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. - according to the testimony of Partner Otto Kahn at a hearing a year and a half ago-are primarily wholesalers of securities . It requires no great stretch of the imagination to picture Kuhn . Loeb 's senior partner , Felix Warburg , presiding at a meeting at which the firm decides without any heartburnings to give up its banking business . A like amount of imagination would serve for Goldman . Sachs . And it requires no imagination whatever to picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for neither firm takes deposits . But the decision will not be so easy for a number of less well-known houses-and for the House of Morgan . <P> Three weeks ago John P. Morgan told inquisitive Senators that the bigger and more profitable part of his business was banking . Nonetheless a large part of Morgan &; Co. ' s profit , if not the larger part of its prestige , has been created by its securities business . To give up either part of its activities might easily deprive the other of much profit and prestige . The choice open to Morgan was enough to stump the ablest of bankers . The House of Morgan , ready with no extempore solution , appeared to face a turning point in its history . <P> The problems of private bankers were , however , largely their personal problems . Much bigger questions were raised by the Banking Act of 1933 . On its passage Franklin Roosevelt called up Carter Glass to congratulate him as the father of " the best banking legislation " since his other law creating the Federal Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of the stock of the three largest U.

The scheme was no simple compromise : <P> 1 ) From Jan. 1 , 1934 ( unless earlier decreed by Presidential proclamation ) all deposits will be guaranteed to a maximum of $2,500 . <P> 2 ) After July 1 , 1934. deposits will be guaranteed 100%. up to $10,000 , 75% from $10,000 to $50,000 , and 50% above $50,000 . <P> 3 ) The money to pay depositors in insured banks will come from a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . which is to start with about $500,000,000 acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
