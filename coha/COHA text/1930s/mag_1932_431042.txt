 | What Is It All About ? Condensed from Scientific American ( April , ' 32 ) Hiram Percy Maxim Inventor of the Maxim silencer for ordnance 0NE of the questions that occasionally come to all of us is : What is this great scheme of nature all about ? This earth on which we find ourselves adrift accompanies its parent sun on some kind of journey through space of which we know almost nothing . Where are we going , and why ? Our parent sun is quite an average star . There is nothing at all unusual about it if we compare it with the 30,000 million stars which form a galaxy which we call the Milky Way . Thirty thousand millions of suns is a lot of suns , at least as we poor little earthians view numbers and regard suns . To be an inhabitant of one of nine planets of a single sun among this vast horde leads us to wonder whether we are as important as we thought we were . But this is not the worst of it , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the depths of space . The trouble began when one of us made the discovery of the " island universes , " the spiral or extra-galactic nebulae . Up to that time we thought that our incredibly enormous Milky Way was the entire universe . While we were busy trying to readjust things , the news came from the big observatories that a large number of new galaxies had been photographed . Where was the thing to end ? The largest telescope we have today is the 100-inch reflector at Mount Wilson . It has disclosed the disconcerting fact that there are hundreds of thousands of galaxies , more or less like our Milky Way , and some astounding facts have also been discovered about the details of these " island universes . " We are building a 200-inch telescope and we have reason to believe that it will disclose that there are millions of galaxies . How far into the depths of space this manifestation of unthinkable numbers of stars goes fills us again with a great awe . This is what Einstein is trying to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters we behold ourselves just awakening to our surroundings . On the face of things we occupy a position of the most magnificent insignificance . We organic creatures appear to be living in a universe that takes almost no cognizance of life . We seem to be a sort of  | by-product . If humility is good for our souls , then we should have extraordinary souls , for as we look out from our little speck of cosmic dust , and realize the facts , we can not but become superlatively humble . What do we find about the beginnings of this earth of ours ? This is a very important question , one that has been given much study . The evidence leads to the belief that all of the satellites of the sun were flung off from the have passed close to the ancestral sun . The gravitational pull created such an enormous tide on the surface of the sun that stupendous masses of incandescent material were pulled out and flung off from the parent body . These masses followed natural laws and coalesced , became spherical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see them today , the nine known satellites of the sun . Among these planets , Mars alone has an atmosphere which resembles that of our earth . Being farther from the sun it receives less heat . Its day is 24 hours , 3 ' 7 minutes long . On its equator the temperature may rise to an average of so degrees in the day time . At night the temperature probably goes close to zero , Fahrenheit . A small amount of moisture appears to remain on Mars , and the kind of life we know on earth could exist there . If vegetation of some sort lives there , as Lowell thought , then it can be argued that animal life must also exist . The late Percival Lowell , whom I suspect may have had an abnormally acute vision , used to insist that the straight lines which he saw on the surface of Mars must be the work of intelligent beings . Straight great-circle lines are not the lines that nature would make . We have not been able to photograph these lines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in insisting that they were there , and he believed the evidence was good that they were irrigation canals which brought water down from the melting snow at the poles . This is all the evidence that we possess as to the existence of life anywhere else in the whole universe than on earth . The matter of communication across interstellar space becomes of interest at this point . Radio waves represent our first tool with which it may prove possible to carry a signal across the great reaches of astronomical space . If among the billions of stars there are some which have a family of satellites such as our own sun has , then it is reasonable to expect that some of these satellites  | would be in a zone of temperatures where life could exist . If life does exist somewhere else , then some day someone is likely to encounter , by means of radio , an extra-terrestrial intelligence . What a sublimely dramatic moment it will be for those concerned when this first interstellar contact is made ! Will it not dwarf every other dramatic incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language be worked out ? When a rudimentary language has been agreed upon , think of asking this extra-terrestrial intelligent being what sort of creature he , she , or it , is . Comparisons will be out of the question , as it would mean nothing to the other party to ask him whether he looks like a man or a crab or a chestnut burr . And think of asking " it " where " it " resides ! n what celestial body is " it " located ? And what if " it " were to turn out to be an intelligent insect sort of thing , or an intellectual vegetable . It might easily be . There are factors which have to do with interstellar communication which must not be overlooked . Were it to be our next door neighbor Mars with whom we were to make contact , it would take about two minutes for the signal to travel across the intervening distance between earth and Mars . Radio waves are a kind of light , and the velocity of light is 1 86,00o miles per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , were our communicant to be an intelligent being located on one of the planets of one of the stars of the Hercules Cluster , for example , it would take the radio wave 40,000 years to cross the space between the earth and that planet . Likewise , it would take another 40,000 years for the signal from the planet in Hercules to come back . This may cramp the style of those who in future centuries endeavor to carry on a correspondence with Hercules . Now let us glance at what we may estimate as the probable time that human life may be expected to endure on the surface of the earth . It depends upon our sun . The sun must continue to supply us with that very exact amount of radiation which will not run temperatures above 1 So degrees Fahrenheit , nor below 100 degrees below zero . This is a range of only 25o degrees . When we realize that we can see billions of examples of temperatures as high as millions of degrees , and other examples of temperatures several hundred degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our existence hangs upon the very slender thread of a maximum variation of only 250 degrees Fahrenheit . But temperatures on earth have been relatively steady for  | many millions of years and the chances are that they will continue to be so for more millions . The radiation from the sun is at the expense of its mass . No less than 360,00o million tons of matter is destroyed every day in order to maintain the present radiation of the sun . Poor old Sol weighs 360,00o million tons less today than he weighed at this time yesterday ! By our human standards this prodigal expenditure can not keep up for very long , but our human standards are not astronomical standards . The weight of the sun is so inconceivably great that in order to show any material change in weight or radiation we must go back five million million years . The sun weighed about twice as much then as it does now , and was correspondingly brighter and hotter . Now let us look in the other direction . The sun is unquestionably a dying star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this means a loss of gravitational pull and a loss of radiation intensity . In other words , we may expect the earth to draw gradually farther away from the sun , and we may also expect the sun gradually to cool off as millions of years roll around . This means one thing only - death by cold . This is a gloomy outlook . It has one consolation , and that is that it will be a long time before all this happens . It works out to be something of the order of a million million years . As man has been on the earth only half of one million , it becomes evident that things have just begun , and that there is a long time ahead in which to build and plan . What sort of beings shall we be even one million years hence ? If we go on advancing in accumulated knowledge as we have advanced since the time of Columbus , our future condition will be impossible to imagine . This leads us to the next and last question . If no accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing in knowledge ever faster and faster , what is to be the influence of intelligence on the cosmos ? Is it possible that intelligence is the big object of creation ? Will intelligence dominate the universe ultimately , controlling the orbits of celestial bodies and directing evolution ? We are inhabitants of the universe and as we gaze into the sky on a clear night we are filled with a great feeling of reverence , for we realize that we are looking at the Great Machine in operation . We see ourselves standing upon our little insignificant speck of cosmic dust , awed and inspired at the great picture , conscious of our own unimportance , understanding our probable beginnings , realizing our inevitable end , and wondering and wondering what it is all about .
