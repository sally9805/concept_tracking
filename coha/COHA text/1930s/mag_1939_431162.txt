 | Food and Drug Detectives Condensed from Advertising &; Selling Edward R. Keyes A UNITED STATES Marshal , accompanied by a federal food and drug inspector , walked into the warehouse of the Economy Drug Co. in Atlanta , Ga. , one afternoon in April , served a warrant on the manager and seized roi8 of the familiar blue bottles of Emerson 's Bromo-Seltzer . In seven other cities other seizures of Bromo-Seltzer were made . And thus began one of the most important battles in the 33-year history of the government 's effort to police America 's food and drug supply . It will almost surely end in the Supreme Court as the first full test of the Food &; Drug Administration 's new power to stop the sale of drugs which " are dangerous to health when used in the dosage . . . suggested in the labeling . " The government will have the tough job of trying to prove that a 5o-year-old product for which consumers spend $20,000,00o every year is dangerous under certain conditions . Until the new food and drug law was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they had been adulterated , because they were fraudulently labeled , , or because they were filthy - but not because they were dangerous . Now that loophole is closed and the government gets many other new powers . It is able to control cosmetics , devices like trusses , hearing aids , nasal sprays , and frauds of the electric belt variety . It has power to forbid the sale of any new drug product until its safety has been established . It can seize products that look like " more for the money " because their packages have false , bottoms or are only partly filled . It can establish standards of identity for all food products - to prevent a packer , for example , from calling his product " jam " unless it contains a certain minimum amount of real fruit . Subquality products will have to be labeled " Below Standard . " It can compel products with distinctive names - products like Miracle Whip , Ovaltine , Velveeta - to list their ingredients and the amount of each on the label so that buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheese , and what not . It can compel a patent medicine manufacturer to print a warning on the label of his product if it contains habit-forming drugs . It can also make him declare the quantity or proportions of dozens of drugs to which a great many people are allergic . It can place a whole industry under permit control in case of a serious outbreak of food contamination in any locality . The Food &; Drug Administration put up a five-year fight to win these new powers from Congress . It was a far more desperate struggle than the fight 3o-odd years ago to put the first food and drug law on the books , although it did n't get the headlines that were lavished on the crusade which the spectacular Dr. Harvey W. Wiley led in I95-o6 . Dr. Wiley could count on the support of the press ; Walter G. Campbell , his successor as chief of the Food &; Drug Administration , could count only on criticism . In the intervening 30 years advertising had become a big business , and ' it was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles of 19o5 and 1938 were alike in one important aspect ; in both , it was the women who won . Women of the National League of Women Voters , the American Home Economics Association , the National Congress of Parents and Teachers . They brought pressure to bear on Congressmen , disputed industry witnesses at public hearings , tirelessly stumped the women 's lecture club circuit , telling the story of the " Chamber of Horrors . " The " Chamber " was a series of displays in the basement of the Department of Agriculture building , showing dozens of dangerous products which the bureau was unable to touch ; its prize exhibit was a series of testimonial letters endorsing a fake tuberculosis cure , each letter matched with the death certificate of its author . In the end , it was a wholesale tragedy that persuaded Congress to take action : specifically , the 107 victims of the Elixir Sulfanilamide made by the S. E. Massengill Co. of Bristol , Tenn . Salesmen had told the manufacturer that there was demand for the wonder-working sulfanilamide in liquid rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to find a fluid in which sulfanilamide would dissolve , and when he found one - a drug called diethylene glycol , already under suspicion in medical circles - 480 gallons of the lethal fluid were shipped out for sale all over the country without being tested on a single laboratory animal . Since the law did not compel the naming of ingredients on the label , the many doctors who received samples of the product and who later prescribed the medicine for their pa-  | tients had no idea what they were administering . Within 24 hours after Washington received its first report of deaths resulting from the medicine - nine of them in Tulsa , Okla. - the entire field staff of the Food &; Drug Administration - 239 inspectors and chemists-was following up every single ounce of the Elixir . From the manufacturer through branch houses and wholesale establishments , through the corner druggist to the ultimate consumer . In addition , each of almost 70o individual samples mailed to physicians had to be traced . Before they finished the job , the government agents had accounted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of the entire episode was the fact that the Food &; Drug Administration was able to seize the goods only because of a trivial technical error . The Massengill product had been called an " elixir . " According to federal standards an elixir must contain alcohol - and the Massengill medicine did not . Had the product been labeled a " solution " the Food &; Drug Administration would have been powerless to act though a hundred people died . Spurred on by these circumstances , Congress finally conferred the new powers on the Food &; Drug Administration which it began promptly to use . In the first month after enactment it made several seizures . One of them was Causalin , which bore the subsidiary label , " **42;94;TOOLONG : " The press was amused that the n6-syllable designation was n't enough . But the government was really objecting that the name concealed rather than disclosed the fact that this widely advertised rheumatism " cure " contained amino-pyrine , a painkiller sometimes deadly . Announced at the same time was the seizure of 275 packages of Lash-Lure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user in 2o might expect bad effects ranging from runny eyes to death . Yet LashLure could n't be touched under the old law . Its manufacturer could n't be sued by victims because beauty parlors made patrons sign a legal waiver before using the dye . Now the Food &; Drug Administration has successfully preferred criminal charges against the maker . Such cases are sensational , but the real backbone of food and drug regulation is built of the day-today routine seizures of contaminated food and below-standard drugs . Products diverted to the dump heap last year included : 2,600,000 lbs . of maple syrup dangerously contaminated with lead from syrup-making equipment . 7q 8,00o Ibs. of worm-infested Canadian Whitefish. 37000o Ibs. of condiment seeds containing insect and rodent excreta . 6,000,000 lbs . of insect-infested dates .  | 37 shipments of non-sterile surgical supplies . Back of such performance is endless laboratory research in the field stations and in Washington . Walk into one of the laboratories in the Agriculture building and you will see chemists working on a method of measuring decomposition in fish that will stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn-ear worm , removed from a bottle of chili sauce are being prepared for a microphotograph . Here a technician is checking tests of six nasal , , prays , already seized as being good for nothing but to blow infection into the sinuses and middle car . In another laboratory , experiments are being run to perfect a new testing technique that shows when tomato juice is squeezed out of whole ripe tomatoes - as it should be - and when it is made principally out of cores and skins . Each - year , the Bureau selects for special investigation a dozen or so divisions of the food , drug and cosmetic industries . Recently , it has made checkups on jams and jellies , candy , macaroni , flour , frozen fish , tomato products , pecan meats , headache and cold remedies , contraceptive devices , and bandages and surgical dressings . After the bureau concludes such projects , most of the bad actors in the , business toe the mark - much to the satisfaction of the ethical producers , who frequently tip off the government on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision . Even the most law-abiding apple grower , for instance , can not always guarantee that his fruit has not too much poisonous spray residue . And then there is crabmeat , which is easily contaminated and is packed by some operators who have n't even elementary ideas of sanitation . To keep pace with such increasing perplexities , the bureau last year fitted up a testing laboratory on wheels . From March to September , the trailer rides north up the Atlantic Coast with the crab fishing season ; in the fall it is hauled around the apple-growing country in Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and Maryland . Some industries have achieved so high a standard of sanitation that , though their output may offend in other ways , the bureau rarely worries about its purity . The fruit and vegetable canning industry is a case in point . Not one death has been caused by a commercially canned food produced in the United States in the past nine or ten years . Of all the emergencies with which the Food &; Drug Administration must contend , floods present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contaminate everything they touch . During the Ohio River flood , food  | and drug inspectors moved into the Brown Hotel in Louisville when the water was still at the second-floor level-moved into rooms without heat , without light . In boats the inspectors checked stores and warehouses , marking goods which had been contaminated . After the waters went down hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of foods and drugs went to the dump in trucks , with mounted guards to keep off hungry pilferers . Despite sickness and fatigue , the inspectors stuck to the job night and day with almost fa- natical fervor . Thanks to this earnest spirit among food and drug inspectors , consumers are getting the kind of protection that money ca n't buy . At least , it 's the kind of protection that money is n't buying . In the last fiscal year , the government spent only i.i cents per citizen to protect the public against the ever-present threat of poisonous foods and dangerous drugs , while it spent about $i a citizen on naval armament against the remote threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
