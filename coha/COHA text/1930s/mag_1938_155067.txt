No U. S. college president has had a more turbulent career than New York City College 's bustling , goateed President Frederick Bertrand Robinson , 55 . A telegrapher 's son , Brooklyn-born Frederick Robinson graduated from City College , started as a teacher in the city 's public schools in 1904 and hustled his way up through the ranks to become his alma mater 's president in 1927 . As quick as you could say Frederick Robinson , he founded a School of Business , more than doubled his college 's enrollment . He became one of the highest-salaried ( $21,000 ) heads of one of the largest U. S. colleges ( 22,000 students ) . Last week Dr. Robinson hustled out of his job . <P> Ever since he became president , Dr. Robinson had been in hot water with his students and faculty . He quarreled with Philosopher Morris Cohen , with Morris Cohen 's son Felix . ( Disliking Undergraduate Felix 's editorials , Dr. Robinson tried vainly to keep him out of Phi Beta Kappa . ) He suppressed student magazines and meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Three years ago City College 's alumni , alarmed not only by Dr. Robinson 's high-handedness but also by the fact that student rebellions had given the college an undeserved reputation for being Red , decided that Frederick Robinson lacked " the human qualities " needed by a college president , asked the Board of Higher Education to do something about it . Still Tammany-controlled , the board refused to oust him . But last June , as the result of new appointments to the board by reform Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia , Dr. Robinson 's supporters were outnumbered . He applied for a sabbatical year . The college calmed , today is as peaceful as a vacated battle field . When Dr. Robinson offered his resignation last week , with one hand the board snapped it up , with the other gratefully applauded his " long and distinguished service . "
