The late great Earl of Birkenhead , " The Galloper , " when Secretary of State for India prior to Joseph Stalin 's break with Leon Trotsky ( TIME , Oct. 10 , 1927 ) , once openly remarked with characteristic recklessness that British agents had been working for some years to undermine the position of Comrade Trotsky in Russia . " But , dash it all , they do n't seem to be able to do anything ! " <P> Comrade Trotsky has since resided in Turkey , France and finally Norway . He is supposed to be a hatcher of anti-Stalin plots , but considering that agents of the Soviet secret service have made away in France with at least two of Stalin 's lesser enemies , the health still enjoyed by Comrade Trotsky is matter for wonder . He is the most professional of revolutionists , with a finished technique of backhanded delicacy , and last week his activities were of unusual interest . Trotsky let it be known last month that he was going to have to leave Norway , and was afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its wilds to Stalinist agents . Last week , having established his unenthusiastic attitude toward Mexico in headlines , Comrade Trotsky quietly asked the pro-Stalin and highly radical Mexican Government to make its informally proffered hospitality official . This was promptly done by President Lazaro Cardenas , and Russia 's Great Exile was expected to arrive in Mexico after the New Year . <P> In 1917 Trotsky went from Manhattan 's slummy East Side directly to join the Revolution of Lenin in Russia . In circles where Trotsky is admired word went round last week , " In Mexico he will be able to work in the United States through agents , just as in France he worked through agents in Spain . " <P> Messrs . Simon &; Schuster are so enthusiastic about Trotsky 's three-volume History of the Russian Revolution ( TIME , March 14 , 1932 ) that , although it failed to be the immediate best-seller they expected , they keep plugging it year after year in the U. S. and up to last week had disposed of some 10,000 copies . It admirably sets forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels to be his chief contribution to mankind and which , Trotsky thinks , is taking place just as permanently and inevitably in the U. S. as anywhere else . <P> Best European opinion is divided as to whether Stalin and Trotsky are actually each other 's bitterest foes or whether the Dictator , who hates to spare much money from Russia for purposes of " World Revolution , " regularly spares a little to the Great Exile on the theory that his talents as a trouble-maker for Capitalism are so great as to render the little he costs a bargain . Exile Trotsky expectorates in print upon Dictator Stalin on all occasions , and Stalin only recently staged in Moscow an amazing trial of alleged " Trotskyist conspirators " against himself ( TIME , Aug. 31 ) . Death sentences were passed and swiftly executed upon 16 of the accused , several of whom had long annoyed Stalin by timid carping at his policies , and this trial is still in retrospect so stirring that in Manhattan last week pinks and reds of various hues held a monster mass meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas .
