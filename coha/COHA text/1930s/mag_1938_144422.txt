BLOW FOR A LANDING-Ben Lucien Burman-Houghton Mifflin ( $2.50 ) . <P> Mark Twain covered the same ground and water 50 years ago , so readers were not surprised that Ben Burman 's novels ( Mississippi , Steamboat Round the Bend ) did not come up to Huckleberry Finn ; surprising was the fact that Author Burman should find as much good old-time stuff as he has . His best find yet , the shanty-boat hero of Blow for a Landing , though by no means as much of a fellow as Huck Finn , is at least of the breed . <P> Willow Joe Penny is a lanky , happy-go-lucky fellow who finds " a power of music " in everything from rubber bands to squeaking shoes , but especially in jugs . His powerful ambition is to be a showboat musician . Mrs. Penny 's ambition , more powerful than Willow Joe 's , is to get a home on solid ground and be respectable . So Willow Joe grits his teeth and builds cabins , which floods always wash away . But when hard times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dilapidated showboat . <P> Instead of getting a chance to play in the show , Willow Joe is sent off on a fantastic publicity stunt , a ten-day trip down the Mississippi on water shoes , playing a guitar . Unlike his half-dozen drowned predecessors , Willow Joe makes it . Then he lands in prison for shooting a man . His luck gets worse &; worse . Then he becomes a hero in a big flood , is rewarded with a nice farm in the hills . But come summer , the Pennys start complaining- even the clock " ai n't been ticking natural " - and sneak back happily to the storms , floods , fever , gyp salesmen , rousing revival meetings , fighting and good catfishing at Beaver Slough .
