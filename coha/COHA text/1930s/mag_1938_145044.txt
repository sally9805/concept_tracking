At the tenth annual National Air Races in Cleveland last week end for prizes handsome enough to cover the cost of a racing plane and a decent burial , the speed-mad fringe of U. S. aviation whistled up a great sound and fury . When it was all over , the pockets of Cleveland Promoters Cliff and Phil Henderson were again lined , only one flier had been killed , + and the whinny of ships racing against borrowed time had proved that aviation still has plenty of broncos . <P> Only event to prove much else was the Bendix transcontinental race-Los Angeles to Cleveland , then on to Bendix ( N. J. ) Airport . Pert , blonde Jacqueline Cochran , only woman entrant in the field of ten , flew in first and fastest to win $12,500 and demonstrate Designer Alexander de Seversky 's 3,000-mile-range pursuit ship . <P> Wife of Financier Floyd Odium , Winner Cochran covets the mantle of the late Amelia Earhart more than she does prize money . But when told she had clinched the race and the $12,500 , she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Labor Day throng of 300,000 jammed the airport environs to watch was the Thompson Trophy free-for-all , 300 miles around pylons . Hottest shots in the field of eight were flashy Colonel Roscoe Turner , 1934 winner and unscathed veteran of six Thompson competitions ; and his reckless young San Diego rival , towheaded Earl Ortman . At 100 miles they had lapped all the field but one . Then Ortman 's motor sputtered , slowed him up , and Turner won with an average of 283 m. p. h . Happy over the prospect of $18,000 first money and a bonus of $4,000 for breaking the course record ( 264 m.p.h . ) , Turner attributed his good luck to the godspeed of two old ladies whose prayer book he had auto graphed before the race . <P> +in a qualifying flight Los Angeles Racer Russell Chambers crashed in a vegetable garden , was fatally injured
