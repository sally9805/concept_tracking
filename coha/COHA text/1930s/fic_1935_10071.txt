nodded ingratiatingly , said good morning , with any encouragement would have sat down at the same table , but he froze him by staring past him . The weak eyes lifted away , the tray swerved in its anxious course , the cau- tious footsteps moved away forward in the long room , toward the window . The kind of despicable herd-member who was always on the lookout for some one to sit beside , some one to join and confide in . In a moment he would look round to make sure whether Am- men had really recognized him , unwilling to believe that his coldness could have been in- tentional . He would do this obliquely and with a little cough . And then lower his head tenderly over his hurt little breakfast . No , certainly not an acquaintance , and cer- tainly not Mather , but just the same to con- sider Mather was useful , for it served to make clearer the essential principles , moral oraesthetic , on which the final decision must be made . To look at Mather was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate to want to pity or despise him  --  he was despicable and pitiful , or pitiable : to remain completely in- different to him was impossible . And that , of course  --  and he slapped both hands on the table and laughed  --  was exactly the point . The stranger must be some one to whom onep101could be completely indifferent . He must be neither attractive nor unattractive , not to be loved or pitied , nor hated or feared , some one whose strangeness and anonymity ( in the sense that one knew nothing about him and felt nothing ) was pure . The face must be quite ordinary , just a face , the bearing and gait must be neither offensive nor enviable , the clothes of a sort of universal character- lessness . In short , it must be simply " a man . " A mere lay figure , or drawing of a man , such as you saw in a newspaper advertisement of ready-made suits for sixteen dollars and fifty cents . Yes , that was it , it was the discovery , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the whole population of the world had become his capital , the whole world lay before him or under him like an uncon- scious victim . He slapped the newspaper down in the chair , walked rapidly toward the cash- ier 's wire cage , smiled over Mather 's head , while he waited for his change to trickle out of the machine drew a postcard and pencil from his pocket , then against the weighing machine in the lobby addressed the card to Gerta and wrote quickly on the other side : Formula found , dislocation number six . . . . Superb . With each little accretion of definitiopIO2 the situation became tighter , drew them all more shrewdly and painfully into false and unwilling postures , they came along with him willy-nilly and without knowing where , and he could see exactly with what expression of dismay Gerta would read this latest bulletin : the heels of her hands pressed quiveringly to the sides of her head , then quickly dropped , then a few swift steps across the room and back , the sombrely curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulled . She would want to call him up on the telephone but would n't dare , she would want to come and see him , she would remain paralyzed un- til she had heard from him again , at most perhaps daring to write him a note of des- perate question . Or would she decide to go away , go back to New York ? Clouds and a wind , the morning was pro- found , from his own tower of vision he looked down at the sordid little human maze far belowhim , into which his lightning could now strikefreely where it willed , and once more , as he proceeded towards the Post Office , along Mount Auburn Street , the sense as of a de- ceptive serenity and leisure arose from his own deployed creation . Deceptive , for of course there was much still unsolved if not insoluble ,  --  no , not insoluble , but unsolved , pI03waiting , the actual terminus not yet selected . This day , and the next , and the one after  --  this week , or the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing could not be timeless , but must have a time ; and in this lay of course the necessity for a decision . Today ? begin today ? Begin with a definite volition ? or allow his feet to take him where they wished ? or simply stand in midstream , as it were , and allow the human current to divide itself unconsciously against him until the right " moment " came ? Deceptive , yes , for to consider this was at once to be im- mersed again in the feeling of hurry . And there were also the subsidiary problems , the merely practical ones : the choice of a weapon , the choice of method and place , the actual planning of the deed itself , and whether at a long or short interval after the selection of the victim . Whether with contemplation or with suddenness . And whether or not with precautions against detection ? But no , that element need not enter . He himself would be , from the victim 's view- point , a complete stranger : the crime would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be dead , no one could possi- bly be suspected , and that would be the end of it . The management of it should be exces-pI04 sively , almost childishly simple . A brief study of the man 's daily habits , his goings and com- ings , the discovery of his name , some ordi- nary ruse to get him to the appointed place at the appointed time  --  Belmont ? Concord ?  --  and there it was . A profound surprise . But how to select him ! He dropped the postcard in the letter-box , turned , recrossed Brattle Square ; a small cy- clone of dust whirled from the open end of the subway , the clock on the Police Station tower said a quarter to nine . A telephone directory opened at random , with the eyes shut , a pencil in hand , the sortes Virgiliancep He smiled , the notion was not unattractive , the merely geographic possibili- ties were very rich and unpredictable . Even more delicious if , for example , he were to invite Gerta to do it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the moment , what seemed most of all desirable was the mainte- nance of his own deep secrecy , his own in- violable privacy and mystery . Gerta and Top- pan and Sandbach , and the shabby little haunters of the C Bookshop on the hill , all these people must be kept in the dark , they must be given a sense of some impending action , some continuous but enigmatic and unfathomable activity ; like the leaves and twigs which the spider draws imperceptibly but imperatively together in his nocturnal spinning , each in turn bent together , they must feel but not see , only with daybreak would come  --  if indeed it were permitted to come to them at all  --  the revelation that they had been organized into an arbitrary pattern by the will of another and for a purpose un- known . They must be touched , used , made to quiver , but kept in ignorance . This would be their fright , this would be a useful part of his own satisfaction . The whole hated city , this alien city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become his own property , his own web . No Peddlers or Solicitors Allowed in This Building . He followed the grey coat , the round- shouldered grey coat , with the collar turned up under a black velour hat , past the Personal Bookshop to the Square . A green bag de- pended from the right hand , full of books , the gait was slack and middle-aged , the knees not quite straightening , the spectacled profile , when it turned to inspect the oncoming traffic from the direction of the subway , was grey and dry and moustached . Standing close be- hind him , it was possible to observe that the under side of the turned-up collar was wornIo6 KING COFFINp106and unbrushed , that there was cigarette ash on the crown and rim of the hat , and that the hand which suddenly rose to steady it against the wind was veined with an unpleasant blue . A professor , with a nine-o'clock , on his way to Sever or the New Lecture Hall . He bal- anced in the wind , then decided , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the last minute had to make an ungainly little run , when the traffic signal changed : the whistle shrilling , he scuttled , head down , hand on hat , towards the police- man 's canvas box . To stand and watch him , as he then veered round the box and darted across the tracks towards the subway entrance , his hand still held anxiously against his hat , the green bag bobbing awkwardly at his side , conspicuous among all the rush of morning pedestrians simply because singled out for observation , was to renew and refresh one 's sense of power : it would be child 's play to follow him , find out who he was : in point of fact , it wouldbe too easy altogether : to send a smile after the retreating figure was in itself , for the moment , a sufficient murder . No , this was not the sort of thing , though it whetted the appetite . Much more interesting , and much pI07 more fruitful , was the multiplicity of the morning rush itself . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway , conscious of his great height , and conscious of his consciousness , was the real and unspoiled secret : an immense sense of wealth , a multi- tude of treasure , into which one merely needed to thrust an exploring hand . On the lower tude of treasure , into which one merely needed to thrust an exploring hand . On the lower to thrust an exploring hand . On the lower platform , where the ramps converged from the Arlington and Mount Auburn cars , it would be at its best . Moreover , there would be telephone booths , and telephone directories . Descending the stairs , he crossed the stream of hurrying people and pushed towards the . Descending the stairs , he crossed the stream of hurrying people and pushed towards the of hurrying people and pushed towards the row of illuminated boxes , which looked like the lighted cells of a hive . A good point of vantage . He leaned casually against the edge of a booth , took the book in his hand , opened it at random , and while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the crowd let his finger fall on the page . There was a name under his finger , but for a moment he did n't want to see what it was : instead , he quite calmly smiled at one face and then an- other and then a third of those that passed him . The last , an old man , bareheaded , turned surprised eyes over his shoulder . Then he surprised eyes over his shoulder . Then he looked down . Joseph Kazis , 241 D Street , South Boston . South Boston  --  ! A little re-Io8 KING COFFINp108mote , perhaps , but just the same , by way of experiment He closed the door , dialled with his pipe- stem , listened to the far-off ringing , heard the click of the lifted receiver , and the slowJewish drawl , a woman 's voice.  --  Who iss it ?  --  Is Mr. Kazis there ?  --  No , Mr. Kazis has gone to work now , who iss it please ?  --  Can you tell me where I can get him , it 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paint shop on Stuart Street , but they do n't like for  --  Can you give me the name ?  --  Why , it 's the Vacuum Paint Shop andUpholstery -- He hung up the receiver , laughed , dropped in another nickel , waited.  --  Hello ?  --  Ammen speaking.  --  Why , Jasper --   --  ber seven , or is it eight ! And listen  --  Yes ?  --  Here 's a funny name just to remember , and then forget : Joseph Kazis . Came over in the Mayflower.  |  --  What ? Hello , Jasper --  ?  --  But we shall see ! No , it will not be Kazis . It will be some one else . . . . Someone strange ! .. .  |p113To  say that he was unmistakable , when he came a few minutes later , was not quite the truth : it happened , when it hap- pened , very quickly , very lightly , there was really nothing in the little man 's appearance which particularly answered to any previous notion : in that respect , it might even be saidthat it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face which he had vaguely foreseen . No , the decision was made auto- matically , somatically , with a mere physical gesture : he had simply , and before he knew it , stepped away from the telephone booth , against which he was leaning , and begun to follow him . This was no Joseph Kazis , no abstraction , nothing so remote as a mere name in South Boston , and in that sense it was already possible to feel an acute disap- pointment , a definite derangement of the basic idea . But of course , the minute he thought about that , he saw that it was in- evitable ; and what the little man supplied was exactly what mathematically would have had to be supplied  --  a real and surprising exist- ence . He was actual . He had come up the sloping ramp of con- crete from the Arlington side , walking rather 113 I14 KING COFFIN slowly , with his head a little down ; he seemed to be hesitating ; and when he had arrived almost as far as the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment and stood still . He looked straight before him with a half-smiling fixity , his hands were in his overcoat pockets , his overcoat was unbuttoned and hung loose at the sides with an effect of habitual carelessness , the grey tweed hat was rather far back on his head . He was obvi- ously wondering whether to turn round or not . Something had been forgotten ; or some plan had been , or was about to be , altered . That much was clear , it was amusing to watch the whole affair transacted so shamelessly in the open , as on a trans-lux screen , but it was also plain enough , from the continuous little smile , a slightly stupid smile , that whatever the thing was it was n't of very great importance . The moment of irresolution passed , he gave a little cough and turned briskly toward the platform . He walked with an odd jauntiness , his feet turned out , and his head on one side . There was something birdlike about him , and the shape of his coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy collar of cheap fur , somehow accentuated this . Lowering one shoulder , he turned neatly into the door of the train.  | Pausing just inside the door , he looked quickly left and right , evidently saw that the forward end was the less crowded of the two , began to edge his way through the double row of passengers : to watch him from out- side , and the slight patronizing smile with which he ingratiated while he made his way , was also to be able , without appearing to follow or any risk of attracting attention , to join him by entering at the front of the car . Accordingly , Ammen walked parallel with his victim : saw the grey hat appear and disappear : saw the hand go up once to touch a hand-hold and drop again : once glimpsed the half-turned smiling face , noticed for the first time the little moustache . Entering , he found himself almost too close to the little man , who had found a seat and sat down . But by standing opposite , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to watch him . It was also possible , by stoop- ing , to see his reflection in the dark lustre ofthe window-glass . He could not leave with- out being seen , that much was at any rate certain . And that was all of course that was necessary . The danger always arose there : it had happened several times . In the case of a hurried exit at a more or less crowded sta- tion , it was necessary to be close at hand.  |  | Revolving a little now , with his two hands a notebook . There was conceit in it too .

Already it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and ex- actly as it was easy to look down at him in the hurrying train , to study his mouth , his eyes , his hands , the large mole at the outer corner of the right eyebrow , the brown feather in the hatband of the cheap tweed hat , so also it was becoming absurdly simple to see the background , the suburban shabbiness and pretentious meanness , of his life . That life began already to lie open : with a single pow- erful glance one found its essential tissue : two suits of clothes , two pairs of shoes , dull lithocromes on the walls , a dirty tooth brush and a clean one , the cracked mirror over the kitchen sink , a comb always carried in the breast-pocket of the coat , an umbrella stand in the front hall , in the zinc base of which wasan o1 ( 1 pair of rubbers . Or perhaps two , per- haps he was married . Perhaps even  --  and Ammen smiled at the advertisement at which he found himself staring , Morning Mouth Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sudden sound of wind , the flood of daylight , on the Cambridge Bridge , sun flashing on windblown and dancing water , the sound of the train it- self diminishing , it became possible to see the sallowness as more marked , the hollows be-pII9neath the eyes as more pronounced . And also a something melancholy or disillusioned in the eyes gave the lie to the amused impudence of the mouth . The eyes were a good blue , very deep , but inward-looking : self-centered . The mouth , under its short fair moustache , had about it a small air of authority . A ty- rant in his own Lilliputian world : a domi- neering ant . A little bully . At Park Street , it was easy to follow him , for as before he walked slowly and reflec- tively , hands in pockets , he seemed to be in no hurry , and to be enjoying the crowded scene , the cross-rush of opposed currents of pedes- trians , some towards the North-bound cars , some to the South , himself sauntering beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he moved toward the escalator . Arrived on this , he stool quite still , did not turn , allowed himself to be borne upward to the sur- face with complete immobility . There he stepped off and turned to the left . The thing was going perfectly : it could not have been better . And if now , as appeared likely , he was going to walk to his destination , it would be extremely simple . This was the advantage of great height . It was easy to follow because it was easy to see . Lagging fifty feet behind , one could observe everypI20 movement of one 's victim as from a tower . Unless he took a taxi  --  but he had already passed the Park Street stand  --  there could be no difficulty . Except for the matter of turn- ing corners , following people in the street was simplicity itself : but when they turned a cor- ner , one must be prepared to run . More than once , on such an occasion , he had found that in the interval between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own arrival there , the stranger had vanished : and into any one of so many possible doors that further pursuit was impossible . This time there must be no such mistake . At the corner of Bromfield Street  --  and it amused Ammen to reflect on the literalness with which his own path of last night was being followed  --  the tweed hat hesitated , as if about to turn to the right , but then pro- ceeded . It crossed Tremont Street to the graveyard , sauntered slowly along beside the railings , turned once to look in at the pigeons and squirrels , but without pausing , and pres- ently had crossed Beacon Street . It was cu- rious : the fellow positively seemed to have the air of knowing that he was followed . That turn of the head , the peculiar way he had hesi- tated at the corner of Bromfield Street , and moreover the almost studied insolence **25;3220;TOOLONG of his back  --  ! Was it pos- sible ? No , certainly not . Any watched per- son looks watched . A suspected person looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to be careful . He remained on the other side of the street , strolled slowly beside the grey churchyard of King 's Chapel , his eyes fixed on the little bobbing hat , and suddenly found himself thinking of Breault . Breault ! This little man was like Breault  --  why had n't that occurred to him before ? Absurdly like him . The same sort of little homunculus , the en- forced dignity of the man small of stature , the pathetic truculence of the weak . The sort of ridiculous boldness which is quintessen- tially an invitation to death : the one-who- wants-to-be-killed . The one who wants to be killed ! And why not Breault ? There would indeed have been a special and beautiful irony in choosing an anarchist  --  and a Chicago anarchist to boot . As if one had managed to murder Louis Ling . Or Czolgosz . And odd how that the pattern should thus be turning round on itself , himself now again passing Tremont Temple thirteen hours later , with the echoes of that scene still whisperingon those stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those ridiculous people ! Mrs. Taber , with her feather duster , was at this minute probably talking about it in the C Bookshop to Miss Gerber , the lumber-merchant 's daughter . At half past ten the shabby little fake analyst would come in  --  Meyer  --  to pick up gossip or blab the dirty secrets of his patients , throw- ing out dark hints as to their social impor- tance . He would be told about it , and snigger , and recount for the hundredth time his story of the dinner he had given at the " Athens , "  --  that experimental dinner when he had provided a department-store sales-girl for each one of his highbrow guests , with instructions to try to seduce them , so that he could observe their behaviour  --  and particularly the behaviour of Ammen . " And Ammen never said a word . He just sat here and never said a word . Do you think he 's human , Mrs. Taber ? " Suddenly he found himself running . At the Beacon Theatre the hat had stopped , pivoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction from which it had come : seeing that a change of traffic signals at the foot of Beacon Street was im- minent , the little man had himself begun to run . As it was safer to run behind him than parallel with him , Ammen zigzagged throughp123the traffic of Tremont Street , was just in time to drop to a walk again at the corner entrance of Houghton and Dutton 's and to cross ten feet in his rear : a little too close for comfort . A narrow escape , and it turned out , imme- diately , to have been even narrower than he thought : for at once the hat swerved to the right and entered the door of S. S. Pierce . Another moment and he would have been too late : caught by the stream of traffic , he would perhaps have been unable to see in what direc- tion his quarry had gone , or into which of a multitude of doors . As it was , there was no great danger in following him into the store , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if for in- spection , first at one counter and then at an- other . The hat preceded him , with a firmness of purpose obviously born of familiarity , to the wine and spirits department at the back . A small bottle  --  to judge from its size and colour a pint of whisky  --  was there procured , paid for , and pocketed ; and this done the little man once more advanced to Tremont Street , once more resumed his interrupted journey towards Scollay Square , this time pausing just perceptibly at the entrance of the Beacon Theatre to glance at the posters of the movies . Two facts had thus been learned about him : pI24 pI25 perhaps not quite facts so much as the possi- teresting and exciting feature . That he bilities of facts : one , that he drank , but with should be unpredictable , as much in behaviour some indication that it might be on a minor and as in appearance , was of course of the very retail scale : two , that he might be a movie essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A third seemed to be that whatever his be expected in outline , or expected in its un- job was  --  always assuming that he had one  --  expectedness , the details must naturally , like it must be somewhat flexible ; it was well after this , be surprising .

It was all very peculiar : but hand . Let him go as far as he liked ; let him the oddity of it was in a sense its most in- even round the corner at the top of the I26 KING COFFIN Square , turn towards Ashburton Place : let him , in fact , go where he liked : he was now under control , he would never escape . He was now  --  and the feeling was positively physical in its sureness and power  --  fastened . What was even surer than that he would turn to the right or left was that whichever direction he chose he was walking deliberately towards death . He was in the act of finding his grave . At the back entrance of Houghton and Dutton 's , a truck was being unloaded . A heavy crate fell from the tail-board to the sidewalk with a sharp clap , a pistol-shot of sound , and the sound was at once echoed by the simultaneous slapping of a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sooty window-ledges of the Court House . Round . the Square they circled , and vanished northward at the far end of the Court House , his eye following them out of sight ; and in that instant the tweed hat had vanished also , turning to the left at the top of the hill . No need to worry  --  he would still be there  --  but he quickened his pace , glanced hurriedly over the crowded array of second-hand books in the window of the Re- built Bookshop , noting one title , Erring Yet Noble , and presently , keeping close to the win- dow of the Waldorf , turned the corner and looked down toward Beacon Street . The little man had disappeared : he was not there . Impossible ! But yes , of course , possible . He must be either in the Waldorf , at his left elbow , or in the shoe-shine parlour be- yond : the Waldorf , at this hour , seemed im- probable , but to inspect the interior through the large windows was simplicity itself . And sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was in the act of receiving a heavy china mug of coffee , came forward with it , stepping cautiously , sat down at a table without once having raised his eyes , dipped sugar from the sugar-bowl and began stirring the cup with a spoon . A retreat , and a wait , becoming necessary , Ammen bought an American from the news- boy at the corner , crossed the street , stood with lifted paper by the door of the Newsboy Foundation .

For a moment the sun flashed downward , filled the dull streets , sparkled on the cars , then was again dimmed by heavy clouds . He looked upward , watched the clouds in swift procession , ragged and grey , but not rain-clouds , it would not rain . From Park Street Church came , with clamorous loudness , immediate and strange , the eight bells of the half hour , wind-borne and irregu- lar . Half past nine . The whole thing was peculiar : he had started a good fox , and no mistake . Perhaps he had no job at all , was going nowhere . Either out of work , or of independent means . But surely not the latter ? Picketers and racketeers . Or of course he might be an " outside man " for some firm or other , whose hours were more or less his own This time , when the little man reappeared , it was with a new air of purpose and a notice- able quickening of pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ammen keeping fifty feet behind ; and then suddenly the hat had turned left into a narrow doorway which appeared to lead into a barber-shop . Hurry- ing forward , Ammen found that it was not in fact the barber-shop , but the entrance to a flight of shabby marble stairs which led to the upper floors : business offices of the hum- bler sort . Listening , he could hear the foot- steps climbing above , and at once , taking three steps at a time , and without making a sound , he followed . The hall on the second floor was vacant : ground glass doors of an in- surance office , a dealer in real estate : the foot- steps were again ascending , and as he reached the bottom of the second flight of stairs he saw the feet just arriving at the floor above . They disappeared , he could hear them slow- ing , then a jingle of keys , the turning of a lock , the opening of a door . The door must be the one immediately opposite the stair- head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door close , and mounted swiftly . Behind the grey glass he could see the moving shadow of a man in the act of removing his coat , very close at hand . The stencilled letters on the door said : Acme Advertising Agency . K. N. Jones and T. Farrow . Jones ! If only it was Jones !  | And why not ? He knocked his pipe softly against the yel- low-plaster wall , dislodged the light crust of ash , began to laugh . That it should turn out to be a Jones would be almost too good to be true . The anonymous one , the abstract one , the mere Specimen Man  --  it would be per- fect ! But even if it turned out to be Far- row Walking forward to the front window , he looked down into School Street , ticked the black pipe-stem against his teeth , reflected with narrowed and unseeing eyes . The thing was beginning ; he was in the presence of it ; his shadow was already falling upon the tree , like an immense frost of peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway , unknown to the tweed hat which now hung on its peg , his powerful influence was beginning to ex- pand and penetrate . He had entered the stranger 's little world , he was here inside it , learning its shape and size , taking possession of it . This worn wooden floor , the scarred plaster of the walls , the ground glass of the old-fashioned doors , the gas-bracket in the corner  --  this was the stranger 's domain , known to his feet and hands and eyes , re- turned to day after day , dreamed about ,  | hated , loved . The whole little life was begin- ning to lie open , like a familiar book . Opening the window , he leaned out ; and at once something caught his eye . The tele- graph office . His long hands tightened on the edge of the sill ,  --  the idea was sudden , and like a pair of claws . It was as simple as light- ning . And it would be as effective . Two minutes later , in the telegraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yel- low telegraph form , added " please call after 11 , " and sealed it in an envelope .

It will take him five minutes.  --  Yes , sir , that will be  --  Give me the change from this .

Clouds and a wind , the wild heavens opened and closed with wild light , the morning had deepened immeasurably , was deepening with each breath he drew : what a surprise was in IF for a moment the thing , in coming closer , seemed almost in the nature of an encroach- ment , as if his own shadow were somehow falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a mirror , the sensation passed immediately , with a mere knitting of the brows , and what ensued was a natural and profound laughter , the golden laughter of the gaia scienza , the gay wisdom . The heavens and the houses laughed together , the whole sound of the hostile city was gay , not to say ribald , and it was as if he himself were mounting rapidly up a spiral of air or light . The impulses were many and confused  --  to call up Gerta , for example , to call up Sandbach , call up Toppan , even Mrs. Taber ; to call them all up and tell them what had happened . Ammen speaking ! Yes ? And I wanted to say that I 've found a man , a stranger , and I have him on the end of an invisible cord , a cord three miles long , and with this cord I shall slowly but surely kill him . I shall dangle him there like a puppet , like Punch or Judy , until I want him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever I choose , and it shall be done . . . . But against this was also the contrary impulse , and the more natural  --  to make this the beginning of a new and essentially secret life : to go underground , into darkness , and to remain there . No one should know what he was doing , where he was , what planning , what evolving : at most , now and then , he would give them the fleet- ingest of little signals , the showing of a singleand ambiguous light , glimpsed for only a moment and gone again , or the utterance of a deceptive word or two in the most disguised and bland of voices . They would know noth- ing , until he had returned at last from the underworld , wearing a new terribleness of splendour . And even then though they would recognize the new power , the new terror , they would guess in vain at the reason , find him as mysterious in the light as in the dark . But only for the time being . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickened his pace , he had thought little about his direction , found himself now proceeding from the foot of Mount Vernon Street to the Esplanade against gusts of wind , the Charles River Basin lay be- fore him half clouded , half flashing under the changing sky , the nearer waves leaden , the farther bright . The raw new works for the new lagoons , islands , bridges , the stretches of bare earth where as yet no grass showed , the heavy masses of unplaced stone lying awry , the ungainly bastions projecting against the river , windswept and sinister ,  --  all this accorded admirably with his own changing scene , his sense of disruption and tumult . The ruthlessness and purposiveness of architecture , of the archiect  --  yes , there are times when one must be a Bucyrus-Erie steam-shovel . Only for the time being : the shadow lay heaviest in that phrase , in the notion of time . Once the weapon had been aimed , one could not delay indefinitely the pulling of the trig- ger ; there must necessarily be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a distance , and for whatever satisfaction , one 's quarry : the **26;3247;TOOLONG must be killed ! But need it be at once ? It was a nice question . Actually , of course , there was no hurry . Mr. Jones could not escape  --  for how could he take flight from a danger of which he was n't even aware ? He would be there , he would wait , as long as it was necessary for him to wait . But this was n't really the prob- lem . The real problem was once more in the matter of purity , and about this it was im- perative to think very clearly , without any vagueness or any self-deception . One must be certain that one was not delaying for the wrong reasons : for example , out of fear , or a distrust of cue 's mere competence . But that was dismissed as soon as considered . The thing would be , if not entirely simple , at all events quite practicable : it would need , when the right time came , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the cool exercise of a little logic . Some small and quite uncomplicated structure of deception would serve , all the more ob viously in view of the fact that the victim was completely unsuspecting . An invitation to something , somewhere  --  Belmont , Con- cord , Nantasket No , there was no cause for worry , there was no fringe of self-deception , he was not afraid ; the thing was as good as done . He could safely leave the actual form of the mur- der to be determined by future events . The revolver , with which he was an expert marks- man , brought all the way from Naples , canoe on the Concord River  --  these details need not yet be considered . Or a casual lurch in the subway ? What was far more impor- tant now was the other question , which he had not quite clearly foreseen though he had vaguely felt it  --  the question as to how legit- imate would be the mere pleasure in observa- tion , in the daily watching and study of Mr. K. N. Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this pleasure had become only too manifest . It must have been , from the very beginning , somewhere vaguely in his mind  --  it was certainly a part of the pleasure of the pure detective-impulse , as discussed by him- self and Toppan . But admitting this , how safely and for how long could it be pro- tracted ? The line must be drawn somewhere  --  the stranger must in essence remain a stranger  --  and if it was perhaps legitimate to learn as much about the little man as possible , by careful study , one must be scrupulous in learning only what could be learned from outside . Yes , that was it ; that would keep it pure : everything would be all right as long as the stranger did not know him . The stranger must not become an acquaintance ? Even this was not wholly clear , however  --  for if knowing about his victim was a per- fectly legitimate part of his pleasure , then surely it was difficult to set any limit ? . . . Advertising ; he was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good or successful one . What did such fellows do ? And how could that be found out ? Two girls , one of them with an Alsatian on a leash , walked for a moment parallel with him.  --  And from where I was sitting in the front row of the balcony I could look right down on his little pink bald head  --  Was his wife there too ?  --  Yes , I suppose it was --  "  --  With red hair ? and she has very skinny arms , you can see them when she wears He turned to the left , entered the rutted and abby alley behind Beacon Street , paused to let a car pass , looked in and saw an old lady with a black hat and veil  --  the fierce bird's-eyes peered at him and were gone . For some reason he stood still , gazed after the retreating car , watched it swing slowly , bumping over the uneven surface , up the left turn which took : 4 to Beacon Street . A final glimpse of that white and hostile Bostonprofile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this wind , the rapid shift of cold spring sunlight with grey shadow , brought him an eclipse : his hatred rose suddenly and sharply , the vision returned to him as last night at Gerta 's , it grew like a tree , thrust darkly and venomously above him , spread violent and lethal boughs to right and left over the hated void . As he stood still in the dusty alley , with tightening arms and handsp143held hard against his sides , it was himself who thus grew and darkened and obscurely multiplied . He had taken possession of the world . Conscious of his powerful arrogance , his half-closed eyes , his out-going intelligence and limitless vision , he looked to right and left along the alley as far as he could , saw thefew people in the distance , knew them , dis- missed them . They had not noticea him , and even if they had , they were as unaware of his true reality , his malevolence , as the oak tree is of thunder . If they saw him at all , they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley , a man with dusty shoes , tall and thin , dressed in a dark suit , his dark hair blown in the wind . Perhaps they thought of him as odd and solitary , or even as absurd and self-conscious : as if to be standing there close to the high brick wall , motionless in the swirling dust , was a kind of awkward pose , something either meaningless or ridiculous . Or shabby and mean . . . . Mean ! But how could it be that ? He looked quickly upward toward the sound of an opening window , saw a maid shake a dusting-cloth with a downward ges- ture of the white arm , felt for a moment something inimical in the mere notion ofpI44 height . To be enclosed thus anonymously between high walls , and as if purposeless , at a standstill  --  this was to be enacting the " un- recognized " Satan , the Satan in disguise . It was that moment when Satan , humbly clad , has not yet declared himself ; skulks in the background ; pulls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet pointed toward the victim his mesmeric forefinger . Certainly there might be a kind of meanness in this ,  --  as there was in any mere solitude . To be alone , in an absolute sense , was also to be mean , as the acorn or the toad is mean . But also to be alone was to be magnifi- cent . . . . He gave his laugh again , turning , he had come back again to his starting-point , the laughter of the gay wisdom , it was all as clearand beautiful and ominous as a black beetle in a golden blaze of light . The scarab ! He was the scarab . And with precisely that kind of hard and precious immortality . And its touch , when K. N. Jones felt it , would be cold . But the telephone call was imminent , he must get to Gerta 's room , be waiting there , listen  --  for the first time  --  to the stranger 's voice . Gerta would not be at home of course , she was at the Museum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note for her . Crossing Charles Street , he ascended Chest- nut , stamped the dust from his shoes , heard the sentences of the dialogue forming , lis- tened intently to the new voice which crept allthe way over the hill from an office in School Street . Advertising . The Acme Advertising Agency . The Farrow might be mythical . A one-horse show . Bought out , perhaps . And who went to such a firm for advertising ? When Sally let him in , unsurprised by his request to use the telephone and to leave a note , it was ten minutes to eleven . The room was empty , silent , smelt faintly of turpentine . The blue smock hung over the back of an unpainted chair , the green bowl of apples stood on the sill , the notice of an art-show was propped against one of the candles . On the corner table , tilted to the wall , was a newpainting  --  a new Gerta  --  which obviously she must have concealed the night before . Like all of Gerta 's recent work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly she had begun speaking in a foreign language . It might be the interior of a lunar volcano ,  --  the inside , the wall , but it was vascular with silver , en- crusted as with heavy silver veins which seemed to have a cold and heavy life , and above this , in a light as dead and clear as terror , were two winged things , not birds , not moths , which appeared to be at dalliance . Above these , in turn , was a little hard pale wafer of a sun . What did Gerta mean by it ? He took it to the window , held it to the light , saw how heavily crusted was the paint , all that veined interior as solid as a honey- comb , but also with a queer phosphorescent unreality . A strange world , as strange as his own , she was a match for him , it was what he had always liked in her : she had secret depths and heights , there must somewhere be a Kay in her family . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He replaced the picture , then stood still in the middle of the floor . At this minute , per- haps Jones had his watch in his hand , was putting out his arm toward the telephone , pulling it toward him , waiting . Or perhaps he was walking to and fro in the room , in the little dingy office , unable to sit down , wonder- ing what the mysterious note could mean : and whether it meant a job or not , and why it had - come by messenger . Perhaps the bottle of whisky stood on the desk , with a tumbler be- side it . And an ash-tray littered with matches and cigarette-ends . Or had he forgotten thep147message already ? was busy , would n't call at all ? It seemed unlikely . The very fact that it had come by Western Union messenger would make it appear all the more urgent . . . . Urgent ! He little knew . A faint premonitory buzzing , and then the telephone , as if clearing away an obstruction , began its sharp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , gazed down at it , smiled as he put his hand on it and lifted it , the receiver still unremoved . Beware lest , if thou gazest into the abyss , theabyss gaze also into thee !  --  Hello ?  --  Hello ? This is K. N. Jones speaking , of the Acme Advertising Agency . I received a note asking me to call this number --   --  I beg your pardon ?  --  I say I received a note this morning ask- ing me to call  --  Oh , I see ; this is Mr. Jones.  --  Yes . Who is this speaking , please ?  --  The Acme Advertising Agency , is that right ?  --  Yes ! Yes ? The voice was a little anxious , a little eager , a little mystified : but low-pitched and quite pleasant . After a pause , getting no reply , it went on :  |  --  What can I do for you ? . . .  --  Well , as a matter of fact , I 'm not quite sure as yet . I merely wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be glad to give you any information I can  --  You undertake all sorts of advertising work , I assume ?  --  Oh , yes . Anything and everything . Per- haps you could give me an idea of what it is you want ? Carrying the telephone with him , he took three steps to the window , placed the felted base of the transmitter on the sill beside the bowl of apples , looked down over the roofs toward the Esplanade , the bright surface of the Charles River Basin , the far-off Harvard Bridge . The window was a few inches open , and he closed it by bearing softly down upon the sash with his elbow.  --  As a matter of fact , I 'm making the in- quiry not on my own account , but for a friend of mine.  --  I see.  --  Well , do you ?  --  Well , I mean I 'd be very glad  --  It would be rather a confidential mat- ter.  --  Well , I guess that would be all right  --   |p149would  you mind telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly matters . But if you want to know , my friend simply happened to be in your building  --  in School Street , I think he said  --  and saw your offices.  --  I see.  --  You feel you would have to have ref- erences ?  --  Why , no , certainly not , I did n't mean that , I just wondered how you knew  --  But of course , if there are going to be difficulties , we 'd better not be wasting each other 's time- - Not at all , not at all ! Please do n't mis- understand me ! I was only  --  my own part in it is simply to make in- quiries . It 's a matter of political advertisingwhich requires absolute confidence . Do you understand ? The gentle voice seemed to hesitate , then said :  --  Of course . What medium , may I ask , did you have in mind ? . . .  --  That has n't been wholly decided . What I was going to suggest  --  will you hold the line a minute while I consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sill beside thep150bowl of apples , the earpiece downward , he crossed the room to the mantelpiece , lifted thenotice of the art-show from beside the candle , read it carefully , then went to the Colonial mirror which hung on the rear wall . His back to the light , he peered at the shadowed and elongated face which he saw there , leaned closer to it , grinned at it with a conscious evilness of expression , his hands all the whilein his pockets , then turned again toward the window and stood motionless . The thing was so easy as to be meaningless . If it was all going to be as simple as this  --  ! And the poor little man was so eager , so keen to get the job ! Waiting there , hardly daring to breathe . Perhaps it would be a good thing to create a danger . If the enemy did n't hit back Returning to the telephone , he lifted it quietly and said :  --  Mr. Jones ?  --  Yes ?  --  My partner thinks that perhaps the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in person . Now as it happens , I 'm usually not very free during the day , and I wondered whether it would be possible for me to come and see you this evening somewhere . Wouldp151it be convenient for me to call on you at your home , for instance ? Or have you a telephone there ?  --  Why , yes , I guess so- -I mean , do you live in Boston ?  --  No , I live in Cambridge . 85 Reservoir Street.  --  Reservoir Street . Let 's see , just where is that ?  --  If you take a Huron Avenue car , it 's only a couple of minutes from the car . I 'll be there all evening , and I 'll be very glad to have a talk with you . I 'm sure you 'll find we can give you satisfactory service , and our prices are very reasonable.  --  I might come in about nine . Or if not , , I 'll perhaps give you a ring in a day or two.  --  The Cambridge number is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me there  --  K. N. Jones.  --  I see . K. N. Jones.  --  And as I say , I hope we can be of serv- ice to you . We 're not a large firm , but I think we know our business as well as most ! Allowing the little boast to hang unan- swered and plaintive on the wire for a few seconds , as if for the full savour of its eagerness , and for the completion of the picture ,  |p152Ammen  merely said " Very well , " and hung up the receiver without waiting for any further reply . In the ensuing silence , it was curiously as if some one had left the room . He replaced the telephone on the table , then began once more to examine Gerta 's odd picture  --  but as he gazed at that surface of honeycombed sil- ver it was not a lunar volcano , nor Gerta , he was looking at , or looking into , so prolongedly and earnestly , but the identity of K. N. Jones : the little man with the clipped moustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little manwith the suave and deliberately ingratiating voice . It was as if he were sitting there , the one who wanted to be killed , in the depths of the picture as in the depths of a mirror , his hands relaxed on the edge of the desk , towards which his curious inward-looking eyes were directed downward . The expres- sion , and the attitude , were those of despair . What was it , exactly , that had created this impression  --  which , though faint , was so defi- nite ? And was the situation in any way altered by this ? But why should it be ? Opening Gerta 's little writing-bureau , he sat down and looked through the recent letters P153in the pigeon-hole at the right . One from her mother in New York , with details of an at- tack of sciatica and iodine treatment ; a card signed Petra from Washington , with a photo- graph of the Adams Memorial by Saint Gaudens ; his own postcard of two days ago inscribed " Dislocation Number One . " But nothing from Sandbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , there was no reason why he should have written  --  yet . Quite likely they had arranged a meeting for today by telephone : to discuss the latestphase of the Ammen situation . And when they did , Sandbach would get a surprise : he would find himself perched on the top of a towering scaffold which had , as it were , grown up under him during the night . A nightmare. 85 Reservoir Street . 85 Reservoir Street ! The day opened swiftly to left and right , like an immense stage from which the scenery was being slid into the wings , the prospect widened , and far off he saw the godlike arm and hand thrust violently downward from the hurrying clouds , the index finger point- ing silently at a single house , then gone likea whirlwind . The arm and hand were his own , the house would soon be his , all that wasin it would soon be known .
