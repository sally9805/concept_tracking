AN INTRODUCTION TO ERIC A STORY BY ELLIS ST . JOSEPH N OW that the murder was a thing accomplished , Eric felt suddenly relieved and surfeited . Miss Prung , the governess , hung from a rope in the nursery where Eric had hanged her ; and no one , he felt sure , was as yet aware of the killing except Miss Prung and himself . The lady had been fully cognizant of his proceedings for a good half hour , or , to be exact , from the instant when Eric had slipped the rope over her head and encompassed the thin neck in its noose , until that later and even more ecstatic moment , when , with a shiver of pain and ultimate horror , her bulging eyes had opened upon eternity . Perhaps it was more than thirty minutes , but it seemed less , his interest had so intensified the time ; he had just stood there , thrillingly near her kicking feet , wringing his fingers with a nervous delight , and watched the contortions of her changing face : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain ; the grimace of twitching terror , and the final mask of death . It seemed that he had hanged five Miss Prungs , not one ; and he was glad , terribly glad , that he had chosen her to be his  --  yes , he must qualify the word  --  his first victim . His idea , his great idea , had dawned very suddenly upon him , so late as yesterday , when , in the company of some friends , he had attended a matinee performance of marionettes . By a freakish chance of fate , the little theater was given that day to a presentation of " The Tragedy of Mr. Punch . " The play was lovely , Eric thought , and the puppets excellent ; practiced fingers manipulated the invisible wires and coaxed them into oblivion . The mechanical actors moved and spoke like living souLs , expired with the real anguish of dying men ; nothing was wanting to the illusion . Eric experienced an almost childish delight in the company of so many delighted children and he followed the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunkard : by his frightful appearance one might have foretold his doom . He beat Toby , his faithful dog , and killed him ; he beat Judy , his wife , to death ; and when the Hangman came to hang him , he hanged the Hangman . It was a marvellous show . At its conclusion , as the gaudy curtain fell upon the gory scene , Eric stood up and applauded and , with all the little children who surrounded him , he clapped and called for more . He remembered this very clearly now , every wooden gesture and each fluting voice , but the precise moment of his inspiration and his subsequent decision , these seemed echoes of a distant epoch and quite beyond recall . Perhaps their inception antedated the performance , perhaps they had been born in him and had motivated his every action from birth , culminating in his desire to sec " The Tragedy of Mr. Punch " ; if so , then yesterday 's playlet was only a stimulus to his unconscious yearning , a sharp prod to his sleeping mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a deeply meditative one , and the sight of so many murders , rendered real by his sympathetic imagination , had excited rather than appeased his thirst for . . . But the thing must be nameless lest the horror become familiar and lose some particle of its awfulness . Murder it would be when committed , but in the formless state of his present mind it remained an apparition , the faceless ghost of a departed twilight . He was vaguely disturbed by the haunting persistency of a thought , the thought that he had thought all this before , in every detail , and was reliving some darkly-ancient incident , half-remembered , from his own past . Like an artist who has blocked in the composition on a grateful canvas , there remained nothing for Eric but the light sketch of his sitter 's portrait . What an immense problem to solve in the span of one single night ! How close he came to the heart of darkness , in the stormy course of his thought , Eric knew ; there were times when he was lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cavernous maw of a hideous monster . But as these visions fast faded and apprehension left him , a feeling of power came upon Eric , a bigness that swelled him beyond the limiting confines of his bed and home : he continued to grow and expand until his enormous figure loomed over the city , casting an invisible shadow in the night , and all the millions of little people , observed through the boxlike windows of their apartment houses , were seen as one gigantic puppet show . Eric suddenly discovered that he was like God and , like God , he movedin a cloak of darkness . The very multiplicity of his choice , the power to murder any one of a million men and women , his tenable position to take life or permit it  --  this confirmed his resolution and filled him with a thrilling importance . He turned and tossed in his solitude , longed for light and the moment when he might point a random finger at some unsuspecting stranger ; he rebelled at his impotence of the moment and cursed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep but a rehearsal of death ? And as Eric remembered this , his little lips smiled queerly , somewhat crookedly , and almost tenderly , as if pleased by this elaborate preparation for the slaughter , and soon after he fell into the deep untroubled slumber of a child . How long he had slept , Eric did not know ; but when he awoke , it was still dark , still night , and his first conscious thought was the last on which he had closed his eyes . To point a random finger at some unsuspecting stranger  --  no , that made light of the killing , rendered it a passing incident ; it was too like culling flowers in a strange field at midnight . He would realize the full might of his act only if he recognized the vital force of the life thus taken , its frightening importance , and confront it in the extreme moment with his own superiority . In giving a face to this nameless body he must draw from real life ; and with the name on his little lips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his house ? First , there was his old father , a fat bloated man with a hard mole on one nostril and a thick bristling beard that grew over his soft mouth and hurt Eric 's hairless cheek as the old man kissed him good-night . He had a bald skull with a circular fringe of black hair which grew long and thin and was plastered over the shining baldness . His paunch  --  the way it was encased in large baggy trousers  --  made Eric slightly ill ; but , above all , he hated the manner in which the old man removed his spectacles as he sat down to the dinner table . He wiped them with a clean napkin , adjusted them carefully upon his nose , and then peered over them at the collation of bowls and dishes of food before him . " The happiest days of our lives , " his father was fond of saying , " are the days of our childhood . I shall never forget . . . " And as he went on interminably , Eric clenched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled with an agony of resentment , was forced to sit there silent . How he longed to kill this self-righteous man who had forgotten even that he no longer remembered , and mouthed such meaningless words ! And do you remember , you stupid old man , the nights of your childhood , the long feverish nights , as interminable as one of your speeches , and meaningless with unknown forms and half-sensed horror ? Do you remember those shapes which glided past your bed , taking on color in the darkness , and kissed your cold lips with a hideous affection ? What of those ominous words that danced before your eyes and glowed with an unruly fire ? Have you never felt so bitter that the thought of death was sweet ? But his father spoke on , scarcely aware of Eric 's frozen smile and desperate eyes , spoke on ; he discussed politics , and business , and economics , and prison reform , and better wages for the people . His conversation had become a dull monologue that at times rocked hysterically upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself away from the table , knocking down his chair , and rushed precipitantly into the drawing-room . This was his father 's forum , a cold stilted room , furnished with his father 's easy chair and artificial flowers enclosed in a glass globe which belonged to his father 's mother , and an upright piano that had come down through generations of his father 's people ; here , shaking with a nervous anxiety , he thrust his face into the dim recesses of a high cheval mirror . It was with a feeling of now or never , and a desire to know the truth at all costs , that he searched the image of his reflection , the thin peaked nose , the white transparency of his skin , the formless little lips , and burning eyes  --  all this , for one single mark or resemblance which might establish an indisputable consanguinity with his father . Just as Miss Prung 's entrance into the room was announced by the swishing of taffeta skirts on the threshold , Eric noticed , or thought he saw , the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fainted . It would be pleasant if the old man were suddenly to disappear , or to die in natural order ; but to kill him , to come into physical contact with him , was odious to Eric , and he dismissed the idea with a quick repulsion . No , not his father , better still , Tant'Helene . That was his stepmother , a French woman with unnatural blond hair . She was small and plump , with large nervous eyes , a wide nose , and rubbery lips ; powder and rouge coated her swarthy complexion , and a thick line of crayon accentuated the heavy black brows which formed a continuous line across her low forehead . Her many gestures were abrupt and startling , her hands were the largest that Eric had ever seen ; her tightly laced corset was in constant evidence beneath the clinging silk , usually black , which she wore to enhance her yellow hair . She was openly and proudly addicted to the use of perfumes : bottles of narcissus , violet , lilac , heliotrope , and lily-of-thevalley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from day to day , flooded the house with their heavy odor . Eric disliked her intensely . For-merly he remembered his own mother , a little thin anaemic woman ; but since the advent of Tant'Helene this memory was murdered , and the two women had merged into one . There had been a time when the dead woman appeared to him in apparitions of sudden and startling violence , apparelled in the livid beauty of a medieval saint  --  appeared to him with the astounding clarity of a stained-glass window illuminated by lightning at night . Then the dark years seemed to roil from under him , a long line of seasons called in military count , and he remembered ; he remembered that his mother 's name was Mary , and that he had been an infant in her arms . But these marvellous visions had long since ceased , were superseded by an unscrupulous reality ; now it was his stepmother , Tant'Helene in carpet slippers and a bathrobe , who trudged through his little room silently with red rubber gloves on her enormous hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Eric was hopelessly fascinated by the woman , so much so , that the very name of Tare-Helene had a terrible beauty of its own . He was irresistibly compelled to follow her from room to room throughout the house , listening to her unending conversations over the telephone , watching as she rouged her lips like some pouting mannequin in a hand mirror  --  and all the time he looked with a grave uncritical countenance . His continual presence , the noiseless steps of his dogged pursuit , his silent admission of a conscious wrongdoing , these things annoyed and irritated , even drove her volatile temper to distraction . Time after time she sent him away , back to Miss Prung and the nursery ; but always , when least expected and hardly heard , sometimes standing on the threshold hesitantly , often just behind her as she walked , he was there . He frightened her . " Why do you always follow me ? " she screamed in thick guttural tones . " What do you hope to find ? " " I hate silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street was filled with a bluish twilight and a blanket of white snow covered the gutter , when tong shadows fell from the dark windows and drowned the rooms in an obscure gloom , Eric stole into his stepmother 's bedroom and began to ransack the drawers of her bureau . Tant'Helene , wrapped in furs , had long since departed for tea ; his old father would not come for an hour from business ; Miss Prung was asleep in the nursery . What he was after Eric did not know ; he knew only that the empty dark room drew him with an irresistible force . As he opened the door a wave of cold air bathed his face and made myriads of little goose-pimples rise on his arms and legs and the nape of his thin neck . He stood in the forbidden doorway and listened . Downstairs in the drawing-room an old German clock , the last gift of his father 's dead sister , chimed five . Five times it chimed with an unbearable interval between each chime , and each chime seemed to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bureau , opening drawer after drawer , digging his lean fingers into piles of her undergarments , unearthing sachets of lavender and old rose , discovering her elastic garters , pink ribbons , embroidered corset covers , her newly washed brassieres , shields for her arm pits  --  he was drawn by an insatiable curiosity ; there were the awful rubber-red gloves , there in the miscellaneous box of photographs , pins , cigarettes , and fallen hair . And here her creams , her ointments and unguents , her salves , bath salts , cleansing fluid , etc . . . . He was holding a pair of black-silk opera hose , the longest stockings he ever had seen , holding them up to the light , the better to see and feel their soft mesh , when he heard a smothered cry , and in the dark mirror before him saw a reflection of Tant'Helene . She looked ghastly . Eric felt the opera hose run through his fingers like water , and the life in him seemed to flow and fall with them . Her sealskin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open wide and looked all black inside . For one fleeting minute there was a deafening siknee , during which each gazed at the other 's reflection and wished to wake from this strange dream into reality . Suddenly coming to life , Tant'Helene ran across the room , roughly clutched Eric 's shoulder and turned him around : from then on , Eric saw nothing but her eyes , two wheels of dirty fire , and heard her screaming voice : " You thief ! Thief ! What are you doing in my room ? Mon dieu , I have you now ! Caught in the act ! Now you ca n't lie to me , you ca n't make such innocent eyes at me ; I know you now ! If you were my child I should kill you ! But no , no , no ; not mine , his ! His , you robber ; do you hear me ? His ! " As she recoiled to strike him she caught the expression in his eyes , and her arm went paralyzed . In one glance she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the red rug , the long black hose in a pile at his feet , the intimate details of her life exposed and bare  --  she saw this , and she saw the expression in his eyes , and she lost her voice and blushed to the roots of her hair . " Mere de dieu ! Mere de ( lieu ! " Eric stood erect . Tant'Helene backed away from him in real horror , mumbling to herself as she went , " You are no child , you are an old man .. . . You 're a horrible old man ! " She fled from the room . I might have killed her then when she turned her hack and fled ; not when I saw that awful reflection in the mirror , not when she stood before me , but when she turned her plump back and fled . It would have been easy then ; then I should have enjoyed it , but now , now it 's too late . Then she knew me for what I am , and that gave me courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  courage ? I can murder anyone I choose ! . ? . But not Tant'Helene , I must n't murder her . I do n't dare to  --  not because I ca n't , or do n't want to  --  but because of her hands ! So ran his thoughts as he lay in bed , meditating and premeditating , and now , more than ever , bent upon murder . The old man was a shabby phantom , hungry for death , and Eric his invisible host ; but he dismissed him in the manner of a dainty lady who , for fear of soiling the tip of her glove in a beggar 's palm , avoids his eloquent eye . Tant'Helene was likewise tabu , the untouchable , the naked Life-in-Death who wins her throw with Death . Unable to accept his two intended victims by reason of his own weakness , he determined upon a third , someone who would bear the brunt of their crimes , his revenge , and expiate in their place . Who else lived in the house ? There remained but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Eric 's mind long before any consideration of the others ; he knew this , and in recognizing his subconscious desire achieved a complete fulfillment . It made Eric so happy that , before he fell into a dreamless sleep , he decided upon the name and the manner of the deed ; so deeply happy that , when awakened the following morning by Miss Prung , the governess , he threw his arms around her thin neck and kissed her stupid face . This was three hours before he hanged her , and the sun was still shining , and his parents were downstairs eating soft-boiled eggs at breakfast , and already little children were skip-ping rope in the street , and playing Jack-the-Ripper , and Jack-be-nimble , Jack-be-quick , Jack - jump - over - thecandle-stick . " Good morning , my dear ! " said Miss Prung , and added cheerfully , " Such a lovely bright sunny morning ! It 's time to be up and doing ! " Her voice was naturally so wan and undecisive , so pathetically weak , that her intended bright remarks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really , which frightened you with their own timidity ) sounded absurd and were screamingly funny to Eric . Her soft loose hands fluttered nervously all about her through the air like two large white moths . Evidently she had intended to draw her thin brown hair into a bun at the hack of her neck , but it escaped on the way in innumerable wisps which she constantly smoothed and sought to replace . Miss Prung , with a tendency to chicken-breastedness , thin and undeveloped , over forty , suggested an anxious child about to recite in assembly . As he sat up and studied her , Eric looked like a little lecherous old man being served in bed by a frightened young girl . He bathed and dressed , under Miss Prung 's embarrassed supervision ; and then , with an air of coming into her own , she led him into the old nursery which now served as schoolroom . For this purpose it was bare and whitewashed , furnished with a large chair , a small chair , a large desk , and a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likewise in oak , and , dispossessed from his father 's drawing-room , a stuffed owl with glassy eyes , buried in the dim recesses of a dust-catcher . Pictures of our dead Presidents lined the walls ; unhealthy geraniums in terra-cotta pots cluttered the triple window sill ; in one corner was an untidy heap of toys piled one on the other . From the center of the ceiling hung a stiff chandelier , one end firmly planted in the plaster , the other twisted like two clutching arms , upwards and downwards , into a gas candle and electric bulb . In a black bowl on the work table a dying narcissus sent its roots , like tentacles of white rubber , into the wet pebbles ; an opened bud , folded in coarse green shoots , was already decayed , yellow , and crisp . Miss Prung sat down on the large chair , with her back to the window ; facing her , Eric sat down in the small chair . The governess opened a large book , and as she scanned the page intently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad childish face to a consideration of the chandelier which hung above them and then to the indiscriminate pile of toys in one corner . Thin as he was , he sat with all the enormous poise of obesity ; the monstrous nature of his intentions gave him a bigness and bulk which dwarfed the schoolroom . Back and forth , from the stiff chandelier to the pile of toys , his attention swung until , suddenly looking up , Miss Prung commanded it . " We shall begin with geography , " announced Miss Prung tentatively . Eric nodded in the affirmative . " What is the largest country in South America ? " asked Miss Prung . " Brazil , " said Eric . " What is the next largest country ? " she inquired . " Argentine . " " ' What is the capital of Peru ? " " Lima . " " By whom was it settled ? " " The Spani  --  sh . " And so on . If some stranger with an ear to the wall had listened to their voices in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant and sincere in her questions , he would have thought the boy most anxious to inform his curious companion ; and this same stranger might have wondered why , if he had the acute penetration , why those answers sounded like the soft explosions of a string of Chinese firecrackers . There was a timed regularity about them , the deliberate precision of a man whose every word has its place in a definite pattern . The study of geography was concluded , and a review of history begun ; then they advanced with rapid stride through the simple maze of spelling , grammar , and arithmetic . Finally they were finished . Miss Prong sat back in the large chair , sighed deeply , and closed her tired eyes . Eric was tense , excited , alert ; his work commenced with the conclusion of her labors . When she opened her eyes at last it was to discover that Eric , perched on the edge of his stool , was intently scrutinizing her . " We will now have recreation , " Miss Prung announced with an accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said these words that Eric with difficulty controlled his countenance . As if he were in the theater , attending the performance of a terror play , the most meaningless humors gave rise and excuse to a delirious laughter . But he was silent , expectant , waiting . " Tell me what you did yesterday afternoon , " asked Miss Prung . Eric was waiting for this . " Where did you go , my dear ? " " I went to the puppet show , " said Eric . Again he experienced that strange feeling that this conversation , all this , had happened before , a long time ago . " And tell me , what did you see ? " queried Miss Prung . " ' The Tragedy of Mr. Punch , ' said Eric . It seemed as if they spoke by rote , as though each had learned his given part , and in performance now recited their lines from memory . The dramatic title awoke a show of amazement in Miss Prung 's stupid kind face ; she was startled , but having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that she was not very clever , even suspected that she was rather dull , and it was sad to consider this fact ; moreover , she abhorred deception and strove for honesty ; but , in relations with her pupil , through consideration for his welfare , she deemed it wise , much wiser , to disguise and hide her own inadequacy . Miss Prung hoped that for what she lacked in intelligence and real erudition she might substitute in real companionship ; and the past , with its long series of little charges , had confirmed her modest intentions and given her reason to hope . " When I was a little girl , " Miss Piling was accustomed to say , " I never played with the other children . " And sometimes , with more truth perhaps , and exactitude , she added , " They never played with me . " There was a peculiar catch in her normal voice , a habit of speech rather than an expression of grief , which weighted these remarks with an unintentional pathos that was quite beyond her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was a governess of forty ; and Miss Prang liked to believe in her happier moments that she played with little children , that she was one of them , and that they liked to play with her . It was the unswerving ambition of her life to become a child ( before she was too old to enjoy it , of course ) , and though the years hung all about her like dried winter leaves to an oak , Miss Prung thought she had achieved fulfillment . For this reason she anticipated the hour of recreation and play , took an active part in it , and tried to enter into the spirit of things . Eric watched her . Avoiding a repetition of the tragic title , " Can you tell me the story ? " Miss Prung asked hastily . " He 's a drunkard , " said Eric . " And what happens to him , my clear ? " she thought it wise to ask , that she might possibly point out some obvious moral . " He beats his dog and kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued quickly , " but what happens to him ? Mr. Punch ? " She began to think that it might have been wiser if Eric had remained at home . At best , the theater is not a proper place for little children . Miss Prung decided that in the future she would attend and censor any production which the boy expressed a desire to see . " He beats his wife , Judy , 0 death . " " How awful ! And then , surely , something happens to him ? Mr. Punch is punished ? " How she wished that she were better acquainted with that particular history ! She thought that she now knew the worst : Eric should not have seen the play . He was an impressionable child ; one never knows what horrible ideas such children may receive from plays , even puppet plays . " Tell me what happens to him ! " she cried . " He hangs the Hangman . " This went utterly beyond Miss Prung 's feeble and excited mentality . She wanted to understand this , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Almost frightened , she cried out , " I do n't understand ! Explain what you mean , Eric ! " Eric was waiting for this . He slowly stood up , walked across the room , and began to search in the pile of toys . Dismayed , Miss Prung followed his movements with an uneasy apprehension ; if this was some game she was determined to appreciate , to take part in it . Eric uncovered a long measure of rope , formerly utilized for street exercise , and long since discarded amongst his other useless odds and ends . Now Miss Prung was watching , completely fascinated , as he drew up his little chair to the center of the room , to that spot immediately under the chandelier . " I 'll show you . " So it was to he a game . Anything to take his mind away from that horrid recital of cruelty and murder ! She corrected herself quickly  --  as the chair , the rope , and his lingering gaze upon the chandelier formed a concrete and ineradicable pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit anything that she might better understand , better grasp the problem , that she might point a moral period to the child 's awful tale . This was her thought as Eric showed her what to do , how to stand , and what was next expected of her . A sensation of terror , delicious in its daring , and yet tempered by a consciousness of fun and mimicry , completely overcame her scruples ; as the little boy went unerringly about his task , Miss Prung abandoned herself to a full enjoyment of her precarious situation . " What next ? " she cried . " What shall I do next ? " Eric demonstrated . " Oh ! Oh ! " she screamed in shrill delight , like an infant whose naked toe meets its first cold wave . By this time , thoroughly submerged in the spirit of things , she had lost sight of her original objective . For one fleeting instant she was aware of her fate . It may have been the expression in Eric 's eyes that warned her ; or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt the tip of a gigantic wing brush her stupidly smiling lips . However it was , she knew ; and her mouth broke open with horror . " Remember : I 'm a marionette ! " she shouted . " We 're marionettes ! " Eric found himself smiling as he kicked the chair . He delivered a vicious kick at its rungs that sent it flying , from under her and away from him , across the room and into the wall . Into that kick he poured all the violent blood that surged in him and sought outlet ; aimed at uo one , it hit out indiscriminately , at Tant'llelene and the old man , at himself and the fate that had formed him , at the calendar of bitter tears that marked his brief time . Miss Prung hung from the rope , her chin held higher than usual ; and her soft white hands fluttered all about her like large moths around an agitated flame . Miss Prung 's legs worked as if she were pedaling a bicycle ; Miss Prung 's eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less as they strained to see more ; Miss Prung 's jaw , dislocated by the fall , gave her face in expression the exaggerated fear of a tragic mask . Her feet , encased in high-laced shoes , were not fourteen inches from the floor . Suddenly , the chandelier gave ; it gave from the ceiling and fell in a shower of white plaster ; it fell for a few inches and then , with an abrupt jerk , was brought up by the stout wires and tubing which lined it . Eric backed away against the wall . His one disappointment was , that Miss Prung , as she hung there , seemed completely inhuman ; there was no blood upon her blue taffeta , no loud voice to embody her agony ; she merely hung , and twisted , like a puppet that has finished its performance , and is hung from the shelf , still warm and trembling with mimic life . Sometime later , as he closed the door softly behind him , Eric felt relieved and surfeited . The murder was a thing accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted in the nursery where Eric had hanged her . Then , suddenly , Eric became afraid , and he ran for the staircase ; he floated down the steps like a man in a dream , and his shadow came up to meet him as it fell down the flight at his feet . Voices started and expanded in his cars , grew into conversation , and became real as he walked into the drawing-room . He walked into the drawing-room slowly . Tant'Hgene was entertaining a friend , two friends , perhaps three . The room was filled with the heavy odor of her perfume . In one corner , his father , dispossessed from his own chair by an audacious guest , peered over his trembling spectacles as he spoke , and with one finger felt the hard mole on the nostril of his ugly nose . " Eric ! " said his stepmother . " Eric , my dear , " cried Tant'llelene , lifting her guttural voice above the steady flow of her husband 's words , " Eric , I want you to say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this is Eric ! I want to introduce you .. . only eight years old and so big ! .. . My son , Eric ! "
