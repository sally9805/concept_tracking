The searchers were guided by a map and let-. ter anonymously mailed from Chicago , supposedly by the kidnappers. , For all of the nineteen days of her captivity , it is now believed , the child had been living in this sun-broiled , desert hole . That she survived is considered a miracle . A. few more days and the excavation would have been her grave . Nevertheless , though so weak from privation that she could not walk and bearing the cruel marks left by the shackles on her ankles , the little girl was still mentally , alert when she was found .

The family had announced they had raised $10,000 of . the $15,000 demanded by the abductors . Explicit directions to the living tomb in which the child was confined were contained in a special delivery air mail letter received by Governor B. B. Mocur at Phoenix this morning and sent here by a State highway patrolman . The letter , which was postmarked Chicago , was not signed , but its handwriting , according to Mr. , Houston , appeared to be identical with that of the original ransom note which was delivered to the parents of the child two hours after she disappeared , and of a second letter received last week . Obviously written by some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive out Broadway to Wilmont , turn south in Rincon Way , drive a mile east and walk 150 paces north .

They had been shaken by previous disappointments and . held little hope . Searchers in Despair . In despair after three hours ' , combing of the blazing hot desert , , the two men decided to separate in. order to cover more territory . Mr , Houston sighted a small mound covered with brush and cactus , and ran to it . Fearful that he might find only , the dead body of the missing child , he did not call at once to his companion , ' who was some distance away out of sight . Instead , he hurriedly cleared away an armful of debris from the slight elevation .

Do you know me ? " ? Mr. Houston asked gently . " Are you afraid of me ? " June looked up and in a weak voice answered : " : To , I 'm not afraid of you . I want my mama . " Mr. Houston joyfully called Robles , who came at top speed . He burst into tears as he saw his niece and for a moment he could not speak . " Do you know Lechi ? " Mr. Hous1 ton asked June , using the girl 's fa ' vorite nickname for her uncle . " Oh , yes , " she replied , trying to get to her feet . Then the two men realized for the first time that she was chained by the ankles to the side of the dugout in which she had been confined . June Frees Herself .

They dropped the key in to her and she was able to unfasten the padlock binding the chains about her ankles . She unlocked the padlock and the two men tenderly helped her out . Her skin was covered with a prickly heat rash , and one of her ankles was cruelly lacerated from the chains . The rescuers wrapped her in a coat and carried her to their car . On the way into the Robles home they did not ask her questions , not wishing to excite her , but she volunteered a little information . She said that at first she had had a mattress and pillow , but " they " took them away and gave her dirty sacks instead . She was carried in the back door of the home of her grandfather , Fernando Robles , wealthy cattleman . Her mother heard the excitement from her room upstairs and dashed down an d clasped the girl in her arms . June had recovered sufficiently later in the evening to give the authorities a little-information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill " and " Will " and that one of them wore gloves , but she did not describe them and was not pressed for further information . Hundreds of persons gathered in front of the Robles home tonight , after it had become known that the child was safe . The police eventually found it necessary to rope off the block . In the early , evening June had revived sufficiently so that her father carried her out on the porch in his arms . She waved her hands and threw kisses to the wildly cheering crowd . Other members of the family grouped about her , their faces wet with tears . Bread and Water Left . Deputy sheriffs went to the pit in which the girl was kept prisoner and brought back tonight the wood and tin frame with which it was lined , and the perforated tin roof . They found that the excavation was about six feet long , three feet deep and a little less than three feet wide . 1 In the pit were some wilted fruits and vegetables , part of a loaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rested on a pile of dirty . vermin-ridden gunny sacks . All the contents of the pit , including some pasteboard cartons which had contained food , were brought here for examination for fingerprints . So were some scraps of tin which were found on the ground near by . The chains which had pinioned the tiny prisoner 's legs turned out to be automobile and dog chains . They had been anchored to a large iron pipe which was driven deep into the ground . They also were brought here , and an effort will be made to trace them .
