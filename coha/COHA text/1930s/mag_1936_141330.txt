Just as rats make excellent laboratory animals for nutrition research , mice for cancer and monkeys for poliomyelitis , so ferrets are invaluable to influenza investigators . Ferret reactions were the basis of Harvard 's Dr. William Firth Wells 's demonstration last month that ultraviolet radiation kills the unknown germ or virus which causes that disease ( TIME , Aug. 3 ) . But many doctors think it probable that some infectious agencies change their form in different environments . The question remained : While human influenza could be communicated to ferrets , could ferret influenza be communicated to man ? <P> Last week an answer reached the U. S. from Britain . Dr. C. H. Stuart-Harris of London 's National Institute for Medical Research was scrutinizing some ferrets sick with influenza . One of the little animals sneezed right in the doctor 's face . Forty-five hours later he was in bed with influenza . Last week Dr. Stuart-Harris was up &; about again , able to proceed on the assumption that ferret influenza is the same as the malady in man .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
