FORTY-THIRD DIVISION A STORY IN TWO PARTS-PART II BY RALPH BATES A. PER:turned away from the couloir he experienced a sensation of weakness that he had not felt for many years ? the sensation of the beginner after a severe climb . His knees trembled and he was nervous in crossing the gully by which he had descended to the rocks of the Astorga . It was not the climb that had overstrung him , he knew , but emotion unleashed by the event in the couloir . For a moment he recoiled from it , as from a sudden revelation about himself . Then he heard shouting and these sensations vanished . On the crest of the Midday Peak , above him but out of sight , an enemy was calling , " Round to the col ; he ca n't get down here . " CulIon1 There must have been other patrols on the Maladetta , and they had heard the firing . ' But how did they know where I was ? " he thought as he raced across the cliff by an easy belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no other way of escape than to climb down to the narrow band of ice and snow that fringed the cliff base , and there was only one way of doing that , to abseil . There was no time for choice , the chimney in front of him ran out on to the smooth gray face below the weather-worn blocks . He tied the rope to his waist , wedged his way with knees and back as far down the chimney as he could go , flung the line over a block and paid himself out . The rope finished when hewas still six or seven feet above the rimaye , here four or five feet broad and fifteen or more feet deep . " No time to go back ; besides , I could n't , " he thought , and began to swing himself sideways , pushing on the cliff face with his feet . At the third swing he reached a spike and with a violent effort pulled himself erect upon it . " Leave the rope , " he muttered and , untying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It cost him a minute of anxiety as he released his ice axe and then , without hesitation , he leaped . He landed upon one knee , pitched forward , ramming his face against the snow ; could not position himself for a blow with the ice axe , slid , delivered a blow but failed to get the weight of his body upon the axe before he slid off the snow layer on to the scabby ice , encrusted with stones . He shot down the slope , feet spread , ripping cloth and skin , frantically striving to bunch himself and cover his head for the shock . He managed to draw his legs together a moment before he struck , broadside on , against a reef of rock . He bounced a foot clear of the reef and fell sprawling , ice axe clattering a dozen yards away . Half dazed , he dashed to recover his axe , and bolted for a narrow snow gully , flung himself into it on his side , the rifle barrel rattling over small rocks , and shot down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axe point behind him . Again he collided heavily with rocks ; as he staggered to his feet , a bullet struck a boulder to his left and thrummed away like an Aeolian harp . He plunged through a pool , scrambled over a bank , dropped clumsily down a wall of ten feet ; fell , tearing the palm of his hand , rose slowly , slightly sick , flung himself upon a snow slope , and slid down it under weakening control until he broke through its surface where rocks protruding through it had half melted the snow A bullet whined overhead as he dashed into a chaos of boulders to temporary safety . " Now come down , " he gasped , head throbbing , the pain of his left knee and thigh almost unbearable . Swaying , he unslung his rifle and chose his position . Two men were standing a little to one side of the dip between the Midday and the Corona Peaks . From his height , he guessed one of them to be the Enemy  --  the slayer of Agustin . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool I am ; shall I never learn to think ? " His mistake had lain in supposing that every man in a patrol of fifteen would be good enough for the Maladetta couloir . That was the route which inevitably suggested itself to a firstrate cragsman , but to no other . Half the enemy , under the Enemy 's leadership , had gone by the easy little southern glacier to the boulder slopes between the two Maladetta peaks . The Enemy must have been near by when Pere had opened fire . A near go ! Angry with himself , he fired at the two men , who darted to the rocks at the base of the Corona ridge . They did not answer his fire . " Ali , fool , " Pere exclaimed , " they 've lost me ; they 'd have thought I was hit . " He crept through the boulders toward the breach on the Estats ridge . No bullets sought him . Wearily he climbed to the summit of the eminence , parched with thirst . " They wo n't try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle pit . Yet he stood vigilant for two hours , until the descending sun cast its shadow upon the recess . There was no movement on the ridges . " They 're afraid to come down among the blocks , " he said aloud and felt great confidence in himself . He began search.ing for water , crawling over the warm blocks , many of them as large as a cottage . He heard the guttural sound of water in the hollows below them and at last he found a way down to the snowmelt , washed his abrasions in icy water , filled his flask , and climbed out , intending to rest for at least an hour . At the end of half an hour of clambering among that wilderness he seated himself behind a pile and ate a meal of bread , sausage , and sugar knobs , and was immediately refreshed . Shortly afterward he came to a corridor of unbelievably green though sparse grass , leading to a greener clearing in the sea of broken rock . The dung of izards lay all around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , smiling a little bitterly , thinking of the herd that had passed him in the mist ; there was a minute comfort in the thought . He sat down on a block and gave himself over to unhurried reverie . Perhaps the izards would come in the night . For all the harm he would do them they might come now , trooping along the corridor , the little ones skipping on the rocks or bunting their sniffing muzzles against the small udders . He imagined them , the agile voyagers of the snow , the soft-eyed , tender dwellers among the waste of stone , stepping lightly into this green oasis and grazing , ignoring him , as if he were invisible . The sun dipped suddenly behind the Posets . Small clouds , yellow-tinged , slid over the crest of the Maladetta . " Must get on the move , " he thought , " get out of this chaos before dark . " His left leg had become exceedingly painful , but he decided to make his way to the rendezvous with Jaime by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always go toward the enemy . If he 's waiting  --  and he wo n't be  --  you 'll have an equal chance . He was still clambering painfully from block to block when darkness was complete and the chaos expanded and became a world ; he was lost in the midst of a planetary surface of granite blocks . While he was upon the summit of the blocks the starlight was sufficient to disclose the outlines of the immobilized storm of granite , but below in the labyrinth of caves and tunnels he felt his way in darkness . Near the edge of the chaos it rained for a few minutes ; he sought shelter and slept near rumbling water , for two hours . When he awoke , shortly before midnight , the half-moon was leaping from cloud to cloud . He squatted for a few moments in the Corona pass and then decided to eat again and walked over to the Corona ridge and took out his food . As he did so a rifle shot rang out from the ridge summit . He saw the tawny flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the rocks and crawled to the foot of a wall and there took off his boots . He waited for a finger of cloud to poke out the moon , and then , leaving his sack and ice axe behind him , he climbed twenty feet up the easy rocks before the cloud slid by . As the light returned he lay motionless between two shark's-fin crags . In the next darkness he did not move but listened , lifting himself clear of cover . Ah , he breathed , hearing a faint clicking higher up the ridge . In the next interval of shade he picked his way swiftly across the ridge to the tumbled confusion of rocks on its flank . In two successive darknesses he moved and in the third he distinctly heard the click of metal above . Had the Enemy guessed his maneuver ? The click was from a different place , to his left , and near . He remained still for three shadows but heard nothing . When next the moon was covered he threw a stone toward the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard the faint scratch of nailed boots , farther off . " He 's going , " he commented mentally . He ventured to lift his head in the moonlight but saw nothing . As the cloud approached the moon he pitched a large stone , and again a rifle cracked ; fifty yards away , it seemed , and a little below the crest . Slowly he began to crawl toward the crest . There was no sound , then there was a tiny impact of stone well down the slope ; at Pere 's level . The skin prickled on his head but he suppressed the start his body attempted to make . For five minutes there was complete silence and he lay , trying to silence the sound of his breathing , a sharp stone interrupting the circulation of his left forearm . Again the click of metal sounded on the summit ridge and he swore in a whisper and said , " Fooled with my own trick , " and ignored the next sound of striking stone below him . The moon entered upon a cloud lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not dare lift his head . When the shadow crept over the ridge there was no guiding sound and he ceased moving well before the light shone out . In the following darkness he did not move , but raised himself and listened . There was no sound on the ridge . He shivered because of the chilling of the sweat on the small of his back , but waited another ten minutes and then crawled swiftly toward the ridge , slinging a cartridge ahead of him . The round fell with a metallic click , but there was no movement on the crest . In the next interval he laid his coat over a high rock and then , the moon shining upon the peak , he rapped the boulder with the rifle muzzle and drew the coat toward him . The Enemy did not fire . Half an hour later , having crawled another fifty yards , Pere stood up and there was no shot . " Gone , " he ejaculated ; " could n't stand it . " He felt sick . He slept that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the breach near the Tonnelle pass , and to his alarm neither Jaime nor the bag of rations was in the breach . Hungry and worn from restless sleep , he dawdled along the Unnamed ridge to the col , where he saw Carlos sitting on a rock on the very skyline , an ideal target . " Cullon , what in hell 's name are you doing there ? " he shouted , and the boy , abashed , made no answer . " Have n't I told you never to sit on a skyline , idiot ? You have n't the sense of a donkey ; and who in hell sent you here ? Get out of it , get down out of it , " Pere yelled and dragged the boy by the shoulder . " The Adjutant sent me , Pere . " " The Adjutant be damned . . . . I gave you orders , do you hear ? " Pere shouted . " What does he know about mountains ? He never saw a mountain till a month ago . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Dead . .. you say . " It was not until his next words that Pere changed his tone . " You say he 's dead . . . . Little Mother of God , how did it happen ? " " The Adjutant made a visit of inspection ; he wanted to see the passes you named in your report . He brought me here with him . We found Jaime in the Aran pass . " The boy was still afraid of the senior scout . " Dead ? " " Yes . . . The Adjutant said I was to watch Jaime 's passes , " continued the boy , " because . . " " No . " Pere spoke abstractedly , " No , you ca n't do that ; go back to your old patrol . III look after the high ground . " He was moved by kindness to the inexperienced lad , as well as by his hate of the Enemy . That the Enemy had killed Jaime he never even questioned . " The Adjutant wants you to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The adjutant can go to hell , " he answered coldly ; " give me my rations . " " 1 . . . I . . . " the boy 's mouth dried and it was only with effort that at last he said , " I have n't got them . " " You have n't ! " " No . ? . the comrades thought you would n't obey . . . . You did n't report the first time .. . " " So they thought they 'd starve me out , ehl Christ Jesus . . . get out , get out . . . . " Pere spoke with ferocity and advanced on the boy , who flinched but stood his ground . " Pere , do n't . . . . The party cell took a decision . . . " " About me , to starve me out , eh  --  the party . . . " The rage in Pere 's gaze increased and he did not finish the sentence , but half-turned and , keeping cover behind the rocks , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to return , and then , taking out his own ration of bread , ran after Pere and forced it upon him . " Keep it , I can look after myself . " " No , Pere ... please , comrade . " There was such distress in the boy 's eyes that Pere accepted the gift . With an effort he controlled his voice . " Listen , Carlos , you keep off these passes , do you hear ? " " Are n't you going to report , Pere ? " Rebellion reinforced angry hate of the Enemy . Pere strode away , without further speech . That night , driven by hunger , and the obsession which had taken hold of his mind , Pere visited the Renclusa refuge . There he killed the fascist sentry and boldly entered the dining room . Though the rest of the guard was sleeping in the warm kitchen , he helped himself to tins of preserves and a bagful of bread . In the chapel , dug into the solid rock of a ridge in front of the refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six boxes of hand grenades . He carried all this to the foot of a small rock ledge and , having ascended to the summit of the escarpment , he withdrew the pin of a grenade and dropped it among the rest of the war material , and running a few paces , flung himself down . The explosion roared among the peaks . The Renclusa summit appeared and disappeared with the flash . He lay all day on the summit , overlooking the enemy patrol 's headquarters , brooding over the Division , Agustin , Jaime ; building up his obsession , fomenting the rebellion within him . The Enemy , who appeared not to be the commander of the patrol , was among them ; sitting before the refuge , drawing maps , it appeared , all the morning and afternoon . A week went by of hunger and joyless effort . Two attitudes toward the 43rd struggled within Pere . He tried to consider that he had broken with organized resistance to the enemy , and in long debates with himself sustained that he should never have joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular army . He knew , none the less , that the irregular waging of trench warfare was , by definition , impossible . The Italian and German invasion of Spain had changed the whole technical character of the war ; the day of guerrillas seemed to have gone . When he considered this his hatred of the invaders flamed up within him . The mechanical aid to the rebels was violating the nature of the Spaniard , he felt . Man to man , valor against valor  --  that was the Spanish way of fighting . Not factory against factory , bald-headed engineer against a peasant , a coppersmith . His trapping of the patrol in the Maladetta couloir had seemed to release something within him at which he himself was surprised . One of his most persistent memories during these days and nights was of the wailing couloir after the enemy patrol had fallen from the Tower . The incident both delighted and repelled him ; sometimes , indeed , he felt sick in remembering the event . There were cavernous recesses within his own being , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping and yelling in ferocious glee . " War poisons everything , makes you love killing , " he said once or twice , but more often he savagely repeated , " Weep , little Italian , weep ; you came to make war . " He had no proof , but he invariably thought of the Enemy as an Italian . It was the Italian Encmy who was drawing him away from his comrades . . . and when he used that word in place of Division he was suddenly sick at heart as well as in mind . He felt , and acutely , the contradiction in his position  --  that he should have broken with his unit now when the whole Division must make guerrillas . Yet it seemed that he was the Division 's chief defense against sniping attack . It was justification for his conduct , he argued . He was on the Llosas ridge when , placing his hand upon a boulder and leaping lightly into the gully , he almost ran down upon the izard . She was sitting upon a ledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying not to disturb the stones , smiling , delighted , and then cautiously sat down , astonished that the beast did not leap to her feet and escape . The izard was sick , he thought ; she was shivering and there was appeal in her face . Her mouth was open slightly and she breathed quickly . " Do n't be afraid , senora , " he said , and then could not restrain a hasty movement which startled the izard . There was a little cry from beside the animal . The kid was half-hidden by her flank . The izard must have given birth a few minutes before he had arrived in the gully , for the little one was still too weak to stand . It uttered a weak cry , bumping its head clumsily against the mother , and she licked it and at once turned back and regarded him . The izard 's winter coat of blackish gray had not yet entirely disappeared , though the brown summer hair was prominent ; she was a young animal , he considered , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least a thousand feet too high , senora , " he thought , and another part of his brain recorded the fact , " Something 's driven you up here out of the woods where you should be just now . What will you eat ? " There was so little grass at this height . Perhaps she had been on her way to the green oasis in the wilderness where he had seen the izard dung . Her shivering increased for a few minutes and then the kid bleated again and she made a sudden movement of her body , and resettling , pushed her face against the kid , disregarding him . The kid tried to stand up and after several efforts succeeded , planting its feet wide , its head hanging . It tottered one step and tumbled over her flank , and the mother , stretching herself , bleated also and the kid began to suck . At the end of five minutes it was asleep . Once or twice the izard looked at him , but for half an hour she made no movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great care essayed to move . The izard was frightened and scrambled to her feet and climbed one or two yards up the gully , but was too fatigued to leap the low obstacle of a smooth rock rib . She gave up the attempt to drive him away and returned to her awakened baby . The kid walked two or three steps to meet her , its legs already strong enough to stand securely . The mother bleated and the kid replied , and both lay down again , the little one pressing itself against the warm white belly ; the mother ceased to be afraid and lowered her head upon her flank , partly covering the kid , which protested and scrambled out . The mother bleated her protest and pushed the little one with her head . For a moment it resisted and then fell with a comical suddenness so that Pere chuckled aloud . The mother was very much startled . At the end of its first hour of life the kid scrambled to its feet , its weakness gone , and stepped away from its mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it descended the gully boldly , for four or five feet , its tiny hooves tapping nervously on the rock . For a while it stood gazing out over the waste of small stones , along the Llosas valley , as if attracted by the glittering tarns . Presently it returned to its mother and sucked . A little later the kid began to move about the gully again and this time attempted to climb on to the rocks of the ridge face . The izard 's toleration of him delighted Pere . He also felt what he could not define , that after three weeks in the wilderness this encounter was especially gracious to him . His pleasure was boundless when the kid trotted up to the gully and stared at him , tilting its head , sniffing . He encouraged it when it tried to cross the rock rib . He was watching the kid 's growth ; it was visibly growing strong . The giddiness and helplessness in one hour had become sturdiness ; and in two hoursmore , he knew from shepherds ' talk , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain hazard . Suddenly the mother became startled and stood up , listening , staring at Pere . Again she moved to attack him , but though the rock rib would have been no obstacle , she did not do so . She did not take up her old position , however , but quickly and nervously descended the gully , going out of sight . The kid climbed down easily behind her . Ten minutes later he saw the izard out upon the stony wastes facing the gully , bleating to the kid , which he could not see . Pere , forgetting the izard , suddenly became alert and released the safety catch of his rifle . Above , on the crest , he heard a shot , and he crouched , resting the barrel on the stones at the head of the gully . There was no answering shot and he was wondering whether it could have been a signal when he heard the kid bleat , and glancing down , saw it standing by the body of its mother . The white stomach was upturned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick steps on the ridge , of rope-shod feet . His hand adjusted itself to the butt . As the Enemy appeared Pere fired , in anger at the izard 's death . Satisfaction surged through him , impelling the blood fiercely through his body , the recoiling impact of accomplished vengeance . Then quietness settled over him . The Enemy was not dead , for Pere could hear groans upon the ridge . He descended the gully a little way , traversed the face of the mountain , and reached the crest behind the Enemy . There was no need for caution , the rifle had fallen from the Enemy 's grasp . He strode up to the fallen man and shouted , " Why did you kill the izard ? " The Enemy looked up ; in his eyes hatred was more visible than pain . " Why did you kill the izard ? " Pere repeated , his voice sinking . " Where are you hit ? " He knelt beside the man , who continued to stare in hatred until his eyes closed in pain . FORTY-THIRD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunic , at which the man opened his eyes , pain intensifying the hate in them . The long , intellectual , but undistinguished face was paling rapidly . Caution again prompted Pere and he crouched low beside the man . The Enemy 's hand , stained with colored inks , moved feebly , and Pere , following the movement , removed the Luger pistol the Enemy was carrying . Glancing at the rifle , he saw that it was a MannlicherCacano . " Are you an Italian ? " he demanded sharply , and the Enemy did not reply ; he shook the man by his tunic . " Italian ? " he demanded sharply , ignoring the sign of new pain . " More Spaniard than you , " the man said , through closed jaws , his eyes shut . " Ah , " Pere exclaimed softly , and began to search the Enemy 's clothing . Wishing to avoid causing him pain , he attempted to remove the rucksack . " I 'm sorry , " he said ; " I do n't want to hurt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man could not live , for the bullet had penetrated the stomach in what the Division doctor called Zone 4 , of maximum gravity . He took out his own blanket and laid it over the Enemy , who made attempts to reject this comfort . Pere had never seen such hatred as in that white face , with its sunken cheekbones and colorless eyes . He opened the Enemy 's sack intending to make a pillow of his blanket . " Leave it alone , " burst from the wounded man 's twisted mouth . The sack contained a Zeiss short-base range finder , three sheets of the Schrader map of the Central Pyrenees , with recent corrections and fine lines drawn upon them ; a pair of Leitz binoculars and drawing instruments . A map-maker or an artillery officer , Pere thought , but he did n't look like a professional . " Are you thirsty ? " he asked , and offered him water , the last contained in his flask . The Enemy deliberately spilled the water . " Hombre , " Pere exclaimed softly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leitz glasses , he counted four of the enemy crossing the last visible slopes of the Llosas valley . He watched them sink below the curve of the slope , going toward Malibierna , apparently having marched from below the Tempest . A little later two men crossed the col in the ridge on which he was kneeling , not two hundred yards from him . They were carrying heavy burdens . The passage of the six men and the presence of the wounded Enemy had confirmed the intuition which had sent Pere upon this patrol round . He had been staring dully at the Enemy 's maps for several minutes when the significance of the fine lines burst upon him . He saw that they were not artillery plottings , but cones of parabolic machine-gun fire . Their range indicated that clearly . " Ah , very nice , " he exclaimed , noting their points of origin . When the Division returns from the Aran heights toward the Aneto village . . . Would the fellow never die ? He wanted to be off , across the uplands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same condition all the morning , until the rain began . Shortly afterward he became delirious . Pere , sullen and miserable , arranged the two sacks in order to keep the rain from the Enemy 's head , but the driving rain streamed upon his face . At last the dying man subsided into a restless stupor . Again Pere attended to his sack . He decided that despite its weight he would carry away the range finder , as well as his own glasses . As he was flinging the Luger into the sack the Enemy uttered a piercing scream and beat his hands against sharp stones . " Oh , Christ , " Pere gasped and pulled the pistol trigger . The Enemy lay still . " Poor devil , ah , poor devil . . . it was best , " Pere murmured , and averting his gaze , felt in the dead man 's breast and removed a few rain-soaked papers and flung them into the sack . He plunged down the gully . Below , on the gravel-littered slabs , hearing the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still standing by the white-bellied body , its light hair darkened by the drenching rain , shivering . As he approached the creature ran away bleating . Pere swore , but again pursued it , yet being heavily laden , could not get near it . " Damn you , you 've learned to be afraid , " he shouted , waving his arm furiously in the direction of the pasture to which he had meant to carry the animal . He made one more attempt to capture the kid , but it eluded him . It cost him ten minutes of blundering and shouting to drive the bewildered creature within sight of the grass . " I do n't know whether the cursed thing can eat grass yet , " he muttered , and struck out once more down the slope . There were hundreds of the enemy in the Malibierna , he found . He turned and began the long journey to the 43rd . Hearing his shout , six of the patrol stumbled out to meet him ; one of them , feeling him stagger , linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sat , his head bowed , breathing deeply . " Now then , " Pere began , " you , Carlos , you 'll get out on the slope by Peak Russell , you know the spot . You , Tomas , go to your emergency place , on the bluff by the tarn . Enrique , you .. . " One of the men stepped forward and said , " I 'm sorry , comrade , I have orders to arrest you . I am in command here . " " Arrest me , to hell , what do you mean ! " But he did not continue to give orders , nor did lie so much as peer into the face of the man to identify him . The old members of the patrol remained silent , standing a few paces withdrawn , while the new Commander took a paper from a wallet and offered it to Pere , and said , " If you care to come over to the wall I 'll strike a light . " " I do n't need documents , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , you 're Commander . Here 's what you do . . . . " He explained his plan of vigilance against the rear attack , his successor listening with growing excitement . " I 'll go on to Headquarters , " Pere concluded ; " you take the men out . " " I 'm sorry , comrade , you are under arrest . " There was a note of stubbornness in the voice . " Cullon , arrest ! What does arrest matter ! Go on , arrest me , then ; I 'm not resisting , but get on with your work . Sweet Christ ! they 'll be over in the morn ing and you 're worrying about an ar . rest . " " I 've got to send a file with you . " " All right , send Carlos . " " Very good , Carlos , take this comrade to the Hospice de Viella . " The boy hastened along the black valley by the side of the prisoner . Two hours later , as they approached the hostel below the anciently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid his hand upon the prisoner 's arm . " What 's the matter ? Hurry . " " Pere , I do n't like saying this , but you 're not supposed to be carrying a rifle . " " Take it then . Take the damn thing . . . . All right , boy , I 'm sorry . " They were challenged a hundred yards before the Hospice , but the sentry did not know of the order for Per e 's arrest and to the boy 's relief allowed them to continue without larger escort . Carlos pushed open the door and called for the sergeant of the guard . " I 've brought Pere , " he said desperately and lowered both rifles to the floor . " You 'll have to go into the back room , comrade , " the sergeant said , ashamed . " Where 's Esquinazo ? " " He 'll be in soon ; in an hour 's time . " " Alberto ? " " On the pass ; there 's been a battle , they tried a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me , how 'd it go up there , all right ? " " Yes , we 've lost about twenty . They say a shepherd from Bosost warned our outposts two hours before they came into range . I do n't know , there was a hell of a racket up there this morning . " " Now listen , comrade , look . I 'll hand all this over to you . " Pere dumped the sack heavily on the floor and , cutting the swollen cord , took out the maps . " There 's a Luger in there too and other stuff . " " Come into the light , Pere , " the sergeant exclaimed , and leaving Carlos in the passage , they shut the door . Behind the door the boy heard them talking excitedly . Presently they came out . " Eh , you can go back , comrade , " the sergeant said and Carlos turned toward the door . " I sha n't have time to get out to my post , Pere . " The scout spoke hesitantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the Unnamed peak  --  but I ca n't give you the order . " " I 'll tell the other . ? . " " He 'll be out , at work . Ca n't you keep him here ? " Pere said to the sergeant . " Yes , perhaps you 'd better go back tomorrow . Turn in with the guard . " It seemed to Pere that he waited hours in the lightless detention room and then there was a great noise of stamping in the corridor , and a series of orders . When the sergeant came again and asked him to follow him to Esquinazo 's office he did so without a word . Beltran , " Esquinazo , " stood behind the table , still wearing his sheepskin coat over his uniform and the cowherd 's leather hat . His symbols of rank were pinned to the lapel of his tunic . " So they caught you , " he exclaimed , with fierce anger . The Chief of Operations and a junior officer were standing by the shuttered window . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .. You will go before the court-martial . Do you wish to be tried by the men or by the officers alone ? " " It 's all the same . " " Yes . I 'm not going to be at the judges ' table , I 've had to do that before with you . I 've told the Adjutant to ask for severe punishment . Do you wish to know what ? " " Yes . .. sir . " " Ah , well , if you 're found guilty , you 'll be reduced to the ranks , for the time being . " " For the time being , comrade ? " Pere did not amend the expression but regarded the Commander with troubled gaze . " If we get out of this , back to our own territory , I hope you 'll be dismissed from the Division . You will be . " " Why , Esquinazo , I 've done good work for you . " " You have  --  and bad work ; that will do . " " Bad work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you down to supervise the outposts on this side as well . We got word from a French comrade , a shepherd , about the attack up there . If it had n't been for him . . . " Esquinazo began calmly , but his temper rose sharply as he spoke . He knew this was not a valid accusation , however , for the outposts he himself had placed had come in with reports an hour after the Frenchman had warned the Chief of Staff . " You 've seen enough trouble with us , you 'd better transfer to another unit , " he added , and the Lieutenant smiled , hearing this softening of the original formula . Then , throwing his gun and holster on the table and flinging his coat into a corner , Esquinazo ordered the Lieutenant to fetch the Quartermaster and the Chief of Staff who were outside with the column . He bent over the maps until the officers came in . " Sit down , comrades , " he began , and shouted for the sergeant to bring more chairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from below , a battalion of Navarros stationed at the Balneario near Benasque . They 're coming over Malibierna . He proposes the following plan . . . " For five minutes Esquinazo outlined the plan and then said , " What 's your opinion , comrades , can the men outside march at once ? We have only two hundred in rest . " " They 'll go of course . They 'll go better if you speak to them , " the Major said . " I 'm going with them ; you 'll take over here , " the Commander addressed the Chief of Staff ; then , turning to the Quartermaster he said , " Get dry rations for the battalion outside for one day , and prepare for two more days . We 're moving off in a quarter of an hour . " " Comrades , ca n't I go ? " Pere interjected . The Chief of Staff gazed hesitantly from him to the Commander . " You ? Hostia , is that man still here ! Sergeant , Sergeant , why is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For a moment Pere expected the Commissar to ask for leniency , but Alberto marched out of the room . The Commander jumped to his feet and rebated his pistol and holster . Getting into his sheepskin , he thrust Pere aside with a lurch of his massive body , and strode out . " Better come along , Pere , " the sergeant said , and he walked listlessly along the corridor and entered the detention room . Pere awoke at two in the afternoon , to find food by his side ; outside it was raining torrentially . He banged on the door and asked the guard whether the Commander had returned . " No , no one 's returned , except the Quartermaster and he went away again at once . " " Any news ? " " No . It 's snowing up on the main ridge . The sergeant says they 're going to bring the Division down . " Impatient for news , Pere could find nothing to occupy the time . Then , shortly before nightfall , the armorer brought him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked him to examine and clean it , and he worked until ten o'clock . He had lain down for the night when the pounding of hooves brought him to his feet . Yes , it was the Staff ! He banged on the door but no one came . Then came shouts and laughter and a Viva , and answering Vivas and then he heard Esquinazo blunder noisily into his office and yell for the telegrapher . Pere hammered again , but in the uproar of shouts and stamping of feet he supposed no one heard him . Then the door slammed and he gave up hope of beingable to catch a word of the din proceeding in Esquinazo 's office . At two in the morning , he heard the " Internationale " being sung , far down the valley it seemed . It must be the battalions returning , he thought . The Hospice seemed to be full of blundering , hurrying men . The " Internationale " was suddenly nearer . They 're coming up over the bank , Pere thought , excitedly . Still singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice was heard , thanking the troops . They would rest two days if the enemy permitted . Fall out by companies . " Viva Esquinazo , " someone yelled . " Viva , " cried the battalion . There were more voices and again the " Internationale . " Pere hammered at the door once more . " Cullon , why do n't you open ! Esquinazo , damn you , I planned that battle . " Hours seemed to go by . There was a conference in the common dormitory upstairs , he knew . At times there was a chorus of approval above and sometimes emphatic interjections . After a while he heard the Operations Chief reciting in his level , boring voice . Many times in the old days Pere had yarned and slept in the dormitory above , retelling the day 's climb or listening to the Aran muleteers going down to Ribagorzana 's lower markets , or absorbing some contrabandist 's tale of adventure , for the sake of the mountain knowledge such men had . He was brooding over the old days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up , put on his tunic and buttoned it carefully , and went out behind the guard . " Stand over there , please , " the Commissar said , and Pere took his place beside the Operations Chief , before whom the Schrader maps were spread out . The barred shadows of the hurricane lamp suspended from the beam shifted backward and forward across the Commander 's face . The telegraphic apparatus was tapping continuously in the next room . " It will be impossible to do more than fix general alternatives , " Operations said , " but we shall have simple maps prepared . They will be without great detail , for we have no unused paper left . Now tell me , " he continued , looking at Pere , " what 's the population of this town , Gistain ? " " About five hundred . San Pedro de las Tabernas goes with it ; say six hundred . " " Cattle town ? " " Yes , some . There 's cobalt and lead mines . " " Ah . " The officers commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camps said . In his youth the assistant commissar had been a miner . The Operations Chief wrote in the information against the town 's name . " Bielsa , what do you know about this place ? " " About five hunched . There are mines in the valley . " " I ca n't see any way over the mountains here . Do you have to go clown the valley to this juncture and up again to continue along the chain ? " " No . It 's hard going though . There 's a difficult route over the Pineda range , then through the Passet breach , it 's about here , and then down the Paso de Golis into the Soaso amphitheater . It 's not for everybody , there 's iron rungs in a low cliff there . There are other routes but you 'd need someone who knew the place . " " Do you know the place ? " " Yes . " " All this is the Monte Perdido group ? " " Yes . " " Caramba , " exclaimed a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains ! " Pere started and looked with excitement toward Alberto . The telegrapher shouted , " I 've got it , it 's coming through , " and everyone was silent , heads turned toward the door . The operator slowly wrote down a message on a piece of crumpled paper . A full minute of tense silence passed and then the telegrapher took off his head-piece and forced his waythrough to the Commander , ignoring the outthrust hands . Esquinazo read the message slowly and then gave it to his Chief of Staff . It was next handed to Alberto who , silently inquiring of the Colonel , received a nod for answer . He looked round and waited for silence . " Ministry of War , Barcelona , Seo de Urgell , for 43rd Division , commanding officer , Selior Don Antonio Beltr  --  n . Message received . Congratulations . Viva RepUblica . " " Viva ! " Esquinazo exclaimed , and in low voices the officers answered , " Viva ! " " Relieving force recaptured LIavorsi yesterday . Held up , bad weather . Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where 's Llavorsf ? " Alberto demanded . " In the Pallaresa valley , the other side of the Enchanted peaks , " Pere answered . " Where 's that ? " Torres intoned . " Parallel valley to this , toward the coast . " " Well , they 've retaken it ; that 's the best enchantment I know , " Esquinazo said . " You may as well read this , " the Commissar said quietly , waiting for the Commander to object . Esquinazo kept silent . Alberto passed a slip of paper to Pere . " This is the message we sent out . " " Seo for Barcelona . Seo for Barcelona . Seo Barcelona . Met and totally destroyed two battalions enemy to-day . Captured quantity war material . Can hold out , have food , munitions . Beltnin 43rd Division . Seo for Barcelona , Sco . . . Barcelona . . . . " " Comrade , " Pere burst out and the paper shook in his hands . They waited for him to speak . " Viva la RepUblica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viva , " they answered again . " What are the difficulties about establishing contact with the relief column ? " Operations asked tapping the map . " We 'd have to cross the Beciberis and the Enchanted range . They 're difficult to move over . Then take Espot and strike down into the Pallaresa , below Esterri . " " Difficult , " the officer muttered , tracing a line on the map . " You were talking about the Perdido region , " Pere began , and drew himself erect and was silent . The Commander lighted a cigarette and nodded to the Commissar who , after a pause , said , " Comrade Pere Cardona . " " Sir , " Pere answered , standing to attention . " The Staff has taken a decision about you . You are censured for the offense of disobedience and neglect of your duty as controlling officer of the west-side patrols . You are severely censured for striking a comrade . Do you accept that ? " " Yes , sir . " " Besides this censure , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock . " " Yes , comrade . " He knew that he would have to face the party 's directive committee ; and he knew what to expect from them . " In view of this , the commanding officer and the Divisional Commissar have decided , in consultation with senior officers , that your offense can go without further punishment . " " Oh Little Mother of God ! " whispered Pere and put out his hands to Esquinazo . The Commander waved him back and he stood at attention beside the Operations Chief . Alberto glanced at Esquinazo who motioned that the Commissar should be silent . " All right . We 've decided that we ca n't undertake any more pitched battles like the one up yonder " ? he jerked his head backwards toward the Aran heights ? " or we shall run out of ammunition and have to take the trip over the frontier . So we 're going to break up one half of the Division into three guerrilla forces ; each working on its own , but keeping contact with me at Bielsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pere stood facing Esquinazo , as if dazed . " Esquinazo , " he said at last , hoarsely , and saluted . " You 'll be working the farthest away from the base , " the Commander continued , " and you 'll have to live off the region , and do it with next to no munitions . Can you do that ? " " Yes . " Conversation broke out among the officers , but the Chief of Staff soon called the conference to order . " We shall meet tomorrow , at ten o'clock if possible , for discussion . You 'll be here to lead it , Pere ; we 've got to study the maps . Comrades , you may go . " Pere left the Hospice and , though it was raining heavily again , he sat upon a shelf of rock just beside a shelter . For an hour he reflected upon the events of the last fortnight and the Malibierna battle . At the end of the hour he remembered that he had put a piece of bread in his pocket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much bigger than he had remembered . " What luck l " he exclaimed aloud , and settled himself more comfortably , drew his coat collar high , and hunched his shoulders , so that his head was protected . How good is bread , he thought , listening to the rain outside the retreat he had made . Contentedly he ate the bread , piece by small piece , relishing its wheaten flavor ; happiness growing within him . When he had finished , thinking with merriment of the comradeship he would have , he returned to the Hospice . The sentry saluted wearily and he entered . He went to the detention room for his blankets , and climbed up the narrow stairs to the dormitory . He felt along the sleeping platform to find a space between booted feet . " Cullon , that 's the biggest pair of feet I 've ever met , " he whispered . " You leave my feet alone , " growled a sleepy voice , and Pere chuckled and edged himself between two snoring colleagues and slept soundly .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
