The Week BY FAVORING Mr. Garner 's resolution for repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment , though DY six votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority , the House of Representatives acted in a highly salutary manner . The strength of the Wet sentiment was effectively demonstrated ; the close l'clte in a Congress which formerly had a large .. , at " r7 majority proves that a repeal resolution will ultimately elY be passed by the new House . And by failing to pass this resolution , the House gave sirefor more mature consideration of the course vin Ilen repeal ought to take . Mr. Garner 's method h81 lye believe , open to weighty objections ; the provision for ratification by state conventions may not and repeal but hurt it , while the Drys will cer-tain , Y ? be able to put up a much stronger fight in 41411Y states if flat repeal without consideration of a desirable substitute is proposed . Another gain from the defeat is the fact that it makes necessary a special session of the new Congress next spring . There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting the legislators . Again , having disposed of this question for the present session , Congress will have more time to devote to economic matters which are of infinitely greater importance . Passage of the Garner resolution would have led to long debate in the Senate , and Congress would have become so bogged down in the repeal controversy that in the short session it would scarcely have been able to do anything else . CONGRESS opened under guard . Capitol Hill was blue-black with policemen and busy with the scurrying of police motorcycles . A double line of bluecoats , armed with riot guns and tear gas , stood blocking the Capitol steps . Inside the building , there were extra guards and plain-clothes men with their coats suspiciously bulging over the hip . A delegation of liberals visiting Speaker Garner on an errand of remonstrance was met at the door to his office by half a dozen uniformed men who passed tear-gas capsules from one to another . The Speaker did not receive the delegation . Outside , it was preceded across the Capitol grounds by plain-clothes men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all the world like the capital of some banana republic on the day after a revolution . THE reception afforded the hunger marchers in Washington was a striking combination of military efficiency and military ineptitude . As the three columns of trucks entered the city ? one from New York and New England with 1,100 delegates , one from the West with about 1,700 and one from the South with less than 250 ? they were rapidly escorted , past red lights , green lights and long lines of waiting traffic , to a lonely section of New York Avenue which would serve as a detention camp . All sorts of preparations had been made for guarding them . The hundreds of policemen who blocked the two ends of the street could sweep the whole length of it with their machine guns . In the railroad yards below were dozens of detectives to see that nobody tried to cross the tracks . On the bluff above were squads of police with gas masks , tear gas and a new nauseating gas in the use of which they had just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone service was strung from tree to tree , and still further in the rear were metropolitan park policemen to see that no stragglers escaped through the woods . Nobody could enter the detention area , nobody could leave it , without official permission . And in case of " eventualities , " the Regular Army was waiting at Fort Myer to take over the city on an hour 's notice . MILITARY efficiency could go no further ? but neither could military ineptitude . All these brave preparations were based on the ridiculous notion that three thousand unarmed men and women were a threat to the government . The result was to transform them into a real threat to public health and to the self-respect of public officials . In the spot selected for their detention camp , there were no facilities whatever for human habitation  - -  no shelter , no kitchens , no heat , no water , no sanitary arrangements of any sort ? only a bare stretch of windswept concrete on which the marchers could stretch out and sleep . Below them in the railroad yards were enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand . In the city there were dozens of halls and garages which the hunger marchers could hire if the officials once gave their permission . But at least until Tuesday morning , they were being held prisoner under conditions that might easily give rise to an epidemic . And having got them into that position ? having successfully violated their constitutional rights ? the police did n't know what to do with them . A good riot would solve the difficulties of the police ? but the marchers were too well disciplined to let a riot be started . Many people were beginning to ask why they should n't be allowed to hold their demonstration , and present their demands , and lodge themselves at the expense of their organization , and then go home in as orderly a manner as they came . Solutions like this are usually too simple for the official mind . DURING the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera in Spain , the International Telegraph and Telephone Company ? the international branch of the A. T. and T. ? made a contract with the Spanish government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of providing Spain with telephone service . Since that time Spain has had a Socialist revolution . The Spanish people did not like de Rivera or the monarchy , and threw them both out ; and they did not like the system of running public service for private profit and decided to put an end to it . Consequently the Cortes is now planning to abrogate the contract negotiated be , tweet/ de Rivera and the American telephone magnates . Our Department of State has objected strongly to this procedure and , it is reported , threatens even to sever diplomatic relations if the // act of confiscation is carried through . It is , in other words , defending American capitalists against Spanish national socialism . This is not our idea of a just , a wise , or a diplomatic attitude to take . Can the United States government guarantee to American profit-seekers that the system under which they endeavor to make their gains will endure against popular wrath in all countries ? Is not the risk of confiscation by a possible socialist government one of the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear ? Will the American people back up American capitalists in an effort to enforce capital-ism on an unwilling world ? Our idea is that bust , ness contracts are not the most sacred things life ; that they have not , for instance , a validity superior to popular revolutions . We believe that the friendship of the Spanish people is more valuable to the United States than the vanished profits of the I. T. and T. SUPERFICIALLY it would seem that the von Schleicher government in Germany differs but little in either program or personnel from its predecessor . Like the von Papen Cabinet , it was appointed by von Hindenburg in violation of the Weimar Constitution ; as a presidial government it is responsible only to the president of the Reich . The present Chancellor appears more conciliatory , more a man among men , more capable of winning popular support and political backing , than the irascible von Papen , who had no patience with political maneuvers and made no effort to appeal to the masses . Actually the new Chancellor is far from being the suave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a man of indomitable purpose , unhampered by fettering principles and free from party bonds . He is a militarist to the core , who conceals behind his protestations against a military dictatorship the fact that he has used his power as head of the Reichswehr for more than a decade to dictate the course of the national government . Whether he will be able to navigate the turbulent waters of German politics that wrecked the von Papen regime remains to be seen . Certainly he is too astute and experienced a statesman to have underestimated the difficulties of his position . Indeed , it is more than probable that the period of indecision preceding his appointment was devoted to a careful weighing of the factor 's which would make for success or failure , before von Schleicher indicated his readiness to accept the proffered responsibility . VON SCHLEICHER 'S position appears pie carious enough . The labor parties regard hum , . as their implacable enemy . The National Social ists , too , with whose program he has been in sY 'll " pathy , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without dividing honor and power with the Hitlerites , are holding aloof , refusing to accept a subordinate roie , , But von Schleicher knows that he can not hope to create a permanent government based on military Power without the support of an organized mass movement . The National Socialists alone could be counted on to provide this mass support , particularly since they are in . full accord with von Schleicher 's principal aims ? the setting up of a military dictatorship , the suppression of labor , the emasculation of the labor unions , the crushing . of the Communist movement and the restoration of the Hohenzollern monarchy . The Chancellor 's continuous conversations with the Nazi Goehring , president of the old and the new Reichstag , prove that he is making every effort to bring about such an understanding , while Hitler 's sudden trip to Berlin during the first part of this week suggests Progress in this direction . If von Schleicher succeeds , in persuading a Reichstag majority to consent to , an adjournment until after the Christmas holidays and is not forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , he ' nay , with his gift for playing with men and movements , win over Hitler and his followers to a toleration policy by granting important concessions . SINCE the election , Mr. Roosevelt has been in the headlines for definite reasons twice , and on both occasions his actions have been disappointing . It is true that he has no technical responsibility for war debts in this Congress , that he probably could not have changed the attitude of its members by making a Joint appeal with Mr. Hoover , that he is embarintelligent by his campaign commitments and that an ? Itelligent policy needs far more time than he had available . His policy of refusing to help . Mr. Hoover solve his immediate dilemma was undoubtedly good Politics for which there are excellent excuses . tui history is not made by shrewd politicians or by men who have good excuses for doing nothing in a great international crisis . History is made by men With courage enough to cut through the underbrush of technicality , reveal the fundamental facts and act ? Pon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news has been because of magazine articles e has written , one for Mr. Bernarr Macfadden 's T and the other for Mr. William Randolph .. Learst 's Cosmopolitan Magazine . Both these baort , iicle.s. have been written since the election , and cn discuss public affairs ; between them , they con-stitute a rough draft of what we may expect in h u s ? Roosevelt 's v , first message to Congress after he been inaugurated . We submit that a declara- Ilb of this sort by the President-elect comes close be dg a state paper , and that it ought not to It . sold to any magazine , still less to those with the oanned aids of Messrs . Macfadden and Hearst . We rnat Mr ? Roosevelt will now stop writing for " el ' until he is a private citizen again " The 1 ? Shed New Republic of November 30 , we pub- ! in editorial article , " World , Debts and tunestic Deflation , " in which we urged that the case for scaling down the domestic debts is as valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has occurred to a good many people , and is having an effect upon Congress , is becoming increasingly evident . In his syndicated column for Monday of this week , Walter Lippmann writes from Washington of the predicament of many members of Congress , evidently as a result of conversations with some of them . What he says in effect is that they do n't dare reduce the war debts unless they can reduce internal debt as well . Farm mortgages amount to about as much money as the war debts ; urban mortgages are nearly three times as much . Any member of Congress who tried to set free the foreign debtors and ignored the plight of his own countrymen would n't dare go home and face his constituency . But the way out of this dilemma is not to maintain the status quo , and reduce neither ; on the contrary , it is to reduce them both . The legal difficulties in the way of reducing the domestic debt are admittedly great ; but what is the alternative ? REPUBLICAN politicians , a few days ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancellation or revision of the war debts , on the ground that such a course would make him popular with the country . But why , in the name of Heaven , should he listen to such advice ? In three months he will retire to private life ; it is almost a certainty that he will never again be elected to any public office . For the first time since the presidential bee stung him in 1920 , he can stand up straight , throw back his shoulders and tell the truth without having to count the cost . We do not assume that the President has usually had a knowledge superior to his acts ; yet there is no doubt that on some matters , and war debts in particular , he has " pulled his punch " for political reasons . As a lame-duck President he has a priceless and unique opportunity to return to those first principles of engineering which he has so sadly neglected since he was graduated from college . If he would now forget about politics and politicians ( most of whom , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hated him ) , if he would speak out bluntly as to what he thinks ought to be done , he would win in the next three months more of the respect , perhaps even the affection , of his fellow countrymen than he has had at any time since the end of the War . ECHOES of at least one recent election contest will be heard in the Seventy-third Congress . Last September rock-ribbed Maine elected a Democratic Governor . Two out of three Congressmen were apparently Democrats . But announcement that in the third district former Governor Ralph O. Brewster had been defeated by John G. Utterback i proved premature . Irregularities in certain r a French-speaking towns in northern Aroostook indicate a commanding margin of legitimate votes for Brewster . The contest was a smaller-scale replica of the devious attempt two years ago by the Republican National Committee to drive Senator Norris from public life . Brewster has long been anathema to the Maine G.O.P. organization . He vetoed the Insull power-export bill in 1927 and when his successor , William Tudor Gardiner , signed a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his party , Brewster fought for retention of the direct primary . Invariably he has been found battling for progressive measures and against the Republican machine . It defeated his two attempts to obtain his party 's nomination for the Senate . THIS year , hopeless of beating him for Congress in the primary , it entered , in the Democratic primary , a candidate of its own , a reactionary never before identified with the Democracy . With the vote split among three regular Democrats , this neon Jeffersonian was nominated . In the ensuing interparty contest , the Republican machine worked for this man , Utterback . His election by 297 votes was reported . But Brewster 's experience with electoral chicanery is not new . In his first gubernatorial primary his defeat was recorded ; he demonstrated that it had been accomplished by ballot stuffing , and won nomination and election . The present irregularities include precincts with his opponent 's name written in for every voter ( and in one case for more voters than exist ) all in the same handwriting . He challenged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme court rendered the opinion that it was mandatory for Governor and Council to exclude the votes of such precincts as violated the state 's electoral laws . A motion to do so was defeated by a tie vote with Governor Gardiner and three Old Guardsmen in opposition . Neither candidate is therefore certified . Unless the court rules further , the next House must decide . Who Pays for Shorter Hours ? T HE DETERMINATION of the American Federation of Labor to obtain the thirty-hour week is modest indeed , in view of the technical possibilities of production in modern industry . At depression standards of living , there are probably not thirty hours ' weekly work for two-thirds of the industrial wage earners . Without a single gain in efficiency , or the elimination of any of the enormous economic waste incidental to our clumsy order , employment for all the workers at no more than thirty hours would thus make possible a total product about 50 percent larger than at present . Estimates of what would be possible with better management range upward froM this minimum . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the facilities which applied science offers us , and if the whole population were sustained on a level as high as it could possibly desire , there would not be anywhere near as much as // thirty hours ' work per week to distribute to those looking for jobs . This being the case , it is curious to note the reluctance of many of the daily editorial writers , and of the employers whose opinions they represent , to endorse the A. F. of L. 's attitude . They are just as conscious as anyone else of the large truths noted above . They are among the leaders in the movement to " share work " by shortening actual hours because there is nowhere near enough work to go round . They do not really believe that the nation 's production could not be accomplished in a thirty-hour week ; or if they do , they are not foolhardy enough to say so . What they balk at is the effect which the labor proposal may have on the distribution of income . When work is " shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay is shared , too . Thus employed labor bears the burden of the shorter hours , and costs are not increased for the employer . But a union demand for a shorter work-week carries two implications absent from the usual work-sharing plan . In the first place , it proposes the same weekly pay as before for the shorter time . In the second place , it is a formal demand for the establishment of a condition supposed to be permanent , and tenaciously maintained in prosperity as well as in depression . If such a demand is won , it necessitates ( a ) an immediate jump in labor-cost per hour and ( b ) a continuance of this increased cost ? except in SO far as technical advances obviate it ? after prosperity returns . This means that labor gets more , and stockholders and bondholders less than would otherwise be the case . No matter what the neces ' sities and possibilities of the situation from the standpoint of the community at large , those representing the interests of capital may be counted upon , with minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so at present of course in veiled terms . This is a time , they say , for cooperation and not for struggle . Industry can not stand any higher costs . What they really mean is that Con flict should be avoided by the passivity of labor , and that industry should not distribute any more purchasing power to the workers , in order that it may continue to distribute as much as possible to stockholders and bondholders . There is little question that many who talk this way sincerely believe that this is the essential condition of keeping whatever volume of employ . ment we have , and of making possible a revival ' They are caught in a vicious circle . Capitalist industry can not be carried on indefinitely without paying rewards and offering incentives to those who lend money and those who invest in resources . This is the segment of the circle whi511 is constantly before their eyes . But capitalist 111 " dustry --  -- or any industry using modern devices -- -. can not be carried on indefinitely at full capacity , without paying those who are employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other Sege ment which closes the vicious circumference , an
