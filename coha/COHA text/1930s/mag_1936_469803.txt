ELEVEN years ago I stood on the rear platform of a transcontinental limited and saw the skyline of Seattle fade slowly under a rainy sky . In reality it was my world that was fading . I had been brought there so young that all that had gone before was legend ; I had spent my childhood , my boyhood , and my early youth in that world , and I had grown very unhappy in it . I wanted to he a writer and it was obvious , I thought , that one could not be a writer in Seattle . I did not know exactly why ; I knew only that I was being starved in the unfriendly midst of that strident western metropolis ; a one-sided " progress " had drowned out the unheard melodies for which my lonely , foolish , youthful spirit thirsted. 1 had left school in disgust at seventeen ; the American system of education spoiled for me everything it touched , and the classroom seemed the last place to go for learning . There followed a year of omnivorous reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to sailors , longshoremen , Chinese fishermen , any man or woman who smelt of salt and whose tongue could pronounce the names of mysterious far-off cities . The most golden city in America lay three thousand miles away and its name was New York . I dreamed New York , talked New York , lived New York until Seattle became untenable for me ? and I left . To stand there on the train that April morning in 1925 and watch Seattle dim , to watch the green spring fields rise and rise and rise and take Seattle 's place , was for me an act of glorious repudiation . Iwas Shakespeare going to London to hold horses for the patrons of the Globe Theatre . I was Shelley lying asleep on the dark Italian hills . I was Emerson walking gravely in the streets of Boston . I had turned my face to the East . The train moved rapidly over the coastal plain , running between the lush April western fields , and then began the long slow climb into the mountains . I can still hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the whined grinding on the rails . As we went higher into the mountains the whole atmosphere grew strangely darker ; it was not really raining but we seemed to have been projected into the element that is rain . Then we came to the Cascade Tunnel . As a boy climbing mountains I had seen the dark western mouth of that tunnel , cut eight miles through the rock of that white range , and as I grew older I had thought of it as the gateway to all that was my birthright . Every morning I had gazed at those cool white peaks and cried out : Over there , over there , beyond is my homer . . . The train plunged into the tunnel , and for fifteen minutes we sat in the fury and rush and the blackness outside and the heavy oily smell of smoke from the engines . Suddenly we emerged into light . Something had happened ! At first I did not quite know what it was because I could not believe it . I rushed to the observation platform . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new day of crystal and sharp sun . For the first time in my eighteen years I was so overwhelmed by a sudden newness of the physical world that I could not help shouting . The emotional meaning of that moment was staggering . The long drizzle of Seattle and my youth were left behind , held back forever by these mountains , and the new day extended infinitely clear to the eastward , under a faultless heaven . All the significance and all the hope of flight were embodied in that sudden change of weather . I had traveled less than five hours of a five-day journey , but I was already East ! II Nothing I saw on the way disturbed my dream of New York as the golden city . But my first day there was one of silent , sick despair . For New York was Seattle grown tall and nervous , and after that first day I could never again recall wholly to mind the picture of what I had expected . It was not a golden city ? not in terms of buildings , streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in terms of life , men , women , and culture ? that I wanted ; and when I did not find that atmosphere I began to suspect for the first time , dimly , that what was wrong was not Seattle or New York but something at the heart of the American dream . And as the weeks and months passed , I began to ask myself why I had come and why I stayed . When I could find no honest answers I abandoned myself to rationalizations : that New York is the intellectual hub of America , that the young man who wants to write must come to New York so as to be in close touch with editors and publishers . I doubt now that these reasons would hold any water that was not frozen by custom . The best intellectual life in America can be savored more quietly and fully at the Seattle Public Library than at a literary tea , and the necessity of contact with editors is a legend fostered by every young man 's ego-desire to meet and talk with important men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West was something which I was notto understand until years later ; and when I finally did understand it I began to wonder if that flight was not the most inanely paradoxical move I could have made . For it was really a beginning of a search for my roots , for a living creative tradition of which I could be a part and a growing part . If I belonged anywhere geographically , it was to the West ; my family on both sides had belonged there since before the Civil War . Yet I knew instinctively that I did not belong to Seattle ; and while it is true that I left it with some violence of spirit , I left it with no violence done in the way of tearing up roots . But I had only to come to New York , to New England , to know that I did not belong there either . The Massachusetts and Hudson River Dutch traditions , which I had been brought up to think of as my heritage , had settled into a dry and sterile form by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find nothing to hold onto , nothing to grow with ; all the vitality of the country was industrial , commercial ; it was a business civilization in which the artist was a stranger , an interesting visitor at best . That fact gave me , as a young writer , a feeling of terrifying aloneness . At first I was inclined to treat this aloneness as a personal phenomenon , or as a phenomenon peculiar to artists in this country ; but as the years passed and I really began to see it , I came finally to know that it is true of a great many Americans ; that it is , and for a hundred years has been , the most persistent malady of the American soul . When the average practical American thinks of roots he thinks of a local habitation ; his roots are not real roots but only ties and sometimes only sentimental attachments to a village or a state where his friends are . But ties do not feed the spirit . We are all spiritual gypsies ; we are products of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen I used to know as a boy in British Columbia always kept with them the thing that was England ; they may have been born and bred on the colonial hearth , but when they said the word " home " you saw Trafalgar Square . And the Frenchman is never very far from France ; he knows that France which is his and he keeps it with him . But we Americans do not have America because we do not know which part of it is ours . For a time it appeared to me then that the only way for a sensitive man to solve the problem of being an American was to follow the course of Henry James and Whistler and repudiate America altogether . I wondered how those who stayed ? Emerson , Thoreau , Melville , Poe , Hawthorne , Mark Twain ? had been able to endure it , and all that was bad and narrow in them seemed to have been made bad and narrow by the world they chose to live in . I read Whitman day after day in a sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American , but all I could find there was the same Tonging that I had ; and it seemed to me that he only groped blindly for a definition , an affirmation , and in his eagerness saw an America that never had been , was not , and never would be . The only America I could behold was one in which the things of real importance were automobiles , stock-market gains , speed records , and wealth . I hated the big business men who had created a world in which human beings could live only in an ugly and unreal fashion , in which the things of the spirit were dwarfed or denied . I thought the big business men were happy in the world they had created . At that time I could not have understood how it is a lonely , incoherent and pathetic desire to capture a dream and a sense of something forever lost ? perhaps something which never existed ? that makes a Henry Ford restore the Wayside Inn , that makes the Rockefellers rebuild Williamsburg . The economic order seemed so tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring myself to trace in it the forces that had given birth to the human degradation and agony I felt in myself and all round me . I fled instead to libraries and concert hails and art museums . One day Iread in an article by Theodore Dreiser that whenever his spirit sank low he could find peace by going to the Metropolitan Museum and looking long into the faces of the Rembrandt portraits . Day after day I haunted the museum , not for the Rembrandts , but in the hope of seeing the face of Theodore Dreiser looking into their dark oil eyes ? Dreiser in agony as an artist in America . I had a feeling that it would tell me something that I could find out no other way . The weeks passed ; every day I continued to haunt the Rembrandt gallery until the guards grew suspicious of me , but Theodore Dreiser never came . That was in 1926 and the expatriate movement which had developed after the War was then at its height . A vast number of the young creative spirits had Ieft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much that should have been a product of the American environment was being born in Paris , and soon all the movement and feeling of the time was to crystallize there in the most typical of the new-age magazines , transition , published in English on the banks of the Seine . The emotion I had when transition accepted and printed a batch of poems I had sent over now seems to me incredible , but it is a perfect indication of the state of mind of at least one young American of that time that the publication of my work in transition gave me , for the first time , a sense of being in touch with my native tradition . I used to wonder then why I did not actually go to Paris and have done with this dark squall of a continent that gave me such a feeling of homelessness ; and whenever I asked myself that question , I could give no intelligent reason for staying . Of course I had to earn a living , but the struggle I was having with it here did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse in Paris . Yet there was all the time something that kept me back ; it was something which I did not know or recognize , but it was very powerful . There was growing in me a half-conscious conviction that an American who could not find in America the true life of his work was an invalid person . III I determined to find out what this America was . The modern scene did not hold the key ; in order to find out anything at all I would have to start where America had started . Like most Americans , I was profoundly ignorant of my country 's history ; but ignorant or not , my desperation had made me willing to try anything . I threw myself headlong into the past . I set my birthdate back to 1620 and began to live America . I found in the revolutionary period a form and coherence and direction no longer visible in the America about me ; it was the Paris where I had not gone , and it made Paris ridiculous . I found there the idealism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boastfulness in the America of the 1920 's , and I knew then what always I had dimly sensed : that when a nation begins to boast of what it has made , the true making period is over , and the stiffness and sterility of a set form is already upon it . A real culture is not aware of what it is ; it functions instinctively without knowing the exact nature of its parts , and only afterward , when it has begun to die , are men able to call by name a strange and wonderful force which has been moving through them . There were many men naming the culture of the late 1920 's in America ; it was unnaturally and unhealthily self-conscious . It was of course a materialistic culture . I could look back into America and see its beginnings , but I could also see other beginnings that never grew , and then I thought I saw why it was so lonely and lopsided and aggressive . A strong , healthy , vital nation does not normally repulse the men who are its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians ? and send them blindly and angrily into exile . if a country is truly happy and a people is happy , the poets and artists stay near the earth where they are born and celebrate the happiness thatis there and walk proudly in the streets . The fact that so many of our creative men have fled the native scene , both in this century and the last , has given to many otherwise intelligent Americans the idea that the artist is a timid soul who can work only in an atmosphere of gentleness with the Louvre for breakfast ; but if the artist can strike fire and life from his surroundings it does not matter where he is , and when the creative men of a nation leave it , it is because the only fire they fee/ there is the cold , dry fire from sparklers . I know it is a tenet of one school of aesthetics that the artist always works alone , but that tenet is a lie by way of protest against the growing confusion of the outer world . The Renaissance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embraced men where it found them ; a true fertility , it brought culture closer to the earth that had given it birth . But doubtless the men of the Renaissance did not know from whence their strength had come . I thought that if I could find in a study of history the real strength of America I could discount the aridity of my present scene as a pause in the country 's growth . It gave me a certain sense of victory in those years to have stayed in America and wrestled with my problem . I was proud that I had not gone into exile . But I know now that it was a baseless pride ; I was an exile to the eighteenth century instead of to Paris . For any complete absorption in history is really a means of flight or a means of personal discovery . With me it was both . I ran away from the present to discover America and myself . In those years of thinking and writing about the Revolution I had flashes of strong conviction that I had really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were only flashes , and when they were gone they left me more skeptical than before . Like the men of the eighteenth century , I got drunk on democracy and the ideal republic ? but always there came a day when I could not keep myself from seeing what those things had become in my twentiethcentury world . And looking upon my own century , I felt that democracy had shriveled into doctrine , that it had failed and with it had failed the best hopes of mankind ; and it seemed to me then that the collapse of the dream of self-government was the cruelest libel ever passed upon the race of man . I used to walk the streets and look into the faces of men and women , thinking I could perhaps see there what this democracy meant to them . Was it sterile for them too , a Venus without breasts ? Why had democracy remained so unfruitful for the creative spirit ? Had she given birth to anything but a tradition of apathetic liberalism ? Why had the men of the nineteenth and twentieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elemental faith , a faith that could bind them together as the men of the Middle Ages had been bound by their concept of the eternal Woman ? Was democracy alone responsible for the rootlessness in which was inherent a poverty of creative expression ? I questioned myself into despair ; and after my intense preoccupation with Revolutionary America had written itself into two books I began to grow very suspicious of the meaning it had had for me . In the space of seven or eight years I had re-lived the thirty decades of America , and in the end I was really back where I started . I had caught glimpses of the roots that should have been mine , that should have been ours ; but having seen them , I was less sure than ever of possessing them ; and the whole great America which I had lived had only increased my feeling of rootlessness . IV This feeling can be disastrous to a man 's work and it was disastrous to mine . It seemed for a long time when the feeling was running strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in America , past or present , with which I could identify myself in the way that I had identified myself with the Revolution ; and I could never see anything wholly again until I had seen through my problem . The Revolution still lived for me , but I had been bitterly disillusioned and I could never look upon it again with quite the same freshness of spirit . I began to imagine that this loneliness of mine was a curious sickness of my own and had no basis in common experience ; I thought I could not speak freely about it because I should not be understood . I would have given anything then to have felt America as one of the eighteenthcentury French Diarists , whom I had read so avidly , had felt it ; but it seemed to me that most of that America had existed in a romance which they had prefigured and whatever had been real was gone . I went back to the letters of Henry James and Lafcadio Hearn and the other expatriates of the nineteenth century in an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only complicated my emotions more hopelessly . I read Irving and Lowell and Holmes and Howells and they all seemed to me timid apes whose very blood had been diluted with ink from Bloomsbury . Yet it did not appear unnatural that they had tried to be British ? especially when I remembered my own flights to Victoria , the most British city outside England , when I had to escape the Seattle of my youth ? and in a way they were just as American as Poe and Hawthorne and Melville except that they were not such violent men ; they had merely solved their homelessness in a simpler and perhaps happier fashion . Emerson and Thoreau and Whitman were the only Americans of their time whom I could stomach then . I searched among my older contemporaries for an understanding of the thing I was in quest of , and I found in them a turbulent , inchoate , and incohesive America . I found in Dreiser and Lewis and Anderson and O'Neill a sense of frustration and tragedy and a bitter discontent with the thing that was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is so unmistakable in a Thomas Mann . I hoped for a time that they were struggling to define a form that was American , that their wild rough earth could be blown down to expose the American roots ; but I saw after a while that they were only defining the struggle that occurs when there are no forms and no roots . They were men caught in the same impasse as myself and I added their loneliness and depair to my own . Then a strange light was thrown upon the problem by the phenomenon of Ernest Hemingway . Hemingway had seemed to me the only American who had any deep feeling for form and order ? not only in the literary sense ? and certainly he was one who could approach the eternal verities with such classic restraint that he gave you the feeling that he had known them always . I could not explain to myself for a long time why I got the feeling that Hemingway was so unusual in the American scene ; I wondered if his form was really deep-born , an instinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of a brilliant craftsmanship whose tricks eluded me ; and then suddenly one day I realized that Hemingway had never written about America at all . He wrote about cultures that were firmly rooted and he could sharply etch the surface turmoil because he was very sure of what was underneath . He could not understand or write of Americans unless they were in costume . His heroes were expatriates like himself ; they were masquerading as Paris newspaper men or Italian soldiers or Spanish bullfighters who really had nothing to do with the Kansas City American who was Ernest Hemingway . At first in my angry resentment against Hemingway I felt that he had been a coward to flee into a European form ? a form disguised by a mask of American language ? but I knew that he was not really a coward and that it must have been something very deep in him which had motivated his flight . There were many men who had done the same thing , and they were good men too ; some were strong men . Why did one like T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholicism ? Why did a brilliant young Chicagoan like Vincent Sheean find all the true movement and challenge of the modern world embodied in the European and Asiatic scenes and think of America only as a name which he could not habitate ? I puzzled over the case of Louis Adamic . An immigrant , he returned after twenty years to the Yugoslavia he had left as a boy of thirteen , and when he wrote about the experience a note of sureness and peace and warmth crept into his prose ? a note that had never been present in anything he had written about America . In Adamic I found a new hope . What excited me in his book was not his rediscovery of Yugoslavia but the thing he left unsaid : that a man may go back to the soil where his roots are and find them stronger and more vital for him than ever they had been before , and when he has found them again , the man who grew from them takes on new meaning and his work new richness . He does not assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a flow , and while he is flowing he feels and sees all things with a wonderful depth and sureness . I became convinced then that a man could do no real work until he knew what his roots were , until he had returned to them for nourishment . I had no Yugoslavia . but I had Seattle . The life I was leading in New England was a lie . I sat in a house on a Connecticut hillside and tried to write in the midst of trees and fields and people who had nothing to do with me and the place where I belonged . It was a barren travesty . Whenever I looked at the stone walls I saw a colonial cavalry taking them at full gallop , but that is all they meant to me ; they meant the past into which I had escaped , and now neither the past nor the stone walls were real . I could understand then what Lord Clifton meant when he said that he did not know how a man could be happy looking out of a window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any feeling about property , but the isolation and homelessness of a nation of renters became horribly clear to me then . I was renting not only land ; I was renting a culture . And it was a culture in which I could not live . Seattle became an obsession with me . I used to go out in the night and stand beside my car in the darkness and say : I will drive to Seattle . I will leave this he and go back where I belong . But then I would remember what a sprawl and void Seattle had been to me in my youth . I would feel once more the blindness and hardness of the Seattle I had known ? and as I stood there the whole longing to return would become irresistibly comic and sad . It was then that I realized for the first time how futile , how absurd it was to think of one 's roots in terms of a physical location . Roots do not grow in places but in things you believe deeply , feel deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil of a central faith and purpose . I should find no more nourishment in Seattle than in New England . For America has exiled her creative men , not bodily , but spiritually and intellectually ; geography has had nothing to do with it , and for the exiles Minneapolis and Moscow , Pittsburgh and Paris are as one . And I realized too at that time , with a feeling at once happy and helpless , that it was no longer a personal matter , and I knew then that I should never find my roots until all Americans had found theirs and that we should all find these roots together , without being truly conscious of what was happening . V But how was it going to happen ? How in an America composed of so many elements domestic and foreign was one going to find anything that all of us could believe together , in the way that the Americans of 1776 believed in the new democracy ? Where in a world denuded of its religious and political illusions was to be found more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of the mightyrivers which once poured down the land ? Up to this time the need for a collective faith had existed only dimly on the fringes of my mind ; my concept of it was still enclosed within the vague outlines of eighteenth-century democracy . I felt that I should have to work slowly forward again ; I did not dream that I should have first to go back another five centuries before I should be able to know even the meaning of a collective faith . I did not will it ; I was carried back very suddenly , one day a few years ago , when I dipped casually into a book which I had read before in my very early youth and which then had left no impression but confusion . Such books exist always in the world , and if one has a central problem they seem to hover about it for years unread , awaiting the right moment to descend upon the consciousness . When they do descend the effect is electrical and stunning . The book was The Education of Henry Adams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began my re-education as a twentieth-century American . I soon became aware that there was no other man whose whole life bore such tragic testimony to the intellectual American 's feeling of rootlessness , and no other historian who had projected himself into the past with such a deep need to discover his own soul . His exile was more painful than the exiles of James and Whistler and Hearn ; for they escaped early to the places in the world where they were happiest , but Adams stayed and was an exile in his own country and did not find himself until he was well past middle life . But when he did find himself he saw what the others who had fled were never given to see . You might think that a man who found in a study of the thirteenth century the key to his own malady was less direct than James or Whistler or Hearn who found their solutions in London and Paris and Japan . The truth is that he was the only direct one of the lot . The others escaped ; Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , but when it was done the result was a very great step toward the intellectual and spiritual discovery of America and , in a sense , of the modern world . If any man should have felt at home in America it was Henry Adams . He was born into a great family and a great tradition and all that was good here was his for the taking . Yet from the beginning he was obsessed by the foolishness of taking and the futility of having . He was a rare teacher and excellent historian , but being those things meant nothing to him ; and even when he was proposed for the Presidency , to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and great-grandfather , he behaved with the awful detachment of a man without personal illusions . He felt himself a failure and that feeling grew with the years ; it was only when it had driven him to true despair that he was able to face it and analyze it and so tear out of his own life and agony the dark reason that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always to a sort of spiritual deportation . It took Henry Adams , the American , the Bostonian , the Puritan , to diagnose the American malady ? a malady which truly infects the whole world but exists here in a more virulent form . Adams took America and puritanism and democracy back with him into the thirteenth century , and lie found them dwarfed and unreal and impotent . The very fact that he had to go back six hundred years for his roots has kept many Americans , who have approached him without having themselves known his struggle , from grasping the roundness of his discovery . Yet what Adams found in a study of medievalism was , in a broad sense , what Karl Marx found in a study of the modern economic order . Their analyses of the widely different cultures to which they made such widely different approaches , added up in the end to the same result : that no society can be happy or healthy in which individuals exist for their own sakes alone , to attain their own ends , without any true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to go farther than Adams because he had a remedy , and if Adams fails toqualify as a modern prophet it is because he took no steps beyond a definition of the trouble . Adams , finding his own world incapable of producing anything that was enduring in more than the narrow material sense , threw himself back into the medieval world in a search for the force which had bound its culture together . And the Puritan was to find it in the Virgin ! He looked upon Chartres Cathedral and he knew instinctively , and later intellectually too , that Chartres was not made by its stones and its architecture , but out of the force generated by a collective faith . Chartres was the expression of what every man in the thirteenth century believed ; Chartres was a monument to the fertile Virgin who had drawn stonecutters and masons and sculptors from over all Europe to pay her their tribute in work ; and so Chartres was not a cathedral but men living . Adams looked back upon his own world which worshipped the machine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chartres more strong and vast and beautiful ; but he knew that another great cathedral could never be built , not because the machine would spoil it , but because the Christianity which had found its flower in Chartres was now a dying culture and nothing truly great could ever come into existence save in the exuberance of a collective faith . The dynamo would be of no good to the race that did not have a common purpose . " All the steam in the world , " he said , " could not , like the Virgin , build Chartres . " The Virgin became for him the symbol of strength . The Puritan from Massachusetts found in her all that had been denied to him for sixty years and all that had been denied to his American earth . She became for him the Woman , the creative Female , the pregnant and fruitful Venus that she had been for the men of Chartres . Adams saw how the Virgin had become sterile in the modern world and modern Church , how the wonderful rich medieval love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams looked back into the world in which he had grown up and saw there men and women who had cut themselves off forever from the enriching forces . In the America where he had lived " sex was sin . In any previous age sex was strength . Adams began to ponder " ( he wrote of himself in the third person ) , " asking whether he knew of any American artist who had ever insisted on the power of sex , as every classic had always done . American art , like American language and American education , was as far as possible sexless . St. Gaudens ' art was starved from birth and Adams ' instinct was blighted from babyhood . Each had but half a nature . " Adams ' discovery of the Virgin and his interpretation of her as the generative Woman was something more than his reaction against puritanism and something more than finding the force that was to flower from Chartres onward through the Renaissance . It was really a discovery of the missing continent in the American spiritual geography . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twentiethcentury life , and it was really the power created when all men feel one thing deeply and depend upon it as a source of expression . He looked upon the narrow individual expression in the art of his own time and saw that the force was not there ; and it was his feeling that it would never be there again until all men were once more held together in a collective pith , like the men of Chartres . VI It was my own need to discover some sort of collective faith and my failure to find it around me that had sent me back , with such hope and enthusiasm , to the eighteenth century in America . There I had heard the whispered beginnings of such a faith ; but in the hundred and fifty years that had elapsed all the whispers had died away , and my own skepticism about democracy was hardly greater than that of my contemporaries . Where now , where in Ohio , Illinois , Virginia , Connecticut , Washington , Oregon were to be horn the men of Chartres ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world which had created a form that promised to bind men together , bind them in common belief and creative purpose , was the New Russia of the Soviets . If any one force could be said to have warped and prevented true democratic development it was the force of laissezfaire capitalism . The beautiful bud of Rousseau 's dream had contained within it the worm that was to eat away the blossom ; that worm was the doctrine of the " natural rights of man " which recognized no authority higher than his instincts and would not stoop to traffic with base economic regulations . So the rights of man quickly became the rights of the most powerful men , and the generous philosophical ideals of 1776 failed to weather the storm of the industrial revolution . The simple agrarian democracy which Jefferson envisioned died before the strong shining steel of the railroads reached the Pacific ; and the blessed " individual , " as the Hills and the Rockefellers and the Fords saw him , would have been unrecognizable to his early champions . Having once seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was not likely to be unfriendly to any system set up in opposition . A preoccupation with the idea of a collective faith could only increase that friendliness . Thus in the years after 1929 , as darkness and despair settled more heavily upon the capitalist nations and the problem of roots became more turbulent in my mind , I became passionately devoted to the ideals of Soviet Communism and to that vast and vigorous young nation that was creating a society free from human exploitation and the profit motive . It seemed to me then that all the objectives ever held noble and intelligent by mankind in any age were to be found , in some form , in Russia ; and whatever I saw that was ugly I explained away on the ground that it was incidental to the period of transition , and certainly nothing in communism was as unlovely as the Christian Crusades . I completely forgot American history and spent my days and nights reading Marx and Lenin and studying the Soviet Union . About this time ? I would place the date arbitrarily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving to a young American obsessed by rootlessness and the lack of a common cultural aim . That thing was the sudden swing of American artists , writers , and intellectuals to the Left ? so sudden , indeed , that it appeared for a while to have happened by magic . You saw the former expatriates , who only yesterday had been cursing the depression which had forced them to return from Nice and Pamplona , now tense with new responsibility for the future ; you saw the younger men , who at the last literary tea had seemed to have no common interests but their mistresses and bootleggers , now organizing in groups for united action . The professional jealousy which had formerly strained their relationship now died away ; and poets and painters could meet together at last without being mutually distrustful of each other 's art . For the first time in America 's history her creative men were becoming knit in a singleness and unity of purpose . The atmosphere had the vitality of a new morning ? and a new morning it seemed . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the new morning for all its brightness revealed certain practical difficulties . It was clear to me that the creative spirit in America could no longer hope to draw power or nourishment from capitalist culture in its decline , and I was sympathetic to the communists ' angry impatience to be rid of all this rottenness now and forever . Yet I was not entirely trustful of what they might put in its place . The truth is that I could not entirely trust them because I could not entirely trust myself . I knew that my own desire for a socialist society was not only intellectual ; it was emotional too ; and at the times when my own poverty , againstwhich I had struggled so long , became especially acute the desire was so extremely emotional that I saw everything in a red fog . My emotion did not upset me because I thought emotion contemptible or because I thought it was my intellectual duty to maintain a high-and-dry academic impartiality ; it upset me because , in moments of excitement and despondency , I heard myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulted what I believed deep down . The trouble with me was that I was still obsessed by the original American ideal , the beautiful lost dream of democracy ; yet I had despaired of it and was ready to accept , as the last hope of mankind , a regime that might well cut off , temporarily at least , the democratic vista . The two dreams trying to exist together were producing in me an unhappiness and confusion . I could accept the communists ' argument that it was not they , but the desperate capitalists heading toward an undeclared fascism , who really threatened to make democracy forever impossible in America ; I could even accept their charge that my temporizing about vague " American principles " in the time of crisis was petit-bourgeois treason . I could accept , but I could not solve my conflict . It was only as I was drawn deeper into the radical movement that the essential outlines of that conflict became apparent to me . I began to see then that the mistake the more rigid communists made was in assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual identification with its spirit , that it could be imported here without suffering a seachange ; and slowly I came to realize that this mistake , of which I too was guilty in some measure , was really a sort of emotional escape and arose out of an urge to turn savagely against the democratic dream that had proved so delusive . Many of the communists whom I knew and many of my own emotions had a flavor that was strangely reminiscent of the people I had known and the emotions I had had ten years before . I began to wonder if it were not barely possible that some of these ardent intellectual radicals could not be identified as first cousins of the men who had fled to Paris in the 1920 's , and if the radical movement ? loosely conceived ? were not in danger of becoming the New Expatria of the 1930 's . And I wondered too if my own desire to throw myself into the Communist Party had not arisen out of the same feeling of aloneness and rootlessness which ten years before had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keats . It was a sobering reflection ? and I knew it was partly a true one . Yet it did not condemn the radical movement or the Communist Party or my own desire to become a part ; it only put those things in some sort of perspective where I might more quietly examine them . What had always perturbed me about the extreme Leftists was their apparent willingness to repudiate the principles of our first revolution in the name of the one to come . It was not hard to see of course that these principles were being used obscenely by the patrioteers , and neither was it hard to sec that they were fast becoming principles in name only . Yet they were not to be discarded lightly ; they were not , if the future held a ray of hope , to be discarded at all . For they represented something more than personal liberty and freedom of speech . They represented all that was dynamic in the American dream , the vigor and eternal freshness of the democratic ideal . They were , in reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and economic order offered little nourishment for the democratic roots ; it was equally clear that the powerful movement toward a new society would tend , if too narrowly conceived , to cut itself off from the vital forces and run thinly into imitation and sterility . The real job of the revolutionary was to produce something more than social change ; his real job was to produce a change that was an extension of the American dream . The enthusiasts too easily forgot that the wonderful vigor of the Soviets was deeply Russian . Andthey too easily forgot the promise of fertility inherent in the Goddess of Liberty ; it was not for nothing that the young Frenchmen who came to America during the Revolution referred to Democracy as a Virgin , for they felt in her , perhaps without being quite conscious of what it was , some of the power that had built Chartres . Now it was not hard to see that a decaying but embattled capitalism was making more and more impossible the Jeffersonian concept of " life , liberty , and the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as the logical and natural development of any real democracy , was the only hope of protecting the dream of Jefferson against the corroding forces . But the coming change would have to be seen , not only as the spread of October 1917 , not only as the extension of July 1776 , but ? if I may be permitted an extravagance ? the offspring of their marriage . The effect of such a conclusion was in no way to lessen my participation in the struggle but only to redefine it ; it was also to make easier that other fight which was for patience . And slowly I began to see that communism as it had existed in my mind was one with all the other dreams : one with my youthful dream of the far-off New York , one with Paris , one with the eighteenth-century ideal of democracy , one with Chartres ; it was just another expression of the same hope , and the thread which had bound the dreams together was my hungry need as a writer to find my roots , a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans could drink . The results which the future might give could not be forecast , and perhaps for the creative man the only result is the amount of force generated in him by the world which he inhabits . It might well be that the new society would never emerge in our lifetimes . It would never emerge at all if the impulse to achieve it were not powerful enough to bind men together in a collective purpose , and so end the search for roots and lift from the creative spirit in America the unspoken sentence of exile .
