Full-Blooded Americans ( Cont 'd ) <P> Sirs : <P> Really can not savvy how those three so-called Americans who gave lip service to their 100% credo , in TIME , June 13 , can get so irrational , illogical and ill-at-ease about your publishing Earl Browder 's picture on your front cover TIME , May 30 . <P> Maybe they never heard of " free press " - maybe they think " suppress " is the American way . Will thank Hancock and Browder 's ancestors for our Bill of Rights , say I. No I 'm not a descendant of a coupla Mayflower Pilgrims but my people were waiting for ' em at Plymouth Rock , when they landed . <P> Yes I 'm part Indian , and while I might not agree with Browder or what he has to say I 'll fight for his right to say it . And furthermore if TIME decides its covers on sex appeal alone-I 'd pick Browder over Onion-head Hoover or Fudge-face Landon . <P> Yours for a better America . MARTHA VAN TASSELL <P> New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , subject Browder , signed by one Burton H. Pugh ; I respectfully suggest Mr. Pugh as candidate for nomination as warden of Jersey City concentration camp . <P> R. B. MAGEE <P> Elizabeth , N. J. <P> Sirs : <P> I am sorry I did not write sooner to thank you for your fine picture of Comrade Earl Browder on the cover of TIME , May 30 . <P> Mr. Burton H. Pugh , Mr. G. W. Thain , Mr. J. Wm . Cummins seem to be having a fit of indigestion over the publication of the picture on the front cover . May I suggest a dose of Carter 's Little Liver Pills ? Are n't some of the things that Americans hold dear the rights of free speech , free press , and so on ? ... <P> MAY WALDEN <P> Avon Park , Fla . <P> Sirs : <P> R. C. Barnett ( " The value of a man 's service to society is measured by the number of jobs he has provided for his fellow men " ) must have been thinking of Frank Hague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Benefactor No. 1 ! " <P> MARTIN CONRAD <P> Dover , N. J. <P> Sirs : <P> Congratulations to a magazine that has the courage to frontpage Earl Browder and by so doing may expect to receive the ridicule and abuse of such 100% ( ? ) Americans as threw rotten eggs at an elected and honored U. S. Congressman . <P> I am of the third native-born generation of an old Scotch line , but after the Jersey City incident I am soft pedaling my Americanism . H. F. McGINLEY <P> Kingman , Ariz . <P> Busy Nasi <P> Sirs : <P> I am one of your subscriber .
