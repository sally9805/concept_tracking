Across the street from the Metropolitan Opera House , in the musty theatre leased by the traveling American Opera Company , another debutant made an appearance last week . Although lacking the international prestige of Soprano Ohms , he had an audience far more determined to exhibit a friendly attitude . For he was Frank Michler Chapman Jr . of Englewood , N. J. , Princeton University and Florence , Italy ; the only son of Dr. Frank Michler Chapman , curator of ornithology ( What Bird Is That ? ) and Dean of the Faculty at the American Museum of Natural History ; divorced husband of Elisabeth Cobb , only daughter of Funnyman Irvin Shrewsbury Cobb . He left college early to serve in the Marine Corps in France in the same company with James Joseph ( " Gene " ) Tunney . Back at Princeton after the War , having a deeper voice than most of the boys and a fine stage scowl , he sang villain parts in Triangle Club shows . <P> With all these facts most members of his audience were well acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends of Cobbs , or fellow Princetonians . Detached critics were glad to join them in pronouncing Dbutant Chapman 's singing smooth and well-styled , above the American Opera average , though as a stage figure he seemed to lack the physique required of Valentine in Faust . <P> Baritone Chapman , the 16th* singer to join the American Opera ranks this season , will not continue with the Company on its third national tour . He will make a concert tour of his own , will sail in May for Italy where he has several operatic engagements , will rejoin the Americans in the fall . <P> They proceeded last week from Manhattan to Washington , thence to visit Baltimore and Richmond . Yolanda of Cyprus , opera by Composer Clarence Loomis of Chicago and Librettist Cale Young Rice of Louisville , added this year to their repertoire , continues to provoke critical argument . Throughout the Midwest it received effusive praise . Manhattan critics found it dull , derivative . <P> <P> *The other 15 : Sopranos Nancy McCord , Wantagh , L.
