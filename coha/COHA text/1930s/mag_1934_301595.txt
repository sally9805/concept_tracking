Preoccupied with President Roosevelt 's money methods , the Senate paused for a few minutes last week to confirm the appointment of a new chief for a government service which , excepting only the Post Office Department , touches more closely the daily lives of more U. S. citizens than any other-the U. S. Weather Bureau . <P> Weatherman Willis Ray Gregg , born 54 years ago in Phoenix , N. Y. graduated from Cornell in 1903 , joined the Weather Bureau next year . He was summoned to Washington headquarters in 1915 , made chief of the Aerological Division two years later . Eight years ago he tackled the job of organizing the Bureau 's service for commercial airways , has been at it ever since . He makes his debut as Bureau chief this week at the Aeronautical Sciences Institute Convention in Manhattan . <P> The intricate network of which he takes command was organized in 1870 as a function of the Signal Corps , transferred to the Department of Agriculture in 1891 . Its first annual appropriation was $15,000 . For the current fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for telegraph bills , most of the rest to pay some 1,000 employes . At more than 200 stations in the U. S. , Canada , Alaska , the West Indies , notations are made twice daily of pressure , precipitation , wind , temperature . The results are wired in code to Washington , Chicago , Denver , San Francisco , New Orleans , where forecasts are made . The Bureau insists that these forecasts are 90% accurate , complacently notes that gibes to the contrary are dwindling . <P> Weatherman Gregg 's predecessor is Charles Frederick Marvin , a softspoken , bushy-browed old gentleman of 75 whose great hobby was the 13-month calendar , whose special aversion is long-range forecasting . He will be retained in an advisory capacity until he completes 50 years of service ( end of this year ) .
