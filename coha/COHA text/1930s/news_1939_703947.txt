txt Highly paid officials of the Board of Education were criticized yesterday for their refusal to join other city officials in taking salary cuts as the Board of Estimate adopted the 1939-40 tax levy budget at a total of $587,518,638 . As adopted by the board , the next budget shows a $2,461,938 reduction from the 1938 tax levy budget of $589,980,576 . The basic tax rate on real estate for 1939-40 will be $2.80 for each $100 of assessed valuation , the rate that prevailed last year . All members of the Board of Estimate met the Mayor 's request that they take 10 per cent salary cuts except Borough Presidents James J. Lyons of the Bronx and George U. Harvey of Queens . Mr. Lyons read a long statement at the meeting contrasting Fusion " economy " with Tammany parsimony , but made no reference to his own salary . The total budget amounts to $684 , - 396,271 and is made up of $587,518 , - 638 in tax levy funds and $96,877,633 of other funds . As adopted , it contains 5 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who earn $5,000 or more , and 10 per cent cuts for officials in the same category earning $10,000 or more . Morris Scores Education Heads Leading the criticism of Board of Education officials , Newbold Morris , President of the City Council , said : " The education officials are unusually blind , and it seems to me unpleasantly so . If they had cooperated in taking the same salary cuts that others took , the city Could have saved $450,000 , from which funds could be provided to maintain vital educational services . The Officers of the Police and Fire Departments who went along with the Mayor 's request for pay cuts deserve the enthusiastic thanks of this board . " The education budget has not been reduced . There is a lot of confusion on this point . The Board of Education asked for a $160,000,000 budget , which , like those of other departments , could not be granted . This budget does not represent a decrease in educational activities . It merely means that the board 's request for more funds failed . " If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we really will be in difficulties with the Department of Education . " Isaacs Adds Criticism Stanley M. Isaacs , Borough President of Manhattan , added his criticism to that expressed by Mr. Morris . After brushing aside suggestions that the city levy new taxes and expressing regret that the city could not contribute more to private hospitals for the care of the city 's sick , he said : " I agree with what Mr. Morris has said about the Board of Education . Statements that have been made concerning that department 's budget have been very unjust to this board . Instead of cutting the education budget we merely refused to increase it by $8,000,000 , which is an entirely different matter . It is disheartening to this board to see no cooperation whatsoever from the Board of Education . Education employes in the higher salary brackets could have taken a cut just as other city officials did . " An effort has been made to tell the public that this board is responsible for the elimination of vital educational subjects as well as the jobs of substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing top salaries from the Boar 's of Education had taken the same cut that was required of other city employes , the saving thus effected would have preserved the jobs of 350 substitute teachers . If these substitutes are deprived of their jobs , it is because of the failure of thest high-salaried persons to cooperate with us in finding funds . All we asked was a parallel reduction on the same basis with other city officials . It is somewhat shocking to me that it has not been proposed . I hope it still may be forthcoming . " Borough President Lyons submitted a number of budget amendments , all of which were voted down . They included increasing the education budget by $3,000,000 ; giving the $119,845 allotted to WNYC , the city radio station , to private hospitals instead ; " changing the title of wheelwright to carpenter in the Fire Department " ; providing $120 annual increments for low-paid librarians ; restoring salaries of secretaries to City Court justices from $2,400 to $3,500 , and restoration of Deputy Mayor Henry H. Curran 's salary to $15,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal . Controller Joseph D. said a total saving of $6,305,498 had been accomplished by modifying the Mayor 's executive budget to provide that $6,000,000 of the $8 , - 200,000 item for redemption of relief bonds be provided from the collections of arrears , interest and penalties of emergency taxes . He reported that the city had collected $3,485,000 from this source in the three and a half months ended April 15 , a substantial gain over the $6,000,000 collected in 1938 . He recommended the transfer in the belief that these collections would hold up well throughout the year . In addition to the $6,000,000 , the board made further savings by cutting the salaries of probationary policemen and firemen from $2,000 a year to $1,200 . Another source of savings came in the change in salaries for newly elected or appointed judges , which were cut from $25,000 to $22,500 . This procedure applies in the Supreme Court , General Sessions , and the county courts . With the leeway provided by the savings , the board found it possible to authorize the appointment of forty new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the nine jurists who begin new terms in January , two are in General Sessions , three in the Supreme Court , First Department , and four in the Supreme Court , Second Department . In his five-page statement Borough President Lyons said city departments under Mayor La Guardia 's control had shown a $99,000 , - 000 increase in expense since 1934 , the year of the last Democratic budget . By contrast , he said departments not under the Mayor 's jurisdiction had shown a $23,694,240 reduction . Similarly , he said , employes in the Mayor 's departments had increased by 20,277 while those in other departments had dropped by 3,154 . He asked what had happened to the Mayor 's 1933 campaign pledge to save $50,000,000 and in protest against the budget voted against it . President Morris ? said the La Guardia administration had saved $30,000,000 in excessive condemnation costs in its first year , and had expanded its activities in the direction of hospitals and other humanitarian activity . After the budget had been adopted , budget officials remarked that Dr. Harold G. Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest paid city officials and received $2,500 more than the $22,500 paid to Mayor La Guardia.
