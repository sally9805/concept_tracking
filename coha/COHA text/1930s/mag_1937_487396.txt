PRIME MINISTER CHAMBERLAIN has taken control of British foreign policy out of the hands of Sir Robert Vansittart , permanent Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , and is going too fast to please the Foreign Office . It was not the policy of the Foreign Office to tell Hitler that he could have a free hand in Europe east of the Rhine , or to bargain with him on that basis . The policy of Vansittart was to go on talking about a general European arrangement including Germany , without any hope of getting one but with the hope of putting off the evil day . For Vansittart does not desire to give Hitler such a free hand but regards it as ultimately a disagreeable necessity . Neville Chamberlain sent Halifax to Berlin to prepare the way for a bargain by which Germany would be given the right of way at least in Austria and Czechoslovakia in return for an undertaking to abandon or at least postpone the demand for colonies . The Prime Minister and his envoy made a diplomatic blunder in thus blowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereality about British policy must now be evident except to those who refuse to see what is before their eyes . Unfortunately , there are many of these , especially in England . The following quotation from a private letter that I received from a friend in England a few days ago accurately describes the situation : British public opinion is not really pro-fascist , but when this is said , it could not otherwise be worse than it is . The middle classes , while uncritical and ignorant of foreign affairs , are shell-shocked with the cowardice of true decadence . The word " war " makes them quake ; yet they resolutely refuse to heed any evidence that war is likely to be forced upon them by the will of other states . They insistently believe , because they are determined to do so , that these states , especially Germany , can be bought off ; and they disbelieve obstinately that it is possible for the rulers of any country to love violence , to practice gross injustice , or to harbor designs against British territory . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation for Eden , who has now almost ceased to count . Halifax has for some time past been for all practical purposes super-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs . Neville Chamberlain and Halifax both belong to the powerful group in English business and " society " who have fascist sympathies because they realize that fascism , as Professor Brady says in his valuable book on German fascism , * is no more than the politically conscious phase of what he calls " control capitalism " ? as opposed to laissez faire capitalism  --  and is the only means by which the capitalist system , which has broken down , can be saved from final ruin . The Astor family belongs to this group ; hence , the pro-German policy of the London Times and the London Observer , in both of which members of that family have a controlling interest . The majority of the rank and file even of the Conservative Party would probably be opposed to Neville Chamberlain 's policy if they understood it , and certain members of the Cabinet , including Eden , are opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet can be successful only if they are ready to resign if they are overruled . It is difficult to hope that Eden will resign in any circumstances . Had he had a true conception of his own political interests , apart from any other consideration , he would have resigned his post as Minister for League of Nations Affairs in 1935 rather than agree to the betrayal of Abyssinia . As it is , he has gone on carrying out policies with which he did not agree and has allowed himself to be used as a decoy duck , for it is his presence in the Cabinet more than anything else that has blinded people in England and elsewhere to the true nature of British policy . Before Halifax went to Berlin , Hitler 's demands were known to the British government . Hitler declared that Germany would return to the League of Nations on the following conditions : revision of the Covenant ; suppression of Article 16 , providing for sanctions ; abolition of all connection between the League and the peace treaties ; suppression of Article 231 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision of the minorities treaties ; recognition by Great Britain of Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia . Hitler demanded that Great Britain should agree to the " reorganization " of Czechoslovakia on the lines of the Swiss federal system and should undertake to give no diplomatic , political , or military aid to the Austrian government . Hitler agreed not to raise the colonial question for six years if Great Britain would undertake to help Germany recover its colonies at the end of that time , and not to make naval or military bases in the former German colonies . He further promised to do his best to restore peace in Spain , on condition that the British government recognized Franco , and also to do his best to restore peace in the Far East . By sending Halifax to Germany , therefore , Neville Chamberlain accepted Hitler 's program as a basis of discussion . This does not necessarily mean that he was ready to agree to every point in it . No doubt Hitler in the last resort would be prepared to accept less than he asked , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a compromise on the basis of Hitler 's pro- " The Spirit and Structure of German Fascism . " By Robert A Brady . Viking Press . The e NATION posals . It will be seen that Hitler offered nothing at all in return for the concessions that he demanded , and Chamberlain will no doubt try to obtain a quid pro quo for sacrificing Czechoslovakia and Austria and agreeing to destroy the League of Nations . For the conditions demanded by Hitler would mean the destruction of the League , which would be deprived of any power of preventing or punishing aggression , and some of its members would never agree to such conditions . Incidentally , Germany could not be given a permanent seat on the Council except by a unanimous decision of that body , which would never be obtained . In the House of Commons Chamberlain refused to give any information about Halifax 's conversations , following the latter 's return , but said that his visit had encouraged the desire of the two countries for closer cooperation . It is therefore clear that he wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been given and no commitments had been made , and that the government would make no commitments without first consulting Parliament . Edward Grey more than once made similar statements to the House of Commons in the years before the war . Yet he made grave commitments without the knowledge of the House of Commons , of the English people , or even of some of his own colleagues in the Cabinet , and on August 4 , 1914 , the Manchester Guardian said in a leading article : " Sir Edward Grey 's speech last night . . . showed that for years he has been keeping back the whole truth . " The question now is whether and for how long Neville Chamberlain and his fascist friends will be able to go on humbugging the British public . They will be able to as long as the majority of the English people refuse to believe that anything disagreeable can possibly be true . Never was the refusal to recognize the real nature of Nazi Germany more evident than in speeches made by members of the Labor and Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 and in the speech made by Sir Archibald Sinclair , leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons , at a public meeting in Manchester . Sir Archibald Sinclair said in the course of his speech : We want to welcome Germany back into the League as an equal in the fullest sense . . . . Once Germany rejoins the League and agrees to a measure of general disarmament and the international supervision of armaments and undertakes to abide by conciliation or arbitration in all international disputes , there is no price for her friendship that our League obligations permit , that justice and equity demand , and that third-party judgment assesses that we should be unwilling to pay . Such are the aims of Liberal policy . It is based not on fear  --  fear of foreign competition , fear of Mussolini , fear of socialism  --  but on faith . Sinclair 's definition of faith seems to resemble that given by the legendary candidate for holy orders in his examination paper " Faith is a grace given us by God which enables us to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was Lord Chancellor in the last Labor Cabinet , is likewise willing to accept Hitler 's conDecember 18 , 1937 ditions for the return of Germany to the League . In a speech in the House of Lords on November 18 he said that the most important thing for the League of Nations to consider was whether it was to have the United States and Germany in the League or whether it should retain the article on sanctions ( Article 16 ) in the Covenant . He thought that it would be better to have the United States and Germany in the League and Article 16 out of the Covenant . The illusion that the United States would at once join the League if Article 16 were taken out of the Covenant is entertained by many people in England , but Lord Sankey ought to know better . Perhaps the most brilliant suggestion was that made by Lord Samuel , a prominent Liberal , in the House of Lords on November 17 . As part of an all-round settlement , Lord Samuel proposed , Russia should give a pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If that were done , " he said , " Germany could be expected to stop breathing fire and slaughter against her . " If Lord Samuel were an imbecile , one could believe this suggestion to be sincere . If there is a country that should be asked to give a pledge not to interfere in the affairs of other nations , it is Germany . At the very moment that Lord Sathuel was speaking the British government knew that Hitler demanded the right to interfere in the affairs of Czechoslovakia and Austria . He has interfered in them already without asking anybody . And now it has been revealed to the world that Hitler and Mussolini have been repeating in France the tactics that they pursued in Spain and aiding a plot for the overthrow of the French Republic . Fortunately , the plot was discovered in time , but will the present French government have the courage to bring the responsibility home and probe the matter to its depths ? For my part I doubt it , for it was the weakness of the French government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embark on their adventure . About a fortnight ago certain members of a reactionary organization in a French town at no very great distance from Geneva said that as there was certainly going to be a Communist revolution , the " Nationals " were determined to forestall the Communists . When it was suggested that their opponents might prove to be stronger than they were , they replied that they counted on German intervention " to restore order " and were convinced that the British government would adopt a policy of non-intervention . The French government knows that the Roselli brothers were murdered by Italian police officers who had been allowed to enter France on the pretext of watching over the safety of an Italian royal personage on a visit . The French government knows that the riot at Clichy , a working-class suburb of Paris , was started by German agents . The French government knows that the explosion in the rue de Presbourg , Paris , was traced to the Italian embassy in Paris . In each case investigation has been stifled and the criminals have gone scot-free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Eden admitted in the House of Commons , without any consultation with the French government . The situation is grave , for Hitler is dictating terms as if Germany were a victor imposing its will on the vanquished . There is only one way in which the countries threatened by Hitler are to be defended . That is by a general European pact of mutual assistance  --  the Geneva protocol of 1924 , with whatever amendments may be necessary , restricted to Europe . The present British government will never agree to join in such a pact , but the pact might still be possible if the British government undertook to fulfil its obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations , should the occasion arise . Even that is too much to expect from Neville Chamberlain , and it is much to be feared that Chautemps and Delbos will once more yield and consent to continue negotiations with Hitler . In that case one can but hope that the French Socialists and Communists will at last have the courage to turn Chautemps out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
