txt A sweeping bill aimed directly at chain stores but which would affect a large additional slice of the American business setup has been prepared by Representative Wright Patman , Texas Democrat , for introduction at the next session of Congress . The proposed measure would prohibit all retail sales by manufacturers or their affiliates of their own products . It has been prepared as an amendment to the Clayton Anti-Trust Act . As the bill is now written , manufacturers would not be able to transport in interstate commerce " any article or material produced by such manufacturer for sale or distribution at retail by such manufacturer . " Determination at this time of Congressional attitude toward such a measure is impossible , of course . Much depends on the outcome of the election and the make-up of the new Congress which will come into office in January . In a bulletin to its members , the American Retail Federation advises that the bill proposed by Representative Patman may not be introduced in its present form , which may be a " trial balloon " Grocery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Amer. ican Retail Federation , which opposed Mr. Pat . man 's anti-price discrimination measure passed at the last session of Congress , said he believed the act was aimed almost entirely at the grocery and clothing industries . This would make the chief sufferers from its passage the large clothing and grocery chains , including Sears . Roebuck &; Co , Montgomery Ward &; Co. , Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. , First National Stores , American Stores , Piggly Wiggly , etc . The bill is believed to be aimed also at direct selling , especially the type earned on by Real Silk Hosiery Mills where canvassers market st4ndard clothing products in competition with local merchants . The five and ten cent store chains , such as Woolworth 's and Kresge 's , the large drug chains , such as Liggett 's , Owl and Whelan 's , and department stores which manufacture part of their stocks or own small producing units could be directly hit , trade association circles here believe . Shoe chains would also be alfec.ed . While the larger chain-store merchandising organizations are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to many other trades , in the opinion of critics . Utilities Seen Invoked Electric utihtles which manufacture and distribute their own energy would have to cease one of those activities if a state line were crossed . Bakeries and milk companies would be affected . The large oil companies which own retail outlets would be called on to sell their service stations . Motion picture companies owning exhibition houses are specifically included . Colonel Sherrill pointed out that the bill resulted from the tendency of corporations to do their own manufacturing or distributing to avoid embroilment with the Robinson-Patman Act , which prohibits rebates or price allowances not made to all purchasers on the same basis . Copies of letters by Mr. Patman , co-author or the Robinson-Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act now  --  being administered by the Federal Trade Commission , have been received in Washington containing drafts of the bill which he contemplates introducing . The text of the proposed bill is : " A bill to amend the Clayton Act in order further to protect interstate commerce against restraints and monopolies .
