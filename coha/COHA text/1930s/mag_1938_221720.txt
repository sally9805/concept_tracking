The 3,000 district leaders of the French Communist Party who were summoned to Paris recently by No. 1 French Communist Maurice Thorez ( TIME , March 28 ) returned to their homes last week primed to execute his orders : " Arouse the masses ! " <P> The French masses are not easily aroused but soon some 18,000 workers in five factories of Citron Motors ( " The Ford Of France " ) went on a sit-down strike and , without stating specific grievances , hoisted red flags . While they continued to sit , quarter-hour sympathy sit-downs were staged at the Farman , Caudron and other vital French warplane factories . All this was extremely peaceable , without riots or even the summoning of police , but everyone remembered that in 1936 over 1,000,000 workers walked out as a means of : 1 ) pressing the first Popular Front Cabinet of Premier Lon Blum to legislate promised vital concessions to Labor ; 2 ) coercing his political enemies of the Right into abandoning some of their opposition . Last week the workers appeared in an unorganized way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who now heads his second Popular Front Cabinet and was encountering firm opposition last week in the Senate . The workers were by no means under the leadership of Communist Thorez , but he bid violently for that leadership last week by demanding a nationwide General Strike . <P> Meanwhile , the Premier engaged in a personal duel of words with the president of the Senate Finance Committee , Joseph Caillaux . Blum was trying to get authorization to borrow another $270,000.000 from the Bank of France to keep the country going for three and a half months , but the Senate thought that was giving the Premier too much rope , hauled him down to $150,000,000 hoping he would resign in a huff , but instead the Premier took what he could get . " Watch out , " angry Blum told irate Caillaux , " lest in manifesting prejudice against our Government and distrust of it you do not alter the present political circumstances and render impossible the very solutions you wish ! " <P> In what amounted to a democratic deadlock , with a few more strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the thoroughly aware and alarmed Socialist Premier that War veterans might try to resolve the situation by turning his Cabinet out by violence . In his newspaper Le Populaire he stirringly asked them not to " descend into the streets . " <P> At week 's end 30,000 workers jammed Buffalo Stadium in Paris , booed moderate French Labor Union Boss Lon Jouhaux completely off the stage with hoots and cries demanding French aid be sent to Leftist Spain . <P> In efforts to divert the public mind , Joseph Paul-Boncour. the new Foreign Minister and great League of Nations apostle , announced that German agents are busy in Alsace-Lorraine fomenting " Hitlerian intrigues " and that orders have been given for their arrest .
