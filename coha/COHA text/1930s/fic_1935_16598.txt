The hall is small and seems crowded , with hat rack , table and a grandfather 's clock . Faded wallpaper in a vine design adds a cluttery touch to the slightly worn flowered carpet .

Propped up by pillows in bed is Virgil Adams , a thin , worn , grey-haired man with wistful eyes and a gentle , friendly smile . The smile is not in evidence at the moment , for he is gazing distastefully down at a bowl of soup on a tray . His expression does not change as he glances up at his wife who enters , carrying the saucer of soda crackers , and assuming a forced cheerfulness supposed to be helpful to the invalid . &nbsp; MRS .

Besides , I think , Alice , that I ought to know by this time how to handle your father . With that , she turns and starts down the stairs , her very shoulder line showing the martyrdom of misunderstanding .

Adams leans back and his face grows wistful and unhappy as he speaks . &nbsp; ADAMSWell ,  --  it 's kinda funny for a man who 's been in business with Lamb &amp; Company as long as I have , to hear it called an old hole ,  --  that 's what your mother calls it . Why , it 's a mighty pleasant place to work ... &nbsp; ALICE ( as she straightens his pillow ) Yes , but father , it 's just that mother feels they do n't appreciate you there . &nbsp; ADAMSWell , they 've h'isted my salary every two years all the time I 've worked for them ,  --  and they took Walter right on , soon as I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful to me , holding my job open while I 've been sick all this time .

ADAMS ( approaching closer and glaring at her husband ) Your dear , grand old Mr. Lamb 's Henrietta has sent out invitations for a large party . Everybody who is anybody in town has been asked , you can be sure of that . Mr. Adams has been listening in some bewilderment not yet discovering why his wife 's voice is shaken by unshed tears .

She moves to the table by the bed  --  or wherever the bottle and glass are , and Adams , at the same time , finds the pouch and sits down to fill his pipe . &nbsp; MRS .

Arthur again takes the chair beside her . &nbsp; ARTHUR ( trying to smile ) Do I seem as stupid as all that ? 273 CLOSE TWO SHOT Alice hardly hears him .

LAMB --  yes , that 's what I called you . &nbsp; ADAMS ( flaring up ) You did , huh ?  --  148  --  &nbsp; MR . LAMBYes , I did . &nbsp; ADAMS ( slowly capitulating ) Well , maybe you wore right . Mr. Lamb standing up and putting aside his chair . &nbsp; MR . LAMBNow , Virgil , this is the point . If you and I been transgressing against each other , why , I think it 's time we quit such foolishness ... Adams also rises . For a moment , the two old men gaze at each other with growing understanding . Abruptly Lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAMBI guess maybe I once talked about doing something for you in connection with that glue business . I 've been selfish and forgetful , but it 's never too lato to mend , and well ,  --  we wo n't talk about it now  --  He moves toward the door , adding : &nbsp; MR . LAMB --  you come down to the office soon 's you feel fit and we 'll work something out  --  He pauses , thinks over possibilities , and vigorously nods his head as he says : &nbsp; MR . LAMB --  yes , I think together , maybe , we ought to be able to show the world something about glue ... And we 'll talk about Walter then , too ... Well , good night . He nods pleasantly toward everyone , as Mrs. Adams , relieved to the point of tears , hurries after him to escort him out . Alice crosses to the door , closes it and turns back to faca her father who has sunk down on the edge of the bed , overcome by this turn of events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man , Daddy ? &nbsp; ADAMS ( gratefully ) He is ,  --  but if it had n't been for you  --   --  149  --  He roaches out and takes her hand as she comes over to him . &nbsp; ALICENonsense , Daddy ,  --  why should you think that ? &nbsp; ADAMS ( adoringly ) What I think  --  I think you 're the smartest girl in the world ; I would n't trade you for the whole kit-and-boodle of ' em . He beams upon her , and she hugs him , sinking down on the bed beside him . For a moment both gaze into space , each busy with his own thoughts . &nbsp; ADAMSIs n't it funny how things work out ? I 've seen it happen in other people 's lives and now it 's happened in ours . &nbsp; ALICEWhat , father ? &nbsp; ADAMSWhy , you think you 're going to be pushed right spang up against the wall . You ca n't see any way out ,  --  or any hope at all  --  and then something you never counted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  and keep on going . &nbsp; ALICE ( softly ) I understand , Daddy . &nbsp; ADAMS ( turning to look at her ) I 'm afraid you do . And you ought n't to at your age . ( shakes his head regretfully ) Young people should leave the troubles to the old ones , and concentrate on good times ... ( pats her arm ) He 's a fine young man , Alice ,  --  the nicest and quietest you ever had . And I know he likes you just for your own sake and not on account of any dang glue factory or anything else .  --  150  --  &nbsp; ALICE ( not looking at him ) Yes , Daddy . ( she rises and speaks more briskly ) Now you 'd better go to bed and rest . You 've had enough excitement for one night . Good night , dear . ( stooping , she kisses him ) &nbsp; ADAMSGood night . Alice crosses to the door , turns off the overhead lights , smiles back at her father and goes out , gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HALL - NIGHT MED . SHOT . Mrs. Adams is coming down the hall accompanied by Walter . Alice advances to meet them and they pause for an instant . &nbsp; WALTER ( contrite and very grateful ) Mom told me , Alice . He squeezes her arm to express the emotion he can not voice ,  --  then walks into his father 's room to try and make it up with Mr. Adams . Mrs. Adams follows Alice to the stairway . &nbsp; MRS . ADAMS ( stopping her anxiously ) Alice ! ... How about -- - ? &nbsp; ALICE ( quickly ) Oh , he left before anything happened . Everything 's all right . She tries to smile but the attempt is a signal failure . &nbsp; MRS . ADAMS ( taking Alice 's hand ) No  --  no it is n't . Oh , my poor baby ,  --  he 's gone , is n't he ? &nbsp; ALICE ( looking away and slightly shrugging ) It does n't matter  - -  -   --  151  --  &nbsp; MRS . ADAMS ( softly wailing ) That dinner ,  - -  -  oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ALICEThere 's nothing to forgive , nother ,  --  it 's just the way things are ... She pats her arm and smiles . Then she ceases to look at her mother and stares beyond her as though reviewing the full sequence of events . Half to herself , she continues quietly : &nbsp; ALICEIt 's all so clear to me now : You do thus and so , and you tell yourself , ' now , seeing me do thus and so , people will naturally think this and that ' ,  --  but in the end they do n't . They think something else ,  --  usually just what you do n't want them to ... I suppose about the only good in pretending is the fun we get out of fooling ourselves that we fool somebody else . Mrs. Adams is gazing at her , startled , a little apprehensive . This is not like Alice . The young girl , suddenly realizing this , smiles and , reaching out , gives her mother a big hug . &nbsp; ALICE ( as one would speak to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'll turn out the lights . As she says this she starts down the stairs . Mrs. Adams looks after , slowly shakes her head , then turns away and moves toward her own door . 290 INT . LIVING ROOM - NIGHT MED . SHOT . Alice , coming in , switches off the overheads . The lamps are still lit , and she moves from one to the other turning them off until she reaches the last one , by the phonograph . Here she pauses , thinking  --  about the evening  --  about Arthur . After a moment 's hesitation she gets out a record , places the disc and starts it whirling . MUSIC answers softly  --  the same piece that had been played five times at the inn  --  her piece  --  hers and Arthur 's . She listens  --  then , as one moving in a dream , quietly , a little wearily , she crosses the room and into the hall .  --  152  --  291 INT . ADAMS ' HALL - NIGHT MED . SHOT . As the MUSIC follows Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes out on the porch , leaving the door ajar behind her . 292 EXT . ADAMS ' PORCH - NIGHT Alice comes out on the porch . She stands for a moment , gazing out into the night  --  quiet , a little weary . Then , out of the darkness  --  &nbsp; ARTHUR 'S VOICEA penny for your thoughts . Alice whirls , startled , gazing at him as at an apparition , as he comes forward . &nbsp; ARTHURNo  --  a little , dead rose  --  He hands her the same one she had given him at the table . She takes it without looking , her gaze riveted upon him . At last she finds her voice . &nbsp; ALICEYou  --  you came back ! &nbsp; ARTHUR ( smiling ) I did n't go . &nbsp; ALICEWhy ? &nbsp; ARTHURI was waiting  --  for you . &nbsp; ALICEBut I thought  --  Suddenly she realizes that if he had waited , he must have heard  --  she looks up at the house and gasps . &nbsp; ALICEOh ! &nbsp; ARTHUR ( interpreting the look and nodding ) Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ALICE ( stammering ) You heard  --  ?  --  153  --  &nbsp; ARTHUR ( gently but firmly ) Stop it ! And let me finish . Then , as Alice shuts up , he continues on a more conversational note . &nbsp; ARTHURI heard a great deal this afternoon  --  at Mildred 's , too . &nbsp; ALICESo they did talk about me . &nbsp; ARTHURYes , and it 's all opened my eyes to one thing  --  He pauses , takes a step toward her , gazing at her intently , as he says : &nbsp; ARTHURI love you , Alice . She stands still , petrified , staring at him . &nbsp; ARTHURDid you hear me ? I love you  --  &nbsp; ALICEGee Whiz  --  And when she still stands and looks , he suddenly , strongly , sweeps her into his arms . FADE OUT THE END pp. 108-130 &nbsp;
