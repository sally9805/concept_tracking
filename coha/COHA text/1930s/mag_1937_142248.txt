Ashes &; Braddles <P> " What 's the score ? How many did Bradman make ? " <P> These were the first words addressed to an Australian farmer last week by two travelers whom he encountered in the fastnesses of the MacPherson Range , 60 mi. south of Brisbane . The travelers , named Binstead and Proud , were the only survivors of one of the most shocking crashes in Australia 's air history . Near them was the charred wreckage of the plane containing the bodies of its two pilots and two other passengers . Farther away lay the corpse of another passenger who had plunged to his death off a cliff while trying to find help in the dark . Travelers Binstead and Proud , after eight days without food , had given up hope of being found alive . They were writing last messages to their relatives when found . What they wanted to know was the score of the fifth and final cricket match between Australia and England for " The Ashes , " and what had happened to Australia 's famed George Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player in the world . <P> To their delight Travelers Binstead and Proud learned that the fifth match of the series was not yet over , that Batsman Bradman had just finished rolling up the impressive score of 169 runs . This helped swell Australia 's first innings score to 604 . England , which had won the first two matches at Brisbane and Sydney and lost the next two at Melbourne and Adelaide , had made only 239 runs in its first innings . It was now faced with the task of getting at least 365 runs in the second to make it necessary for Australia to bat again . England 's best batter , W. H. Hammond , could make no more than 56 runs before he was caught out by Bradman . Next morning with two wickets left to fall , Australia 's able slow bowler , L. O. B. Fleetwood-Smith , took them both before England could add to its overnight score of 165 . Australia had then won the match , by an innings and a tidy 200 runs , retained The Ashes by a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rescue of Binstead and Proud appeared last week in Australian newspapers , no one criticized their curiosity as frivolous . Had anyone done so , Travelers Binstead and Proud could have answered with some justice that almost any other loyal British subject would have asked the same questions . To consider cricket the " national game " of a world-wide empire is to do it a grave injustice . Extremely dull either to play or to watch , it thrives because in addition to being a game , it is an art , a religion and a huge tea party . The biennial matches between England and Australia , cricket 's No. 1 event , combine for Britishers the attractions of a World Series , a Madrid corrida and a Nazi jamboree.
