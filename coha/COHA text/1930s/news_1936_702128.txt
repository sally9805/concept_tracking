txt President Roosevelt today prepared to produce what his Republican opponents derisively term another " white rabbit , " this time in the form of a statement from prominent life insurance executives reassuring investors that their policies were never safer and that they have nothing to fear from New Deal financial methods . The White House announced that an important conference between Mr. Roosevelt and insurance company officials would be held tomorrow . The White House staf refused to divulge the nature of the conference or the names of the conferees , but it was reported in reliable quarters that a reassuring statement could be expected . Seen as Reply to Knox . Announcement of the conference was seen as an effort on the part of the President to arrange a dramatic reply to the charge made by Col. Frank Knox , Republican candidate for Vice President , that insurance policies are not safe under the New Deal . Speaking at Allentown , Pa. , on Sept. 5 , Col. Knox said : " The present administration has been for four years giving lip service to security and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no savings account is safe . " The White House secretariat insisted that the insurance conference was called before Col. Knox made his Allentown speech , which was a week ago Saturday , but Leroy Lincoln , president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance company , stated in New York that he received the invitation " some time last week . " Any time last week would have been after the Knox speech . When Was Invitation Sent ? After word of Mr. Lincoln 's statement reached Washington , the White House again exhibited its concern when Stephen Early , press secretary , called in reporters and stated that the " first draft " of the President 's invitation to the insurance conference was written on Aug. 21 . If Mr. Lincoln 's invitation was received " some time last week " the President must have waited at least two weeks bC. fore sending out the letters . Observers quickly pointed out , after the White House announcement , that the very nature of the life insurance business would put the executives summoned to the conference with the President " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sympaI by with New Deal fiscal policies . An insurance company official could no more afford to warn customers that their policies were in danger than a bank president could afford to invite ar run on his hank by telling depositors that their deposits were not safe . Would Discuss Surface Safety . William Hard , radio commentator for the Republican national committee . declared in his broadcast tonight that Mr. Roosevelt would merely ask the insurance executives about the " surface safety " of the policies and would not ask them about the " danger of inflation and the possible destruction of their tthe policies ) purchasing power . " Hard said the face value of the insurance policies undoubtedly would he paid and that everyone knew the insurance companies to he solvent . But he suggested that the President interrogate the insurance executives a s follows : " ' Do you fear , gentlemen , that there is going to be inflation of Prices ? Do you fear that $10,000 paid to the beneficiary of a life insurance policy may presently buy far less than $10,000 now buys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government are pushing us into a period of rapidly rising inflationary prices , which will destroy the purchasing power of the wages of the workers ? ' " Widespread Fear of Inflation . Hard said that virtually every economist and virtually every banker in the United States fears that we are on the verge of drastic inflation , because the government has been borrowing billions of- dollars to finance its deficits . The government has not been getting these billions in the main from the savings of the people , but from " the book entries in the accounts of the commercial banks ? through the use of ink on deposit slips  --  through the mere manufacture of bank credit , which is the same thing as the mere manufacture of any other form of money . " Hard asserted . The calling of the insurance conference follows a series of operations of more or less official character which have been calculated to allay fears inspired by Republican orators and thus relieve the President of the necessity of making personal replies . After Republican candidates had made a major issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitability of drastic taxes to foot the bill , President Roosevelt early last month summoned Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau , Senator Pat Harrison Dem. , Missal , and Representative Robert L. Doughton ' Dern. , N. C.1 to the White House . ' Chore. with the front steps as their sounding board , they solemnly proclaimed that business was improving so rapidly , revenues increasing so greatly and expenditures being curtailed so prudently that it would not he necessary to lay any new taxes on the people to balance the budget at some unspecified date . Eecall Similar Promises . The Republicans hooted in derision , recalling similar promises made by Mr. Harrison just before the " soak the rich " tax bill came up and just before the President 's message demanding " the undistributed profits " tax bill . The President , however , followed up with a revised budget summation , released over his signature on Sept. 1 . Although he forecast a gross deficit of $2,096,996,300 , the public debt would actually he increased by only 410 million dollars for the 1937 fiscal year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original estimate , despite the fact that since it was made the Supreme court had ruled out 500 million dollars in processing t a x es and congress had passed the bonus , of which 560 million dollars remained to be paid in the current fiscal year . Another charge which the Republicans have made against the New Deal is that the civil service has been raided and virtually destroyed : that less than 10 per cent of 260.000 pay rollers added in the executive branch of the government under the New Deal have been under civil service . Issues Executive Order . Mr. Roosevelt : first ; issued an P.N.C ( 11-five order purporting to place all first , second and third class postmasters under civil service hut actually providing for the continuation of all of Mr. Farley 's appointees in office without competitive examination . Next Mr. Roosevelt wrote a letter to the Home Owners ' Loan corporation instructing its officials to adhere to " civil service standards " and holding out the prospect . of ultirnalr civil , rrvirr , comnI inner ! .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
