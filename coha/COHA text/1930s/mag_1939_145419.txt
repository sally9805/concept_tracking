With Musica-Coster the impostor dead &; buried , a few plain facts about his twelve-year reign and rape of McKesson &; Robbins made news last week . It seemed apparent : 1 ) that the company 's $18,000,000 of missing assets would not be found in munitions or anything else because they had never existed in the first place ; 2 ) that they had been written up on the books to keep the company apparently prosperous while Coster swindled it out of $4,000,000 ; 3 ) that much of his booty went for blackmail . Revealed by one or another of the various investigations probing the great drug swindle , these general conclusions were partially confirmed by Impostor Coster himself-in a slightly incoherent , wholly melodramatic note written just before he shot himself . Excerpts : <P> " Bankers , lawyers , auditors , appraisers and incompetent high-salaried executives , have bled McKesson &; Robbins white . . . . <P> " All of a sudden the treasurer and inside ' shotters ' gang got cold feet and started a secret investigation with no other objective than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and underlings the goat and bring shame and humiliation on my poor loving wife . . . . There are no millions lost or hidden , much less narcotics or alcohol involved . . . . <P> " And know that there are no hidden treasures anywhere . . . . <P> " McKesson should have been in receivership in 1930 and again in 1932 if its profits had not been bolstered in a frantic effort to save the company-and the alleged millions " lost " are simply " profits " to save the company from the hands of the bondholders . . . . <P> " In other words , in the main they were wash sales to create a profit that did not exist , and what is missing is the alleged profits plus expenses and blackmail money paid to maintain it . ... <P> " As God is my judge I am the victim of Wall Street plunder and blackmail in a struggle for honest existence . . . .
