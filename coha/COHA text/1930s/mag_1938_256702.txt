George Van Horn Moseley is a military freak . While in service most army officers feel obliged to bottle up their opinions , but he has not hesitated to announce his belief that more money should be spent on syphilis prevention and less on national defense , that immigration of Austro-German refugees should be facilitated but they should be sterilized before being admitted to the U. S. Last week tart , leathery Major General Moseley , having passed 43 years in the service and two in command of the U. S. Third Army , retired , as all army men must do at 64 . News editors were made aware of this routine event by the receipt of four mimeographed sheets . <P> His remarkable document was in the tradition of Brigadier General William ( " Billy " ) Mitchell , who kicked the complacency out of the air service ; of the Marines ' General Smedley Butler , Navy 's Rear Admiral William Sims , Army 's Major General Johnson Hagood , who brought on premature retirement by his reference to " WPA stage money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " . . . to talk , as a private citizen , about the problems that you and I and every other loyal American must face . . . . Make no mistake , the world drift is away from democracy . . . and America is caught in that drift . There is much encouragement , however , in the results of the September elections , where the integrity and the independence of the American voter has been shown . <P> " We do not have to vote for a dictatorship to have one in America . . . . We have merely to vote increased government responsibility for our individual lives , increased government authority over our daily habits , and the resultant Federal paternalism will inevitably become dictatorship . . . . <P> " In a democracy it is fundamental that every citizen have full confidence in the integrity and fair-minded impartiality of his government . . . . But today in America we often see class marshalled against class and unfair preference is sometimes shown . " <P> Citizen Moseley 's concluding paragraph reminded readers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting civil wars if &; when civil government ceases to govern . " Today , " he wrote , " when doctrines subversive to American constitutional government are being preached and civil authority is often openly flouted , the Army . . . stands firm as the one stable element . . . . The Army of the United States , unlike certain other armies , will never march for any leader except one lawfully appointed and acting fully and lawfully in the interest of all citizens and holding high the Stars and Stripes forever . " <P> With outraged vehemence , Secretary of War Harry Woodring retorted that Major Generall Moseley " was disappointed in his ambition to become Chief of Staff . . . . As to the reasons why General Malin Craig was preferred for the important post , I do not think anyone needs to look farther than to read General Moseley 's flagrantly disloyal statement .
