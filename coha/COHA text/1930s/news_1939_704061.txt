txt Members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System are understood to be considering an order reducing the maximum allowable interest rate on time deposits of Federal Reserve member banks to 29i , from the 2 , S% maximum rate now in effect . If a seduction in the maximum rate is eventually ordered by the board , similar action undoubtedly would be taken by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which has jurisdiction over the time deposit interest rates of insured state banks which are not members of the Federal Reserve System . The contemplated reduction , to a large extent , would merely recognize and formalize the general downward movement in the going interest rates paid by banks that has been under way for an extended period . At the present time . it is estimated here that probably not more than 3250.000,004 ) in time deposits of commercial banks is now receiving the 234% maximum rate . In general . large banks are now paying 1 , - 2% or lesf , while the average going rate of small banks is understood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2% maximum in itself would not be likely to cause any important further reduction in the average rate being paid by banks as a whole . The existing maximum allowable rate of 2%1/4 on savings deposits and other time deposits payable in six months or more has been in effect for insured non-member banks since February 1 , 1936 ? and for Federal Reserve member banks since February 1 , 1935 . Since that time , of course , there has been a marked de cline in money rates that has been especially pronounced during the current year . The present maximum allowable rate on time deposits , other than savings deposits . payable in 90 days to six months is 2 , - " C and on such deposits payable in less than 90 days is 1.7 : - . Although a reduction in the general maximum rate to VI , would not be expected to have any marked effect on the going time deposit rates , the principle of such a move is favored by the Administration group which seeks to spur a movement of so-called " surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels . As an indication of the low point to which time deposit interest rates have declined in large banking centers , information available here shows that in the large New York and Philadelphia banks the current maximum rate is 1% and that in Chicago the rate ranges between 1 and 1%% . In addition , many banks do not now pay interest on time deposits in excess of $5,000 or $10,000.
