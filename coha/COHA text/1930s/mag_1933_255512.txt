STATES &; CITIES <P> Last year , as acting Mayor for 16 weeks after James John Walker 's flight , clean-cut , grinning little Joseph Vincent McKee was the idol , the White Hope of thousands of New Yorkers who mortally hate &; fear the yoke of Tammany . He had striven for municipal economies . Although he prided himself on his Democratic regularity , in Board of Estimate meetings he did not seem afraid to swap punches with Tammany . When bumbling John Patrick O'Brien was propped up in the special Mayoral election last November by Tammany , many a citizen was puzzled at Mr. McKee 's unwillingness to run against him . Spurred chiefly by the militant World-Telegram , 262,000 voters wrote McKee 's name on their ballots literately ; the votes of 73,000 more were not counted because of misspelling . <P> Last spring Mr. McKee made no effort to have his name entered in the Democratic primaries voted last fortnight ( TIME , Oct. 2 ) . He preferred to retire to a $50,000-a-year bank job . He was offered the top place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in next month 's elections . Like Caesar , Joseph McKee for the third time waved away his honors . It therefore surprised many of his fellow citizens , disgusted many more , and dismayed both Fusion and Tammany when , last week , after a fortnight 's indecision culminating in a 48-hour period during which three appointments were made and broken with the Press , Joseph McKee declared himself the Independent Democratic candidate for Mayor . <P> " For nearly two weeks . " said his announcement , " by letter and by telegram , by resolution and personal appeal , I have been asked to be a candidate for Mayor . . . . One and all protested against a leadership that has shattered the city 's credit and made the people of this city bow their heads - an arrogant leadership of stupidity and corruption , unmatched since the days of Boss Tweed . . . . There is no real Fusion in this campaign . The so-called Fusion standard bearer is as objectionable to the solid element of our Republican citizenry as he is to the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... As Mayor , I shall be absolutely free from political domination by any leader or any set of leaders . " <P> " A sorry business , " grumbled the Herald Tribune . " A Joseph Yea-and-Nay , " snapped the Times . " He has not acted as if he were his own man ; scarcely as if he knew his own mind . . . . The fact remains that the best hope of a successful attack upon Tammany lies in the Fusion ticket . " The World-Telegram turned furiously on its former champion : " ' A plague on ALL bosses ! ' becomes more than ever the slogan since the McKee decision . "
