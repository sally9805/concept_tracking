A few hours before Franklin Roosevelt set out across the continent to separate " liberal " sheep from " conservative " goats ( see p. 7 ) , quietly out of Washington for a tour of his own slipped James Aloysius Farley , chief shepherd of all Franklin Roosevelt 's political herds . No believer in griping party purges , Jim Farley 's mission was to soothe feelings already hurt in primary fights , encourage sheep and goats to stampede all together in November . His first stop was at Fond du Lac , Wis. , his second at Sheboygan , Wis. , his third at Clinton , Iowa . Altogether , Shepherd James Farley planned to stop , look &; listen in more than 100 towns and cities , mostly in the Midwest and Northwest . His farthest stop : Seward , Alaska . One of his most important stops : this week 's national convention of Young Democrats ( 5,000 delegates ) at Seattle .
