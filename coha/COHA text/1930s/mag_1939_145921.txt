The marbles for which England is most famed are the Elgin marbles , a collection of Greek sculptures which Lord Elgin plucked from the Parthenon at Athens in the early 19th Century , now one of the most noteworthy possessions of the British Museum . To the natives of the little village of Tinsley Green , however , the Elgin marbles are nothing at all . The marbles they talk about are the lively glassies and marididdles that determine the annual marbles championship of England , oldest sporting event in the Kingdom . Through 18 reigns , since a day in 1588 when two village Hodges played for the favors of a red-cheeked Joan , a marbles match has been held in the courtyard of the Greyhound Inn on Good Friday . <P> Last week , as solemn as cricketers , eight teams of seasoned marblers ( six men to a team ) massed around a concrete bed at Tinsley Green to knuckle it out for the 352nd marbles championship . This match was the most momentous ever : the recently organized Marbles Control Board hopes to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U. S. team . Gravely each man in turn studied the positions of the marbles in the circle , gravely knuckled down , tried to knock his opponents ' marbles off the bed with an accurate flick of his " tolly " ( shooter ) . <P> To the 4,000 spectators , as spellbound as a gallery at Lord 's , greatest disappointment were the Crawley Busmen from the nearby London Transport Garage , pretournament favorites because of their strong fingers ( from punching tickets , they say ) . Overcome by nervousness , they were finally nosed out by the Old Comrades , another Sussex six , 26-to-23 . To the Old Comrades went a suckling pig , to the strong-fingered Crawley Busmen a barrel of beer .
