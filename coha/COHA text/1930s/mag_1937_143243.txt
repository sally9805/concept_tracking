In the snug , prosperous , heavily industrial Kingdom of the Belgians and its rich jungle Congo empire , even the worst Cabinet crisis is almost never cause for alarm . Reason : the extraordinary prestige and stabilizing ability of the Throne . Its power is a legacy from that masterly European schemer Leopold II , who died in 1909 , and from his heroic successor , Belgium 's Wartime King Albert . Fortunately , the throne next came to young King Leopold III , today easily the outstanding European crowned head in strength of mind and leadership . Last week His Majesty , having presided for some days over the vain efforts of Belgian politicians to find a successor for able , honest but scandal- seared Premier Paul van Zeeland , who recently resigned ( TIME , Nov.1 ) , calmly announced that Dr. van Zeeland will continue in office as Premier while King Leopold this week makes a visit of state in London to King George . <P> It happens that Belgium has a howling would-be-Hitler in the sleek person of Rexist Leader Lon Degrelle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Economist van Zeeland and finally made some of it stick ( TIME , Sept. 13 et ante ) . But Belgians did not think this week that their King was taking a risk in stepping out of his country and away from his Government at such a crucial time . They felt that the Government was not so much being left behind as it was going abroad in the person of the King . Reason : The last time Leopold III went to London , His Majesty negotiated with the British Foreign Office and brought back to Brussels a treaty giving Belgium an altogether different status in Europe* ( TIME , April 5 et seq . ) . This act of state by the King eclipsed in importance anything his Cabinet or Premier have yet done and was fully approved afterward by the Belgian Parliament , press and public . Thus King George is to be honored in Buckingham Palace this week by a state visit from a constitutional sovereign whose powers are real . <P> George VI as a young man witnessed the triumphant re-entry into Brussels- after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Crown Prince Leopold , who is now King . In 1935 Britain 's present King George and Queen Elizabeth , then Duke &; Duchess of York , gave a ball in the British Pavilion at the Brussels Exposition-the last public function at which young King Leopold Ill 's dearly beloved and beauteous Queen Astrid ever appeared . After her tragic death in a motoring accident in Switzerland ( TIME , Sept. 9 , 1935 ) , the Duke of York returned to Brussels to represent his father , George V , at the funeral . Today , in so far as two crowned heads can be on natural and simple human terms , the British King and the King of the Belgians are fast friends .
