Last week virtually every man , woman &; child in the civilized world had reason to hail Dr. Leroy Leo Hartman of Columbia University with profound , personal gratitude as an authentic Hero of Science . What hundreds of researchers had worked toward since dentistry began , what millions of dentists and their patients had ardently desired , Dr. Hartman had achieved . After 20 years of experiment he had destroyed the threat of the world 's most dreaded torture instrument , the dentist 's drill , made painless dentistry at last a fact . <P> Handsome , amiable , deep-voiced Hero Hartman was born in Victoria , B. C. in , 1893 , graduated from Northwestern University Dental School at 20 , practiced in Seattle , went to France with the A.E.F. , is now head of the Department of Operative Dentistry in Columbia 's School of Dental &; Oral Surgery . For 18 years of his battle against pain he experimented along the conventional , unsatisfactory lines of blocking tooth nerves or deadening them by narcotic injections . Two years ago he discovered a new substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working on a new theory of pain , he developed a chemical which is spread on the surface of the tooth , painlessly destroys all capacity for pain within 60 to 90 seconds . Dr. Hartman has tested his " desensitizer " on some 500 cases in his school 's clinic , succeeded where the best previous methods had left the patient to suffer excruciating pain . Unlike novocain and other anesthetics , the new substance produces no aftereffects , leaves tooth pulp normal and healthy . " It is so simple to use , " declared Dr. Hartman , " that the patient is not aware of its application . . . . " <P> Patent rights to the " desensitizer " have been assigned to Columbia which will , Dr. Hartman promised , soon make the stuff available for general use , protect the public from exploitation. * Because patent negotiations had not yet been completed , Dr. Hartman was unwilling last week to disclose the composition and rationale of his beneficent substance . Eagerly awaiting details , grateful spokesmen for New York City 's 3,000 organized dentists cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous advance . . . . " <P> *A large academic question is whether universities should thus capitalize their researchers ' discoveries . Last fortnight University of Pennsylvania revealed that it had lost its cancer research department because trustees refused a request of Irne du Pont , who had supported the department since its founding , that discoveries be patented , profits used to reward discoverers and finance further research .
