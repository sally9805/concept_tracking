Last week another battleship slid down the ways of a British shipyard . One anchor broke after she left the ways , but the second held and the vast shell of the 35,000-ton battleship Prince of Wales floated easily in midstream of the River Mersey . Launchings have lately been commonplace ceremonies in the ceremonial-ridden British scene . Last twelvemonth has seen two battleships , one aircraft carrier , two cruisers , 16 destroyers , seven submarines launched . <P> But there was nothing perfunctory about the launching of the Prince of Wales . It came less than three months after the launching of her sister ship , King George <P> V. It demonstrated that Great Britain 's biggest naval building program is well ahead of schedule . It came five days after Chancellor Hitler denounced the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement by shouting to the Reichstag , " The basis for the naval treaty with England has been removed ! " It came after long discussions in British newsorgans about the strength of the new ships compared with the Nelson and the Rodney , most modern British battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an improved Nelson class , carry ten 14-inch and 16 5-inch guns , with a 14-inch armor belt and a 6-inch deck for protection against bombs and plunging fire . The Nelson and Rodney carry nine 16-inch guns , are the only ships in the Royal Navy carrying guns that size . But since 14-inch guns have been improved , power of fire of the new ships is almost the same as the old , and number of rounds fired per minute is higher . <P> Forty thousand people crowded Cammell Laird &; Co. , Ltd. ' s historic shipyard at Birkenhead . Princess Mary , the Princess Royal , only sister of the Duke of Windsor , said , " I name this ship Prince of Wales . May God guide her and guard and keep all who sail in her . " Robert Johnson , head of Cammell Laird , was less restrained : " If I were in Chancellor Hitler 's shoes and heard of the wonderful speed at which we can turn out our ships , I think I 'd turn on my axis .
