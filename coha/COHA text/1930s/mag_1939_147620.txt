Year before World War I got going , tall , dignified Albert V. Moore , socialite , and squat , jib-nosed Emmet J. McCormack , ex-tugboat captain , tossed $5,000 into the pot and founded the shipping firm of Moore &; McCormack ( now Moore-McCormack Lines , Inc . ) . Two years later the shoestring firm bought its first ship for $90,000 ( cash : $15,000 ) , christened it the Moormack , put $185,000 worth of repairs into its hull and went after business . From that time on the history of Moore-McCormack is the history of most of today 's U. S. merchant marine . <P> Riding the wartime shipping boom , the firm bought ten more ships , sometimes had as many as 50 more under charter and Government allotment . At war 's end it sold the Moormack for $400,000 , later snapped up the Government 's offer to take its huge merchant marine off its hands at dirt cheap prices of $10 to $15 a deadweight ton . The advent of World War II found Moore-McCormack big and respectable ( capital : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over what to do with the surplus ships that the provisions of the Neutrality Bill may take out of service . Last week it found an answer . <P> For a down payment of $1,200,000 and a balance of $2,300,000 to be financed later ( probably by the U. S. Export-Import Bank ) , President Moore and Treasurer McCormack sold 14 of their old ( 19-21 years ) Hog Island cargo ships to the Brazil Government . For Brazil it was a good deal . It stepped up her Government-owned Lloyd Brasileiro Line fleet to 62 ships , gave her urgently needed bottoms for carrying her coffee and raw materials overseas now that war has swept most belligerents ' ships from the seas . <P> For Moore-McCormack the deal was even better . Under U. S. Government charter and direct ownership the firm operates American Republics Line 's passenger-freight service to South America . For that line , by late 1940 , Moore-McCormack will have 14-$40,000,000 worth-new 9,000-to 12,000-ton , 16-to 18-knot passenger-freight ships , constructed under the Maritime Commission 's program for rebuilding the U. S. merchant marine . Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the loss of its Scandinavian-Baltic trade ( American Scantic Line ) for the duration of the war , Moore-McCormack might well get rid of all the old ships it can . So might the rest of the U. S. merchant marine . By 1948 , 500 of the Maritime Commission 's new ships will be off the ways . Within three years 1,300 of the 1,400 ocean vessels flying the U. S. flag will be 20 years old . Only once in a generation can any nation 's merchant marine count on selling its obsolete equipment at fancy prices , thanks to war .
