with honesty . Her ears stood up in astonished innocence . Her little forefeet were planted close together . She waited primly , clay daubed and virtuons . Bruce grinned and after a mo-went went back into the garage . The wind whispered in the oaks and an acorn fell with a sharp thwack on the barn roof . Governor was silent . A leaf blew across the barnyard and a puff-ball of a kitten rushed after it , tail twirking . A sound of hammering came from the garage . Molly stretched out a soft black nose and fumbled with the wooden button that fastened the gate . It did not move easily and it was splintery . Molly tried her teeth on it and at last it turned . She pushed at the gate , but nothing happened . The hammering in the garage stopped and Bruce appeared suddenly in the door . Molly drowsed hastily . Bruce crossed to the house , got something from the back porch , and returned to the garage . After a minute Molly tried the gate again . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently encountered the cold iron of a hook . It was a fairly loose hook . Molly worked at it with short lifting drives of her nose until it fell , tapping , against the gate , which opened a little way of itself , and then caught against the sod . Molly scraped through , broke into a gallop , and thundered across the lawn to the driveway . She clattered before the door of the garage . Bruce ran out , grimly silent . Molly cavorted in front of him but not too near . She plunged and whirled and rocked and plunged , her hoofs beating a tattoo on the gravel . Her wet mane flapped against her neck . Lumps of clay fell from her . The lily pad in her tail swung in lively circles behind her . With a final superb fling of heels into the air she raced down the slope to the gorge , jumped lightly across the brook , and began the climb up the steep wooded hill on the other side . Bruce followed , panting . He would try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ahead of him . She wound in and out among the oaks , stopping now and again to look back and see what progress Bruce was making . He was n't making much . The hill was very steep . Molly continued on , up , her tail switching vigorously from side to side . Bruce was crashing through the underbrush below her as she came out on the crest of the ridge . She tore off a mouthful of leaves from a passing branch and stopped to wait . Bruce was nowhere in sight . Down the ridge on the other side the valley began in green and gold and melted away into the plum-colored hills . Their outlines wavered in the heat , but the breath of the wind on Molly 's back was cool and fresh . She munched oak leaves in placid contentment and watched the cloud shadows trailing their purple across the floor of the valley . On the tiny yellow thread of the highway a car glittered for a moment and was gone . Its hum came back on the wind . A squirrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was silence below . Molly moved off the path to the edge of the ravine and looked down . The oak leaves dropped unnoticed from her mouth . Bruce was going back down the hill ! Molly stared after him , round-eyed . Then she lifted a forefoot and stamped once . Her nostrils vibrated with the explosion of her breath . The path curved sharply and dipped down into the ravine . Molly stepped down cautiously , threw herself back on her haunches , forefeet braced , and slid , plowing up the matting of leaves and leaving a furrow of black loam behind her . One leap and she was across the brook . Her hoofs rang on the flagstone steps that led up the bank to the side of the garage . Bruce was inside . She could hear him moving . On the lawn she stopped , ready to run , but Bruce did not come out . Molly bit off the top of a nearby hollyhock , mumbled it and let it drop . She moved forward along the side of the garage to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just see the doorsill . There was no one there . She stamped . Silence . Briskly , with a determined switch of the tail , Molly tramped across a flower bed and went up to the door . The inside of the garage was dark after the bright sunlight , and Molly blinked and stretched and peered , but she saw nothing but a stairway , outlined against a dusty windowpane . It was too much . Molly took one more step and put her head in at the door . The rope dropped without a sound , settling neatly behind her ears . Molly knew better than to fight it . She followed Bruce across the yard and through the pasture gate . She watched while he buttoned the gate , hooked it , and bound the hook in place with wire . He went away . That was that . There was nothing to do . The early windfall apples did n't taste right . The grass was dusty . The sun was hot , and the drying clay on her back and sides was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice , got a good swing , and rolled completely over . Triumphant , she rolled all the way back , and rose in a shower of dust and twigs . There was nothing left to do but stand . Molly stood , growing sleepy . At last a hen wandering across the pasture caught her eye . She brightened . There were more hens scratching around in the grass under the willows . Molly 's ears went back , her head lifted , and her tail went up . She galloped down upon the flock , and it scattered , fluttering and squawking . Molly dashed back and forth , her teeth snapping , turning back the stragglers , and bunching them together . She drove them into the corner where the fence joined the barn . It was n't a very good place . One hen skimmed under the fence and escaped . Molly nagged with teeth and heels and drove the rest , a compact and jittering little group , round to the back of the barn . There was no good place there to hold them either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchard in a shrieking procession that sowed the ruts with feathers . Molly capered behind . " Molly ! For God sake ! " Molly veered away from the flock and thundered past them , mane and tail streaming . Under the apple trees she stopped and swung around to look back , neck arched and head high . Bruce was climbing slowly back over the fence . Molly snorted . When he had gone Molly cropped a little grass , but languidly . It was too dusty . She knocked a fly off her foreleg with her nose . It returned and buzzed about her . Molly stood waiting , listening to it , her eyes furious . It lit on her shoulder . Molly snapped , and the fly dropped to the ground . The shadows were growing long down the hillside at the head of the ravine , and swarms of gnats jigged about her ears . It would soon be time to eat . Molly turned suddenly and trotted back to the barn . The door was open and the sweet musty smell of the hay blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went straight to the door of the feed room . It was not that she expected to get it open , these days , but she could always try . She tried . Miracle of miracles , it opened ! Someone had left off the wire which had held it fast for a year , against all Molly 's attempts . The top of the feed box was up ! Molly 's eyes bulged . She took one step farther in and buried her nose in the whispering oats . In the loft overhead the hay ticked faintly . A mouse ran along a beam and paused to look , bright-eyed and trembling . From somewhere came the thin mewing of new kittens . Governor stamped in his stall . Molly ate intensely , lifting her head only at rare intervals to munch more leisurely . A fly , caught in a spider web by the window , droned endlessly . The line of oats against the side of the feed box sifted lower and lower . When it was impossible to crowd in another oat Molly raised her head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the feed room a little awkwardly and went out into the barnyard and down the orchard road . The grasses brushed her knees and from force of habit she bit off a mouthful , but she chewed without swallowing and without interest . The spring lay crystal clear under the trees , the green foliage mirrored in its heart . Molly lowered her head and drank for a long time , sucking up the water in great thirsty gulps . The coolness flowed around her nostrils and down her dusty throat . She lifted her head and stood for a moment , motionless . Then she drank again . She felt a little heavy and cold inside when she at last stopped drinking , and she turned away from the spring with an effort . A strange sharp pain was beginning in her middle . It darted around , stabbing her , and Molly bit at her side . She heard Bruce 's shout from the window of the feed room , but it was too much trouble to dodge when he ran down the road , a halter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agitation in his hands when he slipped the halter over her head . He led her gently back to the barn , tied her by the door , and stood looking at her . " Oh , Molly , Molly ! You 've killed yourself ! " he said . Molly rolled an eye at him . She was very uncomfortable . He touched her side and she flinched . Bruce went away through the barn , running . Molly 's head hung nearly to her knees . Bruce returned presently and paced back and forth beside her . He usually moved rather slowly , but now he walked with quick short steps and he watched her sharply . It was irritating , and Molly felt uneasy . But the pain in her middle seemed to be going away . She had n't that heavy sensation any more either . A car roared out in front of the barn and then stopped roaring . A long narrow man came through the back door of the barn with a bag in his hand . Molly stiffened . She knew him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had rasped at her back teeth most unpleasantly . The pain in her inside was practically gone now . The long man and Bruce were both looking at her and their voices rose and fell . Molly switched her tail uneasily . The hag was on the ground and it had an evil smell . The long man went to it and took out a bottle . His movements were unhurried as he approached Molly and his touch on her neck was sure and kind . Molly relaxed a little . He spoke to her and his tone was light . It had been like that before . Molly jerked her head away from his hands but they followed her . There was no escape . Molly stood , rigid and motionless . It took only a few seconds . The stuff burned in her throat for a short time , but that was all . Bruce untied her and let her go free . They watched her as she turned away and stood quietly at a little distance from them . She was still breathing hard and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't . She ' rambled across the barnyard to a clump of grass and picked at it . She would have gone down to the end of the pasture , but they could n't catch her now anyway , and she hated to miss anything . They stayed there for a long time , just waiting , and not doing anything at all , except once , when Molly considered rolling . Then they both ran toward her . But when she scrambled up they only stared at her , their mouths making little round holes in their faces . The sun went down behind the hill , leaving it black against the lemon-yellow sky . A smell of wood smoke and damp earth drifted down the breeze . Across the fields a whippoorwill called . Suddenly Molly flung up her head . She wheeled and raced to the end of the pasture , circled , and raced back , pounding up to Bruce with her ears flattened and her eyes rolling viciously . The long man sprang for the safety of the barn door , but Bruce did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He held out his hand and Molly dropped her nose into it . The long man shook his head , laughing , picked up his bag , and vanished into the darkness . The car roared again and a finger of light swept across the willows . Molly tossed her head . Very gently she reached down and took Bruce 's sleeve into her mouth . A long-drawn loop of sound came up Wolf Creek  --  a fox hound trying his voice  --  and a rabbit leaped out of a briar patch and fled , zig-zagging down the orchard road , its white tuft of tail bobbing in the starlight . Bruce 's other hand crept up Molly 's cheek , patting and patting in quick little movements . " Come , Molly . " Molly drew a deep breath . It had been a very dull . day . She rubbed her face against Bruce 's sleeve and then , shoulder to shoulder , they crossed the yard and went into the warm darkness of the barn .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
