THE Secretary of War 's impassioned defense of President Hoover at last week 's meeting of the Republican National Committee , we read , " brought the party leaders to their feet with cheers by his militant thrusts at the Democrats , and his confident prediction that President Hoover 's leadership would carry his party to victory next year . " As to that , we shall see what we shall see . It is the regulation talk of a Cabinet member loyally devoted to his Chief . But what we are concerned about today is one item of the twelve points listed by Mr. Hurley to prove that the President has been a great and successful leader . It reads as follows : , I I 3 . He stopped immigration by an effective order to bar 300,000 aliens who would have been unemployed . Far from being a cause for praise , this is to us a grave indictment of President Hoover , so grave that if the national legislature were aware of its significance and of the enormity of the offense , and the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made a basis for impeachment proceedings . For what this means is that the President deliberately set aside a law passed by Congress without himself having the authority of law , thereby invading the field of the legislative branch of the government . We are quite aware , of course , that Mr. Hoover 's action has been acclaimed by others besides the Secretary of War ; that it has even been described as a statesman-like act in the time of national emergency ; that it has the approval of the bulk of the Congress ; that ' , it was an act of kindness to the intending immigrants not to permit them to come into a country where they would starve for lack of work and increase the difficulties of the American people . Now , valid as these arguments seem on their face , they are entirely beside the mark . The only fact worth noting about this matter is that the President of the United States deliberately violated a law , deliberately trenched upon the prerogatives of the Congress . For those who respect the laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse to have the President again setting the example of lawlessness than to have had a few thousand more people come through the gates of Ellis Island . More than that , not only did the President himself undertake to say when a law should or should not be enforced ; the agents of the United States abroad , the consuls and vice-consuls involved , deliberately resorted to all sorts of stratagems and misrepresentations to head off people who under the laws of the United States were clearly entitled to receive visas . The President 's offense is ,  - -  moreover , the less defensible because he could have asked Congress , last winter for a temporary modification of the law , or for the power to suspend it if in his judgment it seemed wise . Had the regular session not granted this authority , he would : have been justified in calling a special session for that purpose alone . We can not think of a more vital principle today than this one that officials of the United States , and especially the President , who have taken a solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountable for that oath and for the responsibility they assume . Every American has his theory as to why it is that ours has the disgraceful distinction of being the most lawless of countries . Some students of our society and national life attribute it to the inheritance of the pioneer spirit which , when it broke ground through the wilderness , was by force of circumstances at times superior to its own laws , or was a law unto itself . Others attribute it to the government 's attempt to regulate the habits and actions of private individuals , as in the national prohibition act . We , too , have our pet reason for this national lawlessness , although we realize that it probably can not be explained wholly by any single circumstance . Our belief is that our laws and Constitution are constantly brought into contempt more through the lawlessness of public officials than in any other way . The statement we have made above , that this might be well made a case.for the impeachment of the Executive under certain conditions , will doubtless seem to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind if one regards the tremendous amount of lawlessness by public officials throughout the land . Anything we could do to bring home to our officials from the White House down-that this is a government of laws and not of men , that no administrative or executive official has the right to alter or disregard a law , would be the greatest possible blessing . Yet the Secretary of War actually commends the President for lawlessness that would send to prison men who set aside the same law for the purpose of smuggling a half-dozen persons into the United States ! No one , certainly not Mr. Hurley , can deny the fact that the laws of the United States are violated by officials at every turn . The other day the mayor of Syracuse hit upon the happy idea that the way to help the unemployment situation in that city was to remove from the civil service about 170 married women whose husbands were also wageearners  --  an act that fortunately met with vigorous and outspoken protest from the college community situated in that city , and others of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . It was just as lawless an act in its essence as if the mayor had wounded a citizen of Syracuse on the street . Yet he believed himself absolutely justified in overriding the law because of the authority vested in him . Just so Secretary Doak in his annual report acclaims the President for his violation of the immigration law , and the President himself admits it by asking the Congress in his annual message for ex post facto approval of his infringement of its prerogatives and his own violation of his solemn oath of office . No emergency can justify this sort of thing . Everywhere it will encourage the mayors who have made a joke of the constitutional right of free speech and free assembly ; the governors who use the militia to enforce their arbitrary will as to oil production ; the chiefs of police who , as the Wickersham Commission has proved , hourly violate the rights of prisoners and administer the " third degree " without realizing that thereby they make themselves worse criminals than the thugs from whom they seek to wring confessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the gravest menaces to our Republic . Relief Hits New ? Low ARDLY a daygoes- by without its hymns of thanksgiving from industrialists , - reactionary labor leaders , and other public guardians because we are free ft-an the fearsome " dole . " This frank jubilation may arise from mixed motives , yet we assume that few among the defense corps really prefer starvation , - even for others , to unemployment insurance or various forms of state aid . They console themselves-with- the thought that American generosity , thank God , has risen to- the call for sharing and has guaranteed that no matter how hard ; the winter , they will not see , actual starvation. - , . . - , They may not see it . But granting that the relief funds as proposed for various cities and towns will be available in the full amounts requested-a hope not positively certain of fulfilment  --  will wholesale hunger be averted ? Some valuable testimony on this point was offered by experienced observers-from many cities who gathered recently in ' Washington under the auspices of the Joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Evans of Emory , University , almost 5,000 families are . receiving relief , and figuring the minimum allowance for groceries at $6 or $7 a week for each family , and other living costs at about $3 , practically $50,000 weekly is required . For a period of thirty weeks , this would imply a definite need of $1,500,000 , whereas the total actually sought is only $800,000 : A report from Los Angeles placed the unemployed actually registered as 151,000 , of which 60,000 were heads of families . A $5,000,000 bond issue was used up last year and has not been replaced , and out of the Community Chest drive , which brought in about $3,000,000 , only $600,000 has specifically been designated for unemployment . Even adding in other indirect sums , the total falls far short of the city 's needs . In Cleveland , where 100,000 needy families are estimated to exist , the minimum food allowance of $4 a week necessitates spending $400,000 weekly , or $6,000,000 for the fifteen coldest weeks . Adding $5,000,000 for shelter and clothing , $11,000,000 is demonstrably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4,075,349 , , falling short of the need by almost $7,000,000 . Are the , larger cities doing any better ? Last September in Chicago 43,545 families were receiving relief from the County Bureau of Public Welfare and five major relief agencies . Paul Hutchinson , managing editor of the Christian Century , representing the Chicago ' Workers ' Committee on Unemployment , declared : The minimum amount needed for the bare necessities - of life for the unemployed from October 1 this year to September 30 , 1932 , is $21,260,000 . To meet this need there is available $8,890,000 , if county appropriations are maintained , and if the Joint Fund is raised . This means a deficit of $12,370,000 to meet the barest family-sustenance needs already apparent . The legislature will be asked , to provide $10,000,000 , , $3,000,000 for relief and $7,000,000 for a special work fund ; but even if this goes through , it will leave the deficit for the merest maintenance $8,870,000 . Last year Philadelphia spent $7,400,000 for relief , it was shown by Andrew J. Biemiller , secretary of the Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Child Health Society estimated the minimum food ' allowance for a family of five to be $8.50 a week , the Bureau of Unemployed Relief allows only $5 for groceries . The United Campaign for Relief raised $9,000,000 . Mr. Biemiller said : Dr. Jacob Billikopf , director of the Federation of Jewish Charities , estimates the minimum to keep Philadelphia 's - unemployed from starving during the coming year is $15 , - - 000,000 to $20,000,000 . J. Hampton Moore , Mayor-elect , has served notice that the city will give no appropriation for - relief in 1932 , and the State constitution specifically pro-. hibits appropriations for direct outdoor relief , so for . even the starvation minimum of $5 a week for the Relief Committee 's , estimated - 75,000 families in want , Philadelphia - would need at least $15,000,000 more . An extraordinary similarity in conditions runs through the reports from every section of the country . Dr. Sidney E. Goldstein , - chairman of unemployment of the - City Affairs Committee of New York , speaking before a recent city appropriation of $5,000,000 had been passed , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a little : New York will face a six months ' wage loss of not less than $600,000,000 with a total unemployment-relief fund of $40,000,000 . This means that we shall be able to take care of - somewhere between 6 and 7 per cent of those who are out of work . It is difficult to hazard an estimate , but certainly every leader in close touch with the field will agree that fully 30 per cent of those who are out of work today are in need of assistance . In other words , we are prepared , in New York , the richest city in the country , to relieve less than one-quarter of the burden of unemployment . And so , we imagine , few of those whose contact with misery is closer than that of after-dinner speakers will reflect the comfort of soul exhibited by some of the patriotic gentlemen who have won the battle  --  as they fatuously dream  --  for charity as against direct and substantial federal help to the wretched millions . Short Selling HE recent defense of short selling by the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is intelligent and impressive . Analyzing the detailed statistics which the Exchange has recently collected on the amount of short selling in individual securities , Mr. Whitney points out that the fifteen stocks in which the greatest amount of short selling has occurred since May 25 are , for the most part , the very ones which have had comparatively the steadi-est market and the narrowest price fluctuations in that period . None of the fifteen stocks which experienced the greatest decline in percentage of value in the same period , on the other hand , has had any sizable short interest in it . The greatest short interest in any stock for the period investigated was 406,000 shares in General Motors , the general market action of which has been comparatively steady . Even this maximum short interest , moreover , was less than 1 per cent of the total shares of General Motors outstanding . For the whole period of the investigation , short sales , Mr. ' Whitney concludes , have amounted to only 5 per cent of the total volume of sales . The rest represented genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assuming that Mr. Whitney is correct in his conclusion that short sales as a whole represent on an average only 5 per cent of total market transactions , the relative influence of short selling is considerably greater than such an average figure might imply to the uninitiated . For the short selling that occurs , as Mr. Whitney 's own figures reveal , is not distributed equally over the list , but tends to be concentrated on a few " market leaders . " As the action of these leaders commonly sets the tone for the whole market , if these leaders can be depressed on any day or over a series of days by concentrated short selling , the probability is that the whole market will be depressed . Thus on October 28 , as Mr. Whitney admits , the short sales of United States Steel amounted to 24 per cent of the total selling of that stock . Again , the fact that the price fluctuations of the shares in which the greatest short interest existed were in general less erratic than those in which virtually no short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling was a factor making for stabilization . The causation is , in general , the other way round : most short selling tends to occur in those issues which already have the broadest and most active market , for these are the " market leaders . " But while the statistics which the Stock Exchange has collected do not make out a positive case for short selling , they do make out an impressive negative case . They show that the short interest is in general very much less than had been generally assumed before the investigation was undertaken . And they certainly do not indicate that short selling is in itself an unsettling factor . The case for short selling , however , is broader than any statistical one . It can not be repeated too often that every short sale must eventually be completed by a repurchase , and that the purchase , or " covering , " will tend to send prices up on an average to the same extent as the preceding short sales may have sent them down . Further , on days of severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , " short covering " may prove one of the few forces existing to check the decline . It is true that short sellers often circulate false rumors with the intention of undermining confidence in particular securities or in securities generally , but in that case it is the rumors that are vicious and not the selling . The prohibition of short selling would not in itself have the effect of stopping such rumors , for they are quite as often circulated by persons who have not sold short but merely wish to buy stock cheaply . Further , as " bulls " appear to outnumber " bears " by about twenty to one , it is safe to assume that there are on the average twenty times as many false rumors made to raise the price of stocks as there are rumors designed to depress them . Short selling , in the long run , is a stabilizing rather than an unstabilizing influence . Congress should not forget the disastrous consequences of the act of 1864 ? repealed three weeks after its passage  --  which forbade all sales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trading restrictions forced on the Berlin bourse in 1896 . A prohibition of short selling , in brief , would be equivalent to tampering with the thermometer in a frigid house as a substitute for turning on the heat . Those Congressmen who are " unalterably opposed " to reducing the tariff or canceling a penny of the war debts are doing more to send the prices of stocks and bonds to lower levels than all the short sellers combined . God 's Book for God 's People T HE newest translators of the Bible , whose " American " version , * at last complete , has just come off the presses , defend themselves by a quotation from the preface to the King James Version  --  which , as they point out in passing , was the third authorized version and a sixth revision . Most honoured- be their name that breake the yce and give the onset vpon that which helpeth forward to the saving of soules . Now what can bee more auaileable thereto , than to deliuer Gods booke vnto Gods people in a tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God become words and syllables ? Why should wee be in bondage to them if we may be free ? Those numerous persons to whom the Bible has become words and syllables  --  those persons , in brief , to whom it has become , as the phrase is , " literature " ? will not be especially happy as they glance through the pages prepared with such care by Professors Smith , Goodspeed , Gordon , Meek , and Waterman . For the single aim of these scholars has been to make their translation accurate and intelligible . Lovers of the Bible as literature will find , for instance , that " I am the Rose of Sharon , and the lily of the valleys " has become " I am a saffron of the plain , a hyaCinth of the valleys " ; that " the way of a man with a , maid " has become " the way of a man with a woman " ; that " through a glass darkly " has become " at a dim reflection ' in a mirror " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye " is now merely " the speck in your brother 's eye . " What comfort can be given these persons , with whom , we must confess , we have a good deal of sympathy ? In the first place , of course , there is the possibility that the Chicago Bible will fail to drive out the one which we know and which hundreds of millions of readers have known during three hundred years . But if it succeeds , as it or another one like it probably will , what then ? Well , the King James Version will still exist as " literature " ? indeed , by existing purely as literature , in the way Shakespeare exists , it will be all the more precious because it is a private possession of the godless ; let God 's people make of their new book what they may . " Exactly , " we can imagine the godless saying , " but what can they make of it ? And is it not deplorable that a treasure-house of phrases , a whole folk literature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answers to that are many , and only time can make them . Time , for instance , may determine that the saffron of the plain is quite as potent a blossom as the rose of Sharon ; or it may dry the rose and mysteriously preserve it on the lips of men who can not know where it once flourished  --  or forget it . A more significant answer than either of these is given , or implied , by the translators themselves when they speak of the need of an " intelligible " Bible . To the extent that the old Bible was unintelligible , had it not already become " literature " ? The new one is eminently what it claims to be , readable . Let it be read , then , for the profit it can give . And let the old one still be read for pleasure .
