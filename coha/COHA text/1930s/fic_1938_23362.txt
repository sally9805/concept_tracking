tvi-nikt THE WHITE CAMEL A STORY BY EUGENE WRIGHT T WAS high noon . Nothing moved , I nothing stirred . There was no sound . Over the entire wasteland , strewn with sand , ribbed by dunes , dotted with rocks , there was nothing to indicate that life survived ; that in all the world there existed the phenomena of green grass , water , and human beings . The only thing visible in the blue sky was the sun . It blazed at the zenith , gaseous and incandescent , searing again the hide of a land suppressed , tremulous with the day , sustained by its memory of the night . But all was not dead in the land . In a depression of the desert , a depression so slight as to be invisible to a man afoot , grew a small tree . Its trunk was knotted and ribbed . Its branches were thorny . Tiny green leaves , paler than winter plants , grew from the stems of these branches . Blossoms  --  not larger than a penny , grew among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round with brown stamens . About this tree clung the faint , delicate odor of mimosa . The sun wavered . A spiral of wind appeared momentarily on the horizon . Another , holding a dry weed , swept past the tree and vanished , dropping the weed . The figure under the tree did not move . It appeared not to breathe . In the ponderous heat of noon it lay with its head up , crossed by a bar of shade , its forefeet under its chest , its great hump in silhouette against a wavering horizon . It was a large camel  --  not so large , however , as the dromedaries of the Sudan , where the rank grasses and heavy rains grow beasts out of all proportion to their strength . Neither was he thick of body like the Algerian camels , whose barrel chests and short legs are bred for commerce . His chest was deep and narrow , his hips were slenderer than a man 's . There was a great length of bone from shoulder to knee and from knee to hock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no swifter camel , and in all that dry , mountainous region known as the Hoggar , where he was born and raised , there had been none more beautiful to see , more responsive to the pressure of a foot , more resistant to the forced marches , months without water and days without food . But he was not now so white as during those years when he had worn a copper ring in his nostril and picked his way at sundown among the guy ropes of a Tuareg camp . The herbs of soils other than those of the Hoggar had turned the glistening whiteness of his coat to a deep ivory . There were yellowish streaks along his hocks and there was a shade deepening into ochre from the tufted crest of his head to the curve of his neck . The years too had told , for there were hollows above his eyes and the tendons were visible in his legs . But for all of that  --  for all his change of color and the marks of advanced age  --  he was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridden without a whip by a great chief . All through the burning heat of midday he rested , adjusting his position as the hours passed to the retreating shade ; and when at length the gray focus of the tree was too small for comfort his eyes opened . His hind quarters came up , one foreleg slapped the earth . A moment later , risen to his full height , he was sniffing among the under branches for a blossom . But there were none ; he had eaten all those underneath before lying down . He made the circuit of the tree , standing on his hind legs and nibbling blossoms from the top ; then , bothered by the thorns , he dropped to all fours and wandered on , lowering his head occasionally to seize and tear from its stalk a spray of herb ; standing motionless , chewing and sniffing the air which told him all he knew , and all he wanted to know . At the borders of that part of the Sahara that is known as the Tanzerouft , or Land Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoggar , was riding with his guide at the head of a company of meharistes . There had been trouble in the north . The Ouled Gerir , it was reported , had attacked a village in Algeria ; they were well armed , many in number and , it was believed , were swinging in a southeasterly direction across the desert to make a laid on the great herds of Tuareg camels at pasturage in the Sudan . It was not likely , the Captain thought , that they would actually accomplish this . The month was August , the heat made it almost impossible for burdened camels to travel more than eight days without water . Moreover , in that vast bowl of desert which they should have to cross there was at this season of the year the danger of dust storms . Many a caravan and convoy had perished in these storms , worse by far than the blown sand since they sometimes remained over the desert for weeks , obscuring all landmarks , the moon and stars by night and even the sun by day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expressed it for some time ; hefelt a certain obligation toward the Tuaregs , and for these reasons he had left his large cool chambers at the fort and started southward toward a certain well in the Tanzerouft where , he believed , he might intercept the marauders . He was a large portly man , red-cheeked , self-possessed , with bronzed well-kept hands , with a firm full mouth , youthful eyes . Erect in the saddle , his helmet covered with a black sun cloth , he played the endless fascinating game of trying to discover novelty in horizons that repeated themselves . Suddenly he halted . He drew forward a peak of his black turban , held it for a moment , then took his binoculars from their case at the saddle horn . Following a prolonged observation he passed them without comment to his guide . " You say ? " he asked . The guide , an Arab whose shaved head showed through the coils of his turban , lowered the glasses for another look with his naked eyes . " Camel , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisively shook his finger . " No . " For a moment the Captain held his crisp underlip against his mustache . He could not account for a camel in that part of the Tanzerouft . There was no pasturage to speak of ; there was no water . For almost a thousand miles in any direction except north the military maps showed a complete blank , traced by the verticals of longitude and the parallels of latitude . Moreover , he reflected , it was the first time in his life that he had seen a single camel  --  a camel alone in the desert . One saw herds , occasionally two or three . But never one . Receiving the binoculars from his guide , he again put them to his eyes , sweeping the landscape to left and right of where the animal had been sighted , finally bringing them to focus on the camel itself . Through the powerful lenses it appeared as a white triangle mysteriously floating in waves of heat . " Ile 's come closed " he said . The Arab made a noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Like a giraffe ! " Captain Djon slowly returned his glasses to their case . There were , he remembered , rumors of a solitary camel at large in the Tanzerouft  --  a camel declared definitely to have been the personal mount of Moussa , the Tuareg chieftain who fifteen years previous had retreated before him into the Tanzerouft , been caught in a dust storm and perished with his entire company , of thirst . He had even talked to Tuaregs , he remembered , who swore that they had seen the animal ? that it had come up to their caravans out of the desert  --  and had identified it positively as Moussa 's camel by the fact that it bore no brand . There was even a legend , the Captain recalled , to the effect that the camel , unable to understand death , was still looking for Moussa , having yet found no one whom it could recognize as a greater master . The Captain had often smiled at this story , ignoring the challenge . It recalled and perpetuated a conquest that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this story . But now , seeing with his own eyes a camel that he could not otherwise account for , a camel whose size alone quickened the pulse of his heart and seemed to lend credence to the tale , a sudden surge of pride led him to believe that it was worth investigating . He glanced at the sun , reflecting upon the duty that had brought him to the Tanzerouft , the distance yet to go before be reached the well . A few hours ' delay , he decided , would not matter . The pasturage at hand was as good as he could expect to find by sundown . He turned in the saddle , giving the signal to dismount ; and an hour later , with more emotion than he would have believed possible under such circumstances , was trying desperately to verify with his own eyes what appeared to be almost conclusive . For of its own accord the big camel had come up to the company , and now with deceptive slowness was picking its way among the outermost of his own camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gaze at the majestic creature so mysteriously in their midst . Captain Djon followed the animal 's every motion . He could not remember when he had seen such grace , such perfect self-possession . The camel walked like a prince , its head high above the level of its hump . Its approach was an inquiring one  --  but in no way demanding or inquisitive  --  and certainly , the Captain told himself , without fear . It was no wonder , he reflected , that the Tuareg chieftains refused to brand such animals . Their appearance alone was sufficient identification . He glanced at his men . They were at their stations , patiently waiting , each with a piece of rope behind his back . Twilight came . The sky crimsoned ; there were flaming red pennants over the entire desert . The sun , Iike a great traffic light , hovered on the horizon , then dropped out of sight . In the gathering darkness the camel was like a white phantom , circling , seeking a wind , a breath of air . He stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly there was a bellow . There was a scuffle , followed on all sides by the rustle of garments , the shouts of the Arab soldiers ; and as the Captain hurried toward the scene of the capture there was a cry that brought something like a human fist rising into his throat . For he knew now that he had caught Moussa 's camel , and a nervous , hurried inspection with his flashlight proved that it was true . The beast had no brand . The copper ring had been torn from its nostril . For a long time the Captain stood in front of the camel , his flashlight making a small lucid pool on the earth at his feet . He knew now how Moussa had died . He could vision the huge blue-clad figure on the ground , crawling , then , for a time motionless , the nose-cord tied to his wrist . He could see the camel scenting its dead master , frightened by the odor of death , then stamping backward , flinging its head and tearing the ring from its nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head that he might in-spect the nostril , but the animal filled its lungs , spaced its feet , and gave a bellow , muffled by the tight halters , that swelled its neck . He reached up his hand and the camel lifted its head . Abruptly he switched off the light and turned back to the camp . " Bring him in , " he said . He was thoughtful that night . Long after the baggage camels had been brought in and were filling the air with their ruminations , long after the furious jabbering of his men had died down to an occasional murmur , he lay with his head propped against his saddle bags , watching the great form which would not kneel , which refused to rest , which drew taut now one and now another of the tethers leading from mounds of baggage , which breathed audibly , with a powerful restlessness , its head moving high against the stars . He remembered very clearly the circumstances that had led up to Moussa 's death and , he reflected , brought him the camel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had brought him , a young lieutenant , to be linked with an important and highly influential French military family  --  and the coveted appointment in the Sahara that he had managed as a result of it . He remembered his arrival at the Hoggar , the Arab fantasia that had welcomed him , and his chagrin upon discovering that Moussa , the chief of the Tuaregs whom he had come to govern , was not there to meet him . And he remembered sending an envoy into the Hoggar , officially demanding Moussa 's presence at a conference , and the subsequent meeting at which he was given clearly to understand by the majestic veiled figure that he had to do with a man who considered himself in every way his equal  --  if not his superior ; that his personal sovereignty and pride of race were stronger than French bullets ; that , as a man , he was unconquerable . And for over three years , the Captain remembered , they had opposed each other , neither yielding an inch ; bothaware of their responsibilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual resort to arms  --  a denouement , the Captain confessed , that he had almost prayed for , confident of victory , well aware that behind him stood the resources of France  --  men , guns , and ammunition without end . And at last his opportunity had come . The Senussi , fanatical Mohammedans from Tripoli , were coming across the border . Moussa , a Mohammedan , was doing nothing to stop them ; was in fact receiving them . While the Captain 's dispatches to this effect were en route to the north a wireless from Algiers had ordered him to repulse the Senussi , disarm the Tuaregs , and place the Hoggar under a military dictatorship . Captain Djon drew a breath . He put his hand to his large , smooth-shaved cheek . Well , he had done so . And he had done so without loss of Iife  --  except to the Senussi . For in his mind 's eye he could see the long line of white camels , bearing armed Tuaregs , that had met him at the foothills of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of march toward the Tanzerouft , and his own flanking movement to head them off , bottle them up in the hills . Then his pursuit  --  a pursuit that ended at the edge of the Tanzerouft itself , and the dust storm that for an entire week had left the Hoggar like an island in a sea of mist . The Captain got up . He lighted a cigarette and for a time he paced back and forth in front of the camel , under the bright stars . There was no doubt , he thought , that the animal had been searching for Moussa . These camels were notoriously proud , would suffer themselves to be beaten to death , almost , rather than obey a rider whom they did not respect . And there was no questioning the fact that since Moussa 's death the Hoggar had failed to produce a man of equal stature . Captain Djon tossed away his cigarette . He put his hands flat against his chest and stood in front of the big camel , wondering how long it would be before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so long denied him . Not long , he thought . Its nose had yet to heal where it had been pierced for a new ring . A week or more under a heavy pack saddle would thin down the withers enough to take the riding saddle . He recalled the Tuaregs ' legend about the animal and pictured himself riding it through the Hoggar , past the Tuareg villages . He imagined situations in which his mastery of the camel would redound to his advantage . Shortly after midnight , when the company broke camp to begin the day 's march , the camel sprang easily to its feet under twelve cases of ammunition and a machine gun . The Captain was delighted . The last shred of doubt that he might have entertained as to whether the animal recognized him as Moussa 's superior was completely dissolved ; and as he rode he turned frequently in the saddle to admire his trophy , to reflect upon the irony of its burden , and to congratulate himself that what he had always believed to be true was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious to them , he thought , that the camel had never before borne baggage . It was unthinkable that Moussa should ever have subjected the animal to such indignity , should ever have been forced to do so through necessity . And yet in despite of this fact it marched behind him with its head held high  --  protesting with a low rumble in its throat , to be sure , when the Arabs laid on the packs and bound them into place ; exhibiting its teeth even when brought in hobbled from the pasturage to take its place in the convoy  --  but , nevertheless , marching proudly behind him , performing superbly in a role to which it obviously was unaccustomed . There were any number of points , the Captain thought , on which the camel seemed to discriminate between himself and his men , and one morning at sunrise , while his men were walking , leading their mounts after the long night march , he thought he would make a test . " Up  --  ride him ! " he said to an Arab close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man started . He gazed at the Captain for a moment as though he had been ordered to shave his beard . " Upl On the baggage ! " the Captain prompted . Then , amused by the man 's expression , " Speak up ! " he demanded . " What 's the trouble ? " The Arab shook his fist . " No good ! " he exclaimed . " He wants Moussa ! " The Captain laughed . It did not matter . It was gratifying , however , to know the depth of respect that his men had for the camel . Ten days later , forcing his marches to make up for the time lost , he led his company to the base of a dead dune beyond which , he knew , lay the oasis of Bilma . He was thoroughly familiar with the place . For a number of years he had regarded it as one of the most strategic points  --  and one of the best natural defenses  --  he had ever known . For it lay in the midst of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles , and thereby commanded all Sahara traffic within that area both north and south , both east and west . Many a time previous , reflecting upon the conflicts that had taken place among the natives over the possession of Bilma , he had figured himself in command of the oasis , his men and machine guns installed in the old well craters surrounding the living spring , watching from this point of vantage the approach of an enemy across the broad plain  --  an enemy in need of water  --  an enemy that could go no farther without water , an enemy advancing toward the well craters over the carcasses of camels , between those myriad brown mounds which were the solidified contents of their stomachs . He would have them there , he thought . He would have them in a trap from which there was no escape ; and as a general he would give them their choice of two deaths : the withering fire of his machine guns or death by thirst . It was this plan of campaign that brought a glow of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of his company , and that caused him , now that he had taken the trouble to come down to Bilma , to hope fervently that the Ouled Gerir had carried out their plan to attack the Tuaregs and that within a few days  --  possibly a week  --  he would be able to execute his program . Suddenly he felt his arm grasped , his camel halted . His guide had leaped to the ground , was drawing both mounts back under cover of the dune . He had had a quick glance at the oasis ; he had thought for a moment that the well was occupied by Tuaregs . But now , creeping forward on his belly , raising his head slowly again above the crest of the dune , he beheld a sight that struck him like a blow , that caused his heart almost to cease beating . For the white camels hobbled at the well were Tuareg camels  --  there was no doubt about that ; but the figures in their midst were Ouled Gerir . They had made their raid , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the well  --  and now , stripped to the waist , were watering their mounts for the long trek back across the Tanzerouft and home . For a long time the Captain lay under the dune 's crest , staring at his camels , at his men , but hardly seeing them . He had never before been caught at such a disadvantage . He was in a position in which all his life he had never imagined himself , never believed possible . For he could not go back : his camels could travel another two days without water perhaps , but no more  --  no , not even with their baggage removed . An attack  --  even with machine guns  --  would be suicidal ; they could not possibly hope to destroy so many men so perfectly defended . And to wait  --  to lie hidden behind the dune until the enemy moved on  --  would be inevitably to invite discovery . . . and the same choice of deaths he had planned for the enemy . There was only one way out of the situation : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way contrive to spring a trap that he , himself , had regarded as absolutely fool-proof . With his guide beside him he gazed again at the oasis , counted the Ouled Gerir through his field glasses , found that there were forty-three  --  a few more even than he had anticipated . He looked at the white Tuareg camels , and suddenly the desire that had brought the Ouled Gerir across two thousand miles of desert in the summertime flowered in his mind , and he recalled his own emotions upon seeing clearly for the first time through his glasses the great white camel , now standing behind him , burdened with baggage . The plan in his mind was a brilliant one , a fantastic one . But would it work ? Would the camel obey him ? Was it faster than the young camels  --  the fastest of the young white camels hobbled at the well ? He did n't know . He thought so . He hoped so . He went swiftly to the big camel , thrust his hand under the baggage above the withers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pack saddle . " Saddle him , " he said . His men did not move . " Saddle him ! " the Captain repeated ; but as a few soldiers moved slowly and uncomprehending to obey the order , his guide stepped forward and his hand went to his temple in a stiff salute . " Mon Commandant , you must not ride that camel . " Captain Djon glanced up at the man . " It is dangerous , " the Arab continued . " I know that camel well . I have watched him since the day you caught him . Mon Commandant , he is still Moussa 's camel . " The Captain felt his anger rising . He had not expected such a statement from his guide ; could not for a moment believe such disloyalty in one of his own men . " Moussa is dead , " he said bluntly . " Just the same the camel wants him . " " He 's been carrying baggage , " was the Captain 's next retort . " Good . Let him carry baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab held himself rigid , his eyes unwavering in a fixed , direct look which told the Captain all that he was afraid to assert in so many words . " Let him loose and I swear he will return to the Tanzerouft  --  to exactly the same spot where he came from . " " You would rather die of thirst ? " " I am not thinking of myself . I am thinking of you . Mon.Commandant , I know your plan . And I tell you that if you ride the white camel into the Tanzerouft you will not return . There is the little brown camel . He is very swift . I , I am light . With your permission , Mon Commandant , I will ride before the Ouled Gerir . I will lead them far , far away . You will have nothing to fear . We shall all be saved . " " We should die or be killed . They would not follow you . " The Captain turned to the men who were disburdening the big camel of the cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment every nerve in his large , resolute body , it seemed to him that he was watched by not only his men , but by the eyes of Paris as well , by all those who believed in him , and by those who had envied him and hated him . " We shall see , " he said , speaking as to himself , and as his light fabric of saddle was fitted forward of the beast 's hump he himself underwent a transformation . Removing his sun helmet , he bound his black turban about his face and head , leaving only a narrow aperture for his eyes . One of his soldiers handed him a long blue gown , brocaded , which he slipped over his white tunic . And when he had exposed a tuft of his dark hair and lowered his billowing black pantaloons until they brushed the ground he knew from the look in his men 's eyes that his disguise was successful , that mounted on the white camel , he would be mistaken for a Tuareg by the Tuaregs themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They knew . But he waited until the camels were stripped for action , until every soldier stood at the foreleg of his kneeling mount , a rifle in his hand and bandoliers of cartridges across his chest . Thus they would wait , he toldthem , until the Ouled Gerir had sighted him , until a sufficient body of them had started in pursuit , until he had led them out of sight into the Tanzerouft . Then they would strike . They would strike swiftly and decisively . And from the expressions on their tense faces he knew that they would succeed  --  that they would take possession of the well or die trying . He took the camel 's nose-cord in his hand , and the animal seemed to rise , to grow greater in size . Its knees restlessly moved the sand . He put his foot on its foreleg and its nostrils quivered and its eyes showed white about their yellow irises . Now , he thought , was the moment , not later . Now the camel would snarl , bellow and refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leap to its feet and race under the pressure of his foot for the plain beyond ; and there , even seeing the Tuareg camels and smelling the water it needed , keep on running until he brought it to a halt , saved his men and himself . He thrust with his foot . The camel rocked under him , flung him forward with a jolt ; then with a powerful shudder rose to its full height . It stood stiffly for a moment , its tail out and its head up as if to orient itself . Then , regardless of the Captain 's foot or of the nose-cord and of the soft , encouraging words from the Captain 's lips , it swung into action  --  silently , effortlessly , headed for the plain ahead , toward the Tanzerouft beyond . The chieftain of the Ouled Gerir , Ahmed Ben Salah , was a slim leathern man , not very large , with dark liquid eyes , with a bearded chin , with a knowledge of camelflesh in his small shaved head that was second only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in crossing the Sahara . Considering the stakes to be gained well worth the sacrifice , he had provided himself with plenty of Algerian camels , mounted those to be ridden by his men with the lightest of saddles , lightly burdened the others with waterskins . At the last welt known to him in the Tanzerouft he had allowed these latter camels to drink their fill , then cut out their tongues so that they could not eat . Nine days later , when his water-skins were empty , he had killed these camels and reprovisioned himself with the water in their stomachs . It was in this manner , marching night and day , that he had reached Bilma , made his raid upon the Tuareg villages and now , with over a hundred white camels , was engaged in selecting from the lot those to be ridden and those to be sacrificed , if need be , on the trip homeward . He had no fear of the French . As well as anybody  --  the Tuaregs themselves  --  he knew the circumstances of Moussa 's defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms , he should not have dared the raid that had been so easy . He smiled , recalling their futile defense with spears and swords ; and it was in this frame of mind that his attention was called to a white camel , larger than any he had ever seen , crossing the plain westward ridden by what appeared to be a Tuareg noble . He immediately suspected a ruse . But what , he reflected , if there were more Tuaregs behind the dune ? His men could handle them . He gave orders . More than a dozen saddles were hurriedly fitted to as many white camels . A moment later , in the saddle himself and gripping a rifle , he was directing a flanking movement intended to bring the Tuareg within rifle range . But the Tuareg , he soon perceived , was making no effort to turn ; was riding straight for the Tanzerouft , and his men were beginning to converge from left and right , to fall in with the direct course of pursuit taken by himself . The big camel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and drawing from his saddle bag an implement like an iron claw , he applied it savagely to the shoulders of his own mount , raking the flesh , forcing it to greater speed . The glow of satisfaction was now gone from his eyes ; they were hard , flashing . He was bent forward in the saddle . Abreast of him wereother riders ; more were falling in behind . He could not understand the choice of the man ahead of him . Was there a well in the Tanzerouft he did not know ? Had the Tuareg sufficient water with him , after all , to manage an escape to the next well under cover of night ? Toward sundown the Captain drew the camel to a halt . It was not easy for him to do so . In spite of its long run , in spite of its faltering and heaviness of foot , it resisted the nose-cord until from sheer force he had drawn back its head , caught its nostril in his hand , and forced it to kneel . It lay heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hollows over its eyes rhythmically pulsing . Captain Djon glanced in the direction from which he had come , and against the clear horizon he could see a number of white dots . He caught a laugh in his throat , then abruptly swallowed it . It was about an hour since the Ouled Gerir had turned . His men had long since taken the well . By midnight , he reflected , the marauders would get the surprise of their lives . He looked at the camel , and the ache in his arms , the killing fatigue in his back , throughout his entire body was lightened for a moment by a glow of pride , by the elation of conquest . For the camel , he thought , had not only obeyed him ; it seemed actually to have understood the situation ; for instead of responding to his frequent and finally futile efforts to make it turn , to circle back toward the well in order that he should not be unnecessarily far away when the pursuit ceased , the beast had raced unswervingly toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being captured . He lay down , got up after a moment to drink from his waterskin , then lay down again . He was tired ; the camel was tired ? completely done up . There was no point in returning to the well immediately . He would sleep for an hour or two , he would allow the camel to rest . By starlight he would return  --  at a walk , and he would be back at Bilma by dawn . It was dark when the Captain awoke . It was so dark that for a moment he thought he was blind and put his hands to his face ; for he could see no stars , neither could he see the camel . He could hear it breathing , ruminating ; he could smell it . Rut he could not see it . He got hurriedly to his feet , felt frantically about for his waterskin , found it , and wrapped it carefully in his black turban . He had been a fool , he told himself , to leave it exposed like that , lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn since sundown . He located his saddle and brought it quickly to the camel , passing his hands over its hump to locate the withers . There was no point , he told himself , in waiting for daylight . There would be no sun . The dust might continue to fall for a week , two weeks . Saddling up , he removed its hobbles ; and with a warning from his heart that he refused to acknowledge , he mounted , brought the animal to its feet and drew the nose-cord , trying to turn it in the direction in which he thought the well should be . The camel resisted him , caused him to reflect : he had been positive that he knew where the well lay . Immediately upon awakening his instinct had told him . But now that the camel objected he wondered if he were not mistaken . Its sense of direction was infallible . It was thirsty . There was no doubt but that it had smelled the well the day before . The Captain drew his foot from the animal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confidently , the beast started through the darkness in a direction contrary to his own ; and when the gray light of day allowed him to see the camel 's feet and a pale area of earth he watched this area carefully , hoping for the assurance of a bit of dung dropped by his mount the day before . But he found no such landmarks , and when toward the middle of the day the heat became almost more than he could bear without his sun-helmet and sufficient clothes to insulate his body , he began to be worried . He had come all , he thought , of thirty kilometers . It was incredible that he could have gone farther the day before . He tried to force the camel more to the right , thinking that he might strike a point of the great plain dotted with camel carcasses and dung . But the camel refused to bear to the right . It turned back its head , showing its teeth and the whites of its eyes , and when he struck it with his whip it instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pitched him out of the saddle . He quickly recovered himself ; he still held the nose-cord . Seizing his whip from the ground , he struck the beast savagely about the head and neck , tried again to force it to the right and , when he found that it would be beaten to death rather than march in that direction , he tried to pull it by the nose-cord , walking barefoot . He fired his rifle , shouted , fired another shot . He was thoroughly frightened now . His water was gone . In spite of the cloth wrappings all had been absorbed by the heat and the dust . His mouth felt sticky . A kind of panic , worse than thirst , was attacking his nerves . It was imperative , he knew , that he reach Bilma before the next morning . Mounting again , no longer certain of where the well was , he gave the animal its head . And at sundown of the next day the Captain was still riding . But he was no longer tired . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now entirely gone ; but it was sluggish in obeying him . His face felt wooden , yet burning . There was a loud ringing in his head . His feet were slipping constantly from the camel 's neck . For now that he was blind to the desert he was as in a room of his own , a room in which the chairs and the tables and all the other objects that he had for so many years used as a means to an end now struck him as new and strange and somehow beautiful , as if they were ends in themselves . And because his mind , now lost , was seeking a truth that was beyond life , he saw again the white camels before rgiriumoomarnimvpmciroom THE WHITE CAMEL him in the Hoggar foothills , and he understood at last that the man whom he had most hated had stood always beyond life ; that the pride and sovereignty he had so desperately attacked and , he thought , conquered , had been flung in his face ; and that he had for fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died to save the lives of his people . With what was left of his strength he knotted the nose-cord to his wrist and tried , but failed , to bind himself in the saddle . A strange sight presented itself in the Tanzerouft some days later . In a space of no particular identity stood the white camel . One foreleg , being advanced , was complemented by a hind leg . The other two legs were parallel in a backward position . The attitude , save for the animal 's neck , was of motion ; yet the beast did not move . It was unable to move . Its neck was bent ; its head was turned low to the ground . Its nostril was stretched and from the copper ring in its nostril the nose-cord Ied backward to a figure brown on top and of a lighter shade underneath , which rested on its knees and chest and one elbow , the other arm being held forward by the nose-cord . For the space of a half hour the figure did not move . Then , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . The other tried , but failed . And as these efforts were accomplished the camel also moved . Its head advanced slightly . Its feet lifted and lowered in their tracks . Occasionally the dust became so thick that the camel was invisible , the Captain a dark shadow . There was over the land the same hush , the same knowledge of falling , fulfillment of will that accompanies a snowstorm . The Captain moved again ; the camel moved . And then for another long period they held their pose  --  statuesque in a gray mist , hound together yet unconscionably remote , the Captain blind , the camel implacable . But there came a time in the big camel 's life when the Captain ceased to move ; when its nostrils quivered and its ears lay back , when with a nervous movement of feet it swung its head over the Captain 's body , steadied , and then flung back like a whip , jerking the body and tearing the ring from its nose . And the camel went on . It traveled by night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And before a month had passed the camel arrived at a place in the desert which caused him to wander , as at pasturage ; to feed at leisure , moving now in this direction and now in that ; to stand for long periods of time chewing what he had eaten and gazing over the landscape . A tree awakened his interest . It was not a large tree . Its trunk was gray and twisted . Its branches were thorny . Tiny green leaves , paler than winter plants , grew from these branches . Among the leaves were blossoms , not larger than a penny . The camel put his nose familiarly among these blossoms , nibbling , scenting their fragrance . Then , as if moved by a whim , he passed on . He passed an object like a rock , gray and hairless , crumpled on the earth , cords at either end . He knew it was a waterskin ; he had once carried it at his side . But it was without interest . Likewise without interest was a rifle , its barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , farther on , a blue gown , lying as though dropped only that evening . He came to a leathery figure beyond , colossal , distorted , projecting a few white bones  --  all that was left of Moussa . There was a nose-cord attached to his wrist , and at the end of the nose-cord there was a copper ring . The camel smelled the nose-cord and the ring . He lifted his head , gazing over the landscape , scenting the air . This heap of bones was not , to him , the Moussa he had served . He seized a bone in his teeth , transferred it to his molars . For a time he stood over the figure , crunching the bone for its lime . Then , moved by a restless urge , he wandered on , still in search of his master .
