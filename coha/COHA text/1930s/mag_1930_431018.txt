 | IN A high-ceilinged room on the second floor of the Executive Mansion in Albany ? a large , comfortable room of great charm , with a fine old desk , some happy reproductions of early American furniture , a fireplace , and numerous spirited pictures of yachts , cutters , and full-rigged ships ? I sat talking with the wife of the Governor of New York , Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt . " The three questions that I have come to ask are these , " I said . " Just what is a wife 's job today ? In what respect does it differ from the job as it used to be ? How is it managed by women who manage it in the modern way ? " She laughed pleasantly . " Do n't you think that a man who can ask such questions should be able to answer them ? " " He should , but can not , " I confessed . " Doubtless there are millions of men who can not answer them ? and perhaps a few women ! Of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many husbands who do not know how the other half lives ! " Thereupon I explained how I had come to realize that the questions I was asking were too big for a mere man to answer . At the start of my investigation into this fascinating problem , I had consulted many prominent men -- business men , judges , lawyers , experts in household economics ? and many wives . Some emphasized one thing , some another . I found much disagreement as to the specifically modern aspects of the job . but universal agreement that the wife of today has a widely different task from that of the wife of a generation ago . " These differences of opinion , " I said to Mrs. Roosevelt , " are too much for me to reconcile . I hope to find out what answer I shall get if the problem passes through the mind of one person whose authority for speaking can not be questioned . " Incidentally I may say that I was moved to take this problem to Mrs.Roosevelt for several reasons . Four distinguished women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of modern wife . They spoke with admiration of the manner in which she manages her home and many outside cares , handling a complicated job with the charm of high intelligence and forcefulness of character . Moreover , I was aware that , back in 1917 , because of the manner in which she mobilized herself , her husband , five children , and ten servants , her home in Washington was regarded as a model type for large households conducted in accord with the recommendations of the Food Administration . Celebrated as a hostess , a partner in a furniture manufacturing enterprise , a teacher in a New York day school for girls , mother of five children , four boys and a girl , this ideal type of the modern wife happens herself to be a grandmother !  | " Nowadays , " observed Mrs. Roosevelt , " we hear it said with great emphasis that women are changing , or have changed . Some even say that a successful wife today must be a new type of woman . I do not think so . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has many new aspects . The truth seems to be that the circumstances in which we live have changed so that a wife must change her methods to meet the requirements of her job , just as the professional or business man has had to change his methods to meet the requirements of his job . " I think we must all agree that in the wife 's job there are three fundamentals ? being a partner , being a mother , and being a housekeeper and homemaker . Formerly , if we had been arranging the phases of the job in the order of their importance , I think we would have put being a mother first and next being a housekeeper and homemaker , and then being a partner . But today we understand that everything else depends upon the success of the wife and husband in their personal partnership relation . So from the modern point of view that comes first . " The most successful marriage I have ever known was the most complete in its partnership . A business man of vast interests , a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had many contacts with men and a great influence over young men . He and his wife were mature when they married . They knew what they wanted to get out of life and what they wanted to do with their lives . He talked with her about everything ? his business , his friendships , and particularly about the one great interest they had in common . She was interested in everything that interested him . He was interested in everything that interested her . " The great common interest in which they were most absorbed was helping others . He was continually picking up young men and literally converting them from ' bums ' into substantial citizens . It was his avocation , so to speak . His wife had a tremendous human interest that matched his own . Young men who were sent to him because , for one reason or another , they were not doing well in their jobs or in life were invited into his home . The wife was able to talk with these young men and frequently to discover their secret ambitions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of the influence of this husband and wife , the young men turned out remarkably well . " The great joy of this couple was to discover some hidden or defeated aspiration in the heart of a young man or young woman and then , in ways of their own , to help this aspiration to assume reality . This was their great interest , their adventure , their thrill and their excitement together . Always it seemed they were planning other people 's lives , furnishing out of their own happiness a sense of what life could and should be . " A great adventure of just this sort is , of course , not possible for all . But in every marriage that is managed in the modern way there must be , I think , some great common interest that may be said to correspond . It is through the interests that a man and woman share , interests that may be entirely apart from business or other worldly cares , that the light of a true marriage shines . " Partnership ! Companionship ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for modern marriage . This thought takes me back to some memories of one of my husband 's grandmothers . A relnarkable woman , she managed her household with great ability . Corresponding with all the intellectual lights of the day , reading everything written by Emerson and other important writers of the time , she read to her husband all that time would allow . Always she carried on a stimulating life of her own in which he shared . Today , to be sure , the same type of woman is doing what corresponds to that type of thing . So I am not saving that the wives of today can hope to be better companions than were some wives of the past . The great change is that , far more generally we recognize the importance of such companionship . Today , I think , there are far more wives who are good companions than there used to be . " How well we realize today that it is essential for a woman to develop her own interests ? in music , literature , club life , church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as not to lose the possibility of being a stimulating personality ! I have in mind the case of a woman who is sensitive , delicate , and a little timid . She married a man of very strong and dominating character . From the very beginning of their marriage their conversations were almost exclusively about his affairs , seldom hers . He completely dominated her . She had really great artistic gifts , but , owing to the situation in their home , she did not continue @#  | developing them after her marriage . In the end , their relationship came to mean nothing to him , mainly because she was afraid of him . Having taken out of her everything that was good , he lost all interest in her . Eventually they were divorced and he married again . " In his relations with his first wife this man represents what might be called the vampire husband , ' dominating ruthlessly and discarding what he ruined . With the second wife it was different . She did not fear him . Seeing that she had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she promptly adjusted herself to the circumstances in what I should say was the modern way , neither subordinating nor effacing herself . She , too , had talents and abilities , and she maintained her right to develop them . Though deeply interested in all her husband 's affairs , she never sacrificed her own interests . The difference in the result has been remarkable . The relationship apparently has been perfectly satisfying , and the marriage a complete success . " Also , to be sure , we have the vampire wife . Daily we see women who look upon their husbands purely as a source of supply and seem to think that their husbands should sacrifice everything for them . They take all and give little or nothing in return . Thus either the wife or the husband may be of the vampire type . But the relationship that ensues can never be a success . It may be successful for one , but never for both . At all events it is not modern . " Life moves more rapidly today . There are more things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . More than ever before , a wife must be able to take an intelligent interest in her husband 's interests . Notice that I say in his interests , ' not merely in his job . ' Her interest must not cease with his job . Women have found it a terrible thing to be just a heavy partner , sharing business and home cares only , and not a light partner , sharing in the diversion of pleasure hours . The modern way means that she must fit herself and keep herself fit to share not only responsibilities and burdens , but intellectual pursuits , recreation , diversion , and pleasures of all kinds . " On the other hand , each should , I think , have the opportunity for some experiences and interests that are not entirely shared by the other . As one sociologist puts it , Each must have a separate foothold , personal activities which are entered upon alone and which are not immediately rehashed in lieu of other conversation . These detached and personal activities maintain that sense of " illusiveness " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pall , there must always be some distinct territory in the life of each that has never thoroughly been explored by the other . ' " An Antiquated Idea " What would you say , " I asked , " if some stately mid-Victorian gentleman should suddenly arise in this meeting and declare that a wife 's job is to be entertaining and keep her husband 's mind off his business affairs ? A remark of that sort was made to me not long ago . " " I have never thought it was any more a wife 's job to keep her husband 's mind off his business worries by entertaining him than it is a husband 's job to entertain his wife and keep her mind off the thousand and one irksome duties that may be tiring her ! " " Now , will you tell me what you regard as the particularly modern aspects of the mother phase of the wife 's job ? " I suggested . " How much more we know today about the care and rearing of children than women formerly knew ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child-rearing passed on to her by relatives , friends , and neighbors ? She is alert for scientific information about every detail from the correct footwear of the child to an understanding of his mental processes , and she is satisfied only with really expert advice . " There are those who assert with implied approval that the modern mother exercises less power over her children than the mother of former days . This , I think , does , not put the matter in the correct way . Nowadays more children are sent outside the home to nurseries and schools for some of their earliest training . Consequently many children come less under the mother 's authority . But a woman who has her children at home must , if she is going to train her children properly , require discipline and obedience . " The difference between the methods of today and those of yester-year consists mainly in this : We do not have the old-fashioned idea of making a child do a thing simply because he is told to do it . From his earliest days we teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As much as possible we let him learn by experience . Nevertheless , we still tell him what to do and require his obedience . If he does not quite understand the reason for what is asked of him , he must nevertheless obey , if for no other reason than because he has learned that mother is trustworthy . In the future , of course , he may demand an explanation , and this the wise mother will do her best to give . Children Need Two Parents " The partnership which husband and wife share must , of course , include parenthood ; for there are many things in managing the children which the mother can not accomplish alone . Take the religious side , for instance . A woman may feel that to make religion a reality to youth , a certain amount of formal observance is necessary . If she does feel this way about it and the husband himself does not practise such observance , a time will come when disturbing questions will arise in the minds of their children . They will realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observance necessary . They may question the wisdom of what the mother has asked . In the end this may prevent the life of the family from being a unified thing . " " Would you say that most mothers today understand sufficiently the importance of letting their children develop their own personalities ? " I asked . " The experienced modern mother understands it , but there are many still whose failure in this respect works havoc . Today we frequently hear the phrase smothering mothers . ' It refers to a situation that is all too common and one that every mother should thoroughly comprehend . " " What is a smothering mother ' ? How does a mother smother ? " I asked . " Psychologists and doctors explain this as a tendency on the part of mothers to take over too much of their children 's lives , not allowing them to assume their own responsibilities , nor even to formulate their own thoughts . A mother can smother in many different ways . Sometimes it is due to excessive affection . She may feel that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them formulate their own ideas . She does not have the patience to wait to see if the child can answer for itself . Such a mother can not bear to think of her child suffering through experience in the world . In the end she claims so much of the child 's attention that it is not allowed to have any outside life of its own . " Frequently the concern of a mother , or of a father and mother together , is that the child should achieve that which the parents themselves desired when they were young , but of which they were deprived . If the child is not suited for the particular mold into which the parents wish it to fit , the attempt to force the child into it smothers its true self and works harmful and sometimes devastating results , " I have in mind a woman who wanted her daughter to be a social success . She made her come out , gave her a grand party , and wanted  | her to be with her friends ' children and to do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not care about that kind of life and was very unhappy . She tried , nevertheless , to make herself a success . " Seeking to meet her mother 's wishes , she became a little fast . She painted . She danced in an exaggerated way . She did all sorts of things that were not in her nature to do . Finally she broke down in health and had to go away to get well . Upon her return she suddenly announced that she had never wanted to be a social success nor the kind of person she had forced herself to be . What she really wanted was some kind of job . They had to let her go and find a job . To this day her mother is not reconciled , though she has felt obliged at last to let her daughter be herself . The Smothering Mother " Some mothers I know have a way of making themselves more attractive than their daughters . I have actually seen them take their daughters ' beaux away , by themselves assuming the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express herself , an injudicious mother can easily prevent the young personality from flowering . " How many boys I have known who seemed dull at home because they would not talk ! Elsewhere they have been delightful conversationalists . At home , they were smothered because the mother , or perhaps both parents , did not control a desire to shine and consequently monopolized the conversation . " " Then we recognize it as part of the wif emother 's job today to avoid smothering , " I said . " How can this be managed ? " " The essential thing for a mother to realize is that smothering should and can be avoided . The great safeguard lies in this . As her children grow older and do not require physical care , a mother must take pains to develop new interests of her own in church , community or welfare activities , say . She must not let herself be . completely dependent for her interest in life on the lives that her children live . " There are two other things which I think are highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly because of the character of the times in which we live . The first of these was brought home by the story a mother told me recently . She had just heard that her grown-up son was a delightful conversationalist when away from home . " John , ' she said to him , telling him of what she had heard , I wish that you would exercise this delightful quality at the family table . ' " To this John replied : I ca n't , Mother ! I 've tried ! ' " If you can talk so delightfully when away from home , why ca n't you talk in the same way with us ? ' asked his mother . Do n't you realize , Mother , ' he said , that at table you and father and the rest of us never hold a conversation ? Families do n't talk ! They plan ! ' " Planning for the family is important , to be sure , but there is a time and place for it . Perhaps the table is not the place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets together nowadays we are altogether too apt to confine our conversation to the material sides of existence . I think it is part of the job of a wife today to broaden the subjects discussed between her and her husband and the children . " Many fathers and mothers seem disturbed because this is an age when children say to their parents : You do not know about conditions today ! You are behind the times , out of date ! ' This is something that the younger generation has always said to the older generation . Today I think we can use better wisdom in dealing with it than they did in former times . " I happen to have been associated with a group of young people who have grown up in unhappy homes . Some of their homes have been broken . The effect of it has been terrible upon these children . They have come to look upon trial marriage as the practical way to avoid an unhappy home life . They say that it would be better to go in for trial marriage for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a broken home . " Now , one may not believe in the panacea that these children propose . Indeed , one may abhor it . But if you say to them that this is something that must not be thought of and should not even be discussed , the result is certain . You will have no understanding of what they are thinking . The only way one can understand and influence them is to let them talk and to consider the question oneself . " That , I think , is the only way in which this particular problem ? the perennial problem of a difference in views between the younger and the older generation ? can ever be solved . So far as possible the older generation must keep an open mind , never be shocked , and always be willing to listen and to discuss whatever the younger generation may have to say . " " You have yet to speak of the new things in the housekeeper-homemaker part of the wife 's job , " I reminded her at this point . " Once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and the housewife 's activities were centered in home industries . Today , she is far less of a producer ' in the old sense . She has become a purchaser . As we all know , nowadays she buys , among other things , the house furnishings , table supplies , motor cars , clothes for the family , and mechanical devices used in the home . " But do not understand me to say that the wife of today is not a producer . She produces as much as formerly , but in a different way ? by deciding what the family needs and how to spend , by using money in the best way . " Once she had to plan to see that the household had the necessities . Today , most of us have more than the mere necessities ; and the wife has to plan on what are the next greatest values for the family after the necessities are taken care of . This in itself is an important and momentous new task . " Think of the things a woman must know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what are the proper things to eat and how they should be cooked . If it is a home where she does most of her own work , she has the problem of systemizing that work and of using as many labor-saving devices as she can afford . She must learn to do it in the easiest and quickest possible way so that all goes as smoothly as possible and so that it may not seem a burden to her or to any one . If it is a home in which there are servants , she must inform herself as to reasonable and satisfactory rates of compensation . She then has the same problems to meet that an employer in business has . Definite agreements must be made and lived up to , with time off , and compensation for loss of free time . That is to say , this must be the case if we regard servants as people like ourselves who happen to be engaged in the business of modern housekeeping . Home-Making Is a Partnership Job " Again , the partnership which the husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes today the trouble seems to be that the husband takes no responsibility beyond merely providing what money he can . This attitude is frequently responsible for a certain amount of mismanagement in the home . When it occurs I think it is apt largely to be the fault of the wife . If she is really doing a cooperative job , bringing her husband into the important decisions that arise in connection with her work , he is bound to realize that her duties are exacting , and a sympathetic understanding more or less inevitably results . He will probably never know how much time it takes her to do each individual thing , nor just how , by managing people , the children , and the details of her work , she makes the home a comfortable place . But he will know that she is doing many important things . I  | should say that it is part of the wife 's job to see that her husband realizes that in managing the home she is continually dealing with big problems and doing many important things . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share . " One job of the modern housewife is to put her household on a business basis . In the old days it was sufficient if she kept accounts . Today she makes a budget . From first to last the modern wife faces the necessity of taking her job exactly as one takes a professional job , applying the best possible scientific and efficiency methods . " Ond of the requirements for a successful wife today is a tremendous fund of energy . More and more we are coming to realize that it is important to budget not only expenditures , but time and energy . In order to do this , one must have a sense of values and be able to decide what things are to be considered the most important . " The Matter of Most Importance " I should like to know how you look at your own job in this respect , " I said . " What do you regard as the important things ? How do you manage the matter of time and energy ? " " The most important and necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position my husband occupies at the present time , is to see that the social side of life is taken off his shoulders and that the house runs smoothly . Therefore the first thing I look after is the social necessities , the fixed events that must occur . " Until all my children were away at school , I stayed at home . Then I began to teach . I was already teaching when we came to Albany . I teach because I love it . I can not give it up . My subjects are current events , literature and history . This work takes me to New York for three days a week , Mondays , Tuesdays , and Wednesdays . My teaching is the second most important thing on my program . " Ordinarily it is difficult or impossible for the housewife to make and follow a schedule . She must always be ready to meet emergencies . She can plan her time only in a general way . To a certain extent , however , I do make a schedule . I know , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a certain train , and that I shall come back every Wednesday on a certain train . I am in school from nine to one o'clock on Mondays ; nine to five on Tuesdays , and nine to eleven on Wednesdays . I must be at home ' here Wednesday afternoon from fourthirty to six o'clock . Every week during the legislative session , on either Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , or Saturday night , whichever happens to be most convenient for my husband , we give a dinner . As a rule , people who visit us come for the week-end , and I must plan for the men who come on other nights when I am away . Of course , I have to know before I go to New York on Sunday what is going to happen while I am away , so that I can leave a complete list of the people who will stay in the house , order the meals , and have it all settled . " Outside of these matters a score of things may come up , but they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeping and my teaching . That is always the case when one is planning time . You have to decide , first of all , what the important things are , and others must be fitted in . " It is fair to say that the constant interruptions which take a woman 's mind from what she is doing at the moment make it more wearing than the man 's business job . She must have great adaptability in switching from one type of work to another . That is one reason why it is so important for the wife of today definitely to decide upon which tasks are to come first . " A woman is naturally limited in what she can do by her physical strength . The happiness of her home depends upon her gauging it  | accurately and not becoming a tired drudge , an irritable wife and mother . This is particularly difficult to avoid when she has perhaps a delicate physique and a very active mind . She must decide on what her physical limitations are in just the same way that she decides what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect than financial ones . If she goes beyond them , it means that every day she will make her home less worth living in . It will affect her husband , her children , her servants , and every one with whom she comes in contact . " One of the great secrets for making the most of one 's time and energy is to put yourself completely into what you are doing at the moment . If the task of the moment is playing with a child , you must not be thinking of something that must be done in the next hour or of what is going to happen tomorrow . Livein the present , not in what is yet to come , as so many women do . " It requires more thought today to develop character and to live a life in which we can acquire a real education . One needs peace to develop inner contentment , and time to think and grow spiritually as well as physically . " I have in mind a wealthy woman who has many houses in city and country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North and in the South , and innumerable servants . She spends her time putting pretty bows on things one uses in the bathrooms and bedrooms . The great original discovery she has made about life is this : she thinks it terrible that married couples visiting her , occupying the same room , should have bathrobes and lounging robes that do not match ! She shops a great deal to get robes that will match and also fit harmoniously into the surroundings of the room ! " Many of us waste energy , time , and thought in pursuits that might seem equally futile if we stopped to ponder them . Usually the reason is that we have no plan . Each must decide for himself , of course , what he will regard as of first importance and what things come next . All our lives should be planned with an idea of doing some central job as well as possible . One can not realize the great joy of life to its full extent until he has deliberately designed a pattern for his activities and set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , floored by the rapidity of movement in the world today , have said to me : I can not keep up with my children ! Motor cars carried them so fast ! Now they want to fly ! There are so many things I should , but can not , do . I can not read or hear or see enough to keep up-to-date . ' To these women I say : The first thing to do is to sit down and become immovable . Get possession of yourself ! Let the world go by altogether until you have decided for yourself just exactly what you want . ' " Homes Come Before Careers " You have not spoken of that vexed problem , the wife 's job when she combines it with a career , " I reminded her . " It is too much vexed ! " she returned quickly . " I think it is comparatively simple . Looking at the history and the background of women , we seem to think that they are naturally more adaptable than men , and that they should try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that if the home of a married woman who goes in for a career is to be a success , she must subordinate what she is doing outside to the man 's career . " It comes down to this . If a marriage is really based on love , both can make it go if they wish to . But love is like every worth-while thing in life . It has to be cultivated . In all human relationships that require the continuance of an emotion , you have to give . If both are going to work until they are so tired that neither cares to do anything for the other , then that marriage is not going to last . Without the interchange of kindly thought and sensitive and affectionate acts , love will go . This is something which should be thought of by both the man and the woman before marriage . @#  | Something must be given up for the relationship with each other . " " Nowadays , " I said , " the home is being criticised because people are in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a place to eat , sleep , and keep one 's belongings . What is the wife 's responsibility here ? " " Home is where the family is ! " she returned quickly . " Sometimes it is around the radio ! Sometimes it is in the car ! Some day it may be in the air ! Different types of homes serve different uses . Home is the atmosphere in which we live . It is where our thoughts and fondest impulses are . The success of the modern home can not be judged merely by the amount of time people spend in it . " Today the homemaker is getting color and variety into her life by the use of the car . Only pessimists claim that all these new forms of amusement are abused and overdone . To be sure a woman can waste her new leisure and strength by ill-advised uses of the new mechanical devices . But we are learning that the leisure which the mechanical age has brought means more time for books , nature , friends , and all the other forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , " I said , " I feel like a mere man . The task of a modern wife seems too much to ask of an ordinary human being . Is the average woman equal to it ? " " Absolutely ! She is fully equal to it if she has been properly trained , or if she takes her job seriously enough to seek properly to train herself . This is particularly so if the husband is a man who recognizes that he needs special training and fitness for his job . " " And for success in this stupendous undertaking of being a wife , " I said , " what do you regard as the great essentials ? " " A little more academic training than formerly , that she may be able to study and master housekeeping and child problems ! Tact ! Kindness of heart ! Interest in the people about you ! Unselfishness ! Some independence of spirit . " " One more question , " I said . " If I asked Governor Roosevelt why he thinks you have made a success as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say ? " " In all probability he would tell you two things ; first , that a woman can not possibly know whether she is a successful mother until her last child is grown , and perhaps not until all her children 's children are grown . And he might say tha any little success I have achieved is due to the fact that I have some executive ability . That seems to be my only discernible talent . " This answer interested me tremendously in the light of what happened a moment later on my way out of the Executive Mansion . Passing the Governor 's office on the ground floor , I asked if I might see him for one minute to ask one question . He gave me two minutes to ask two questions . " Governor , " I said , " if you were asked to name the one thing which more than any other accounts for the success of Mrs. Roosevelt as a wife and mother , what would you say ? " " Great Scott ! " he exclaimed . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had interviewed his wife . " It 's something I 've never thought about ! " he added . " I 've always just taken it for granted that she was . " He gave it a moment 's thought , then said : " The answer is not difficult . It is right on the surface . " He looked contemplatively out the window , pondering the answer he had in mind . Then he said : " She has that something which every member of the Roosevelt family seems always to have had , a deep and abiding interest in everything and everybody . " This reminded me that Mrs. Roosevelt was a Roosevelt before her marriage ? a niece of Theodore Roosevelt ? by a line that diverged  | from her husband 's family back in 1690 . " And has she no special abilities of any kind ? " I asked . " None ! Not to any marked degree ! Only those she has developed as she went along . Everything grows out of her interest in things and in people ! " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think not . She has become a good executive because she is interested in people and in doing things . It all grows out of the trait I have mentioned . " In answer to something else I said , he added : " It is this broad , genuine interest that makes one tactful and kind and keeps one human , and fits a woman to be a partner and a mother and a homemaker , and for her place in the world , just as it fits a man to be a partner and a father and a homemaker and for his place in the world . "
