txt Municipal Services . Referring to the list of " engineers " assigned to the Mayor 's committee on municipal power plant , I am unable to find three of them listed as professional engineers in the University of the State of New York list for 1W.4 . There is also possibly a fourth , who is in the doubtful class owing to lack of a middle initiar . Would it not be well for the Mayor to see that all such engineering assignments are taken from a list of approved engineers ? The news concerning the offer on the part of the Consolidated Gas group to ? do business on the so-called Washington plan should put an end to this poppycock about municipal plants . The Mayor can retire gracefully with the laurels and every one will be happy , The municipal subway , incinerators , sewage disposal plants , markets , canal terminals , Staten Island docks , ferries and other enterprises should be enough of a dose for the taxpayers to swallow without the addition of this needless duplication of existing facilities and the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1634.
