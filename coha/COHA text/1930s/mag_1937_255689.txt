The Commons- <P> The House was advised that $892,960 was the cost in 1936 of the British Secret Service . This was " less than had been expected , " and the ever-efficient Secret Service , far from having overrun its budget as Government departments are inclined to do , reported a tidy little surplus of $7,035 . In so far as any British public man has to carry off the honors of being called ' ' head of John Bull 's Secret Service " by such careful newsorgans as Manhattan 's Herald Tribune , this duty is discharged by Sir Robert Gilbert Van-ittart , brilliant permanent Undersecretary of the British Foreign Office. * Last week Sir Robert 's brother-in-law , vigorous British Ambassador to Germany Sir Eric Phipps , was appointed Ambassador to France , and heaved by the Nazis were sighs of relief . After Dictator Hitler took power , two diplomats Der Fhrer found too hard and smart for his Nazis were the then U. S. Charge d'Affaires George Anderson Gordon , now U. S. Minister to Haiti , and Sir Eric Phipps . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herald Tribune last November , " is catching and jailing at a record rate spies with German contracts , and worrying the Nazi war staff and diplomatic chieftains by an uncanny knowledge of things which the Nazis thought were impenetrable secrets . . . . Vansittart is the only man living who knows all the Number Ones of the British Secret Service . Even the Prime Minister is denied that knowledge . But one other man is let in on the money side . He is Sir Warren Fisher , Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and Head of the Civil Service ; and he does the auditing job himself . <P> The Regency Bill , under which the Duke of Gloucester is to become permanent understudy of King George VI and Regent in the event of His Majesty 's " incapacitation " or death ( TIME , Feb. 8 ) was urged with dignity in the House last week by Home Secretary Sir John Simon . As England 's greatest lawyer , Sir John recalled how the insanity of King George III prevented that unfortunate monarch from assenting to the Regency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill , proposed by King George VI in " a message signed by His Majesty 's own hand , " should obviate Regency Act difficulties for all time , according to Sir John Simon , and overwhelmingly the House was with him . <P> Unfortunately the Home Secretary had opened , by mentioning King George III , direct access of attack upon King George VI by the few republican M.P . ' s and the lone Communist M.P . last week . Speaker the Rt . Hon. Edward Algernon Fitzroy , a congenitally stanch Monarchist usually quick to choke off belittlers of the Royal Family , was obliged to let them have their say .
