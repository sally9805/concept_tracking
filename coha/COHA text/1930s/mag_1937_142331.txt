In the land now called Germany there appeared some six centuries ago a curious and fearsome phenomenon . Suddenly and inexplicably large crowds began to dance in the streets with furious abandon , screaming , writhing , foaming at the mouth . The mania spread from city to city , new victims being inspired by sight of wandering sufferers , until most of Central and Northern Europe was a howling , leaping pandemonium . Uncontrollable , the dancers heeded no barriers , dashed out their brains against stone walls , pranced off bridges . Those caught in time were turned over to priests for lifting of curses , casting out of demons . <P> Appointment of a parson and a rabbi to help Rev. Frederic Siedenberg. executive dean of the Jesuit University of Detroit , mediate Detroit 's pandemonium of sit-down strikes was not the only thing which reminded observers of the medieval dance mania last week as they watched the U. S. Sit-Down epidemic of 1937 spread out across the land . From Salem witchcraft persecution to Ku Klux Klan , from Gold Rush of 1849 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself no less subject than its sister nations to seizures of mass hysteria . The Sit-Down last week remained primarily a new and powerful weapon in the hands of Organized Labor . But the 600 cigar-factory girls who sat down for extra pay in Newark , N. J. had no union , did not want one . The seven Negro wet nurses who sat down for 10 per oz. in Chicago ( see cut p. 12 ) had never heard of John L. Lewis , replied to questioners : " Y'all must mean Joe Louis . " In Ionia , demanding back pay , members of the Michigan National Guard who had policed Flint during the General Motors Sit-Down , planted themselves on their armory steps , refused to budge until their captain handed them each a $5 bill from the troop 's athletic fund . When his 40 employes sat down , President Louis N. Kapp of Chicago 's Comet Model Airplane Co. got out his fiddle , made it a party . In many cases the Sit-Down was a craze like marathon dancing or miniature golf . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week found itself unable longer to ignore . <P> Senators 6 Shadows , Uprising in the Senate for one of the briefest speeches of his loquacious career , California 's venerable Hiram Johnson cried : ' ' The most ominous thing in our national economic life today is the Sit-Down strike . It is bad for the Government and in the long run it is worse for Labor . If the Sit-Down strike is carried on with the connivance or the sympathy of the public authorities , then warning signals are out , and down that road lurks DICTATORSHIP . " <P> Peering down the Johnson road , James Hamilton Lewis of Illinois discerned the same lurking bogey . Solemnly he recalled that seizure of factories and industrial unrest had preceded the rise of Fascist and Nazi dictators . " Hear your humble servant ! ' ' warned courtly Senator " Jim Ham . " " In every hour and condition such as now surrounds this our Government there awaits another Hitler and there lurks in the shadows another Mussolini . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
