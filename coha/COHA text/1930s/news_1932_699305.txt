txt ' Acting on affidavits and other data presented by Walter S. Mack Jr .. defeated Republican candidate for the State Senate , George Z. Medalie , United States Attorney , began yesterday an inquiry into charges of widespread fraud at the polls in the Seventeenth Senatorial District . J. Edward Lumbard . Assistant United States Attorney , launched the investigation by issuing subpoenas for voting machines . The Board of Elections , already fighting the Federal inquiry , indicated it would oppose the subpoenas . Mr. Medalie announced that tomorrow the grand jury would be requested to examine the Mack data . At the same time it was learned that Mr. Medalie 's office , under the direction of Mr. Lumbard , had laid plans to widen the inquiry into election frauds in Manhattan and to seek special court action to prevent the Board of Elections from changing the totals on the machines to zeros on Dec. 8 , when the thirty-day period during which they can not be changed is ended . Appeals by the election board are expected to delay final decision on the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to pressing a search for the irregularities charged by Mr. Mack , Mr. Medalie 's office will follow a line of investigation leading into the Second and Fourth Assembly Districts . Subpoenas for voting machines in these districts were served with those for machines in the Seventeenth Assembly District on George V. Conklin , deputy chief clerk of the Board of Elections . Mr. Mack 's affivadits and other data were gathered in an investigation begun by himst.lf and carried on particularly in the Puerto Rican election districts of the Seventeenth Assembly District which turned the tide against the Republican candidate . He was aided by former Assistant Attorney General Samuel A. Berger . " Information contained in the affidavits , " said a statement from Mr. Mack 's office . " presents a vivid picture of almost incredible corruption and dishonesty throughout the district . " ' I saw fourteen men enter the polling place , ' one sworn statement reads , ' and throw out the watchers , after which each man went into the booth , started to vote and continued voting for about ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man voting about ten times . " Says Inspector Signed 800 Names . " Other voters reported similar occurrences , and in one affidavit an inspector declared that at 4 P. M. there were over 600 votes cast in the machine , and only about 170 signatures in the registration booth . ' I saw one Democratic inspector signing the book at least 300 times dia1 ing the day , and after the polls were closed I saw him sign additional names , ' he said . " Others reported closing of the polls el shortly after 5 o'clock , despite long lines of voters waiting outside . One voter testified to being st'ucl in the face and given a black eye when he protested at the insp  --  ctor tampering with his vote . He also declared that a policeman near the The same issue is at stake in the on the voting machines in the Seventeenth , Second and Fourth Assembly Districts and if the board , as ex , pected , declines to honor the new subpoenas , similar procedure will be started . But since the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve the voting data intact for only thirty days after election day . it would be acting within the law if it permitted the zeroing of all the figures on the machines on Dec. 8 , the day for argument on the legal issue . As a result , if the Federal Attorney 's office did win its case it might be of no avail . For that reason Mr. Lumbard is understood to be preparing to seek a special writ to compel the Board of Elections to retain the figures rin the voting machines involved in their present state until after the decision of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals had been handed down . It is expected that the November grand jury will be asked to hold over into December to continue the inquiry , door raised his club and threatened to strike him if he did n't ' beat it . ' " Mr. Lumbard 's inquiry , it was said , would include investigation of charges that henchmen of Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenbeirner had been at work at the polls intimidating Mack supporters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election day . Mr. Mack avowed that his real purpose in following up the charges was to try to reveal actual balloting conditions , so that a start on a purification of voting could be obtained in order to achieve a " clean Mayoralty election next year . " " Before the election , " said Mr. Mack , " I was warned of this situation in the Seventeenth district and told to expect the worst . I determined then that if such astounding conditions as were described to me actually existed , I was going to see they were done away with . " I found that they were even worse . There is no use in people standing in line for two hours in order to vote if that vote is going to be nullified because in other districts hoodlums and gangsters are running up votes on the machine which will far overbalance any honest votes cast . " The people of New York are actually being deprived of their franchise because of this state of affairs . Especially is this true in a district such as the Seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Democratic organization or timorous of its power . Here fraud on the voting machine is very easy , and votes are rung up like sales on a cash register in the five and ten , with no possible check whatever . Mack Undecided on Contest . Mr. Mack was undecided yesterday about any attempt at a contest with Albert Wald , his victorious Democratic opponent . It was considered unlikely that he would make one . The Democrats will control the new Senate and it is believed that they would vote to retain the seat for the party . No special court action is being contemplated by Mr. Mack either . It is understood that Mr. Lumbard ' in going before the Federal grand jury will offer the affidavits and call those who. made them within the near future .
