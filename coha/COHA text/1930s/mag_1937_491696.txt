WHO ought to be the big boss of a big business ? That used to bother only those in line for the job . The public and the politicians never used to get into the picture . The man who owned the show was just naturally its boss and had the undisputed right to make mistakes . No one gainsaid the right of P. D. Armour , Andrew Carnegie , Cyrus McCormick , John Wanamaker , P. T. Barnum or any of the great individualists of yesterday to manage his own affairs . Likewise no one questioned the management rights of such men as Cornelius Vanderbilt and E. H. Harriman , who bought control of properties without wholly owning them . There were questions aplenty as to the manner in which some of these men managed their properties . Today , the public view is tending to consider all corporations as in the public service . Of course , everyone in business is , after a fashion , in the public service , for the public supports everything . And what we formerly thought was private business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps because public officers are doing the examining . Be that as it may , it is a fact that the rights , 1 abilities and pay of those who manage private corporations are being pawed over , and may be a subject of lawmaking . For it is said that our present lot of corporate managers have little or no ownership in their corporations and are not really elected by the stockholders . Thus , it is said , the control of big business tends to be self-perpetuating in the hands of men without the responsibilities of ownership . Business tends more and more to be conducted by corporations , and the process will con ti nue , because , af ter business reaches a certain size , individual ownership becomes cumbersome and inconvenient , and an owner 's death may bring calamity . The corporation as a convenience is , however , fairly new . Fifty years ago , the corporate form was scarcely used , except by railroads , canals , banks and insurance enterprises . Individuals who incorporated were looked on with suspicion . Adam Smith did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation was then called  --  could be workable in general business , while Swift , Addison and Steele had only satire for the kind of persons who organized companies , for the only sort of company they knew was the concern whose stock was a punter 's chip  --  even the East India Company and the Bank of England began as gambles . During one British boom , it is recorded , promoters mysteriously launched a company for a purpose " later to be disclosed . " The public snapped up the stock . The purpose never had to be disclosed , for , once the stock was sold , the reason for the company died . That is reminiscent of our own 1925-29 , and only goes to show that the corporate form is exceedingly versatile and that stock jobbing may easily be confused with the doing of actual business . To that confusion is due most of the past and present public misunderstanding of corporations and their management : It is a misunderstanding for which the corporations themselves are to blame , for there has never been a dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of many corporate officers and bankers , between a company 's stocks and bonds as equipment for a gambling game and the stocks and bonds as representing the savings of the people entrusted to the directors to use in the making and selling of radios , automobiles , steel rails or what not . The corporation is here to stay and , unless the country turns turtle , we may look not only for more corporations but for an increase in their average size . It takes capital to provide the facilities to produce low-priced goods and at the same time to pay high wages . Quite a lot of people do not seem to have thought of that . Someone must manage our corporations , and the quality of their management is the most important concern of the ten to twenty million people who own them through holding certificates of their stock , of the , perhaps , twenty or thirty million men and women who draw their pay from them , and of the one hundred and thirty million who must look to them as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the concern of the young men and women 100kinr ahead . A badly managed corporation is a public liability because it hurts its owners , its workers and those who would buy from it  --  and also it slams the door of opportunity . Corporate management , on the whole , does not , today , command respect . Whether or not that attitude is justified is another matter . Stockholders quite generally think that they have been getting a raw deal , workmen believe that their pay is lower than it ought to be , and consumers complain that many things are more expensive than they ought to be . Few of these people realize that a part of their complaint is not fairly directed at management and that rising taxes must lower real dividends and real wages while raising real prices . Behind the tangible discontents is a greater discontent . This has to do with the relations between business and government . The average man and woman are sensible human beings , deeply absorbed in having the best possible kind of United States for their children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more typical than are the street derelicts . The average man and woman know business both as a source of wage or other income and as a source of supply . They are asking why there should be so much conflict between business and government  --  if a government exists for its people , it is unreasonable for it to interfere with its people making a living . Business itself can not go wrong , for it is inanimate . Only human management can go wrong  --  a turret lathe can not have bad intentions . If all the charges that have been made against corporations are true and if all the regulatory laws promulgated or proposed are necessary , something is very wrong with the management , and it ought to be changed . If , on the other hand , the charges are not true , those in key positions ought to speak up and bring out the facts  --  as would any falsely accused persdn . That is about the reasoning of the average man and woman . They are fed up on the bickerings of government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are sick of political investigations and denunciations , of pugnacious labor organizers and of meaningless resolutions by associations that claim to represent business . They know intuitively that none of them represent anything but their own narrow interests . The people would like to get down to brass tacks and go to work . That which most disturbs the plain citizens is the apparently sheeplike character of those who hold more or less high positions in corporate affairs . They note that some of these men  --  enough to color the whole  --  are voluble opportunists rather than sincere advocates . The public often disliked the lords of industry and finance of a generation or two ago , but they respected them as fighters  --  as men who had achieved . They turned to them in emergencies . John D. Rockefeller , Andrew Carnegie , Henry Clay Frick and others of their kind and generation were not liked , but they were respected , largely because everyone knew what they stood for . Could the white paper used in denouncing them be reconverted into trees , the shelter belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan lived amid waves of angry printers ' ink , but in the panic of 1907 the country turned to him and he did not disappoint them . The Need for Modern Pioneers There are not many men willing squarely to buck a law which they hold is unjust . No end of men will speak their minds freely in private , but few will come out with the vigor of old Sir Josiah Child , the head of the East India Company during part of the reigns of Charles II and James II . Sir Josiah appointed s , Mr. Vaux as manager in India . Mr. Vaux , on leaving for his poet , said , in the course of a speech , that he would endeavor to acquit himself with integrity and justice , and would make the laws of his country the rule of his conduct . Whereupon Sir Josiah rose and set him right , saying that he expected that his orders were to be the rules and not . the laws of England , " which are a heap of nonsense compiled by a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws for the good government of their own private families , much less for the regulating of companies and foreign commerce . " Sir Josiah was a corporate officer  --  a hired man managing property he did not own . His attitude toward the law is hardly to be commended , but he certainly can not be charged with neglecting the rights of those who had put their property into his care . No one wants a return to exactly the type of men who built the country . They were pioneers and had to do , at times , some rather ruthless clearing . If the Pilgrims had been welfare workers , our lands would still belong to the Indians . But many thoughtful men and women who have no axes to grind , seriously question both the courage and the ability of the mine run of those who manage our larger corporations and financial institutions . Those who are less thoughtful and who like the sensational , question their honesty . The widespread and growing opinion is that the main faults of business management today are due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or banker appointees who have little or no financial stake in the corporations and that they eloet officers who agree to be puppets , satisfied to bank their salary checks . Many fear that these directorates , by controlling the elections and the voting rights of the stockholders , will use this control to perpetuate themselves and create a managerial dynasty . It is pointed out that the great automobile and chemical companies  --  which are directed by men with large stock interests in their // own corn panies  --  eamo through the depression with much better records than the concerns directed by men with only nominal stakes in the properties they were supposed to manage . This line of argument is very plausible until one examines what actually happened during the depression , whereupon it appears that all the lines having to do with supplying the vital needs of consumers fared very much better than the lines having to do with durable goods , such as houses and machinery . For instance , the machine-tool industry is largely made up of rather small units managed by their solo or principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average ability . But the machine-tool industry not only hit bottom but almost went dead . The two largest disasters of the depression came to men of great ability who had staked their all in the concerns which they overextended  --  that is , the Insulls and the Van Sweringens . Each depression has its own particular pattern , and slackness does not fall upon all lines of business evenly . Some sections of business go down quickly , others slowly , and still others very slowly . No two recessions and recoveries have precisely the same pattern , but we know that , in the depression from which we are now recovering , some units in some lines did well while their fellows were doing very badly . For instance , the big chain stores , and especially the food chains , were not so much affected as the small , owner-managed retail concerns , but in steel the situation was reversed and the little fellows did better than the big ones . You can take any text and , by a careful selection of data , compose a persuasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Professors Berle and Means , of Columbia University , published a book which had considerable influence and to which the passage of the present laws regulating the issue and sales of securities may directly be traced . The authors found that the corporate business of the country was rapidly drifting into the control of those who did not own it . Everyone by now knows at least something of the financial acrobatics by which speculators , pyramiding on a shoestring , have secured the control of the investing of many millions of dollars , and sometimes the actual stock control of conservative corporations engaged in producing goods or services . No one defends this kind of control , which lodges the ultimate management in men who can not possibly know what it is all about . The corporate control we are talking about is something quite different and has nothing at all to do with investment trusts or stock-market operations . Most corporations begin life with a comparatively small list of heavy stockholders , centering in a dominant stockholder who , to all intents and purposes , owns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the original stockholders die or sellout , and their holdings are split up into small blocks . For instance , the common and the preferred stock of the United States Steel Corporation , after thirty-six years , is now in the bands of more than 200,000 holders , of whom nearly half are women . The average holding is around fifty shares , with about 70 per cent of the holders owning less than twenty-five shares each . Even a small family corporation , unless trusts are established or some member is rich enough to buy out his relatives , will , within twenty-five years , split into a number of tiny holdings . Stockholders do not attend annual meetings . If they did , another problem would be presented , for no enclosure in the country is big enough for crowds of the size that would assemble , nor would anyone know how to turn several hundred thousand people into a deliberative body . Corporate elections are by proxies , mailed out by the management and at the expense of the corporation . Any stockholder who opposes the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he must pay for the printing and mailing , and this , in a large corporation , will cost anywhere from $5000 to $15,000 . A group of stockholders who want to put on a knock-down-anddrag-out fight with the management of any large corporation must be ready to spend at least $50,000 . That lets out the small stockholder , and so , if dissatisfied , he simply sells his stock , takes his loss and calls it a day . No way has yet been devised for the application of more than the forms of democracy to the relation of stockholders to large corporations . This applies also to the mutual-insurance companies , to co-operative societies and to labor unions . The New England town-meeting plan , as applied to corporations or large societies , simply will not . work . The . Alm  --  The Best Man in the Job To all intents and purposes , the managements of the large corporations , including the railroads and the mutual-insurance companies , are self-perpetuating . The implication is that a self-perpetuating management shuts off opportunity to capable young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of the democratic process  --  a really open election  --  would give better results . Would frequent changes of management necessarily be for the better ? The city-manager idea in government represents an effort to get away from the very principle which some advocate for corporations . The oldest form of government in the world is that of the Roman Catholic Church . The Pope appoints the cardinals , and the College of Cardinals , by secret ballot , fills vacancies in the Papacy . Thus the management of the Church is self-perpetuating . But no one contends that this lessens opportunity ; the life records of the Popes and the cardinals disclose that they rose by virtue of ability and not by reason of influence . So it may well he that the absence of democratic forms does not often bar opportunity . Our real interest is in seeing that the best men get where they belong . Everyone agrees that we do not want royal families ruling corporations they do not own , and for their private ends . What is the situation ? There are advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind , to general elections in business . If a corporate management had to spend part . of each year electioneering , business would have to be neglected . Indeed , the officers of some of the cooperative societies and labor unions rate the care of their political machines for getting re-elected as Item 1 of each day 's business . The Securities and Exchange Commission has tackled one phase of the problem of corporate directors and officers . It not only supervises the stock holdings of directors and officers but also publishes the changes in their holdings in order to prevent them from using their positions to play the stock market . During 1936 , the SEC issued an official summary of the holdings of officers , directors and principal stockholders  --  that is , holders of 10 per cent or more  --  of the 1736 corporations whose stocks are listed on national securities exchanges . Many important corporations do not list their stocks on the exchanges , while few small or medium-sized concerns bother about listing , so the summary by no means represented all of American business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations the holdings of the directors and officers were negligible , but that in most of the corporations after the first flight , there was a predominating ownership which had the responsibility of management . Striking exceptions to the general rule of large companies were General Motors , in which the officers had , directly and indirectly , very large holdings , and the du Pont and Swift companies , which are still essentially family concerns . An analysis of the report disclosed that , out of 2,054,000,000 shares listed by all the companies , the officers and large holders had 430,000,000 shares , or 21 per cent . The average means nothing except to show that corporate management as a whole is most certainly not without a stake in what it manages . The report was expected to create a sensation , but it fell flat .. Like the publication of officers ' salaries , it caused some internal troubles in the corporations and stirred up office politics . Also it aroused resentment among the executives of the highest character and ability . One of the most capable presidents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . It was rumored that he resigned because he did not want his salary revealed . That is true . But not in the way the gossips imagined , because he had not taken any salary for several years . Instead of stimulating officers to invest in their corporations , the result has been exactly the reverse . No man cares to make an investment that must be publicly reported . As one chairman said to me : " They have made it so that a man just ca n't invest in his own company . He is more likely to invest in the stock of a competitor , for a man of experience knows the affairs of his competitors about as well as his own . " An Evil Largely Imaginary Preventing corporate managements from using their positions to speculate in their stocks is a problem that exists less actually than in the mind of the kind of reformer who starts with the assumption that all men are wicked . There is a professional-gambler type who believes that he knows too much to work . Ho plays the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type has an infinite number of varieties . Some are full-time and others are only partetime gamblers . Now and again , one of these men finds himself in a position where he can manipulate an investment trust or a company . Then he runs riot . I recall one old family concern which the heirs tried to sell out because none of them wanted to bother with management . By a queer break , a bunch of financial racketeers got control . They made themselves officers and took possession . As their first net of management , they threw a big party in the offices on corporate funds . The party lasted a week . And so did the new management  --  for by that time the real owners learned what was going on and , with the aid of the courts , very literally threw out the racketeers . That sort of thing happens , though only the small corporation is so easily captured . Criminals get into financial circles just as they get into clerical circles . Some respectable corporate managers will yield to an inherent passion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in both cases , the number is negligible . During the stock-market boom , many corporate officers got on the band wagon and bought heavily of their own and other stocks on margin . When the drop came , these men thought they could stem the tide by supporting their own stocks . They did this partly to save themselves , but more to save their associates , who could not afford to put up more margins . These men were long on what they considered sportsmanship . They all lost heavily and sonic lost their all . Today more than one man , keeping up a front in an important position , is hopelessly in debt . and spiritually broken . But I know of only one case where an important corporate officer went short on his own stock and profited by disaster . That man today holds no offices and sits alone in his clubs . Corporate officers are less likely than ever today to speculate in their own or any other stocks . Few corporate officers can , on their salaries , make adequate provision for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenses incident to prominence . the amount left over from a 5:50,000 or 5100,000 a year salary is what sticks to the rungs of the ladder . The complaint that officers and directors have power without the responsibilities of ownership is , on the Government facts as above given , premature . But , on the present scale of income and inheritance taxes , it is inevitable that men will not , in the near future , own what they manage . It is curious that those who complain the loudest against large fortunes are the same people who complain that officers and directors do not own enough of what they manage . **27;1153;TOOLONG h The fiction persists that great corporations are just a way by which the very wealthy get wealthier . That is soap-box stuff . In fact , great corporations are tending to be simply savings institutions in which people of moderate means put their savings , just as in savings banks . A corporation engaged in business receives savings and , in return , issues stocks and bonds as evidences of ownership , where a savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the money into land , bu ildings , machinery and supplies , hires mon and tries to make and sell , or just sell , something for more than cost  --  part of the cost being the upkeep of the tools , machinery and other facilities that represent the savings or investors . The directors are charged with the management of the property that belongs to the shareholders . They are , in effect , trustees and they must elect the higher managerial officers . These officers , in turn , appoint their assistants , and so on down the line to the wage earners . At no point can the supposed distinction between labor and capital be flatly made . The directors represent the owners of the savings , but the managers are in the same boat with the manual workers as hired men . The managers may also be owners of stock , but so also may be the workers . " Consumers " do not exist as a separate class  --  we are all consumers . That is the theoretical setup of the large corporation which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be kept in mind that at least 90 per cent of all the corporations doing business are still managed or controlled by the principal owners , and the board of directors exists only because the law insists that every corporation must have one . Such corporations are managed no more formally than a country store , and the directors meet merely to comply with the law . All the large corporations began as little concerns , or as consolidations of what once were little concerns . United States Steel and General Electric came into the world large , but all their component companies either started from scratch , in the manner of the Carnegie Steel Company , or were consolidations of companies that . had started from scratch . Thus , there is seldom a definite break between owner management and ownerless management . The process is very gradual . Take the A. T. &; T. , which is about the largest of our companies . This was put together by Theodore N. Vail , who saw that the telephone could not be truly useful without a national application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan &; Company , realized his life 's dream . The company was his idea and his company , although actually he owned comparatively little of it . Among the young men he took into his organization was Walter Gifford , and Mr. Gifford eventually became the natural man to succeed him . When Generalities Delude That corporation has grown with the country , and no one could be rich enough really to own it . The board of directors contains a number of bankers , and its securities have been put out by one firm . It is considered ordinary business prudence for a corporation to stay with one firm of bankers as long as the bankers give good service , and for exactly the same reason as it is considered prudent practice to stay with one firm of lawyers . But to say that the presence of bankers on a board means banker control is no more accurate than to say that the presence of lawyers on a board means lawyer control . It all gets down to cases and to personalities . Walter Chrysler , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dodge Brothers , but no one ever accused Mr. Chrysler of being controlled by anybody . There are bankers and bankers , just as there are lawyers and lawyers , and it is quite as ridiculous to assume that a banker 's advice must always be against ? the public interest as it is to assume that a lawyer 's advice must always be again t the public interest , As a matter of plain fact , the sort of man who can be absolutely controlled by either bankers or lawyers can not last long as the head of any considerable corporation , for he can not command the respect of his colleagues  --  and that is a prelude to chaos . All of which assumes that directorships and high executive positions are as much sought after , and are as easy to fill , as political jobs . The political mind looks at all salaried jobs as " plums . " and a man who gets a ten or fifteen thousand dollar political job is expected to regard himself as very lucky , and under complete obligation to whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the higher circles of the business world . Once upon a time , the honor of being a director of a great corporation was enough to attract most mon , but today the kind of men who would be of value to a board see no reason why they should give their time and experience in exchange for trifling directors ' fees and the prospect of being held to a big liability , if the corporation be mismanaged . That is why boards are tending more and more to be made up of officers of the corporation , of bankers and of lawyers  --  that is , of people who have a direct pecuniary interest . It is equally hard to get . men to fill high and responsible corporate executive jobs . The day may be coming when men with experience and common sense enough to fill really important positions , will refuse , because of t his experience and common sense , to take these positions . I would say that half or more of the executives of the great corporations of the country would quit their jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the bull by the tail and cannot. let go . The supposedly high salaries do not mean anything , because , after income taxes are paid , high salaries look like top hats that have been sat on . Some salaries are utterly exorbitant . There is no question about that . However , these salaries are not really paid to the men who sign the vouchers for them . They are largely paid to the Government . In order to give a man a net salary of $100,000 a year , he must be paid a gross figure that is out of reason . I happen to know one man who receives a salary of $40,000 a year and has an income from dividends of his company in excess of $1,000,000 a year . By an extraordinary set of tax circumstances , his net income is only a little more than $100,000 a year , but he is expected to contribute to charities and to maintain a living scale commensurate with the million a year he is supposed to get .. The delights of high salaries are not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Man Worth ? A sentiment exists in many quarters that there should be a limit on salaries , and that around $25,000 a year is as much as any man is worth . The worth of the services of any man , it may be pointed out , is a question that no one can settle . But it is a fact that. , if corporate salaries are limited by law to a low figure , men of ability can earn at least that figure in private pursuits , without having the responsibility of directing property that belongs to others . Limiting salaries would certainly bring a change in the character of corporate management , but the change would not be for the better . Russia has a grand exhibit of low official salaries , but the perquisites that go with the offices are such that the salaries do not matter . Low salaries , in public business , are great breeders of perquisites . Perhaps they would make for the same lack of frankness in private business . Now as to the royal-family angle . The transition from owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the A. T. &; T. , as a rule , gradual . If a banking firm helped in the original financing , members of that banking firm would , as a matter of course , become members of the original board . The larger banking firms do not die , and so they will continue to have representatives on a board of directors long after all of the organizers are dead . The representation may be to look after new financing , or to protect the interests of those who bought the earlier securities , or both . The banking firm will , in the course of time , have only slight holdings of the company 's securities , for bankers must turn over their stocks of goods just as any other merchandisers . There will come a day in the life of every old and large corporation when the only continuous link with the past is in the representatives of the banking firm . This connection may be desirable and profitable to the banking firm , hut , since a banker profits in business only by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stay with a property , regardless . A third generation of the Morgan family is now on the board of United States Steel , but the connection means nothing in dollars and cents . The Passing of Heirs uipparent Securing a company 's bank deposits was once a good reason for a banker being on a board , but in these days the large banks can not lend the money they already have . The banking representatives may , by default. , find themselves forced to pick new top executives . Other things being equal , they will pick their friends , but their friends are apt to he rich men and , for the reaSons given above , rich and capable men do not want jobs . Today  --  i t may be news to many  --  the country is being combed for men between thirty-five and fifty years old who have records that would justify offering them sizable jobs leading into more sizable jobs . That is one reason why canny young men try to land Washington jobs , for in these days that is the quickest way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistants . A cynic would suspect some of these men of being radical only to be noticed . There is no longer any royal-family stuff about appointments in business . Competition is too keen for that : here and there , somebody 's son may have a sinecure because he is somebody 's son . That is more likely to happen in closely than in widely held corporations . Some of the selections for higher offices turn out to be duds . That is inevitable . But . it can be put down as a fact that the selections represent the best judgment of the selectors and that effete circles are not given the preference . One of the most radical of the New Deal lawyers has had several corporate jobs offered to him  --  not to quell his radicalism but because he seemed to have ability . The corporate executives of the country may or may not represent the best brains of the country . But no one has as yet found a way of bettering the average . That the problem gives concern to responsible men is shown by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to the question of why corporate officers are in general so unpopular and why they so often seem to act like bewildered sheep . No one can give a pat answer to that question . Perhaps this statement comes near the mark . It was made to me by a man of wealth , experience and reputation . Ho said : " I am not an orator , but I think I know something of my business and also I think I have kept a fair balance between the interests of my stockholders , the employees and the public that supports all of us . The stockholders have had reasonable dividends , the workers have had fair wages on an increasing scale , and the public has had fair prices on a decreasing scale . I find that I am a public enemy , or at least I am denounced by some labor loaders and by some politicians as having all those attributes which go to make up a public enemy . " None of the men who denounce me has any facts or any responsibility . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have responsibilities and , anyway , I have neither the desire nor the ability to go on the soap box . Even if I did , it would not matter . For I am mostly accused of things I never did or even heard of . The way is always open to shorten hours and raise wages . That would make me a hero . But I would also have to raise selling prices , and that would cut down our sales and turn the high wages and short hours into fake benefices . I do not want to be a fourflusher . I would rather be a public enemy . " This man was trying to say that his corporation had been drawn into the political arena and that he was being expected to run it and at the same time be , in effect , the leader of a little political party . He knew business , but he did not know how to resist political attacks disguised as economic theories . Most politicians are lawyers , and in order to meet them in public forums , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while ago  --  say in 1929 ? all bankers and corporate heads were wonder men  --  and many of them gracefully acknowledged that they were . Now the pendulum has swung . But the men of 1937 are much the same sort of men who performed in 1929 . May it not be that the human deflating of recent years is only a reaction to the human inflating of the boom ? The quality of business and banking executives can be improved . So can the quality of all the human beings who go to make up our nation . But can the improvements be brought about by law ? The quality of Government service scarcely makes a case for governmental supervision of the ability of corporate executives . Might it not be more to the point to develop standards of ethics ? Few men cheat at cards . But that is not because of the law . There is no law against cheating at cards .
