txt Seventeen thousand jobless men , needed to help roll back the thick cover of snow thrown over New York by Saturday 's near-bli77ard , found themselves assured of at least two day 's wages yesterday , when they were put to work as emergency street cleaners in all parts of the city . Thousands of applicants for snowremoval jobs were turned away at the street-cleaning stations of the Sanitation Commission . At 328 East Ninetysixth Street nearly 2,000 men gathered . Learning that only eighty-one could be employed , the men struggled for preferred places in the waiting lino until a police emergency squad was called to restore order . An additional 3,000 men were given temporary jobs on the night shift last night , and it was estimated that 2,000 more got jobs from private snow-removal contractors . The 17 , - 000 who were put on yesterday were ordered to report again at 6 o'clock this morning for another day 's work . The total force at work on the streets yesterday , including about 19 , - 000 regular city employes , was 36,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sanitation Commission . The snow-removal bill to be presented to the city , he estimated , would be $500,000 . The Weather Forecast . No more snow is in immediate prospect , the Weather Bureau said last night . It predicted that today would be cloudy and slightly warmer . The temperature yesterday ranged from 18 degrees at 8:10 A. M. to 33 at 2:10 P. M. and the average was 26 , eight degrees below normal for Dec. 18 . One death , that of a hunter in Warren County , N. J. , was attributed to the storm , while the fate of seven men on an oil barge which left Philadelphia Friday for Quincy , Mass. , was still uncertain . The Coast Guard had vainly sought the barge , but it was believed it might be safe in some isolated cove . Many minor accidents were reported on the slippery streets and among the thousands of children coasting and skating . Ice was threatening to block the Hudson River to navigation at the earliest date in years , The Associated Press reported . A tug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krum Elbow and the Coast Guard planned to go to its assistance today . At Albany the ice was four inches thick , but nevertheless two ocean vessels and two night steamers made ready to try to get through . The Hudson is not ordinarily closed by ice until January . Despite the heavy snow , there was considerable flying at Curtiss and Roosevelt Fields yesterday , although the pilots had to be on the alert in taking off or landing lest they run into drifts . 50,000 Go to Coney Island . By way of contrast with the efforts of the shovelers , 50,000 persons took advantage of the bright sunshine which followed Saturday 's storm to journey to Coney Island . Other thousands made use of the railroads and of automobiles to journey out of the city , notwithstanding the difficulty of travel . The railroads reported their business heavy enough so that the lateness of a small number of their trains was attributed to the holiday traffic rather than to the storm . As for the Coney Island visitors , most of them congregated upon the Boardwalk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iceberg Athletic Club tiptoe out for a dip , in accordance with the rules of that organization . The slow rise of the temperature during the day softened the snow sufficiently to aid the removal force and to make the footing damp for those persons who determined to take their holiday despite the weather . Because Saturday 's downfall of white totaled 6.8 inches , the streetcleaning bureau found itself confronted for the first time in two years with a major snow removal problem .. Last Winter 's snowfall was so slight that the cost of removing it amounted to only a few thousand dollars , said John Donlan , secretary to the commission . In the previous Winter there was a greater need for removal , the bill being $1,359,036 . All these totals were topped , however , by the figures for the Winter ' of 1925-26 , when the costs of snow removal amounted to $4,405,839 . Schroeder Up All Night . The attack upon the accumulations of the present storm began Saturday night , when the downfall was still in progress . Commissioner Schroeder , who spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directing the opening stages of the work , said yesterday that the Sanitation Commission was particularly desirous of clearing the principal downtown streets so that there might be as little impediment as possible to Christmas buying . In the early work , because of the difficulty of notifying the unemployed men to whom jobs were given later , the removal on business streets was carried out by Sanitation Commission trucks and sweepers , manned by their regular personnel , who will on that account receive an overtime allowance . The word to hire emergency laborers was sent out in the early morning and definite allotments were made for each of the 226 stations maintained by the commission . Pay was fixed at 50 cents an hour and it was announced that the emergency workers would be allowed to remain on the job up to ten hours . On this basis it was estimated that between $80,000 and $100,000 would be passed on to the men provided with jobs on yesterday 's day and night shifts . Of the 19.000 regular employes about 15,000 were sweepers , drivers and mechanics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sewer departments of the various Borough Presidents ' offices , and the others were checkers and the like from other city departments . 3,400 Trucks Attack Snow . About 2,000 street-cleaning trucks were engaged in the work , in addition to those supplied by 1,400 contractors . The function of the departmental workers in most districts was to pile the snow at the sides of the roadway , from which point it was dumped down the nearest sewer or trucked to the East and North Rivers . The removal made extra work also for the Police Department , since patrolmen were assigned to each of the street-cleaning stations . Two patrolmen were on duty at the East Ninety-sixth Street station when the disorder occurred there , but found themselves unable to check it unaided . Jerry Murphy , foreman in charge at that station , which is one door west of Second Avenue on the south side of the street , said that the job seekers had not attempted to riot ; their only motive had been to get work . About 1,000 men had gathered in the street before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the work of hiring began , 2,000 were present and had broken their lines and were swarming in front of the station in an effort to reach the door . In one or two instances , commotions near the door indicated that men were fighting for places in line . Finally , the East 104th Street Police Station was notified , after the pressure of the crowd had cracked a window , and the emergency truck attached to that precinct was sent to the scene to help restore order . No arrests and no injuries were reported . Since the main object of the streetcleaning bureau was to clear the principal traffic lanes , the majority of the workers , emergency and regular , were concentrated in Manhattan and Brooklyn . In the latter borough , 9,000 of the emergency workers were concentrated , and it was announced that a considerable part of the night shift would be sent there also . It was estimated that about 2,000 of the jobless had found employment in the Bronx and 2,000 in Queens , and that the remainder were employed in Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of removal would slacken after today , although diminished forces might he kept in outlying sections . CROWDS FROLIC IN THE SNOW . Many Children Hurt in Sled Mishaps and Adults in Falls on Icy Walks . Gleefully taking advantage of the first heavy snowfall in two years , thousands of children in the city and its suburbs brought out skates , sleds or skiis yesterday ; built snow men and snow huts , or even on occasion joined forces in old-fashioned snowball battles . Many grown-ups joined them in taking advantage of the skating in the city parks or on ponds and lakes in the suburban areas . It was the best day for Winter sports that the metropolitan district had known in several years . Minor accidents were numerous as children recklessly played with their sleds in city streets were hurt while sledding , although all were able to go home after first-aid treatment . Henning Heinz , 11 years old , was cut about the right eye and cheek ; John Ryan , 15 , suffered a laceration of the scalp ; Mary Carroll , 16 , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis , 11 , of 310 EaBt Thirty-seectud , Strget , gut big eye , and Edward Noonan , 17 , of 201 East Sixty-eighth Street , was shaken when his sled hit another in the Central Park accidents . John Legg , 14 , of 41 Lincoln Place , Brooklyn , suffered a leg injury when the sled on which he was coasting down Lookout Hill in Prospect Park hit a tree . He was taken to Kings County Hospital , where his condition was said to be serious . Mrs. Anna Tafter of 647 Winthrop Street , Brooklyn , fell at Albany Avenue and Rutland Road , suffering a laceration of the right knee , for which she was treated by an ambulance surgeon and sent home . Mrs. Minnie Berman , 68 , of 1,479 East New York Avenue , Brooklyn , fell in front of her home , breaking her right arm , and was taken to Trinity Hospital .

Her left ankle may be fractured . In still another Brooklyn accident , Abraham Fine , 35 , of 605 Vermont Street , fell at Livonia and New Jersey Avenues and was taken to Trinity Hospital with a broken left leg .
