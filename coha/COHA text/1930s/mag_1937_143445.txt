Great sport was made in the House of Commons last week by humorist A. P. Herbert , M. P. of the Population Bill introduced by Minister of Health Sir Kingsley Wood . According to Sir Kingsley , one of the " Big Six " of the Cabinet ( Chamberlain , Hoare , Simon , Hailsham , Inskip &; Wood ) , the United Kingdom is ceasing at such an alarming rate to bear children that its population will have dropped from 44,000,000 to 5,000,000 in 100 years . <P> " I think I have ceased to breed ! " announced Humorist Herbert , 47 , father of four . " But no one is going to ask me about that . The questions which census agents are to ask from door to door under this Nosey Parker bill are an insult to the nation 's women ! " <P> MrMr . Herbert , famed for his verse contributions to Punch , next delighted the House with these especially written lines : <P> They pulled down all the houses where the children used to crowd , <P> And built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> And if the father got a job there was n't anywhere to dwell <P> And everybody wondered why the population fell ! <P> Abroad to show that everyone was passionate for peace , <P> All children under seven joined army or police . <P> The babies studied musketry while mother filled a shell- <P> And everybody wondered why the population fell ! <P> The world , in short , which never was extravagantly sane <P> Developed all signs of inflammation of the brain , <P> The past was not encouraging , the future none could tell , <P> But the minister still wondered why the population fell ! <P> The best way to stimulate a British husband and wife to breed , Humorist Herbert gravely advised , is for His Majesty 's Government to provide likely couples with free holidays at the seaside . This drew guffaws , but dapper , dynamic Sir Kingsley Wood easily shoved his bill through second reading 197-to-125 . To get the statistics wanted by the Ministry of Health , he declared , is now " a matter too urgent to await the census of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will either be slamming their doors against Nosey Parkers or taking these Ministry of Health bell-pushers into their parlors and their confidence . <P> British editors , rallying to potent Sir Kingsley Wood , rebuked Humorist Herbert for " misrepresentations , " " distortion " and " questionable levity . " He replied with a letter to the London Times , arguing : " If more plain language were used , there would be less bad legislation . It shocks no one to have the Government census taker say ' Other issue and marriage condition of father and mother where the father of the child is a person other than present or a former spouse ? ' But what this means in plain language is : 1 ) ' Have you had any other illegitimate children ? ' 2 ) ' Are you married-that is , have you committed adultery ? ' 3 ) ' Has the father committed adultery ? ' <P> " I am sir your servant , but regretfully not so obedient as usual . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
