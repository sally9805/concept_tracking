UNIVERSITY senior in tears is not a pleasant sight , especially if the senior happens to be a man . John Helding had been through an emotional strain of real magnitude , for the simple reason that he had just " busted up " with a girl , also a senior , with whom he had been going since be was a freshman . I knew him pretty well , and saw him going along near the campus on a fine autumn evening , full harvest moon , floating clouds , with the tang of leaf smoke in the air . I hailed him and asked him if he wanted a ride to wherever he was going . He hesitated and then got into the car . He did n't say much , but very soon I noticed him wipe his eyes with his handkerchief . I did n't question him , for I knew he would say anything he wanted to when he felt like it . I drove the long way to where he was going , and he told me sketchily what had happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after a good night 's sleep things would look better in the morning . He said he doubted if he 'd have a very good night 's sleep . The reason was that he was living as a watchman in a building , and though his bed had springs , it had no mattress ; just an old cotton blanket , and that was all . That was another matter . Here was a student of the depression , one of the kind you read about and hear rumors about and have a hard time to find . I asked him why he did n't go with me to the student hospital and get a good rest . He demurred on the ground that his underwear was so ragged that he would be ashamed to undress in the hospital . A little fast talking took care of that , though , and in half an hour he was registered in the hospital , had had a hot bath , and was tucked in , sound asleep , dead to the world of his troubles , thanks to a little sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped with human kindness , common sense and tacit understanding . The next day , after a good rest , he was feeling better . The sleep had helped , as had a good breakfast . He told me that his meals had not been any too regular , either in quality or quantity , and though he was not , suffering from lack of food , he could take a good breakfast without any trouble . Well , the long and short of it was that by noon we had secured him a mattress and some blankets for his spring bed , a little cash to buy some much-needed underclothing , and , most important , had him placed in a job which would give him a regular income which would enable him to eat and have the clothes that he needed . John Holding is a fictitious name , of course . But John Helding 's situation is a real one that has happened U during this college year on tho campus of a big university . Now do n't get the idea that all colleges and universities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time how students are living on crusts of bread , in garrets , without sufficient , clothing to keep them warm , without any of the comforts of ordinary life . Faculty men are always getting worked up about the " hundreds of students " who are in actual want . Uplifting societies are regularly meeting to sympathize with the poor overworked students suffering from the depression . Kind-hearted and well-meaning townspeople are always getting excited about the students " starving on our very doorsteps . " A Collegiate First.Ald Station S OME of our faculty people became so excited about the critical condition of our students , " dozens of them , " last winter that the president of the university appointed a special welfare committee to serve as a clearing house for eases of real need  --  lack of clothes , lack of food and inadequate living quarters . There was a good deal of ballyhoo about the appointment of the committee , and the fact was well advertised that . I was the chairman , and that anyone knowing of students who were in actual want should report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that relief measures could be undertaken at once . We talked a lot , printed a lot , and got ourselves generally into the press and the public mind as a special relief agency to help students who were in want . After a week , a professor came to me to say that he believed that Harold Smith was a student who should be looked into as a possible candidate for our welfare work . I called Harold , and found him dressed , not well but warmly . Ho was married . Yes , it was true that they lived in a very small place one room , and an alcove for a kitcheu . They shared the bathroom with another family . Yes , it was also true that they were expecting a baby . Yes , they were having a tough time . But , " No , we do n't need any special help ; at least not yet . We may need some when the baby comes , but with the food supplies that we get from our folks down in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to explain that they had talked it over with the folks , and decided that his wife would be better off in the warm little apartment than she would staying down on the farm with her folks , whore there were no conveniences and lots more work to do . And they were both happier . The committee did help Harold some . We found a couple of faculty wives who made a layette for Mrs. Smith  --  fixed her up a big clothes basket with some Ilue ribbon and silk in it  --  and when the baby came , she was all equipped to take care of it . I " sponged " a secondhand carriage for the baby a little later . One of our doctor friends agreed to take care of the mother and baby on the basis that he would be paid eventually . And four months after I originally saw Harold , he came in and borrowed twenty-five dollars , ten of it to join Tau Beta Pi , which is the Phi Beta Kappa of the engineers , and fifteen for some special baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold graduated in June of last year . Three days after that , another professor told me that there was a girl in one of his classes who had been wearing a coat to class which was obviously unsuitable for winter weather . We called her in , and , sure enough , the coat was a lightweight affair and she looked cold . She 'd been wearing it until she had time to cut down a heavier coat which had been given to her by a kind friend . One of the women over in the home-economics department agreed that if this girl would bring the coat to her and have a fitting or two , she would get the work done for her . In two days the girl had a winter coat suitable for any kind of bad weather . She was earning her room and board , so there was nothing to worry about from that angle . You do n't have to believe it if you prefer not to , but that was the end of the reports that we had from either students , faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . Not another report came in , and no report ever came from any of the people who called on the president to tell him about the " dozens and dozens of cases " in:actual wan t . I said not to get the idea that we are loaded down with John Heldings . Do n't get the idea , frein these examples , that we are without instances where there is actual need . But do n't get the idea that colleges and universities are sitting idle , waiting for them to be brought to them . They are cropping up all the time and we are constantly looking into and after cases where help is needed . But the routine for such aid was set up long ago , and with the depression it simply meant an increase in the total number ; otherwise , the routine was about the same , and it 's all in the work of the day . A Hard  --  Times Questionnaire DEOPLE like to ask questions about students . They I like to know what they are doing and how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place where I go these days , away from the campus , someone wants to know the effect of the last few years on the college students , on their points of view and on their morale . Are they discouraged and hopeless ? Are many of them starving or going about in rags ? Do many of them live by barter ? how many are on relief ? Are there many suicides among them ? Have mental irregularities increased ? What do I think of the FERA ? Have most of the fraternities folded up silently and disappeared ? Will football ever be as it was ten years ago ? How many students do we have DOW , and are there enough left to keep the university going ? These and many others , some sensible and some asinine , are always being asked when one gets away from the campus . Well , at least people are interested , or they would n't ask questions . Certainly there are enough students left to keep the colleges and universities operating . Along in the fat years of 1927 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories . The slump began about that time , when freshman classes began to decrease . A few wabbled and showed spasmodic increases , but the general trend was toward reduced registrations . By the time 1933 and 1934 had come , most of the colleges and universities had gone to levels which were discouragingly low . But the registrations in the fall of 1934 showed a general upturn . I entered the university in the fall of 1918 , the famous S. A. T. C. year , which was said , in many institutions , to bare produced the dumbest lot of students which ever congregated around centers of learning . That year our registration of more than five thousand students was an almost impossible figure ; so large that the institution was swamped and the faculty scarcely knew what to do with the crowd . Within twelve years that figure had more than doubled , and the drop to around eight thousand undergraduates in the leanest years seemed , when falling , like a terrible decline . Yet it was three thousand more than the figure which , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no need to worry about the number of students who are in the colleges and institutions . Better spend your time worrying about what is going to become of them after they graduate . What has happened to the cost of living in a college community during this period ? The two major items in living costs are board and room . In the heyest of the hey-hey days , the best rooms rented for about fifteen or sixteen dollars a month a man . Board at that time cost about thirty-five to forty dollars a month . Fifty dollars a month was a fair price for room and board . Less than a year ago , I saw a sign on a pretty decent rooming house which said " Room and board , eighteen dollars and fifty cents a month , with twenty meals a week . " That is a real drop , and was the lowest figure I ever saw for room and board , although there were a good many places offering room and hoard for from twenty to twenty-five dollars a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually down , but a more important one was that competition was a lot keener among the rooming and boarding house keepers . A community which has easily housed and fed cloven thousand students finds a slump of three thousand leaving a lot of rooms vacant and a lot of empty chairs at boarding-house tables . Consequently , competition drove the prices down to the levels of thirty and forty years ago , when sixteen dollars a month for room and board was a fancy price . This year , prices are up a little . It is a little harder to go out and find a landlady who is offering her rooms at ten dollars , and , when you say you 'll pay five , have her say : " All right , you can have it . " They might come down from ten to eight , or even seven-fifty , but not often will they cut to five . A year ago , a lot of them would and did . And hoard is up a little bit too . The better places charge about twenty-five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a week . You can get a fair place for both room and board for thirty dollars a month , and the lowest price I have seen advertised this year is twenty-two dollars for both . These pastyears ha ve taught a good many men something that they did n o t expect to learn in college , and which may make a lot of wives happy in the future . It may make some of them unhappy , too , due to criticism . A good many college men have learned how to cook , and some of them are real experts at the art . We have regulations about students living in apartments , and do n't let them do it without some responsible person sponsoring them . But we have approved quite a number of small groups who have taken apartments . They pool their cash , buy groceries and cook their own meals . It is surprising just how expert some of them have become . Bachelors of Culinary Arts F OUR young fellows  --  one freshman , one sopho-more and two seniors  --  invited me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a small apartment , not very big for four good-sized men , but big enough if you are willing to overlook certain features . They paid twenty dollars a month for the rent , or five dollars each . Our dinner was all right . One of the seniors was the cook , and he had prepared a dinner with a roast and vegetables which smelled good . looked good and was good . His roast was really excellent , and he topped it off with a peach pie which he had made himself . The pie was a little disappointing to him , he said ; he 'd made better ; but I 've eaten worse , so that was fair " enough . After dinner , two of the others washed the dishes , and the work was done . They have their assignments of duties , and they told me , and showed me their figures to indicate that they were having very decent meals for an average of about three dollars 's : week for each man . Some claim they do even better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , but I 've never been a guest at their tables and ca n't say as to the quality . They look well fed . The home-economics department was on its toes when this sort of thing began , and provided sample menus for men cooking their own meals , showing minimums of food values and suggestions for variety at very modest costs , and a great many men took advantage of the help . Some of these fellows are going to be able to tell their wives that a little more shortening would have removed that rubbery aspect of the pie crust when they have their own homes . I 've read about students at other institutions camping in tents and living in all sorts of places in order to simplify and reduce their costs . The nearest thing we have bad to that was a group of four men who rented a small house on the outskirts of the town , paying practically nothing for rent , and keeping house there . Two others lived one year iu an auto trailer which they set up on a vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing very spectacular about that . f Con finu  --  d on Pogo 72 ) ( Conelnu  --  d from Page 68 ) She eluded him null min over to the stretcher .

" She looked at him steadily . " But he 's dead ? " " Yes . " " Why did you lie to me ? You 've told me a dozen times he was alive . " " I did n't want to shock you . I was going to tell you tonight . " Her eyes widened . " Why , not an hour ago you said ? " " He sold him , " whispered Adam in a voice like a white-hot wire . " And they came and took him away .

Oh , Ruth , why did n't you tell me ? I could have told you three weeks ago that . he 'd got that reward ! "  --  She turned around to look at him . Trujillo caught the eye of one of the soldiers and his lips formed a command , silent , but unmistakable . The soldier fired . The heap of rags and bones toppled off the stretcher with scarcely a rustle . Ruth sat on the floor and took Adam 's bead in her lap . The hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became blank . The lean , bruised body twitehed , - the thin knees drew up . Then it - waS still . Mark pushed the rags back from it and laid his ear against the ribs , then he gripped the bony wrist to feel the pulse . Ruth watched him with tears rolling down her cheeks . " We can't. do anything more for him , dear . " " Take him away ! " ordered Trujillo . The soldiers went out with the stretcher . Ruth sat on the floor looking at the closed door . Mark lifted her up , sopping her blood-stained skirt with his handkerchief . " Come ! We 've got to hurry ! " Trujillo glanced at the guard , who stepped in front of the door . Mark faced about . " You 've lost her , Trujillo , but you 've still got your job . I should think you 'd want to keep it , after being among the unemployed so long . If you 're wise , you wo n't let anything happen to us between here and that train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands . " , Trujillo bowed with superb , ironic courtesy . " I 've found many charming women in the world , but only one Parazuela . " He wrote a message on a card with steady hand . " This will carry you through , I think , without difficulty . Have you a car ? " " Yes , thank you . " Trujillo raised Ruth 's hand . to his lips , completing the gesture even while she blenched and pulled away . The guard opened the door and closed it behind Ruth and Mark . Trujillo sat down at his desk . " Leave me alone ! " he said to the guard . " Do n't let anyone in here . I must prepare my message for my ministry tonight . I ca n't be disturbed . " His face grew grim and gray . The veins on his forehead stood out . His upper lip pulled down in a thin line , his lower lip grew more prominent . He jerked open his splendid coat . Then he sat with his face on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock struck seven . ? There was a knock at the door . He sat up , buttoned his coat , smoothed his hair before he said " Come in ! " Captain del Valle entered and smiled at him with admiring young eyes . " The ministry- is assembled ; Your Excellency . " " Thank you , - Del Valle . " With Del Valle a respectful step behind him , they passed down the long corridor where men were at work obliterating the scars of last night . He looked straight ahead with inscrutable face , the picture of a strong leader in a national crisis . The doors of a splendid solo with gilt ceiling and walls of dark cinnamon wood and hangings of brocade stiff with tarnished gold threr.d were thrown open . The light from a crystal chandelier fell on the group of men seated about a massive table in chairs with tall backs that rose above their heads . Higuerra , who occupied the first place to the right , next to the vacant chair of Trujillo-Rojas , was the first to spring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's massive chair and he seated himself . There was silence , but for the scraping on the marble floor . He looked around the table and greeted his cabinet with grave for-mality : " We are all Parazuelans about this table for the first time in five years . The day of foreign domination is over . Parazuela for the Parazuelans ! " He paused . " In order to clear myself of any suspicion of American influence , I have justdeported theAmerican woman whom I married during the period of ; my exile . Some of you have known her as Miss Ware .. A beautiful woman . It was my final sacrifice for Parazuela . " A murmur of surprised approbation ran around the table . " She was a most charming woman , " said Gen. Miguel O'Day , " but unmistakably foreign , and of different faith . " " I would not have ventured to suggest such a sacrifice to you , " said Galindo , - " but I have long felt that a Latin-An-ierican alliance  --  say with one of . the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " It was a noble action , " said Echarte feelingly. - His colleagues nodded . Trujillo-Rojas accepted their approval with a bow and indicated that he was ready to take-up business of state . Higuerra , alone looked at him with a fleeting , cynical smile . ? ' ( THE END ) ( There have been some , though , who have had to have help in order to eat . There was one athlete who had so many injuries of a minor character that sent him to the hospital that he was almost a regular boarder . In fact , he was a regular boarder there , for it came out , when we investigated , that about all he was getting to eat was what he received when he was in the hospital . He was too proud to say anything about it , though . That is where the biggest rub comes , for those who are mouthy about their troubles are usually getting by , whereas those in real need say so little about it that they are hard to find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student who needed the money immediately for food , but I made more to students who had money coming from somewhere and wanted to borrow to pay a share on a grocery bill on time . The same thing has been true this year ; only fewer cases . In mentioning John Helding at the outset , I stated that he was ashamed of his underclothing . That suggests clothes and the people who wonder if we have many students running around in rags . I have not seen one yet in genuine rags . I have seen a good many who were wearing inadequate overcoats and jackets on cold days . And I have seen some in zero weather wearing big deep-piled woolens and going bareheaded by choice . A few cases have been suggested where shoes , overcoats , underclothing and similar garments were needed , and all these have been helped either with the garments needed or with loans to provide them . We made quite a number of loans last year to students who had to have clothes of one variety or another . But the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The clothing merchants have told me that last fall 's business was better than it has been for the past five years . I 've mentioned loans a good many times in these paragraphs . What has been happening to the loan funds during the last few years ? One thing is certain : They have been busy . A great deal of money has been borrowed . But here is a. curious thing which has come out of it . A great many do not want to borrow . And if they do , they borrow in as small amounts as possible . Perhaps these years have taught some of them not to borrow . The student from the agricultural community seems to have something of a horror of getting into debt , and there have been times this winter when I have offered loans to students from farm homes which have been definitely rejected . " Nothing doing . I 'm not getting into debt to anybody . " I can not say that we have been able to meet every demand from students that has come to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able to meet the request of every worthy student who asked who qualified under the regulations set around the loan funds . This is one difficulty . Some wo n't borrow , while others will come and borrow when they have money , but want to be sure of having a little more than they need . What is happening in the way of repayments of these loans ? You 'd be surprised . A man told me the other day that he thought it was hopeless to expect students to repay loans now , when there was no chance for them to get work to enable them to repay . Ho just as good as told me I was a liar when I told him that for June . July , August , September and October of 1934 , I had the highest average months on repayments that I have had since I have been handling loans . And the most interesting thing about it is that some of the payments are coming from men who have paid nothing for many months and write in that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting commentary on how these payments are coming. - A year ago , out of ten repayments on students ' loans , nine came in as postal money orders and one was a personal bank check . Last fall , three to four out of ten came in as personal checks on banks . Perhaps that is an indication that banks are being used more than they were a year ago . One thing which has helped the situation a great deal has been the FERA . The FERA is the Federal Emergency Relief Administration , and the FERA around colleges has been the providing of Federal funds to give work to students to enable them to continue in or to return to college . No doubt you have your own ideas about relief of all kinds , and you may have very definite ideas about Federal relief of any kind . I have my own ideas . I sincerely believe that the relief which has been offered to the colleges and universities has been among the most worth while and best administered of all the different plans for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and universities were notified that Federal funds were to be provided through state-relief agencies by which students could be paid for work on projects of a socially desirable character . Funds were allotted to colleges applying for participation , based on the enrollment as of October , 1933 . The allotment for any one institution for a month was based on one-tenth of the registration at that time , multiplied by fifteen dollars . It was assumed that an average earning for a : student should be about fifteen dollars a month , although this amount could go as high as twenty dollars a month . The students to qualify for the work were those who could not continue their ( Continued an Page 74 ) Two etn N'T it make you happier , " too , Mother , if you could confidently say ?

In the fall of 1934 the same plan was followed , except that a slightly larger amount of money was provided , based-. on 12 per cent of the student body instead of 10 . A good deal of latitude was allowed to the local colleges in handling their own funds , except that careful accountings were required . From the administrative standpoint , the men and women in charge of the projects were high-grade individuals , and entirely free from any worries as to misappropriations or mishandling of funds .

All institutions picked the student workers very carefully , and attempted to see that only the worthiest eases were aided . There was a real satisfaction when the Federal funds were made available again for 1934-1935 , for it again meant an opportunity for many students to continue who might otherwise have been forced to drop out . And it undoubtedly brought back to colleges and universities many students who had been out of college or who had been unable to enter . Do n't get the idea that these funds were to be used as loans . There was no suggestion of loaning about their handling ; they were to be used as remuneration for carefully supervised work projects , and generally , I think , have been administered in this manner .

When I was a junior in the university , the tickets for the Junior Prom sold for six dollars . This year they are to sell for two dollars and fifty cents . Will the quality of the prom be seriously affected ? No . It will have all the features of the prom when I attended it as a junior  --  orchestra , decorations , glamour , and so on . The orchestra will be a nationally known one which is heard almost nightly on the radio . And the students will have as good a time as we did when we paid six dollars for our prom . The social programs of the fraternities have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each fraternity had at least four dances a year  --  a formal and three informals .

We had one fraternity in the good old days whose members prided themselves on the fact that , they always had their . formal the night after the prom and always had the prom orchestra for their private dance . Now , that was class . The last time they did it , the orchestra cost them six hundred dollars , not to mention the dinner and the favors , the programs and decorations . It has n't been done since . The next year their formal orchestra , cost them only a ' hendred . Last year they paid seventy-five , for the orchestra .

Dial Dancing The social programs of the fraternities have been greatly reduced in cost , and yet the programs have been more extensive . Now the average house has a formal and perhaps one or two in-formals . The cost of the formal to the individual member is about what the informal used to cost , and the cost of the informal is about the same as that to one of the ; campus ballrooms for a Union dance . But the lean years have ' produced the " radio dance , " a thing unheard of five years ago on the campus . A radio dance is something like this : The boys decide that next Friday night they will have a radio dance . They file a petition for permission to have it , get their chaperons , and then have the party . The couples go to the house , clear the living room of furniture , and dance to radio music . Usually some of the guests can entertain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap dancing , or crooning . Two or three bridge games may be in progress , and the table-tennis table is always busy . There are sandwiches and coffee near the end of the evening , and the party is over . The cost may run as high as two bits per person . Many of the houses have a radio dance each month . Exchange dinners are also popular between fraternities and between fraternities and sororities . The juniors and seniors at my house go to your house , and the freshmen and sophomores from your house come to mine for dinner . Sunday-afternoon teas have always been popular with the sororities , but in the last few years the boys have been stealing the idea to some extent and having Sunday-evening teas at their houses , which really means that you feed her at the fraternity house instead of taking her out and buying the Sunday-evening lunch .

Of the sixty-two houses still operating on this campus , less than half a dozen are in difficulty at the present time on their current indebtedness . Some of these have readjusted their rentals and are retiring old debts on time payments . But they are paying cash as they go and are cleaning up the wreckage of former errors in management . It is an interesting fact that not one of the old guard of fraternities on our campus was included in the fade-out picture . Every one which disappeared was a new , small , or local organization , and the old , substantial groups have come through in reasonably good shape . The pledging program for last fall showed that practically every house was filled when the season was over , which is an encouraging promise for the future . If the wolf and sheriff are at the door now , they are going to find it a long and cold wait in most cases , for the retrenchment programs of the surviving houses have been thorough and forward-looking . Football has been a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The amount of interest in football seems to vary with the condition of the times . In 1925 , I traveled from Urbana to Philadelphia to see Illinois play the University of Pennsylvania at Franklin Field . Most of us went to see the University of Pennsylvania play Red Grange . I had purchased an extra ticket , and found that I did not need it , and turned it in at Urbana on the Wednesday before the game . Out of curiosity , I asked the man who occupied the seat at the game where he got fiis ticket and what he paid for it . He said he had purchased it in Cleveland the day before , Friday , for fifteen dollars . In the last few years there has been no ticket scalping . There has been no need for tickets to be scalped , because you could always get a ticket at the gate just before game time , and usually a fair seat . Crowds dropped off and the public was getting its football by the aerial route . The Return of Pigskin Prosperity However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds began attending all the college games . Some say it is because the game is a better game , with the rules changed as they have been . Perhaps its a better game ; perhaps people have more money to go see the games . At any rate , they are getting there , and crowds at college football games were better last fall than they have been for a number of years . It is n't limited to college football either . In New York City , the largest crowd in five years to witness a professional football game saw the Chicago Bears take the New York Giants in a 10-9 last-minute victory . Mention has been made in the newspapers that liquor seemed to be in evidence at some of the games last fall , and people have been seen drinking in the stands . I have seen some of it , but no more than I saw in the bootlegging days . People are inconsistent . Takethe old grad who waa plastered at every Homecoming during the days of prohibition . He was back this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People ask a good many questions about the liquor situation and its effect on students . Beer came back to us on a Friday . The restaurant owner who was nearest the campus who sold beer told me that he sold seven hundred cases of beer on that first Friday . On Saturday , he sold three hundred cases . On Monday he sold twenty-five cases . Thereafter he sold from five to ten cases a day . When warm weather came , he installed a beer cooling and pumping machine to serve it by the stein . After a week of trial , he had the pump removed and stuck to the bottled product . An official of a near-by university wired me at the end of the first week to find out what we had done to regulate the sale of beer near the campus . We wired back that we bad done nothing . He wrote to me to indicate that he thought we were nutty . We wrote back and explained our stand , and he agreed , after six months , that our system had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootlegger and illegal purveyor . Facing the Repeal Problem Then came the hard liquor . There was an old state law which barred the sale of liquor within four miles of the campus . That law went by the board with all the others . Liquor is sold in the community and any adult can purchase it . The bootleggers are out of the picture , or at least they seem to be . Now get me straight on this : We have about ten thousand students . We know that some of them are going to drink . We regret it , but we know they will . We know that some of them will get into trouble with the law and with university discipline . We know that some will be fired from the university for drinking and intoxication . We also know that the favorite drink before repeal was spiked beer . That was near beer with the neck and an inch in the bottle poured out , filled to the top with alcohol , and then shaken and consumed . We knew that men became seriously ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also knew that men bought liquor from bootleggers at times which knocked them cold as fish and oftentimes left them very sick . We knew that social events were occasionally spoiled by smarties who thought they had to have a little bootleg liquor . Well , since the change we have had about the same number of disciplinary cases involving liquor , with a slight improvement in the last few months . We have had none of the terribly poisoned youngsters who foolishly bought bootleg gin mixed in wash boilers . The fraternity parties and social functions have been freer of liquor than they were before . There is the picture as it is here . I 'm no idealist about the liquor situation . I heard a fellow dean from another university say a few years ago that liquor was no problem at his institution . It was n't . They paid no attention to it . The wettest dance I ever attended was on his campus  --  a class dance . My own observation is that our student body has taken the repeal of prohibition much more sensibly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And from what I can learn , that seems to hold for a good many other colleges and universities . Are these students of the depression hopeless ? Are they discouraged and looking forward to a world without promise ? Have they lost interest ? Are they beginning to take to suicide ? Ours do not seem to be . They do not take much stock in suicide out in this part of the country . Hopeless ? Sometimes yes , but not over the future in general . The hopeless seem to take more of a trend toward hopelessness of passing a particular course , or of getting a particular activity job , or of making Phi Beta Kappa . Of course they become depressed and blue and discouraged , but not from the standpoint of the seeming fact that the world and the country are doomed to eternal perdition . There are too many affairs of the moment to take their time to allow them to become very discouraged about the distant future . Besides , most of them are too busy with their own work to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the idea that they are a shallow , thoughtless group , for they are n't . Last year the department of economics announced a , series of lectures on current economic topics , open to the students of all colleges . The first one was held in a small lecture room seating one hundred people . Next week they moved it to a larger hall seating two hundred and fifty . Then to a larger one seating nearly seven hundred , and after that they had all the rest of the series in the university auditorium , which seats twenty-two hundred . Twentleth.Centary Renaissance That seems to hold for a great many of the lectures and discussions which go on around the campus . A month ago , a distinguished engineer was brought to the campus with some movies of the Boulder Dam project . One of the senior honorary societies sponsored the convocation . The man was a very distinguished gentleman of his profession , and there was some fear that he might not draw a crowd of complimentary size . He did , though , for eighteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently a local professor lectured and showed slides on a last summer 's trip to Norway ; he turned them away " from the lecture room seating three hundred . The plays , concerts , debates , lectures , student meetings and forums all seem to be attracting more students than ever before . It is actually becoming the thing to do to go to some of these worth-while events which are constantly taking place in the college community . Some people say it is because the students are more serious minded . Others say it is because so much world history is being made every day that some of them are keen to find out about it while it is going on . The student daily newspaper has been full of letters from contributors , and tremendous wars of words are waged on the editorial pages . Some of the subjects do n't seem to be very heavy , but what of it ? The argument is the thing , and the Fact that individuals are interested enough to take very definite sides on common and current problems is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown more initiative in the last two years than it has since the war . It has asked why students had so many honorary fraternities and clubs and whether or not the costs were justified . The conclusion was that a good many were not worth their cost . It has united in several worth-while movements in a way that it has not united for years . Thu class elections in the full were the bitterest elections we have had since I have been around here . It has completely revamped its system of student government since September , and already is dissatisfied with what it produced and is trying to make adjustments and changes for a better form . A few of the antitnilitarists are continually stirring up the question of compulsory military training , and to date have not won a single round against the students who feel just as much the other way . The campus religious forums are having the largest attendance in years and the churches near the campus are chock-full on Sundays . The spirit seems to be one of " find out more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college or university seems to be an ideal place to do this thing . The B. R. Rolls Up His Sleeves These students , especially the seniors , worry some over what is to become of them . With the unemployment that we have , they should worry . I have been surprised at the number of last year 's seniors who have been able to find work since graduation . Not all are doing what they expected to do . A good many work in fields far removed from the training which they received . That is not surprising , however , with business men of this day . Last year , one business man who came to the campus to hire twelve seniors asked for men who were good students , who had either taken part in activities or worked their way through , who were honest and well liked by their fellow students . He said he did n't care what college they had been in , for his eoncern would put them through their own training course . We find graduates turning to occupations which , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for graduates . I know a dozen who are operating filling stations , and who are cleaning up , as the saying goes , for they have fine personalities and attract customers . A good many are doing additional work , especially in graduate schools . Someone has predicted that in time the master 's and doctor 's degrees would become as common as bachelor 's degrees are now . Maybe they will : fifty years ago , no one would have predicted the commonness of the bachelor 's degree as we now have it . These students who have come out of the depression are a great crowd . They are an interested crowd . They are a decent group . And they are less selfish than you would think . I investigated sixty of their cases last year for qualifications for FERA work , and each one said that , though he needed the work badly , if someone needed it more than he did , he would try to get along . Along with the decent citizens of the crowd are the usual run of bill beaters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large  --  not nearly so large as it was when the registrations were much higher .
