Herbert Henry Lehman , banker , son and brother of bankers , announced last week that , as Governor of New York , he had at last , after five fiscal years , wiped out an accumulated deficit of $94,428,496.67 left behind for fiscal 1933 by Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt . Fiscal 1938 , said Governor Lehman , had ended with New York State some $16,600,000 in the black for the year , some $6,500,000 in the black for all years ( apart from funded debt ) . <P> Banker-Governor Lehman is now running for the U. S. Senate , and local adversaries took mild issue with his figures , saying that some of his indicated surplus funds were already pledged , that he had played a common little trick of year-end balance reading . Sharper issue , against a national sounding-board , was taken by the ex-Governor who created the deficit . In his speech at Covington , Ky. ( see p. 7 ) , Franklin Roosevelt digressed to say : <P> " As Governor of New York . . . because I could get no assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the State treasury into the ' red ' - in order to feed the destitute and give work to the unemployed . <P> " In the six years that have intervened many of our States , because of that help back from the into the National ' black ' again-my Government , own have got State of New York-and your own State of Kentucky . . . . Your Governor , my Governor and a good many other Governors are able to go before their people and announce proudly that they have balanced budgets . <P> " More power to their arms ! " <P> Banker - Governor - Candidate Lehman did not reply to his President . But others looked up New York State 's relief expenditures : included in the Roosevelt deficit of $94,428,496 was only $25,000,000 for Relief . <P> The New York Times drove home another point : <P> " There is no magic in the formula of ' Federally financed ' public works . The National Government has not tapped some mysterious source of funds , or taken money from a box where it was stored for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever except that which it acquires by taxing its citizens , and every dollar in ' Federal funds ' that has been received by ' Kentucky and other States ' will be repaid by the people of Kentucky and the other States-with interest . There is no Santa Claus in Washington . . . . " <P> Political Notes <P> Slogan-of-the-Week <P> Author : Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League ( Samuel Untermyer , president ) . Place : Manhattan .
