Correspondents crossing the narrow strip separating the Czech Army lines from the German Army 's advance lines in Sudetenland last week reported the most tragic aftermath of the Sudeten Settlement . Huddled in ditches or scrabbling in the fields for stray potatoes missed by the harvesters in this no-man's-land were hundreds of desperate Jews . <P> For their plight , both Germany and Czechoslovakia were responsible . Booted from Sudetenland by Nazi Storm Troopers who came in the wake of the German Army , the starving , penniless refugees were refused admission to Czechoslovakia ostensibly because they were technically citizens of Germany , actually because Czechoslovakia has no wish for refugees who can not support themselves . <P> From Breclav , now the German Lundenberg , 204 Jews were expelled by Austrian Nazis fortnight ago . For a few days , food was sent from Sudeten towns . Then a desperate Jewish mother smuggled her six- month-old child back into Breclav and the Germans cut off all food . " We are lying beneath hedges , " a Jewish mother , big with child wrote to Prague . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we were wearing when we were expelled . " <P> South of Brno , 150 Jews were in the same plight . Smaller groups , many stricken with influenza , dotted the area . Carloads of food sent by Prague sympathizers were turned back at Czech Army lines . One refugee , a Breclav physician , went insane . Czech and German passersby , crossing the no-man's-land , defied the authorities and tossed into the ditches what food they could sneak through . <P> A plea was sent to the U. S. Minister in Prague , Wilbur J. Carr , and finally the Czech War Ministry , acting with the Czech Red Cross , agreed to help . Food was hurried into the area and negotiations authorized with Germany regarding the refugees ' fate . <P> Meanwhile in Prague public resentment against having to take care of thousands of Sudeten refugees , a good many of them Jews , rumbled into an anti-Semitic demonstration , Prague 's first since Nazi annexation of the Czech territory . University students and young doctors milled about the famed square of Wenceslas , named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Jews , " " Czechoslovakia for the Czechoslovaks . " Cafs were invaded and many frightened Jewish patrons hustled into the streets before police dispersed the demonstrators .
