March 28 , 1938 . ? Lengthy discussion in the lunchroom to-day concerning the Adamowski House Bill and the Graham Senate Bill . One or two of the teachers asserted flatly that they cared not two pins who was Mayor or how he got the job , as long as we received our pay . The noise was deafening , the clatter of knives , forks , and dishes as terrific as usual . Fifteen hundred pupils and teachers eating and talking at once ! I finally made myself heard at our table . They all listened , which was bad , for ? encouraged ? I found myself lecturing . I explained who the vested interests ' were who were so anxious to give Chicago a hand-picked Mayor . And I made it clear that if the legislation passed and the powers kept their promises we should be pretty small and selfish to allow the people 's constitutional right to a primary to be sold for seven and a half months ' back pay , however desperately we needed the money . I discussed also the Sargent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a statement as ' I stress the necessity of maintaining the home , the common schools , and the churches , if representative government is to continue . ' On six different occasions , recently , members of this precious committee , addressing sumptuous banquets , have spoken of preserving the ' common schools . ' Little Miss X , who has a tidy brain and a startling grasp of financial statistics , as well as a charming personality , went over the Budget . Sometimes we all talked at once . It was tonic and exhilarating , but ridiculously futile . I agree with Mr. Mencken when he says that the pedagogue is largely imbecile . We are imbecile , but not because we are stupid . Many of the teachers have an excellent grasp of the situation . But we do nothing except talk . We pay dues to organizations , and we talk , talk , talk ! Just now , however , we are getting a practical if somewhat cruel course in current civics , and we have become inveterate readers of the daily papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rarely a day passes without deleted material to finance pay roll for last two weeks of June as soon as legislature validates Acting Mayor Corr 's signature . ' Today they read : ' Find flaw in legislation . ' So the signature is still invalid . No pay in sight , not even the promised two weeks ' ? and the primary gone blooey ! The teachers are furious . April 3 . ? Fred Sargent , head of the Citizens ' Committee and president of the Chicago &; North Western Railroad , has gone to Washington to see the President about school loans . Little hope for any results . But I had results in class to-day . The discussion of current events was spirited and intelligent . It was splendid . I have hope for the younger generation . Some of the students look so shabby and so hungry . One more girl stopped at the desk to ask until to-morrow to hand in her work . The poor child is clerking , after school hours , at Woolworth 's . What a way to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teachers has left for Washington . Szymczak too ! The press says his trip is to obtain a loan for the teachers , but rumor has it that he wants a Federal Reserve appointment . As for Fred Sargent , I wonder if his trip to Washington was entirely in the interests of the teaching body . There is an infuriating editorial in the Daily News calling him our friend , but 14,000 unpaid teachers doubt it . He got a loan , all right , but it was not for us ? eight million more for the C. &; N. W. , to be drawn down as needed . ' Of the $446,300,000 total funded indebtedness of the road , thirty-two million was previously loaned by the R. F. C. The figures appeared in an article on the financial page of the News , only a step or two beyond the editorial department . And on page 1 the news about the further loan ! This is the same Fred Sargent who as head of the Citizens ' Committee constantly howls for more economy in the schools . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. W. April 5 . ? The school strike has broken . It amounted to little at our school . An efficient engineer , who has frozen us systematically all winter and all spring , put his finger in the dike . My talks yesterday apparently had little to do with keeping my pupils in class ; it was all the work of the engineer ? he disconnected the electric bells so that no signals could be sounded . To-night 's papers are filled with strike news and pictures of the striking students . Black headlines : ' Ten Thousand Students Quit Desks in Protest on Teacher Pay ' ; ' Arrest Eighteen Student Strikers ' ; and more of the same . It is all very alarming . Another editorial in the Daily News , calling it the inevitable consequence of the inexcusable treatment of the teaching force . . . . Thousands of them , underfed and distracted by intolerable anxieties , have been carrying the burden of their unpaid toil by sheer heroic resolve .

It is the Committee that is our enemy ? made up of bank presidents , railroad presidents , packers , and directors generally of the wealth of the second city of the United States . There is no possible doubt of their intention ; they are attempting to starve the teaching force into submission to their programme and to cripple the city 's educational system . They would like to reduce public education in Chicago to the three R 's . ' There is ample justification for the labor station 's radio broadcasting of attacks on publicized respectability , naive as it 5 1 6 THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY often is . It is 50 per cent hair-trigger , but it is also 50 per cent right . I am going to bed . What will to-morrow bring ? April 6 . ? The strike grows . Communism has been charged , of course . It is a nasty mess . Dead tired when I reached home . The pupils are jittery , the teachers nervous . But I taught my classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no discussion of the situation . Five teachers have been sent to asylums since January first , I heard to-day . My resources are pretty thin . I need spring clothes desperately . I should let Mrs. J ? go , but ca n't bring myself to tell her . It is such a pittance I pay her , and yet she needs the money . Husband out of work ? her boy in high school ! Two more form letters in my mailbox were from loan companies offering me $300 or $400 without anyone knowing about it ? at interest which approximates 41 per cent for the year . They choose such reassuring names , these companies . Much of their capital is borrowed from our five Loop banks and reloaned to us at these usurious rates . Many of the teachers are already in their clutches . Clutches ! " That word makes me wonder if I am losing my sense of humor ? it sounds so East Lynne-ish ! But the situation , too , is East Lynne-ish . Three postal cards from brokers offering to sell my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making a fat living out of needy teachers .

Headlines are so amusing : ' Hope Grows for Teachers ' Pay ' ; Parents of Strikers Subject to Fine ' ; Take Back Expelled Reds ' ; ' Teachers to See Ickes ' ; ' Roosevelt to Hear Plea ' ; ' Strong in Cash ; Total Deposits of Chicago Banks Now One Billion and a Half . ' Still the timid bankers ' hesitate , overcome by their doubts of Corr 's signature . Many pictures of the aldermen at Hot Springs . A dispatch from Washington says Senator Lewis has urged appointment of M. S. Szymczak , Chicago city comptroller , to the Federal Reserve Board . So that is why he went to Washington ! April 8 . ? Tribune says to-day : Fear Teachers ' Cash Pay Day Is Facing a Delay .

But the Tribune 's headline should have read , ' Hope Teachers ' Cash Pay Day , etc . ' The animosity of the ' World 's Greatest Newspaper ' is usually more explicit . A rather lonely evening . My own fault ? my pride , I guess . I was invited to dinner and the theatre and felt that I could not accept . But I spent a pleasant evening , nevertheless , with some English book catalogues that had come in . Have n't bought a book in eight months ! My sabbatical is due next January . If they pay me the salary I have earned , perhaps I shall be able to gratify my lifetime 's dream of wandering down Eastcheap in the footsteps of Irving ? prowling the streets of Old London , the descriptions of which so amused me to-night in Stow 's account . But the bills hang heavy , heavy over my head ? ' what shall I do to redeem them ? ' My account book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be paid and $1$00 put aside for London and Oxford ? and my Shakespearean research ! There was quite a fight to conquer self-pity to-night . I wanted so desperately a stunning evening dress , and to accept that invitation . Teachers who go places and do thingeoccasionally , I have noted , are better teachers // for it . But I did n't want to go because I should be a better teacher . What rationalizers we are ! Oh , to be a very tender apple blossom ! Walked off a bad temper induced by a bill from one of the department stores , and wrote an impertinent letter . Dear Sirs : You solicited my account knowing me to be a teacher in the Chicago high schools . You know now ( Or do you ? It has been whispered in some of the papers ) that the Board of Education owes us , etc. , etc. , etc . ' But I tore it up and began over again . ' Dear Sirs : It grieves me to have to say that I am unable at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was after this that I put on my hat and raincoat and walked six miles . After ten minutes the black mood passed . The rain dashing in my face , the white plumes on the angry lake , the delicate green velvet buds in the park , so soon to blossom , all helped to restore my temper . I love the city and its parks ? and spring is coming . I kept repeating to myself Wordsworth 's lovely sonnet beginning , ' Earth has not anything to show more fair . ' But it is too true that in Chicago all this loveliness is as a great brocade of beauty laid over a festering corpse . April 9 . ? While I was walking off my ill temper on the lake front yesterday , repeating Wordsworth 's lines on the City Beautiful , fellow teachers were interrupting a flag-raising ceremony at the Century of Progress . The picture in Palm Sunday 's paper is a grim one ? all the bigwigs , frock-coated and silk-hatted , rode up in cars to take part in the ceremony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , were the same old shabby , nondescript teachers , singing ' The Star-Spangled Banner ' and holding aloft their own banners ? one of them reading , ' Chicago , the Wonder City , Has 14,000 Unpaid School-Teachers . ' The officials did n't care for the teachers ' ceremony and there was no room on the lake front for another one , so with disdainful glances they drove away . The flag was not raised yesterday on a Century of Progress . More and more I feel myself being drawn to this more violent form of expression . Something in me cries out that it is bad enough to be poor , worried , and debt-ridden , but far worse to make a spectacle of myself . Nevertheless I am trampling down my pride , if that is what it is , and I too perhaps shall soon join the more radical elements of the teaching force in their demonstrations . With their nuisance technique they are getting results that I am beginning to realize could not otherwise have been achieved . At the least , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . Many of the teachers are actually facing starvation . April 10 . ? Corr is off for Hot Springs . Not a vacation , he says ; but to get action . Action ? Well , to-day two thousand school-teachers stormed the City Hall and one of the banks . At the bank , guards were hastily stationed and the doors were closed . One of the papers carries an article about McDonough , the county treasurer . The much-talked-about McDonough plan of tax collection has been abandoned . Each day the burden grows more intolerable . The city is perhaps legitimately two years behind in its taxes because of the reassessment . But the truth is that to date the total back tax bill amounts to more than $9.50,000 , - 000 . And statistics show that more than 90 per cent of taxes on property values of $10,000 or less have been paid in full . In other words , the lower and middle classes have been the good citizens in spite of the depression .. It is the rich who can not or will not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY they are dictating educational retrenchment . The schools , they shout , must economize . The sympathetic press runs editorials about a ' soak the rich ' campaign ; yet we know that locally and nationally the poor man pays his taxes while the rich man hires lawyers to defend his plea that he can not pay . As Alice said , ' Things grow curiouser and curiouser . ' But I must press my dress , mend the elbow , and sew in fresh collar and cuffs . I am beginning to be a little tired of vegetable soup , stews , and chopped meat for dinner ; but one of these I shall have . Am I becoming a prima donna ? Is it butterflies ' tongues that I hanker for ? Come , come , my dear ! April 11 . ? There is a smell of spring in the air . I was quite warm to-day in my old winter clothes . I look and feel detestably shabby . And there is a bitterness creeping into me that I despise . I am neglecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell myself ? I should go to the dentist and pay him when / get paid ; I should go to the shops and charge things to my accounts . Schoolteachers as a class were always good credit , because they paid their bills on time . Now they are made to feel like paupers . But I will purchase nothing as long as my income is nothing . The Ole situation is fantastic ? incredible ! The city now owes me $e780 , and God knows when I 'll get a penny of it . As a compromise I have made out a list of the bare necessities to replenish last year 's wardrobe : a cheap hat , ? I hate cheap hats ! ? a pair of shoes , gloves , hose , and alterations on two of last spring 's dresses . I have lost weight alarmingly , I find . I suppose I should not have cut off the cream ; but I could n't afford it . The greenbacks in the old book are shrinking away ? I have had no bank account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be a saving ; but I ca n't do that . If only her husband could get work ! It is unbelievable that it is she and her sort ? the small home owners ? who have for the most part paid such taxes as have been paid ! Now she would like to sell her home . I know how she has scrimped and saved to meet her payments . On the heels of these thoughts , a little while ago , I picked up the evening paper , and this is what greeted my eye : We the citizens of Chicago , second city in population in the United States , metropolis of the West , greatest railroad centre in the world , extend to the public a cordial welcome to the greatest drama of human progress ever assembled in the tide of time ? a Century of Progress International Exposition . We welcome you to the wisdom of the world in every phase of human endeavor . We welcome you to a city whose hospitality knows no limits , whose parks and drives surpass the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spires of whose churches , temples , and cathedrals challenge the clouds in their sweep and are a constant and perpetual reminder that this city bows in reverence and acknowledges that there is a Supreme Being that rules the Universe . The gates stand ajar , our hearthstones await your coming , our hands , etc. , etc. , etc . ' Comment is impossible ! 0 God , 0 Rufus Dawes ! And this will be about enough of that . There are some runners in my stockings that demand attention . If they are mended with great care , perhaps no eye will detect that there now stands exactly $32.53 between me and ? ? April H. ? Mr. Taylor , president of the Board , and , in private , attorney for the common stockholders of Middle West Securities , says : Representa- fives of the bankers have informed me to-day that they will sever all connection with the school system if we issue warrants in excess of 50 per cent of the number permitted by the Budget . ' I attended a Board meeting to-day . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the teachers cheered . They do n't really want the schools closed ; but they are hungry and tired and they ca n't go on without money . Action on closing the schools was postponed until to-morrow . April 13 . ? I attended the Board meeting ; a frightful jam at the entrance . Of the 14,000 teachers in the system , 75 per cent at least have the same idea I have ? that the schools must be closed . I want it blazoned to the world that Chicago 's school-teachers have been forced into involuntary servitude . I want the country at large to know that we have worked for almost a year without pay in this beautiful city that invites the world to its celebration of a Century of Progress . But that is only a part of me ? only an angry part of these really kindly , conservative people who have been so twisted by the politicians and the bankers and the press . We have been bullied and threatened for so long that we almost hope that , as a Century of Progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be ushered out . However , the schools are not to be closed . Teachers are to go on teaching . One of the trustees with banker affiliations smugly announced that it would be a disgrace to close the schools now . It would be very bad , it appears , in view of the coming Fair . The President of the Board also voiced his opposition . Who would feed the thousands of children who , as matters stand , are being fed in the schools , he demanded to know . He thought we might as well finish the school year on June 1 and give the children their credits . Did he mean , I wonder , that there would be difficulty with the parents of pupils if the children did not get their credits ? That it was easier to put up with the unpaid teachers and their noise than to risk getting the children 's parents in the Board 's hair ? One trustee actually suggested that the schools be closed at once ? but he was a lone voice and quite powerless to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was to read that Edward J.

The papers say we may get two weeks ' salary on Monday . A huge demonstration is planned for Saturday . Spent the afternoon grading papers , and most of the evening . To-morrow I shall parade .

Most of the principals received the checks and brought them to the parading teachers . At a conservative estimate , 20,000 teachers and students paraded , accompanied by high-school bands and flourishing many placards . Some of the signs were clever , some bitter , some only dull ; but all of them deleted material // school work . Rumor has it once more that the schools are to close soon . I made out three plans to cover the work yet to be done , based on three tentative closing dates . This afternoon I played tennis . The air was glorious . And in the evening I had dinner and danced at the Yacht Club . There were ten in the party , all old friends . Dr. James asked me if I had been biting any more bankers ' ! April 27 . ?

From one point of view , we have no right to be doing this sort of thing ; but from , another , those of us who are still eating regular meals owe it to those who are starving to force public attention to this situation . The headlines to-night are black and several inches high . April es . ? Paul Schneider , a 41-year-old school-teacher , a husband and father , committed suicide to-day . How much longer , 0 Lord ? The New York Journal of Commerce gave us a fine editorial , praising our strategy and suggesting that we picket the homes of the leaders of the tax strike . April 29 . ?

City corporate employees have received their salaries for December , and are promised those for January soon . Kelly announces that teachers may expect $14,000,000 in cash before long . The city employees are four months ahead of us in collections . May 8 . ? Taylor orders $10,000,000 cut in school costs . New Board members are announced .

We may have the money before then . This is the result of our nuisance technique ? the only thing that has been effective to date . May 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . ? Complete silence in the newspapers about teachers ' pay . The weather is warm and I am spending my spare time making a dress , which will take an eternity , as I have no sewing machine .

The Mayor has issued a warning through the press that there are to be no demonstrations on the part of teachers when the Fair opens .

Demonstrations by teachers will be discouraged by policemen 's clubs , it is threatened , and we may find ourselves in the County Hospital if we parade to the banks again . Three weeks are left us in which to complete two months ' work in our classes , and summer has set in with a vengeance . The $40,000,000 bond issue for payment of school salaries passed the legislature yesterday . No one expects it to become tangible cash before late fall or winter . May V. ? Dog tired .

For me , there are papers to grade and a dress to press . Ho , hum ! June 5 . ? The heat is terrific . Last night I worked until three , grading papers . Officially the temperature is 98 degrees , but in my classroom it averaged 111 for three hours . Examination weather ! There is no word of any further effort to get us our back salaries .

And I ca n't . July 10 . ? Yesterday the Board passed a so-called economy measure wiping out the junior high schools , closing the one junior college in the city , and abolishing all manual training and domestic science in the grade schools . Teachers ' classes in the high schools will be increased from five to seven , and there is to be one principal only for every two grammar schools . Swimming instruction , too , is wiped out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second step in a programme designed to wreck public education . The first was to starve the teaching force into submission . This action is in direct conflict with the National Recovery Act , since it adds to unemployment by throwing more than 1000 teachers out of work . The savings claimed by the Board are terrific exaggerations ? indeed , the whole programme is based on falsehood and hypocrisy . How will the dear public receive this step ? Apparently they have cared little that the teachers were being starved . Now that the real objective behind the activity is obvious , what will the people do ? I had expected the blow to fall first on senior high schools . That will be the third step , perhaps . July 21 . ? The clamor of the newspapers is deafening . For the moment even the big circus on the lake front has been crowded off the front pages . The Tribune openly defends the action of the Board ; the Hearst papers denounce it . The News straddles beautifully . Two splendid articles in the Herald and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all and demand that the Board either rescind its action or get out . To-night I attended the great mass meeting called by the Save Our Schools Committee . The Stadium was filled : 25,000 persons ? parents , teachers , and citizens of every kind . The high spot was an amazing speech by Judd of the University of Chicago in which he proved that no deficit existed for the year 1933 ? that an accumulated deficit of less than $7,000,000 , dating back to 1929 , is being met in a single year by this drastic and unnecessary cut in educational services . He said that the cut was advised by the paid agent of Fred Sargent , head of the so-called Citizens ' Committee , that the Board had merely acted under orders from the Mayor , and that the Mayor had accepted the policy dictated by the owner of the Chicago Tribune . He lashed the Board for its pretense of economy , when it refuses to adjust the costs of material maintenance . Stench bombs were exploded in an attempt to break up the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair was an ordeal ; but the dear public certainly heard some truths expressed . My head aches furiously , but I am glad I went . July 22 . ? One lovely bit came out to-day . The Herald and Examiner said editorially : ' The public demands to know why the Board of Education members wish to measure the hours of schooling that a child is to have , while in the same breath they say that they will no longer measure the tonnage of coal purchased . ' It has been reported that last winter orders were given to school engineers to cease measuring coal on its receipt at the schools , that figures of the coal dealers were to be accepted . The Board now has two coal company presidents among its members . July 27 . ? The headlines to-night are pretty sickening . The school cut has been upheld .

The best educators of the country have come to our assistance , and the action of the Board stands condemned from Maine to California . August 12 . ? There are days like today when I doubt my sanity . Here I am in the frightful heat , spending a large part of my time sticking printed matter into envelopes and addressing it to people who will probably throw it into the wastebasket .

A censorship has been established at Board headquarters . In the days of the Roman Empire the rulers provided free bread and circuses to keep the people happy . There 's little free bread now , and we pay for our circuses . Chicago 's schools are wrecked and its teachers are starving , but the world still comes to visit the great Century of Progress Exposition on the lake front . Sally Rand and the star Arcturus . . . .

In the morning I went for a swim and in the afternoon to a meeting of the Board . Two sets of tennis in the evening . I am less depressed by the turn of events . The whole meeting today , incongruously enough , was devoted to plans for obtaining a government loan for the building of more schools . All they want is $14,000,000 ! No mention of the wrecking pro gramme ; and no discussion of the list of teachers and principals to be dismissed . The raison d'etre of the School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat contracts . They talked at length , and with their usual disregard of the English language , of the plasterers and carpenters who would be benefited by the building programme .

However , I am not discouraged . I still have faith in the gentleman at Washington . Some part of the loan may go through , but there will be a federal watchdog on the job to keep an eye on expenditures . The days of the grafting politician are numbered . The Board is protecting itself by uniformed policemen , fully armed , and by plain-clothes detectives an incredible spectacle ! The members are in no physical danger .

Trustees Repel Another Blow at School Economy ' was the Tribune 's idea of what occurred . The Herald and Examiner said : ' Free Teaching Offer to Help City Spurned . ' What really happened was that Mrs. Hefferan , the only member of the Board to vote against the wrecking programme , presented an offer by ten teacher organizations to work for nothing to the extent of any deficit in the 1933 educational fund . There was a condition attached ? that the Board must permit an immediate audit of the school records , at the teachers ' expense , to determine the amount of the deficit , if any . It was the implication that a deficit did not exist that angered the Board members . An attorney named Walker got up and roared at us . ' This kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegantly . It exasperates a person who is trying to do something for the school children . ' When we all shouted with laughter , the policemen and detectives drew themselves up and waited for an order to stop us . The troubled Mr. Walker went ahead with his own uproar . Unless we had proper respect for the School Board , he said , he would insist on our disclosing our names and addresses as we entered the room , and he would personally prefer charges against us . When he finished , Trustee Savage got the floor , red of face and neck , and added further threats . He said : ' I will be the first one to vote to dismiss anyone , whether it be superintendent , principal , or otherwise , that does not see that our programme for the benefit of the children is carried out . ' So we otherwises ' subsided , and in the end Superintendent Bogen was allowed to speak . He said he would go before the government advisory commission tomorrow to ask for the $14,000,000 loan . September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives of the Board of Education this afternoon when they went before the federal advisory committee on public works and asked for an advance of $14,000,000 , ' said the Daily News to-day . The early Tribune said that the committee had voiced its favor ' of the proposal . I should have attended the meeting myself . Instead I went sailing . The lake was lovely , and it is seldom enough I get a chance to go sailing . September 11 . ? I have bad a glorious two days in the country . The news on my return is tonic , too . Something is going to happen soon , I think . The real fight is on , and the scene may move to Washington . The papers contain huge pictures of politicians departing in special trains . Ostensibly they are going to ask for relief for the unemployed , but the real purpose of the trip is clear . It has been intimated that the Administration is not in sympathy with the ideals of those who pull the strings of our local democracy . These gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think they will not have the spending of it . " T was brillig , and the slithy toves . . . ' School opens in a week . I feel fairly fit , and I am ready . My finances are still appalling . The two weeks ' pay tossed us last week ? a sop to Cerberus ? ? went to creditors , except for a few dollars . Sometime this week we are to receive a month 's salary in 1933 tax warrants ? marketable at a 40 per cent discount or worse . A drop in the bucket of my obligations . To-day is gray and cold , and the leaves are beginning to fall from the trees . On days like these our Nordic ancestors went forth to fight . In the same spirit , I like to think , thousands of teachers are returning to their classes prepared to serve , but also prepared to fight for a decent solution of the problems ahead . Heaven send us grace and courage to perform our tasks !       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
