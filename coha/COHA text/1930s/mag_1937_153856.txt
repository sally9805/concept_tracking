International <P> To the land of the free and equal , where every mother 's son had a chance to become a millionaire or President , sailed from France 29 years ago one Charles Eugene Bedaux . Although slight in stature and of no great muscle , this ambitious little Frenchman promptly took the highest paid job he could qualify for in Manhattan as an unskilled laborer , that of a " sand hog " digging skyscraper and subway foundations under heavy air pressure which gives a workman who emerges too quickly cramps and pains called " the bends . " Using his brain as well as his shovel , Sand Hog Bedaux was able after a few years to begin living the American success story of which he had dreamed in France . The new trade of " efficiency expert " had fired his imagination and he invented the Bedaux System of " B ( for Bedaux ) Units " now defined by Webster 's Dictionary as " A system of wage payment in which work is subdivided into units equivalent to the number of minutes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of the number of points of work accomplished in a given length of time . " <P> It was Success when the onetime Sand Hog married as his second wife a pretty Daughter of the American Revolution , Middle-Western Miss Fern Lombard . It was Success when the small , swarthy little emigrant returned to his native France and bought for $750,000 a princely chateau in Touraine , ordering its ancient vineyard grubbed up to make a golf course which proved that Charles Eugene Bedaux had been thoroughly amalgamated in the American Melting Pot . It was Success for Mr. &; Mrs. Bedaux to disport themselves on the Riviera with a wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Herman Rogers , one of whose dashing friends was a Mrs. Simpson . By this time Science was being served in columns of newsprint by the Bedaux Expedition of French Citroen caterpillar cars to the subarctic regions of Canada . <P> The American Federation of Labor 's American Federationist said in its issue of September 1935 that the Bedaux system " stripped of its pseudo-technical verbiage , is nothing more nor less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workers at the smallest possible cost in wages . " Next for Charles &; Fern Bedaux a unique pleasure was in store-the abdicated King of England married Mrs. Simpson in their chateau in France ( TIME , June 14 ) . Later the honeymooning Duke and Duchess stayed at the Bedaux chateau in Hungary . And this week Mr. &; Mrs. Bedaux landed in Manhattan charged to arrange and carry through a tour of the U. S. and possibly Canada by the present King of England 's elder brother and His Majesty 's eldest sister-in-law who are expected to arrive November 11 on the Bremen .
