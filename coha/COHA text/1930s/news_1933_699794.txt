txt At 7900 South Ashland avenue stands a $160,000 stone building that was erected by John Bain , one time head of a chain of banks , who is now under sentence for his mishandling of money . It used to house the West Highland State bank , one of the main units of his chain . But the bank was closed In June . 1931 , with liabilities of more than a million dollars , and for a time ii appeared there was nothing to do with Mr. Bain 's monumental structure . But now that 's all changed . Last week two enterprising business men , and Clancy , went to the city hall and obtained a license to convert the West Highland State bank Into a beer saloon . Things are'completely liquid in the old bank now , with foaming steins passing over the counters where tellers were wont to pay out on Checks and cash registers jingling where other tellers used to accept deposits .                   @ @
