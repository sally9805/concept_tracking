Having nothing that corresponds closely to either cinema 's gold-plated statuette award ( informally called " Oscar " ) or literature 's , press 's and theatre 's Pulitzer Prizes , radio takes its annual laurels from the Women 's National Radio Committee ! This organization is affiliated with numerous women 's clubs . The women awarded their gold microphone last week to NBC Blue network Sustaining Broadcaster George V. Denny Jr . and his America 's Town Meeting of the Air . <P> Awards are based on an elaborate combination of quasi-popular election and committee choice . Ballots are sent to key women in W. N. R. C. affiliated organizations , radio chairmen and others who are expected to represent radio views of their respective groups . Tie votes are broken by deliberation of a committee which includes American Legion Auxiliary Radio Committee Chairman Mrs. William H. Corwith , Child Study Association 's Miss Josette Frank , former W. N. R. C. Chairman Mrs. Harold Vincent Milligan and W. N. R. C. Chairman Mme Yolanda Mero-Irion . <P> Retired Concert Pianist Mero-Irion founded the W. N. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star series , which her committee graciously commended under not one but two categories for its music and good taste in advertising . Her aim is to make newsboys whistle strains from Ada . She storms at what she considers the state of radio broadcasting , loathes crime stories , poorly performed music , women baritones , precocious child artists , true story programs , advertisers who coax children to eat their products , amateur hours .
