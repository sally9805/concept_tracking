Knee-deep in snow 10,000 ft. up the granite scarp of Lone Peak in the Wasatch Mountains , 25 miles southeast of Salt Lake City , last week a snowy-haired oldster of 90 named Ed Hamilton fingered a small splinter of duralumin while tears filled his eyes . Tugging at his white beard , he mumbled : " I 'm glad . That 's all I can say . " <P> Reason for old Ed Hamilton 's emotion was that the bit of metal marked the end of a grueling six-month search for his son-in-law , Pilot S. J. Samson . Last Dec. 14 , Pilot Samson took off from Los Angeles on his regular run to Salt Lake City in a Western Air Express Boeing . After stopping at Las Vegas , Nev. , the twin-motored transport droned on north into a wintry night and oblivion ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) . Aboard the plane , which last reported hitting 199 m.p.h. at 10,000 ft. under a " high overcast , " were four passengers , a co-pilot and pretty Hostess Gladys Witt , whose marital indecisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WAE launched a search which continued spasmodically until last week with the lure of a $1,000 reward . Fortnight ago a searcher on Lone Peak found some letters . Last week four men reached the scene of the crash almost simultaneously , agreed to share the $1,000 . <P> Lone Peak is an 11,250-ft. sentinel on the edge of the valley up which WAE flies on the Salt Lake radio beam . This beam is notorious for " multiple effects " ( splitting around mountains ) . Pilot Samson crashed 35 miles off course , apparently had lost the beam altogether . If he had been just a little higher , he would have cleared Hardy Ridge , had a safe path on to the airport . As it was , the plane was smashed into confetti and completely buried by snow . At week 's end no bodies had yet been recovered and postal inspectors stood guard with guns while they salvaged a rich batch of gems . <P> Said Postal Inspector M. G. Wenger : " Evidently the plane - we think it must have been traveling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife-edge ridge only 20 ft. from its top . Part of the undercarriage and nose , with much of the mail , ripped off upon the ridge , and the rest of the plane , with the seven bodies , plunged off the cliff , striking once about 400 ft. down and then ricocheting off and tumbling some 600 ft. more into the uptilted snow field . " <P> While the difficult search for bodies began , old Ed Hamilton requested that they be buried forever by dynamiting the towering cliff above the wreck , memorial ized by a skyline marker .
