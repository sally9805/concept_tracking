txt The idea of this journey was conceived last November when H. G. Watkins , leader of the expedition , and I failed to cover the expected distance on our southern iournev . If an air route is to cross Greenland its course must necessarily be modified by the , altitude of the ice cap . Traveling south last Autumn from the centre station we found that the height decreased southward in a line between de Quervaine and Ansens , the highest points , but we did not get far enough at that stormy season to complete the profile . On the evening of July 1 Andrew Stephenson , Lieutenant Martin Lindsay and I left the base with three sledges and twenty-seven dogs . Our plan was to make a rough survey of the coastal mountains at least as far south as Namuses Crossing and then to turn across the middle of the ice cap to find out what we could about its altitude . Escorted by Photographers . For the first two nights we were accompanied by a small photographic party . We were very glad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attentions . They had their share of adventures among the crevasses , , however , for Flight Lieutenant Cozens sank to his armpits through a snow bridge when taking a photograph of the camp . Throughout the journey we traveled at night . At this time of the year the sun temperature at lower levels is always above the freezing point , which means a sticky sledging surface . But at night the slush was frozen into a slippery crust which increased the dogs ' pace enormously , while we could glide along on skis beside the sledges . Consequently our hours of travel were limited merely by the altitude of the sun and never by fatigue . This one point demonstrates rather well the main difference between Summer and Wintee , sledging . In Winter traveling- is strictly regulated by the hours of light and darkness and by the temper of the elements . Camping 9. nct breaking camp are alike miserable . In Summer , on the other hand , one stops traveling only when it becomes so warm that the idea of standing about for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface are never so bad in Summer time as to make traveling quite impossible , and it is pleasant to feel that weather alone is not likely to alter the issue of the journey . Another point not without importance in a long journey is that it is much more intriguing to travel at night . By day the even expanse of snow always looks much the same , but at night the cloud and light effects are full of interest . The sun was only below the horizon for a very few hours , so that the gay sunset clouds did not have time to lose their color before they were rekindled to announce the dawn . July 15 we were as far south as Fjord , so we had plenty of time in hand . This would have allowied us to travel further south near the coast , but we had been climbing all the tine and even in clear weather we were apt to lose sight of the mountains because of the steep drop to the coast , To sea the mountains proper we would have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meandering course and conseeuently inaccurate work . For this reason we decided to turn southeast up the slope and content ourselves with aneroid , radios and meteorological . onservations . For the next four nights , in which we covered 108 miles , we were still climbing . The readings of our instrument have not yet been corrected . but it seems probable that we r : -. died an altitude of well over 9,000 the highest crossing of the ice cap . Much Misty Weather . In this area we had a good deal of misty weather . Since we were no longer looking for mountains this did not worry us except that the diffused light made it more difficult to keep a straight course and we had to travel entirely by dead reckoning . However , we found that with an oil compass fastened onto the leading sledge we could keep a quite reasonable course . We had brought with us bamboo poles and a home-made species of square sail . As soon as we began to go down the western slope we had the wind behind us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable help . One night we covered just under thirty miles , but we all decided that the management of such craft on the slippery but uneven snow crust when we ourselves were on skis was rather a hectic form of Winter sport . When the front sledge stopped to camp it was a good sight to see the other two coming up with their sails bellowing to the wind , sledge flags flying and the excited dogs galloping along in front . From descriptions of the inland ice one is apt to get the idea that it forms a dreadfully uninteresting landscape . This may be partly true , but all boredom is forgotten as soon as the first mountain top appears above the horizon , is lost from view in the next valley and then appears again , perhaps with two or three companion peaks , from the top of the next rise . We first saw the west coast mountains miraged up from a distance of more than fifty miles , and the wildest bets were made as to their identity . When we had taken latitude observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmarks . Quite apart from sentiment , the destruction of so much valuable material was a thoroughly unpleasant job . Did 450 Miles in Four Weeks . The dogs had been bought at the end of the sledging on the west coast , and then , after a year of almost continuous hard work with us , they had finished up by traveling 450 miles in four weeks . The only rest they had had was on the five days we were laid up during that time for unpleasant weather or astronomical observations . But there was this slight consolation : on this journey , at least , they were never short of food , and each dog had ten . days ' pemmican ration as a sort of condemned man 's breakfast , all , that is , except one-eyed Barmsie , - who fell down a crevasse and was lost just before we reached the mountains . Next morning we started on our walk . For the first two hours we followed a delightful flowery route through the mountains . Then we came tip Ivigtut Glacier . Here we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep and the surface cut up by ice falls and by deep but fortunately quite unhidden crevasses . We only had to cross the glacier and then walk down the southern side for three miles , but it took us five hours to do it . Then we started the twenty-mile walk over the mountains to Ivigtut . We had hoped to arrive that night , but the roughness of the country and the short thick growths of willows and birches slowed us up so much that we were forced to lie down as we were for the three darkest hours . We started off again , feeling rather cold , at 2:30 next morning , but the hills soon warmed us up . We reached Ivigtut at 9 A. M. on July 30 , just twenty-four hours after we had left our camp on the ice  --  a somewhat toilsome ending to such a pleasant sledge journey . Then came hot baths , our letters from home , delightful hospitality and plenty of good food and drink in this most up-to-date of Greenland 's settlements . There Since July , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership of H. G. Watkins , has been in Greenland since July 26 , 1930 , making weather observations on the ice cap and charting possible landing places for an air route from Britain to Canada . In a dispatch dated June 24 Watkins said that about a month from that date a ship would arrive to take some of the members of the expedition home . On its arrival the party had planned a fourteen-month stay . The journey of Scott , Stephenson and Lieutenant Lindsay across the ice cap took them along the inside edge of the coastal mountain strip , never before seen by man save at the point where Nansen tried to cross the cap in 1888 . From Ivigtut the three men are to sail for Europe or America , according to a previous Map Proved Incorrect . The first mountains we had sighted proved to be nunataks just separated by ice from the Arsic Mountains , which stretched about twenty miles further inland than they are shown to do on the map . We had come out rather too far north of Ivigtut Glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good way through the crevasses and for a gap in the mountains through which the glacier flows . From now on every moment became exciting . Lindsay hurried after the other sledges with the news that he had seen a flag and at the luncheon halt a feather was passed around and admired . We climbed a nunatak and located a likely looking valley , but when we reached it eight hours later we found no glacier , only a rather steepsided valley with a fierce little glacial stream running down it . However , we knew we could not be far from Ivigtut Glacier , so we camped and walked on to reconnoitre . After climbing five hills we saw our glacier not far to the south , but it looked too rough and crevassed to make worthwhile sledging round to it , so we decided to stay where we were for the night and start walking for Ivigtut next morning , taking only what we  --  could sarry on our backs . Then dame almost the only unpleasant part of the whole journey . In Southeast Greenland it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eskimo dogs can not live together , so we had been told that we must  --  shoot our teams , ,
