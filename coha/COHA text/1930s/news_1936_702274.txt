txt The momentous , session of Parliament that received today King Edward 's message of abdication was best described by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin himself when he said near the close of his narrative of the crisis : " This House of Commons today , is a theatre which is being watched by the whole world . " Never since the first British Parliament was called by Simon de Montfort 672 years ago had it been the theatre for such an impressive tragedy as that enacted today . There have been greater political issues , perhaps , and more fateful struggles between Crown and Commons . There have been long Parliaments , short Parliaments and rump Parliaments . But there has , been no precedent for today 's enactment of the tragedy in which a monarch signed away his sovereignty over an empire of 500,000,000 people for his love of a woman . And while the play was on , the wars of one hemisphere and the efforts in the other hemisphere to end wars were merely side shows . Extra Police on Hand Standing room only was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not even standing room left in the acres of lobbies and for many blocks outside on the streets that lead to the Houses of Parliament . So many extra companies of police were assigned to duty around the buildings that it was feared serious disorder was anticipated by the authorities , but nothing could have been further from the fact . There was as much decorum in witnessing this self-effacement of Edward VIII as there was last January when the multitudes gathered to mourn for his father and to proclaim him . Needless to say , the House itself was filled as it had not been since ? the session at which war was de- ' eared in 1914 . In the diplomatic gallery , every seat was taken by Ambassadors and Ministers from nearly all nations . What little daylight sometimes seeps into the Commons chamber on a Winter afternoon was completely shut out by a but fog , so there was nothing but mellow illumination from the lights above the stained glass ceiling .

The familiar cry , " Prayers are over , " after the customary , brief devotional exercise with which every session opens , was followed by many involuntary , at least unusual , " Amens , " suggestive of a devout wish that for this once they might be answered quickly . There were no " King 's men " in : this House . But it was equally true , there were no anti-King men . The King 's own message was received with sorrow and sympathy . When Mr. Baldwin made his long statement of the events that preceded the decision to abandon the throne , there vanished the last trace of the bitterness that had developed in the last week from fear that the Crown might try to override the Commons . " We are not judges , " said Mr. Baldwin , and it was one of his utterances to which members gave their warmest assent . " While there is not a soul among us who will not regret this from the bottom of his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver , Mr. Baldwin received many signs of approval from the whole House . But the greatest cheers came when he ended with this : " Now let us rally behind the new King . " BALDWIN RELATES STORY IN COMMONS Prime Minister , " there is also not a soul among us here today that wants to judge . " That was true . The harsh criticism of yesterday was stilled , at least for the moment . In its place there welled up all the old affection that the people bad for Edward during his years as Prince of Wales and at his accession . " The House must remember , though it is difficult to realize . " said Mr. Baldwin , " that His Majesty is not a boy . He looks so young . We have all thought of him as our Prince . " That note of the grieved , but still affectionate , father struck a responsive chord in the House . Nearly every member of it thinks the King who " looks so young " has erred and flouted the traditions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger about it tonight . Mr. Baldwin saw to that . When he entered the House and announced " a message from the King , signed by his own hand , " it was the signal for beginning a ceremony and service of poignant farewell probably never equaled . The Commons had established its supremacy over the Crown beyond all trace of doubt , but there was no gloating over the victory . Events Are Recounted After the Speaker had read the royal message , Mr. Baldwin , showing in his face and his voice the great strain he had been under , gave his remarkable chronicle of the events since he first talked with the King last October about his attachment to Mrs. Simpson and warned him against the danger that his course would destroy respect for the monarchy . His quotation from Hamlet beginning with , " His soul is not his own , " was Mr. Baldwin 's measure of the restraint the King should have put on himself but did not .
