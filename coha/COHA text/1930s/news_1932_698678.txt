txt President Hoover today assumed an active part in an effort to expedite through the Senate the billion-dollar tax bill which was passed yesterday by the House . He called Chairman Smoot of the Senate Finance Committee into conference , and afterward Mr. Smoot announced that hearings on the measure would start Wednesday morning . The White House made known the President 's intention to take up with other Senators the matter of prompt handling of the tax bill . He is expected to invite Senator Harrison , ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee ; Senator Robinson , the Democratic leader ; Senator Watson . administration spokesman in the Senate , and Senator Reed to talk with him . Hardly had Mr. Hoover acted when Secretary Mills issued a statement , which , while praising the effort of the House to balance the budget , also declared that the tax bill contained " serious defects and discriminations . " Mr. Mills reiterated his belief that the measure would fail by more than $200,000,000 to meet the government 's needs , but termed it " a great victory for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffled over the statement , and spoke of " politics . " He repeated his contention of yesterday that the treasury head " juggled " figures " to prove his own arguments . " " I say to you again that I have guessed correctly more times than has Secretary Mills , " the Speaker said , adding emphatically that the House would stand on the estimates of its own revenue experts which placed the revenue-raising capacity of the bill at $1,032,000,000 . Stormy Time Expected in Senate . Mr. Garner is also standing by the estimates of the Economy Committee that governmental savings would total $200,000,000 . These two , together with increased revenue assured by minor postal increases amounting to $30,500,000. would total $1,262,900,000 , or $21,900,000 more than the $1,241,000,000 in additional funds estimated to be necessary for balancing the budget in the fiscal year 1933 . The belief prevailed at the Capitol today that the tax bill would have a stormy career in the Senate . Sepator Reed let It be known that he would attempt to have the general sales tax restored . House leaders predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160 recorded yesterday in the House , the lower branch would " never " accept a general sales tax . Attacks on a number of the " selected " levies , written into the bill in place of the sales tax , are expected in the Senate . These were accepted by the House in rapid succession , before interested persons and organizations could mobilize to fight them . The Senate intends to conduct hearings on every new item in the bill . Senator Smoot said today that " full opportunity " would be given for the hearings , adding his hope , however , that , instead of having " twenty or more witnesses " on one provision , those asking to be heard would " get together and designate spokesmen to represent them . " " Such procedure would shorten the hearings and at the same time afford ample opportunity for a complete airing before the committee of the views of those who favor , as well as those who oppose , various provisions of the bill as passed by the House last night , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his statement agreed that the House bill would " raise a very large amount of revenue . " " What , however , is more important is that the House , in passing it , has recognized and affirmed the necessity of balancing the budget . " he said . " This is a great victory for sound financial principles . " Mr. Mills felt that the differences in estimates were of a minor nature ; and he expressed the hope that Speaker Garner was correct in his calculations . In view " of drastic cuts " alreadz made in the 1933 budget , there was " but little further room for large economies through administrative changes alone , " he contended . To accomplish a real reduction in cost , consolidations must eliminate duplication of effort ; there must be a curtailment of unnecessary functions and the suspension of certain activities . There wan no saving in a temporary postponement of an appropriation . Of the estimates that reductions made by the Appropriations Committee represented a saving of $113,000.000 , Mr. Mills declared that only $27,000,000 could fairly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of payments for the adjusted service certificate fund as an example . Text of Mills 's Statement . The text of Mr. Mills 's statement was as follows : - The bill which passed the House of Representatives will raise a very large a mount of revenue . What , however , is more important is that the House in passing it has recognized and affirmed the necessity of balancing the budget . This is a great victory for sound financial principles . There can be no turning back . - " The differences as to estimates of revenue are minor in character . The Speaker seems to think the treasury estimates are too low . I hope he is right . Only time will tell . All I can say is that the estimates represent our very best judgment . " The bill contains serious defects and discriminations . I trust that these will be corrected in the Senate and that the changes will ultimately be concurred in by the House . " The treasury estimates that the bill , during the fiscal year 1932-33 , will raise approximately $1,030,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as against an estimated $1,241,000,000 needed to balance the budget , exclusive of the sinking fund requirements . It is apparent , therefore , that there is a gap of something over $200,000,000 which remains to be bridged . " This the Ways and Means Committee and the House evidently plan to bring about by means of reduced expenditures . There never was any difference between the Ways and Means Committee and the Treasury Department as to the imperative need of reducing the cost of government , but in my letter to Chairman Crisp I pointed out ' the extreme danger of attempting to balance the budget except on the basis of either ascertained facts or of prospects sufficiently substantial to justify a confident expectation of their realization . ' " Unfortunately , neither the Ways and Means Committee nor the House had before them in preparing their estimates of needed revenue a concrete program for definite reduction in expenditures . They were obliged to rely on more or less vague estimates . Economy Program Essential Now . " It is now clear that if we are to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete program is imperatively necessary . " This means that there must be substantial modifications of existing law affecting the duties and obligatiohs of the departments and independent establishments of the government . In view of the drastic cuts already made in the 1933 budget as presented to the Congress , " Amounting to $370,000,000. there is but little further room for large economies through administrative changes alone . " To accomplish a real reduction in cost there must be an elimination ' of duplication of effort through consolidation , the curtailment of unnecessary functions , and the suspension of certain activities during the period of emergency . To attain this goal will require not only legislation but close cooperation between the legislative and the executive branches of the government in carrying out such a program . " There is no saving in mere temporary postponement of an appropriation . In the discussion of savings much emphasis has been placed on the reduction in the estimates of appropriations made by the Committee on Appropriations of the House . The claim has been made that they represent an actual saving of as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only $27,000 , - 000 of reductions can fairly he said to represent actual savings . The balance . in all human probability , merely represents deferred appropriations . Instance of " Confusion " Is Cited . " For instance , the largest single item of reduction is one of $50,000 , - 000 for the adjusted service certificate fund . The committee reduced an estimate of $150,000,000 to $100 , - 000,000 ? to use its own language ? ' upon the assurance of General Hines that an appropriation of $100,000,000 will take care of the obligations until the next session of Congress , when a deficiency appropriation can be made if needed . ' " In other words , the $50,000,000 of supposed savings is to be appropriated next December ? in the middle of the very fiscal year for which we are budgeting , and will have to be paid for out of taxes collected during that fiscal year . " This illustrates one of the causes of confusion . When the Treasury epartment talks of a balanced budget , it means a balanced budget ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced expenditures , it means an actual reduction in the cost of government  --  not a postponement of an appropriation for a few months . " There can be no question as to ' the willingness of the ? Treasury Department and other departments of the government to cooperate with the Congress in the development on a nonpartisan basis of a real program looking to genuine reductions in the cost of government . As a matter of fact , the departments and independent establishments have already submitted suggestions to the appropriate committees for effecting substantial reductions . "
