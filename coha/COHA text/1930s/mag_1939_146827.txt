Manhattan 's art season is to U. S. art what the Broadway season is to the U. S. theatre . It started off with a mild pop last week when the renovated Whitney Museum , after a four-month delay , threw open its doors at last , revealing a fountain filled with goldfish in the lobby , four new galleries filled mostly with familiar U. S. moderns from the Museum 's permanent collection . <P> Directors of the Whitney Museum did not know whether they were more tickled over their sensational new indirect lighting system , their four new rooms , a new central staircase and widened halls , or the 118 paintings , 53 pieces of sculpture , 31 water colors , 29 drawings and 57 prints by 20th Century American artists . Dawdling gallerygoers , who could scarcely tell when night fell as the concealed lights filled the rooms with an almost perfect synthetic daylight , were tickled with everything . They got a familiar pleasure from such standard brands as George Luks 's gamey Mrs. Gamley , George Bellows ' Dempsey and Firpo , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old House by the Creek , Max Weber 's The Chinese Restaurant . Most of the 30 newly acquired works were new only to the Whitney Museum , added to the housewarming without spoiling the old home mood . <P> Biggest thing in the sculpture room was the late Gaston Lachaise 's tiptoeing , steatopygous , nude , Standing Woman ; one of the smallest was still the reductio ad absurdum of John B. Flannagan 's solid , amusingly diminutive Elephant ( see cut ) . <P> This week people who found the Whitney Museum 's selection of 20th-century painting already turning tamely classic could rush off to the Associated American Artists ' businesslike galleries , where to most of the 58 members of An American Group , Inc. classic was a fighting word . Their exhibition of paintings , sculpture and wood carvings was as up-to-the-minute as an air raid , often as violent and savage : <P> Sometimes they implied a misplaced sadism , like Louis Ribak 's Leading Citizens , in which a chunky citizen in shirt sleeves bullwhips a nude man lashed to a tree trunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's painting of a walkathon in which it was hard to tell the epicene men from the epicene women staggering in various stages of rawly colored collapse . <P> Sometimes they were self-consciously obscure , like Anton Refregier 's timely Invasion , in which a trio of Hieronymus Bosch-like monsters seem not to know what to do with a Soviet flag . <P> Adolf Dehn 's lyrical Lake in the Mountains , Lucile Blanch 's Mine in Clinch Mountains served as brave antidotes . <P> Ingenious was Aaron Goodelman 's clothes-pinlike Kultur ! ( see cut ) . <P> A small exhibition at the Neumann-Willard Gallery ( 24 carefully selected pieces ) combined old art and new with almost no jolts . A 15th-Century Christ in the Temple failed to clash with Marc Chagall 's pinkish fantasy , Flowers in a Dream , Max Beckmann 's strong modern Landscape with Factory or Clemente Orozco 's un-Orozcolike The " El " Station .
