Wiener Sngerknaben <P> Tourists who go to Vienna nowadays may pay a few schillings and wander fairly freely through the gloomy Imperial Palace . They may gaze to their heart 's content at the iron cot on which old Franz Josef slept , at the basin in which ample Maria Theresa bathed . But one wing in the Hofburg is barred to them . Tourists are not allowed to prowl through the rooms which belonged to Archduke Rudolf , Franz Josef 's son who died mysteriously at his hunting lodge at Mayerling . Rudolf 's rooms have not been preserved as a museum for tragic memories . They are occupied by 40 lively boys , the Wiener Sngerknaben ( Singing Boys of Vienna ) , a choir which Maximilian I founded in 1498 to supply music for his chapel . <P> Without the Habsburgs to subsidize them , the Wiener Sngerknaben have had to do what they could toward supporting themselves and last week 22 of the boys ranging from 9 to 12 arrived in the U. S. for a transcontinental tour . On the pier at Hoboken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sailor pants and reefers . They romped and spun tops while customs officials skimmed through their 22 valises in each of which bathrobe , towel , comb and handkerchiefs were packed exactly alike . Then , after sight-seeing Manhattan , the boys set out for Washington where Mrs. Hoover and many another notable heard them sing with expert unity and phrasing , saw them enact neatly and unaffectedly Bastien &; Bastienne , a fragile little opera which another Austrian boy , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , wrote when he was 12 . <P> Mozart was never one of the Wiener Sngerknaben but Haydn and Schubert had their first musical training in the choir school as did Clemens Krauss , natural son of an Archduke and a ballet dancer , who now directs the Vienna Opera . Haydn and Schubert had to leave the choir when their voices broke . The Habsburgs would not have their boy sopranos castrated although that was common practice elsewhere in 17th and 18th Century Europe . With the fall of the Habsburgs the choir disbanded , but six years later Father Josef Schnitt , a priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years fed , clothed and educated the boys out of his savings . <P> Most boy choirs existed because the Catholic Church would not permit women to sing in the sanctuary . The Wiener Sngerknaben sang nothing but ecclesiastical music until 1926 when Father Schnitt 's savings were gone and they went out giving concerts with an eye to the boxoffice . The blue- &-white; sailor costumes which the boys are wearing for the U. S. concerts are symbolic of the secular turn their programs have taken . ( In Washington last week they sang " The Star-Spangled Banner " and " Dixie . " ) Proceeds from their U. S. tour , to be taken in a bus labeled " Wiener Sngerknaben Special , " will go to the school , not to the boys . Yehudi Menuhin still asks for a strawberry ice-cream soda when he has finished a violin recital . When the Viennese boys sing well they get candy .
