In 1935 Communists the world over , including those in the U. S. , took a raincheck on revolution . Object : by joining a " united front " for capitalist democracy , to make the democracies allies of Soviet Russia against Fascist Italy , Nazi Germany and Imperialist Japan . Last week world Communists , including those in the U. S. , turned in the raincheck , came out from behind their false whiskers , and announced that they had just been fooling : they want their revolution after all . The new Communist name for revolution is " quick transition . " <P> Indicted Earl Browder , Communism 's No. 1 spokesman in the U. S. , made the announcement in Boston . Because it was Browder who spoke , his hearers knew that the " new party line " was really Moscow talking . A quick transition to socialism in the U. S. is now the object of his party , said he , returning to Joseph Stalin 's old theme : that the U. S. is ripe for collapse and revolutionary restitution . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicable for the capitalistic U. S. ) Earl Browder made no mention last week . Said he , abandoning Communist support of Roosevelt 's foreign and domestic policies : <P> " . . . Imperialist war . . . is tearing away the veils of hypocrisy behind which the monopoly capitalists were hiding their ruthless dictatorship . . . . Thus ' democratic ' America , even while it is technically neutral , forgets its liberal dream about a ' New Deal ' and loses itself in a wave of reactionary sentiment . . . . Only the working class , rising in alliance with the rest of the toiling population , and taking the decisions out of the hands of the capitalist class , can prevent war . . . . " <P> What moved Joe Stalin and his Earl Browder to doff their democratic whiskers was the Russo-German pact and the consequent reaction against the U. S. S. R. , in which Franklin Roosevelt shared last week ( see p. 15 ) . The Browder speech last week was the first realistic thing which he and his party have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Browder and friends , free again to take up their old cries of international class war , down-with-capitalism , etc. , were not in an altogether happy position . To portray Joseph Stalin 's totalitarian regime as the flower of revolutionary socialism will be as tough a thesis as it was to maintain for four years that " Communism is Twentieth Century Americanism.
