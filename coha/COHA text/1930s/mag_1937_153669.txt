The four-year-old struggle between Dictator Hitler and the Confessional Synod , Germany 's anti-Nazi Protestant Church , has been a clash between ruthlessness and spunky defiance . Last week , however , the Third Reich tried a Confessional leader in a way that would have brought credit to any Government . <P> Up before an emergency court in Berlin was Rev. Dr. Friedrich Otto Dibelius. eminent theologian and general superintendent of the Confessional Synod . He was charged by Nazi Church-Minister Hans Kerrl with publishing a letter last winter falsely accusing Minister Kerrl of mocking , in a public speech , that ABC of Christian doctrine-that Jesus is the Son of God . Three competent attorneys appeared for Dr. Dibelius ; the public was admitted except when Minister Kerrl was present ; the press was admitted throughout the trial . <P> The Church Minister , supported by two chief assistants , mumbled and blustered . He could not remember exactly what he had said in his speech but how could Dr. Dibelius know-he was not there . Six witnesses , however , backed the defendant : two stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one produced painstaking notes that he had taken down at the time . Dr. Dibelius won another point by revealing that he had sent a copy of the accusing letter , before its publication , to Adolf Hitler and other Cabinet members , had received no replies forbidding or otherwise . For eight hours the debate surged back &; forth . Finally , the court , hinting that Dr. Dibelius had come " pretty near the truth , " acquitted him . <P> This acquittal sharpened interest in the trial scheduled for this week , of the Rev. Dr. Martin Niemller , fiery ex-U-boat commander arrested last March on " still more serious charges . " Since Dr. Niemoller has long been the spearhead of the Confessional movement many Churchmen regarded the unexceptionable handling of Dr. Dibelius ' trial as disingenuous window-dressing , wherein the Nazis deliberately threw a small fish back into the pond , while they went right ahead with their plans to land a whale . <P> This seemed to be the opinion of several hundred of Niemoller parishioners in tree-lined Dahlem , a Berlin suburb . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulpit an announcement that enraged them-the special prayer meeting they had planned to hold that evening for their imprisoned leader had been banned by police . <P> Quickly organizing a march of protest , the parishioners streamed into the street . Police were soon on the spot , ordered them to disperse . When the marchers refused , 75 women , 40 men at the head of the procession were dragged off to police headquarters where their names were recorded , after which , according to police reports , they were released . Because this was the first mass demonstration on record against a Reich decree . Nazi bigwigs grew panicky . Fearing that there might be an even bigger demonstration outside the Court House while Pastor Niemller was on the stand they discreetly postponed the trial .
