BRANCH RICKEY , president and manager of the St. Louis Cardinals , covered his eyes with his hands . He could not bear to look . Out there on the infield at the Polo Grounds , his second baseman and batting star , Rogers Hornsby , was lying unconscious . Johnny Lavan , the St. Louis shortstop , had fielded a grounder , and the ball , which he had thrown mechanically , without taking time to look , had struck Hornsby on the head . Only the night before , Rickey had been offered $350,000 for Hornsby . That is a lot of money , no matter what your background . And what was Rickey 's background ? Born in a small Ohio town , his parents had made great sacrifices so he could go to school and college . The Rickeys always had to count their nickels . And here was a Rickey , president of a poverty-stricken baseball club , a club deep in debt , offered $350,000 for one player . Rickey had met Charles A. Stoneham , president of the New York Giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Broadway . With Stoneham were Manager John J. McGraw and Judge Francis X. McQuade , of the New York club , and Oscar Cooper , a banker . Stoneham 's first offer was $150,000 , but Rickey laughed and stood firm even when Stoneham berated him for a foolhardy and irresponsible club president . " Your board of directors will hang you for betraying their trust , " Stoneham told him . " You must have a price  --  what is it ? " " Half a million dollars , " Rickey replied , and it was Stoneham 's turn to laugh . But he raised his bid to $200,000 , then $300,000 and finally $350,000 . " You , the president of one of the richest clubs in the world , offer me three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the greatest player in the business , " Rickey said . " Hornsby is an established star and you have a wealthy club in a great population center . My club is poor . But poor as we are and small though our city is , I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been in only four or five games . I 'll give you one hundred thousand dollars for Frank Frisch . Or I 'll give you Hornsby if you 'll give me Frisch and two hundred thousand dollars . " McGraw vetoed that proposition and the conference broke up . How a Baseball Idea Was Born I ' Rickey never forget those moments on the bench , " Rickey said afterward . " Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars suddenly mobilized out there on the turf at the Polo Grounds . They were large silver dollars . They had arms and legs and wings and faces that mocked at me . They did squads right and squads left , and right oblique and left oblique . They turned cartwheels , and as they rushed on their way , out toward the exits and over the fences , each one laughed at me . " Hornsby recovered , but I did n't . Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars , and I had offered one hundred thousand dollars for Frisch . A total of four hundred and fifty thousand dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men , I could sell them to Stoneham for four hundred and fifty thousand dollars . But 1 had no Frisch and , I feared , then , I no longer had a Hornsby . " But I said to myself that I could find other Hornsbys and other Frisches . I would find them young , but I could find them and develop them . Pick them from the sand lots and keep them until they became stars . All I needed was the place to train them . " That 's how the idea of chain-store baseball was born , on that afternoon at the Polo Grounds in the summer of 1919 . Sired by necessity , the idea has carried the Cardinals from poverty and a sea of red ink to affluence and championships . On that afternoon when Hornsby was knocked unconscious , the Cardinals owed $150,000 and he was their only player worth important money . Today the Cardinals are champions of the baseball world for the third time in nine years , during which they have won five National League pennants . They expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry , of the Giants , Charley Grimm , of the Cubs , and Pie Traynor , of the Pirates , building and planning for the coming race , build and think in terms of beating St. Louis . The Cardinals are not standing pat just because they won the 1934 pennant and world series . The process of rebuilding , of adding strength here and there , has been going on through the winter . Many promising young athletes who could have been sold to other clubs for fancy prices will report to Manager Frisch at Bradenton , Florida . Center-field trouble developed in the St. Louis machine last season and Rickey has attended to that . Baseball scouts will tell you that the best young center fielder in the minors last year was Terry Moore , of Columbus . He is the answer to a scout 's prayer . He can throw a baseball into a barrel at 100 yards , is a ten-second sprint man and can hit a ball a country mile . Last spring , in an exhibition game with his uncles , the Cardinals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only time the feat ever was accomplished . Moore will be one of many . There will be young pitchers , catchers , infielders and outfielders , knocking at the big-league door . If they are ready for the majors , the door will be opened and they will be added to the Cardinal roster or sold to rival clubs . Replacements for any need are easily available now . No longer is it necessary to scour the minors or bid in the open market against the wealthier clubs . When a weak spot develops through the failure of a man to measure up to big-league requirements or because a veteran is fading , Rickey sends orders to Rochester , Columbus and Houston for delivery of the cream of the year 's crop . The manager then picks the men he wants to keep . .8 Treasury of Horsehide Recruits AjE THEN Chick Hafey developed contract trouble V V and Sam Breadon ordered him sold or traded , Rickey summoned half a dozen outfielders . Joe Medwick , from Houston , was one of them and he made good immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manager Frisch asked for help , Rickey summoned Johnny Rothrock from Columbus , and he knew his man . Johnny played every inning of every game for the 1934 Cardinals . When Sunny Jim Bottomley seemed to be on the down grade with a salary that was rather high , James Ripped Collins was called from Rochester and , after a short apprenticeship , he replaced Bottomley as the regular first baseman , making Bottomley available as trading material . Charley Gelbert suffered an accident while hunting after the 1932 season , forcing him out of baseball when he was reaching the peak . The Cardinals were not prepared within the organization to replace so young a man , so Rickey selected Leo Durocher , of Cincinnati , as the shortstop he wanted and obtained his services by giving Pitchers Paul Derringer and Allyn Stout  --  two farm products  --  and Infielder Sparky Adams . The Cardinals have money now . Before the Rickey idea began to function , it was necessary to economize in every possible way . The Cardinals lived at the cheapest respectable hotels they could find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few pitchers , were given lower berths , but if you were a , rookie player or a rookie newspaperman , you rode from city to city in an upper . Today , if one of the better hotels does n't give the boys the service to which they have become accustomed since leaving La Plata , Missouri , or Sylacauga , Alabama , the Cardinals move to another . Instead of crowding into the uppers and lowers of one Pullman car , the team uses only the lowers , frequently having three cars to itself . In the old days , business was transacted by mail . Today Rickey flies from farm to farm , and has asked Breadon to buy him an airplane . At regular intervals , business managers are summoned from the chain stores for round-table conferences at the St. Louis headquarters . Transportation , telephone and telegraph bills stagger the office help each month . The Cardinals ' Acres of Diamond Stars DRANCH RICKEY did it all with his chain-store idea . The Cardinals now have developmentfarms in leagues of every classification . They own the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Association , and Houston in the Texas League , the three big proving grounds . Their holdings in smaller leagues include Springfield , Missouri ; Greensboro , North Carolina ; Huntington , West Virginia ; Greensburg , Pennsylvania ; and besides these clubs , owned outright , there are optional agreements with more than a dozen others in various small leagues , from which the outstanding stare will . be graduated to larger circuits , until they are ready for the major-league tests in St. LOWS uniforms . There is today no more important figure in baseball than Branch Rickey , the penniless president of the struggling Cardinals of 1919 . When he goes to a major or minor league meeting , club owners , managers and scouts wait upon him . They ask his advice and are eager to buy his players . At the recent minor-league convention at Louisville , there was a line of seven mon in the lobby of the Brown Hotel , waiting for a few words with Branch Rickey . He and his party , including scouts , club presidents and managers , occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the National League presidency when John A. Hoydler resigned . If or when Above  --  Rogers Hornsby and the , Lads Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis retires , Rickey will be the outstanding candidate for the commissioner 's job . When the St. Louis National League club , in a badly run-down condition , was purchased in 1917 from Mrs. Helen Hathaway Robison Britton , it was a civic enterprise , to prevent the sale of the team to outsiders . There was a ballyhoo dinner at the Mercantile Club and teams of stock salesmen were formed . The Knothole Gang Idea , conceived by J. C. Jones , a St. Louis attorney , was explained . Anyone buying a share  --  of stock at twenty-five dollars was to have the right to give a season 's pass to some deserving boy , so that the youngsters of the community could have their big-league baseball without having to depend on knotholes in the fence . There was to be a Knothole Gang and the memberswould develop into loyal Cardinal fans who , in later years , would keep the turnstiles busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be 375,000 , but the early stock-selling drive netted only $50,000 . However , Mrs. Britton really wanted to sell and agreed to accept the amount . Rickey resigned his position as business manager of the Browns , the American League club in St. Louis , and became president of the Cardinals . To make the road rougher for the project , the country went to war , Rickey entered the service , and when he returned in January , 1919 , he found the Cardinals in a. bad way . The 1918 team had finished last in the pennant race and the turnstiles had rusted for lack of customers . The cash box was empty , Major Rickey was broke , too , and because there was no money to pay a manager , Rickey , along with the duties of president , assumed the task of directing the team on the field . A spring training trip to Florida or Texas was out of the question . There was no money for railroad fare . And so it was decided to condition the athletes in St. Louis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continued on PLIff ? 891 ( Continued from Page 87 ) The band struck up for the big number , and Mary Long came out with all her grace and charm , and danced better than she had danced in a long time . And everything was quickly returning to its normal state . Only Aunt Emma was not very pleased . " Well , now the baby 's gone , I guess we can go too . I hope you do n't want to stay to see those legs dancing when my feet are hurting me so . " " No . All right , we 'll go , " said Uncle Jim amiably . And with that they paid their check , and as they were passing out through the hallway , the cigarette girl said , " Cigars . Cigarettes . " And An angel came along in the person of A. M. Diez , a stockholder who had made a fortune out of shoe findings . He was a baseball fan and , as a sporting proposition , agreed to advance enough money to finance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season drew near , the problem of equipping the team with uniforms arose . It was out of the question to buy a set of new ones . The money advanced by Diez had been used to feed the players , transport them to and from the university campus and to provide baseballs and bats . The cash box was empty again . Rickey rummaged around among the uniforms of the 1918 season and found a dozen that could be patched and repaired . He canvassed the sporting-goods houses until he found one that agreed to match the old ones as nearly and as cheaply as possible and to extend credit . And so , with half the squad wearing old uniforms and with Rickey serving as manager and president to save money , the Cardinals went to the baseball wars of 1919 . It was no wonder that Charles A. Stoneham confidently expected to buy Rogers Hornsby . With not even enough money to provide the smaller necessities of baseball life , it was natural that the Cardinals found themselves severely handicapped as they sought to build up the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional bargain , there were many difficulties . First Link in the Cardinal Chain At that early time , Rickey had convinced the baseball world that he was an unusually keen observer , an astute judge of ball players . His chief scout , Charley Barrett , was just as outstanding when it came to seeing future greatness in the awkward youths of the minor leagues , the sand lots or the college campus . But in effect , Rickey and Barrett frequently found that they were serving other clubs , indirectly , but effectually . Barrett would see possibilities in a young player and inquire as to the sale price . Perhaps the minor-league-club owner or manager had not seen the hall mark of a Hornsby or a Sisler or a Grove in the player , but when the astute Barrett . made inquiries , that was different . Scouts of the wealthier clubs would be informed that Branch Rickey and Charley Barrett had made an offer for Pitcher Joe Doque . If Barrett offered $3000 for Doque , he must be worth more than that to a club with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'd like to smoke a good cigar . " " Well , I declare , " said Aunt Emma . " You ai n't smoked a cigar in years . Be careful it do n't make you sick . " " No , " said Uncle Jim . " I do n't get sick any more . " And now the place was sailing along with all its gaiety and racket , The band was as noisy as it could be . The drummer was beating his drums with fierce violence . The girls were stamping out their dance with a pounding rhythm . They were beating on the floor as though they were determined to wear it out ; pounding the boards into splinters . money , and time and again Barrett would come back empty-handed from his bargain-hunting trips , having learned that Joe Doque had been sold for two or three times $3000 to New York , Detroit or Chicago . When , despite handicaps , promising players were picked up , the Cardinals found it difficult to keep them during the necessary period of development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players to minor-league teams under optional agreements . This amounts to a loan of the player 's services ; the minor-league club , in return , giving the player instruction in the fine points of the game . This arrangement does not always work out satisfactorily . Good pitchers are overworked by overzealous minor-league managers . Others are neglected . Minor-league clubs make much of their profits , or did when there was profit in the business , by selling young stars to the majors . Naturally , they prefer to devote their time and attention to players whom they own outright . Rickey visualized a chain of minor-league teams of various classifications , a kindergarten , grade school , preparatory school and a university of baseball , which eventually would graduate shining Phi Beta Kappa students of the game ? Hornshys , Frisches , Sisters , Cobbs , Speakers and Mathewsonswho would lift the Cardinals out of the doldrums of red ink and who could be sold to the Stonehams , Rupperts and Nevins for battalions of silver dollars . Rickey talked about his dream at every opportunity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man was Sam Breadon , aggressive , with a square jaw and a willingness to back up his judgment with his dollars . Breadon , a former bank clerk who moved from New York to St .. Louis in 1904 and decided that the automobile industry offered more to a young man than did a bookkeeper 's stool , was one of tho early investors in the Knothole Gang Idea . He bought eighty shares in 1917 , investing $2000 . He was a baseball fan as well as a successful business man , and though the Cardinals were staggering on their way , he saw the possibilities of the future . In 1920 he put $5000 more into the chili , became a member of the board of directors and looked around for other blocks of stock . Breadon quickly became outstanding among the stockholders because of his interest , his enthusiasm and his holdings , and on January 13 , 1920 , he replaced Rickey as president . Through that year and the next he increased his They hammered away with all the force and might that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as loud as they could , announcing to all the world that this was Harry 's Broadway Cabaret , famous for its syncope , tion , famous for its jazz , famous for its girls , its dancers  --  famous for everybody . And Barytone Barry joined in , crying out the words of the song as loud as he could cry . Through all this din and racket , Fuller leaned across the table to his wife . He touched her hand lightly to attract her attention , and he said , " It 's a funny thing how quiet it has become since the mother took the kid away . " holdings , and in November , 1922 , he bought 1048 shares of common stock from J. C. Jones , thereby gaining a controlling interest . Rickey 's idea was just a dream to most of the stockholders , but to Sam Breadon it was something real , with a dollars-and-cents fabric , and in February , 1921 , the two men forged the first link in the Cardinal chain . They purchased 50 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from E. C. Landgraf , for $20,000 . At last the Cardinals had a place where young players could be sent for development , and so many promising juvenile stars were found and placed that in October of the same year the board of directors voted to further the project . They placed a fund of $25,000 at the disposal of the president and manager , to he used at their discretion for buying players and to increase minor-league holdings . Pitcher Knocks Himself Out Rickey and Breadon soon discovered that the 50 per cent arrangement was not satisfactory . James Leroy Bottomley , who wrote from Nokomis , Illinois , that he thought he could play major-league baseball if he had an opportunity , was given the chance , and by the time he graduated to Syracuse , it was evident that he was to be a star . Landgraf had continued as president at Syracuse , and when major-league clubs began to make attractive offers for Bottomley , Landgraf wanted to accept . It was with great difficulty that he was persuaded to return Bottomley , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him and farmed him to Syracuse . Experience at Houston in the Texas League also proved the folly of trying to operate with only a part interest in a chain store . From California had come a sturdy young fellow named Charles Hafey . Hafey reported as a pitcher , but Rickey , sitting in the grandstand during a morning workout , quickly classi tied him properly . Branch heard the crack of a bat against a baseball that was particularly sweet to his ears and saw a line drive whack against the lumber in the left-field bleachers . " Judas Priest. , who hit that ball ? " he wanted to know . " That 's a boy named llafey , from California , " Old Joe Sugden replied . " He 's a pitcher . " " You mean he was a pitcher , " Rickey replied . " Tell him he 's no longer one . // He 's an outfielder . Throw away his too plate and buy him sun glasses . " It was law , and liafey became an outfielder . He went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first investment there was the purchase of nineteen shares of a total of 100 for $19,000 . The holdings were increased until the Cardinals owned 59 per cent . However , because of objections within the Texas League to ownership by persons in a higher circuit , the stock was in a strew man 's name . Haley became a sensational hitter at Houston , and Rickey awoke one morning to learn that the president of the Texas League club was inclined and eager to sell the slugger to a rival major-league club for 535,000 . The Curdinals were at a disadvantage . They could not shout from the housetops that they owned 59 per cent of the stock and that the club president . was not doing right by them in selling Hafey . So they had to dig into their left pocket and pay $35,000 to Houston , their pain being alleviated in part by the fact that .59 per cent of the purchase price eventually found its way into their right pocket . It was apparent that ' straw men and part . ownership were not satisfactory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other 50 per cent of the Syracuse stock , and the Cardinals then challenged the situation at Houston . Increasing their holdings there to 90 per cent , they called for a showdown , opened their books , showed what the stock had cost , what they had spent for a new baseball plant , had a fair price set by an impartial committee and asked the league to buy them out or forever keep its peace . No one advanced to pay the fair price of approximately $500,000 and the Cardinal ownership of the Houston club has been out in the open ever since . Expansion of the chain of farms might have been impossible if it had not been for a profitable year at the box office in 1922 . The club was beginning to show the results of Rickey 's careful planning and shrewd trading , and when it made a noise Like a pennant contender , half a million persons attended the home games , almost as many the contests on the road , and the books at the end of the season showed a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing that Riekey 's idea was not an empty dream , here was the proof . The final payment to Mrs. Britton was made in 1923 , the club was out of debt and the business of expansion continued . Sioux City , Iowa , was added to the chain in 1924 , and in 1925 the Cardinals owned that farm , all of Fort . Smith , Arkansas , all of Syracuse and 90 per cent of Houston . Then , in 1926 , after a total of $160 , - 000 had been invested in minor-league holdings , the Cardinals won St. Louis ' first pennant in thirty-eight years . On that . Cardinal squad of twenty-five players , fifteen had spent all of their baseball careers in the St. Louis organization . There was not a man on the team who had cost more than $10,000 . It was tangible proof that players could be picked green , trained , polished and developed into valuable major leaguers . Rickey had stepped down as field manager when the Cardinals gained their great triumph of 1926 . If Rickey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his players . He talked over their heads . His baseball was sound , Rogers Hornsby recently said there was n't a smarter man in baseball than Rickey , that he Was always a jump or two ahead of the opposition . He also was far ahead of his men in his ideas . They never quite caught up with him . The team was in last place in 1925 when Breadon persuaded Rickey to turn over the managerial reins to Hornsby and take the full-time job of business manager . Hornsby , practical and unimaginative , took the excellent club that Rickey had built and quickly whipped it into a pennant contender . he recalled Shortstop Tommy Thevenow from Syracuse , arranged a trade with the Cubs for Catcher Bob O'Farrell , claimed the great Grover Cleveland Alexander from the Cubs for the waiver price  --  a mere $4000 ? traded Heine Mueller to the Giants for Billy South-worth , and in 1926 led his men to a pennant and the world championship . The country 's baseball fans still talk about that world series and the dramatic seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Persons who saw the contest will never forget the picture as Grover Cleveland Alexander trudged from the bull pen through an October mist and saved the championship for the Cardinals . Bases Full , Lazzeri Up Alexander  --  Old Pete to his teammates  --  had pitched . a full game the day before and followed with a night full of celebration , an old Alexander custom . Hornsby feared the combination might have impaired the efficiency of the great right arm , but in the seventh inning , when Jess Haines developed a blister on a pitching finger , Hornsby called a halt and signaled to the bull pen for Old Pete . " People always ask me what I said to Alec when I went out to meet him , " Hornsby explains . " I left my position and met him halfway between the hull pen and the infield . I wanted to find out if he could see . He recognized me all right , which was encouraging . He had been dozing in the bull pen , but his eyes were about open when he met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that the bases were filled , two out in the seventh inning , with Lazzeri ut bat . I had told him he was our best bet and that , if we needed help , I 'd call him . " ' Do n't worry , Rog , ' Alec told me . ' I guess there 's nothing to do but give Lazzeri a lot of trouble . ' And so , after I saw that he could see and walk , and did n't have anything in his hip pocket , I told him to go in and pitch . " Alexander took five practice pitches , struck out Lazzeri with the bases filled , to end that dramatic inning , and then turned back the Yankees for two more innings to make the underdog Cardinals champions . " And there never will be another thrill like that one for any of the Cardinals of 1926 , " Hornsby confided . Now there was money to carry out the chain-store idea in a big way , and Rickey made the most of it . Each year there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituted . In 1928 Syracuse was sold and Rochester bought in its place . The chain also included Houston , Danville , Laurel , Waynesboro , Fort Wayne , Scottdale and Shawnee , and the investment in minor-league holdings amounted to ? 946,000 . At first baseball ridiculed Rickey and his idea . Then opposition crystallized . It was encountered first at Houston , where , as told , the other club owners legislated against the entry of major-league capital , Later Judge Landis took up the cudgel . But by that time the Cardinals had established property rights and an order to discontinue would have been tantamount to confiscation . Other clubs , too , were adopting the idea , and finally the commissioner , though ho never has changed his mind , was forced to surrender , as far as active opposition was concerned . Final victory for the chain-store idea was gained when the major leagues at joint session forced into their agreement with the commissioner a clause in which it was stipulated that he would treat all player transfers alike , whether or not they involved minor-league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This ended the last threat to the chain store as part of the structure of organized baseball , and since then the building has been done with confidence . The New York Yankees have a chain and Tom Yaw key , new owner of the Boston Red Sox , is building one . It has been said that local ownership of minor-league clubs is the ideal situation ; that it is not proper for one club to control as many players as are at the beck and call of the Cardinals ; that advancement of players in their profession is blocked or hindered by all the strings attached to them by the St. Louis organization . Rickey replies that the Cardinals turned to the chain-store idea as a matter of self-preservation . If a near monopoly exists now , there was a worse one in the field when the Cardinals were unable to compete with the checkbooks of the wealthy Giants , Yankees , Tigers and White Sox , he contends . Rickey denies all the allegations against his idea . He can prove that players are not retarded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major leagues more than seventy-two players who had been found by the Cardinals or trained in what flippant critics call Rickey 's Chain Gang . Baseball 's Proving Ground The annual surplus of talent has been used to good advantage . In 1928 , St. Louis needed a catcher to replace O'Farrell . Young players from the farms were used in an exchange with the Philadelphia National League club whereby Jimmy Wilson was obtained by the Cardinals . Similar deals have been made when the need arose . The Cardinals sold Pitcher Bill Lee to the Cubs , Pitcher Fritz Ostermueller to the Red Sox , Bob Worthington to the Braves . When the major-league teams gather shortly in spring training camps , there will be dozens of Cardinal-grown players trying for positions . In lean years these sales have balanced the budget for the larger farms . Rickey and his chain-store idea saved many a minor-league club , even leagues , from the scrap heap during the depression . Loans were made to clubs and to entire leagues , to carry them through a season . In return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the year . These arrangements were not always profitable . But the far-sighted Rickey realized that without the minor leagues , baseball soon would dry up at the roots and die . With no grade or high schools , there would be no use for a university , and munh of the Cardinal attention has been devoted to the Class D and C leagues , the grade schools of baseball training . Each year the Cardinals sponsor free-for-all trial camps or training ( Continued from Past , 90 ) schools in various parts of the country . In 1919 the youth with baseball ambitions thought only of playing with the ( Inuits , Yankees , Tigers or White Sox . But Rickey has made the youth of the land Cardinal-minded . Winter and summer , the mail brings letters , from young men who want to play baseball . And the Cardinals answer all letters . In 1034 more than 450 rookies reported at the Cardinals ' spring camps , 85 per cent of whom had never before signed a baseball contract . For them the Cards were opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball career . Four schooling and trial camps were held during the summer , attended by almost 1000 boys with no previous professional experience . Seldom have the Cardinals encountered serious competition in persuading young men that their chain stores opened up the widest and easiest avenue to the majors . Rickey has a way with men . A college graduate , a former professional player , former baseball coach at the University of Michigan , an attorney and a fine public speaker , he has a compelling personality . The average father , after an hour 's conversation with Branch Rickey , jumps at the chance to intrust his son 's future to the man . Riekey can sway an audience . He ca n't find time to accept a fraction of the speaking engagements he is invited to fill . The first order of business for the program committee at any civic , fraternal , church or athletic function is to ask Rickey to make an inspirational address . Lulu Loses Out Jack Smith , an outfielder with the club several yea.i.s ago , had a high regard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter that he was not satisfied with the contract offered . He journeyed to St. Louis and informed the newspapers that he was a holdout . A week passed without a conference between the player and Rickey , Smith still reporting from his hotel stronghold that ho was a steadfast holdout . Finally a friendly scribe suggested that Jack ought to visit Rickey at the Cardinal office and save himself time and money by trying to reach a compromise agreement . Not me , " Smith replied . " I ai n't going to see Mr. Rickey . Five minutes ? with him and I 'll sign anything he hands me and I wo n't be a holdout any more . " Rickey , feeling responsibility as guardian of the young men in the organization , frequently makes clubhouse talks to warn and arm them against temptation . Occasionally a youth takes him seriously . Clarence Heinol Mueller , a product of the St. Louis municipal diamonds . signed a Cardinal contract , went to training camp with other young men who had been chased to the train by the cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heine had relatives , including a comely girl cousin , in the town where the team was training , and that evening , after the day 's practice , he was escorting Cousin Lulu to an ice-cream parlor . As he approached the parlor he saw Rickey walking down the street in his direction . Unceremoniously , Heine pushed Cousin Lulu into the nearest doorway , with orders to stay put , and then sauntered away to avoid his manager . When Rickey disappeared , Heine returned and found the girl cousin indignant . " I do n't earn how mad you got , " Heine retorted . " That was Mr. Branch Rickey , manager from the St. Louis Cardinale , coming down the street , and , after all , I 'm down here already to train for the Redbirds , not to run around with women . " Thoroughness marks the Cardinal training and trial camps . Managers , scouts , club executives and coaches attend , and each boy is card-indexed . Each is watched and checked individually , and if , at the nightly conferences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single asset , he is retained for further trial . Few stars have slipped through the hands of the St. Louis owners , once they have been caught in the great dragnet . Lonnie Warneke , of the Cubs , was an exception . He once belonged to the Cardinals . A slender youth ' from Arkansas , with a burning fast ball , he was sent to Houston , then shunted to Laurel , Mississippi , tagged as a fine prospect . A Find Who Got Away Laurel 's manager did not see the future greatness in Warneke . He informed St. Louis that he was about to dispose of the young pitcher to a club outside the organization . The card index at headquarters showed that Warneke from the beginning had been labeled as having promise . A scout was sent to Laurel to pass final judgment . He grudgingly gave his consent to the release and Warneke passed out of the organization , to develop later into a brilliant master of pitching . But the mistake served a purpose . In annual instructions to camp inspectors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball at that early date . Let there be no such blunders in the future . At the outset , the Cardinals , wanting to make the farm clubs as nearly self-supporting as possible , knew that it was essential to have the good will of the customers in the minors . They decided , therefore , never to take an important player from a farm during the playing season . At the end of the pennant race , the fans expect and want to see their heroes graduate . But never , during a season , have the Cards wrecked or impaired a farm team by taking away a player , no matter how crying the need in St. Louis might be . Minor-league clubs in the chain have had more than their own share of success . Rochester , shortly after it came under St. Louis ownership , won three consecutive pennants . Houston won in the Texas League and also gained the Dixie Series championship under the Cardinal banner . Columbus won American Association titles and the Little World Series , in competition with the International League , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minor leagues , there are more requests than the Cardinals can take care of , for assistance and ownership . The 1934 personnel of the Redbirds proved how well Rickey builded . St. Louis dashed gallantly down the stretch to win the pennant and make Bill Terry and the Giants sick of all wisecracks , and especially those concerning the presence of Brooklyn in the league . Theri the Cardinals defeated Detroit in a dramatic . seven-game world series and the chain-store stamp was on the outstanding Cardinal heroes . Dizzy and Paul Dean , who pitched the National League team to victory , each winning twe games and the hearts of the country outside of Michigan , were picked up as boys and trained in the Cardinal chain stores . " Me and Paul " are being hailed as the outstanding box-office attraction in baseball , successors to Babe Ruth . Babe cost the Yankees $125,000 . " Me and Paul " cost the Cardinals nothing but a few headaches . Bill DeLancey , the juvenile catcher , who did all of the backstopping in the series , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medwick , hard-hitting left fielder and idol of the Detroit fruit and produce merchants , was found on a Jersey sand lot and developed at Scottdale , Pennsylvania , and Houston . Collins , the first baseman , became Cardinal property when St. Louis sold Syracuse and obtained Rochester and its roster . John Leonard Pepper Martin , who galloped to national fame in the 1931 world series as the Wild Horse of the Osage , making a one-man show of the victory over Connie Mack 's Athletics , also was a product of the chain stores , costing only the trouble of developing him and teaching him that a Pullman car was safer than riding the rods . Two of the infielders were obtained in trades . Frisch became a Cardinal in the 1926 Hornsby trade . Durocher figured in the 1933 swap with Cincinnati . Chick Fullis was the only St. Louis outfielder in the series developed outside the organization . Color and courage are two assets the Cardinals are glad to find in rookies , and the team of today has both in large quantities . The Deans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stretch , during which St. Louis won twenty of its last twenty-five games . And when Detroit was leading , three games to two , in the rough-and-tumble world series , Capt . Leo Durocher remarked that the situation was made to order for the Cardinals . " We have n't cracked on a hill yet , " he said . " When the fighting gets tough , that 's where we shine . " 77t ? Breadon , Rickey The Breadon-Rickey combination has been an efficient one . Rickey , whose contract calls for a share of the profits , has a free hand in shifting , trading , buying and selling players . He has a blackboard , covering one wall of his office , on which transfers are posted during the winter trading months . He consults Breadon only when a deal involves first-line strength . Breadon decides questions of business policy and hires and fires managers . As Rickey 's shrewdness is a byword with baseball people , so is Brea-don 's luck . Every time Breadon meets a dilemma  --  and he has tackled many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solid gold , diamond-studded horn in either hand . Rogers Hornsby was sitting in the city 's lap after leading the Cardinals to the 1926 triumphs , and when Breeden , two months later , traded the Rajah to New York for Frisch , because harmony did n't live there any more , the indignation was tremendous . Pro Bono Publico , Vox Populi and Beowulf Q. Phan vowed never to make another turnstile click . The customers were determined to show Breadon he could n't do that to their Rogers Hornsby . But Frisch , in 1927 , was the greatest second baseman and probably the best player in the business ; the Cardinals finished just a nose behind the pennant winners without Hornsby and the turnstiles clicked merrily . During a controversy with the Browne over the rental of Sportsman 's Park  --  owned by the American League club  --  because a clerk forgot to mail a check Broaden had.signed a month before as he departed for a Florida ye-cation , Sam bought an abandoned quarry and was prepared to turn it eventually into the site for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building boom came along , the quarry was used profitably as a dumping ground by excavators and became a valuable property , as it paid for itself several times over in fees from the dump trucks . Subsequently , the Browns enlarged their park , adding materially to its seating capacity , but it was Breadon and the Cardinals who cashed in on the improvements , because the next year the Redbirds won the pennant . There was indignation when Breadon demoted Bob O'Farrell after one year as manager for finishing second , and then traded him to the Giants , but George Harper , obtained in the swap , had the best year of his career and his batting carried the team to the 1928 pennant . Nothing Succeeds Like Success Fans stormed again when Breeden fired Bill McKechnie after the Cardinals won that pennant , but Breadon picked Gabby Street from nowhere , and again the customers forgot their resentment when the Old Sergeant won two flags and a world title in 1930 and 1931 . Street , in turn , was fired to the tune of the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1933 , drove the Cardinals and the Dazzling Deans to the 1934 world championship . If success is a convincer , the customers believe now in Breadon 's judgment and luck . The value of the Cardinals has grown tremendously since that afternoon in 1919 when a vision of 350,000 silver dollars swayed Branch Rickey . Recently Tom Yawkey , of Boston , bought Joe Cronin from Clark Griffith , of Washington , and good authority has it that the price was $250,000 and a $35,000 player . Using that as a basis of values , Rickey and Breadon could get back more than the 1917 pur-chase price of the Cardinals if they wanted to part with Dizzy and Paul Dean . If they chose to sell on a wholesale scale , they undoubtedly could clear half a million dollars and still have their franchise , minor-league clubs and a respectable roster of players . Lew H. Wentz , Oklahoma multimillionaire , recently negotiated for the purchase of Sam Breadon 's holdings , approximately 77 per cent of the stock . The price was to be $1,000,000 , and except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly scarce , that would have been a bargain . Breadon said he was glad Wentz did n't buy  --  that the club was worth $2,000,000 . At the three larger minor-league farms  --  Rochester , Columbus and Houston  --  real estate and new baseball plants represent a total investment of $1,200,000 . Baseball men will tell you that if times were more nearly normal , the Cardinal property , at a conservative estimate , would be worth $2,500,000 . Hero is a team which has won five pennants and three world championships under four different managers in nine years , with other triumphs ahead , an artistic as well as a financial success . And Branch Rickey did it .
