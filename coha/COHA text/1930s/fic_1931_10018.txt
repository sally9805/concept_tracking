THE CHURCH WAS NEW , with a broad white nave . The wooden saints that flanked it had faces as red as fire . More shame to Annick , said Papa . For it was she who had been obliging enough to retouch their faded countenances . A wave of shame rose in her whenever she passed the gaudy Christophein the vestry door . In time they would fade , but to her it was a source of great anguish that while Charlotte 's children were small , at least , this would be one of the family jokes and jibes . All through their childhood they would hear Papa talkingabout it , and somehow this might alter their opinion of her . It might even give them a frivolous conception of religion . It might in some way lessen the dignity of God . With bowed head and clasped hands she was advancing to take the sacrament at the altar , when she heard a titter rippling under the bowed round hats of Charlotte 's children in their pew . Her heart was suddenly stricken cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furtive look in their direction . Their heads were shamelessly lifted from their hands , and they were stifling their laughter at the sight of the enfant de choeur who had tripped upon his gown and fallen flat on the steps of the altar . With measured step she advanced , her thoughts inP31lief turning again to God , her steps bringing her to the test 's encrusted robe and to the delicate flesh of Christ which stroked down the lifted waiting tongues . In ecstasy did Marthe follow her sister down the aisle . nnick 's head had been bowed , but Marthe 's hung low likec humblest servant of God . Annick 's step had been slow , but Marthe 's feet moved as if she trod a shining path . Her elbows re held far from her trim grey suit , her fingers were clasped if in an agony of delight , and under her lids her eyes rolled back and forth . Once at the altar she fell with the greatest abandon upon her knees and the stormiest emotions used her bosom to rise and fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others she flung back her head , riling her long full throat , her jaw fell open and the flesh the Saviour slipped easily down into her very soul . For a full minute after he had passed her by she held the lace curtain of c altar under her chin , her fingers trembling with ecstasy . With what emotion she swayed back and blindly stumbled to the family 's pew . She fell quivering against Bridget , seek-g out her hand . Sedately , with dignified tread , Annick resumed her seat. cc a month she took the sacrament , but every Sundayart he reeled to the altar with an emotion that never lessened , flinging herself in the most terrible abasement at the feet of the priest . With a breath of relief the children 's heads suddenly lifted from their hands , and they all filed demurely out into the courtyard of the church : Maman and Papa and the three girls ; Bridget and Nicolas , Charlotte and Jean , with the four childrenmaking their four abrupt bows as they passed the holy place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disclosing r smile . She broke into talk . Her breasts rose , swelling thegold tulips of her blouse , her fingers flew over the buttons ofchildren 's jackets , shaking light through their hair aspulled off their tight hats and tossed them away into the iting surrey . " Yes , Maman , you must drive with us . Yes , yes , Papa , you t drive back with us . Jean will be so glad . " Monique had pressed softly in among them with her face low them and her small head turned away . " And thou , " said Charlotte , shredding her fingers in Mo/nique 's hair . " Thou wilt walk with Tonton Nicolas , my child . " Monique swung her head up a little between them and gave Bridget a queer long look through her lids . Her mouth was dark as a plum and her face was thin and golden with wine-silk eyes . Bridget took the small cold fingers in her hand and they walked after Nicolas and Jeannot . Monique put her feet delicately forward on the cobbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridget 's face . She was like a bright sleek little animal , a fallow deer turned sensitive and keen to human approbation . Nicholas walked ahead with Mimi and Jeannot , the boy . They had come to the confectioner 's shop and had stopped to exclaim against the pane . " Oh , babas au rhum ! " they said . " Oh , marrons glaces ! " Tinkle of lemon sticks on the plates , spun baskets pink as doves ' feet , flamboyant sun . They went through the shop door and Monique 's plum mouth melted in baba juice . " Nicolas , " said Monique . She murmured his name softly and solemnly in her tart . " Tonton Nicolas , " chided Jeannot sharply . " Quel en-fant ! " Bridget and Nicolas sat quiet , watching them . They thought of the children as their own , maybe , with their own blood mingling in the children 's bodies . And they sat exchangingsmall smiling glances over the children 's heads , pleased with the role of pere and mere de famille . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he started to blaspheme at the sun that was shining too brilliantly on his face , and at the sweetness of the cakes that were sticking to the children 's fingers . " My God , how my shoes are pinching me ! " he said . He had suddenly turned yellow and wan , and he sat raging with the ends of his mouth turned up in his face . Bridget felt he was ready to kill them all . " It would have been better if they had died in my sister 's womb ! " he said . Just so many more they were , so many more to be sick and disappointed with life . " To be born with a fortune , " he said . " Look at Jean , that miserable creature , born to a fortune and not an idea how to enjoy it ! Look at my father , with money put away in the bank to buy nice husbands for Marthe and Julie ! Would n't it have ken nice if I had been born a German and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Not one of them would I have spared . Imagine knifing can to the heart ! " He sat grinning and swearing at the sun . Maybe Charlotte would have been saved , perhaps I would have let Charlotte survive . But imagine the joy of slowly killing Maman , extracting her front teeth slowly , and rippingPapa up the middle ! " Ile sat in the confectioner 's shop with his thin legs tched out in the sun , thinking up the ways in which he uld murder them all . Jean , the head gardener , would bebled like a pig . " The only nice thing about the war , " said Nicolas , " was five French officers I saw hooked up by their jaws in a deserted butcher shop . We came through the town in moonht , and here were the five gentlemen who had perished e days back , hanging all by themselves by the jaws where Germans had put them . Sense of the ridiculous , what ? " Suddenly his eyes filled with tears . " I want some money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . " All the way home his legs were as strong as legs could be. e took them the longest way so that he could point out to idget the place where he had played under the pine-trees in deep moss as a boy . He had remembered these trees as the best , the thickest , the most magnificent in the world , but chow they had diminished now in grandeur . " It 's because you 've turned sour , grain of sand , " said Bridget . " Oh , really , " he said . " Sour , sour , " said Bridget . But she felt that something was ing place in him that she knew nothing about . She felt he turning remote , and he was rankling in her like a dim and in her spirit . He was going cold in protest against the fly , and a bitter shadow had fallen across his will . Somengshiftless was becoming of him , as if he had forgotten y they had come to France . " All summer you are going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And then when you are strong , we shall find work to do again and go away . There are countries everywhere , and when you are strong we can go anywhere at all that wep34want to go . " " It would be easier to kill Jean , " he said . Before them in the woods the leaves were running like honey along the boughs . How had such thick streams of sunlight ever run into this black northern world ? The children were in it , up to their naked knees , prancing and shouting through the woods . Soon they were at the river , and although Charlotte 's house and the family 's house were there visible through the trees with the road running between the two , Nicolas sat down on the bank and told Bridget the story of the famous sail from Saint-Malo to the country place which he had made with the entire family when he was eight years old.  | BRIDGET LAY IN THE GRASS watching the sky and the deep green bosom of the elm that stood unruffled against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds and swinging them steadily across the pure lakes of the sky . The afternoon was tapering down to dinner . " You 'll catch cold , " said Papa 's voice beside her . His voice bowled down his white vest to her . " What are you doing there ? " he said . He was thrust up , between her and the clouds , containing his agitation . His lingers twitched at his sides . " You must sit up in a chair , " he said . She went back with him to the family where they were gathered upon Charlotte 's terrace , and there Papa drew up the long low chair for her and patted the cushions under her . " There , " he said . " You must sit up in a chair . " Nicolas looked up over his book , observed Papa 's round back leaning to settle the cushions , and turned back to his page again . Maman looked up quickly , alertly , like a bird , and smiled quickly under her nose , and then her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly and discerninglyat Bridget.  | " The clouds are so beautiful today , Bridget , " said Annick , as if they alone knew . She sat looking at Bridget as if they alone were aesthetically allied . In her fingers was a narrow coarse bit of crochet work that she was working into austere edgings for her under garments . Jean 's yawn fell together and he folded his paper , smiling . Charlotte was coming vigorously across the terrace , carrying the baby against her shoulder while the other children ran about the blue skirts of her dress . She smiled deeply at them all as she came . Her black hair was like a close cap and curled down over her ears and neck . She smiled with the pale triangle of her mouth . Maman watched them over her glasses as they came , her face soft and contented over her nimble fingers . Charlotte brought the baby directly to Bridget and put it down carefully across her knees . " Oh , Nicolas , " Maman cried out , " oh , Nicolas , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his book . He stared darkly and blindly a moment at Bridget and then he smiled , plucking his fragile amiability from a remote and sardonic source . His eyes dropped from them and returned to the page . Back and forth went his eyes across it as he read . Bridget saw the leaf turn and felt the baby move slightly in her arms . Its black clear eyes were mildly discovering her face , making a slow adventurous voyage across her nose , down her cheek and over the movement of her breast . Here was the family united again , united with such intensityas if it had survived its first separation . Maman had begun to talk to them all as she worked , and Charlotte was sitting idle , smiling at them and looking out over the sea . Not too far out , but close at the little waves that were murmuring against the terrace wall . Suddenly the church bells pealed and pealed out over the summer fields . They came rocking and ringing out on the warm air : a soft hesitant note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The family stared into each other 's faces . Maman lifted her head , cocking it and listening sharply . " Not a baptism , " she said . " It is war , " said Papa grimly . Nicolas lowered his book for a moment . " If it is war , " he said , " I 'm not going to fight for your damned country , " he said.  | " I 'm not going to fight for your damned country . " " Oh , shame , shame , " said Maman . Charlotte walked quietly around to the drive , and Bridget gave the baby to Annick who had clasped her hands and begun to pray . Up the drive she walked with Charlotte , quietly to the gate . The peal of the bells was turning frail as the wind shifted , and the fragile petals of sound drifted along the air . Then the wind turned towards them again with the full clanging stroke of the bells . Peasants on bicycles were flashing past on the road , and they did not turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People on foot were running in their loose heavy boots , running heavy as horses down the road . An old woman fled past with two blue pails swinging in her hands . " Fire ! " cried Charlotte . She took Bridget 's hand and they started off in short breathless runs down the road . Below , the road escaped from the trees and curved out across the green rye and the wheat . They ran a little apart , and children with pails clattered between them , while the full clang and clatter of the bells rang out ahead on the road . Around the turn the wheat rolled away and low knolls of mustard weed glittered against the dark coils of smoke . Smoke in a full throbbing river , flowing upward , dark and magnificent . Bridget 's hands were cold as she ran , and running she saw from the corner of her eye the golden body of a ripe pear hanging under the sharp black pear leaves , near the road and ready to fall . She looked at Charlotte , and Charlotte smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and secretly as though they alone were aware in this fleeing dark and brilliant world . The red tongue of the road licked slyly along the gorse , and now the smoke was above them , and only the trees before them were withholding the opaque wall of heat . Beyond the aces were the walls of a stone house like discoloured teeth erect in flame , and above them a sky sucked white by fire . It was the last of the row of thatched houses which began the town . Charlotte said , without passion , that if the row went the town would burn . People were running the length of the street to the pump with their buckets , and when they returned the fire-fighters hoisted the full buckets up the ladders andp 38emptied them down over the flame . Charlotte and Bridget stood in the field before the house listening to the soft rush of the torrent of flame and the gentle smack of the water striking the fire . And then began the soft , soft boom of the collapsing stone . The bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on another plane of sound . Presently Maman and Papa emerged from the trees and came into the solid volume of heat . Maman walked quickly , with her shoulders humped forward , her hat on and a coat for Bridget across her arm . She came to them with Papa and then she hurried away into the confusion of people in the lane . She spoke to the agitated people , moving her hands and directing with her sharp old finger . There was a cessation of movement , a visible break , and the men on the ladders were left calling out for more water , shouting aloud although their voices were burned dry in their throats . Then the people in the street began moving again under Maman 's words and the directions of her hands . They were busy forming two lines in the lane from the burning house to the pump . The empty pails fled up one chain of hands to the pump , and then down they swung full again in the other hands to the men on the ladders . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , and the great full pails came swinging steadily down until the slaps of water on the flame were thinning out the smoke against the discoloured sky . Like charred bits of sapling , a few swallows began to curve down in the fading smoke across the wheat and there was a faint stir and sigh among the people like a recognition that it was almost at an end . The water flowed steadily down from hand to hand , and the bells struck slowly now , and without panic , rocking off into silence . The people had begun to chatter over their swinging hands . And presently , perceptibly , the pails began to come slower and slower , to come at intervals , and the men on the ladders stood empty-handed . Faces peered curiously up the line . " Envoyez l'eau ! " they shouted . A murmur gathered down the line , swelling into one great cry . " Envoyez Pena ! " cried the fire-fighters on the ladders . Maman walked down between the waiting people.  | " The pump is dry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men leaned out from the heat , crying wearily and angrily at the people . " Your mother is a fool , " said Papa . He followed after her with his cane . And suddenly the bells started out again over their heads . The people were grouping together again in lines , but this time with greater spaces between them so that there would be enough hands to reach out of sight to the pump that was farther in the town . Charlotte and Bridget went into the lines , filling two empty spaces and waiting for the full buckets to swing down the lane . Charlotte 's tanned hands gripped the wet handle each time it came , her diamonds shone , she smiled easily each time she swung the full bucket on . This activity became a new and absorbing thing to them , quite apart from the fact of the fire . When Bridget lifted her head she was amazed to see the flames still glaring through the empty window sockets of the second house , and to see the geraniums writhing back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third house to wet the straw . The buckets slopped steadily down the line and the empty pails fled back to the pump . There was the soft rush of the flame and the brittle split as the timber fell . The second story had collapsed and the next house was burning . A young man was crawling up over the thatch and hacking the burning roof away . His hands were red on the axe he held , and his sleeves were rolled back on arms as white as milk . In golden flakes the burning roof fell away in the evening . There was a sudden blind quiet , a relaxation of hands , and the people stood idle , watching up the lane from which no miracle of water descended . Presently the lines fell apart and Charlotte and Bridget walked into the town among the scatteringpeople . The women were frightened now and they had begun to carry out their linen and their vessels from their houses , and to set them away in safety in the wheat . Charlotte and Bridget stopped to help bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village people had scattered , following Ma man out of sight in search of another pump . And now the lines were forming again from a fresh pump under the church , in the very bowels of sound . The distance between hands was wide and arms stretched out to reach thep40outstretched arms . The men were beginning to sing to the rhythm of their hands , singing slowly beneath the sound of the bells . " J'ai un chien qui gueule tout le temps ... " Bridget swung the buckets . " Et une femme qui en fait autant . . . " Bridget closed her eyes and felt the bitter flame hollowing her nostrils , the taste of flame in her mouth . A half hour .. . " Jr m'en f ous , je suis elegant ... " In an hour the third pump had gone dry . The people broke apart , some starting off with Maman down another street . It was night and the moon had begun to hollow white valleys in the streets . Bridget followed the others down the cobbles , wandering along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to an arch in the houses with a moonlit courtyard beyond . And in the centre of the court a fountain stood up in the light with a strong dark chain of water stringingfrom the stone lion 's mouth . They rushed to the arch , the dark figures , crying aloud and swinging the empty pails . But the gate was closed before them , and they all stood transfixed at the bars of it , defeated and silent in the pure hollow warble of the water . And then two lithe ones ran up and swung themselves over the gate and the pails were tossed after them . The two lithe men ran back and forth , filling the buckets at the fountainand hoisting them high over the grill-work to the ones who were waiting there in the street . And now they were too few to form into lines and they spread themselves out in the little street , far from the cries and the sounds of the fire . Bridget was left at the gate with a man who swung the bucket over and down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the street to the next woman who ran on with it to the next . Bridget was in a panic of weakness , running with the sharp slap of the water on her feet and hands . Her mind was working calmly and rationally with these people , blank and thoughtless with them , and consumed in action . But her body she felt was almost in death , straining fiercely up from the buckets . Suddenly motion and sound ceased as if they had all been suddenly snuffed from life . And then faint triumphant criesp41rang out of the silence . " Vivent les pompiers , vivent , vivent , vivent les pompiers ! " the people were crying . Bridget dropped her empty pail and ran on with the people . The woman who had swung water from her was weeping and she caught Bridget to her and kissed her cheeks . " Vivent , vivent les pompiers ! " Bridget came down among the people , past the piles of fine linen and polished heirlooms in the wheat . The two walls of the house stood charred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking long gulps of cider and resting their weary bodies before a final soaking of the smouldering wood . Their faces were wet and raw , and their raw hands smoothed their forearms as they talked . Charlotte was among the little groups who were talking with the men who had fought the fire , and when she perceived Bridget she came down to her out of the circle of heat and light . She came along , putting her wet weary hand in Bridget 's hand , and they walked away together through the trees . Maman and Papa had gone on before them , she said . It was almost midnight in the icy-jewelled watch on Charlotte 's arm . " What will Nicol say of us ? " laughed Charlotte . And Bridget suddenly thought of him . Nicolas , Nicolas . As if she could ever escape the rift and pain in her heart.  | IT WAS A GOOD DAY for Nicholas and he was with the men down with the big net opening the dam . They could see them from Charlotte 's terrace , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare legs through the shallow pond helping to adjust the net so that the fish would be stranded in it when the water fled through . Charlotte had fetched her hat , and with Bridget she turned away from the family and walked up the beach with the children . Riquet plodded beside them with his short legs spread apart and his fat knees knocking , and Jeannot fluttered from rock to rock with his green net . The little girls walked together , winding their arms with sea-weed . " When we can talk more easily together , you shall teach me many things , " said Charlotte . It was always in the future for them , what they should be to each other , promised and secret and unseen . Charlotte rested her soft hands on her hips . " To walk from here , " she said . " I do not walk gracefully . Will you teach me to swim ? " She lifted her fingers over her breasts . " I want to be slender . We shall walk a great deal together , Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smooth flat flowers on Bridget 's wide hat . So much they would be to each other , so much , so much . She stood murmuring to Bridget , and touching her wax flowers , touching the bright beads in Bridget 's neck . It was Monique who came between them , carrying them little seas in her palms . " I am afraid of Monique , " said Charlotte with her shy brilliant smile . She pressed Monique 's plum mouth with her finger . " Monique is my confession . I must keep my finger over her lips , this way , saying hush , thou must not betray me ! " She laughed softly in her throat . " And thy lids down , Monique , over the betrayal of thy eyes ! " She closed Monique 's lids with quick touches of her mouth , and Monique danced away , smiling under her closed eyes . Jeannot watched in derision . " Open your eyes , Mon , " he cried . The sharp cold sparks of the sea fled before them , and Monique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net , turned impatiently away after a brown sloping wing . The shadow of the poplars quivered across the sand and the cries of the men as they worked back at the dam drifted across the beach in the sea-wind . Bridget walked on with Charlotte , and Charlotte talked to her of pictures , of photography , and of painting . With her hands and her eyes and with simple words she talked so that Bridget comprehended it all . Arid with such bright shy awe , with such reverence that hands and fingers could interpret the sensations in one 's body . All pictures , even bad pictures , were really beautiful and a wonder to her because with hands and fingers one could imitate life . ' liven Bridget 's pictures . They looked like nothing she had ever seen on earth , but to Charlotte they were beautiful , they were to be cherished in wonder . Bridget listened , and she responded with her few hesitant words , but she kept hearing the remote cries of the men drifting down the wind . She listened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked blindly and brightly on , but Bridget kept turning and turning to the sounds of the pond and the stroke of the red crest of the house . But it was all ( xkyond the curve , and hidden , with only the absolute knowledgein her heart that Nicolas was in pain . She went on withp44Charlotte , but it was unreal to her , the sea and the sand , the full swell and slope of the sea , and the fine dry slipping sand . She went on in terror , quieting her cold fingers in her palms . Whatever in act had come to him was of no importance : the manner of death was indifferent . But she knew that he was done , and in her heart she saw him so clearly , done , and lost to her , with his will sapped out in a new tide of pain . She thought of him , and she was numb with terror . She listened to the men 's fragmentary cries on the wind , and she thought of Nicolas dead and submissive under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sharp white shell beneath the glittering chains of water . " I should like to be the epitome of grace , " said Charlotte . " Do you think my arms are too large ? " It was a long time before she was ready to turn back to the terrace for tea . The pond , as they came to it , was still , unbrokenand alone , and beyond on the terrace the table waited quietly under the tea cups . Jean was sitting with his stick dangling between his loose knees , and Maman and Papa were playing bridge with the two girls . Beyond them on the lawn , Annick was teaching the catechism to her urchin boys . There sat the family , so unconcerned , playing and talking under the deeper boughs and the thin light . In the brass sides of the kettle , the wall of the house and the geraniums at the windows were reflected blind white and scarlet and green . Maman had finished the blue sweater for Charlotte and she tossed it over to her between plays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down over her breasts , turning this way and that before them all so that they might see the fit of the belt and the turn of the sleeve . " Chic , " she cried . " Do you like it , Bridget ? " So quiet was the air , so tranquil . Bridget felt they were secured on a safe sweet island , nodding , browsing softly upon a quiet sea . So safe they were , so safe . What a world of women who lived without avarice or despise , what a woman 's world built strongly about the men 's fortune and the men 's fortitude , what a staunch , sweet world that could never fail . No fire or flood to blacken or to rot them , no death final enough to destroy them all . Wipe them out and they would go on living securely in the palm of God . Their fingers busy with a thou/sand kindnesses , their hearts touched by poverty or solitude . And this strange , hard , bitter thing in Bridget that could have cried aloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist in their faces and that said : " Where is Nicolas ? Where is Nicolas ? Where is Nicolas ? " " Where is Nicolas ? " she said . But here was Madame of the Depeches again , pedalling with grim dignity down the drive . A ripple passed through each heart , and the blue envelope was put in Maman 's hands . She cawed sternly with apprehension , she ripped it open with one nail . And as she opened her mouth to read it to them , the whole world blossomed , burgeoned , burst into hosannahs of song . Even Annick came to hear , abandoning the souls of her young pupils to kneel before her mother for the tidings . Luc , Luc swelled in the throat of every singing bird . The afternoon that had come so near to swooning in the heart suddenly sprang lightly from eye to eye . In two days Luc would be in their midst for his month 's vacation . Luc , who was to these three virgin women a French career that they had studied for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their communionveils had learned to bow before , burn candles to , this man who each of the three knew must mean a lifetime crowned or doomed for ever  --  he who had made no sign of life to them except to brush his hair back , trim his nails clean , shave and scent his face ! These girls have gone into confessionalsto you , have pulled out their words as smarter girlsull out their eyebrows , crying for patience and a generous cart that would relinquish you to one another ! This was the year that Luc would speak his heart out , if heretofore he had performed no miracles but forgot to answer letters , rode trimly On the backside of an ambulance , contended that Anatole France had espoused his secretary and not his cook  --  butmen in menial ways were all one to the family  --  cooks , rotaries , pastry-doughers , clerks , or even that ignobleMadame de What whom they had cut in the street from theday she had fallen so low as to invent a soap that smelled andsold . Luc f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year hisdecision would be made  --  Luc was to come , Luc about whomromances were written , all plays staged , all histories inred.  |p46Once  the excitement had lulled into a drenching calm of delight , Charlotte suddenly put down her cup and her eyes turned round and vague . " Where 's Nicolas ? " she said , looking about at them all . But Maman had just trumped Julie 's ace and the game was too diverting for interruption . P47O NLY AFTER DINNER did the family begin to concern themselves with it . Nicolas , it appeared , had never returned to tea . A fury and anger was growing in Bridget 's heart , and a terrible fear , as if the family had done away with him . She knew so well all that he was holding against them in his soul , right or wrong he was holding it against them . If the good devoted family that he had would insist upon his birth , would insist upon bringing him into it , he was thinking , then they must take the responsibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight it as well . So much had he talked to her of it that she thought of the illness as a thing that was the family 's possession and that had nothing to doith them themselves . The disease was the family 's as much ase pelouse or the gate or the wall . They were allowed to share It because the family was made up of good people who opened wide their hearts ; this was the way Nicolas talked to Bridget and whichever way the truth was she knew in her anger that it was the family and the best that was in them that had turnedheart so cold . Down , down , down to the bottom of the pond , to the valley of the river , had they pressed his heart with theirp48thumbs ; down , under the torrents of bridge games , under the grim Sundays of thunderous mass . Nicolas , Nicolas , she whispered in every room of the house , Nicolas , where are you , what have I done too to drive you away ? Annick had taken her wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Marthe had wandered down the road . Whether it was an occasion for panic or for reason , no one could decide . Papa was following Maman step by step as she squatted among her strawberry plants , a plate balanced in one hand and with the other picking off the ripest fruit . He had several conflicting theories which he was describing to her in every corner of the garden . These were the things they were all doing to keep it from their minds that something had taken place . No word , no gesture betrayed them nor caused them to look into each other 's eyes . " But he has walked too far , " said Charlotte in the midst of Jean , Julie , and her children . " And finding himself too weak he has merely sat down somewhere to rest . " But suddenly the tears rushed from her eyes and she flung herself into Bridget 's arms . " My darling , my darling ! " she cried with her eyes still so beautiful and unscarred by her weeping . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Papa who had come leisurely down the drive now hastened forward with consternation in their faces . " Poor child , poor child ! " said Papa . Suddenly his face diffused with anger . " Has it occurred to you , Jean , " said he , " the truth of what has happened ? " In his desperation he appealed to the one other man of the family who happened to be present . " What has certainly happened , " he went on , quivering with anger , " is that my son has gone off with another woman . " " Ah , Papa , " exclaimed Maman in anguish . " Your unfortunate brother , " continued Papa , turning upon his wife , " did precisely the same thing at Nicolas ' age . There was a striking resemblance between the two , they both played the violin , and Nicolas ' radical opinions since his return to France can be explained in no other way . He has turned against the gentle influence of his wife . It should be evident to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He placed his trembling hand upon Bridget 's shoulder andp49his moist eyes looked into hers . " Or there is one alternative , " he said . " There is one alternative , poor child , and we can all of us but pray to God that it be so . Your unfortunate young husband has met with foul play . Given the choice , I , as his father , have no hesitation and I feel sure that you all of you share my feeling . If he is lying in the bottom of some ditch , we can but rejoice the day we find his dear body and put it to rest among those of his own flesh and blood . " " You are insane , " said Maman . For a moment her eyes flashed wildly at him . " What of your own brother , Auguste , and the madhouse of his home ? " " Is this quite the time , quite the time to bring up stories of my relatives ? " cried Papa . " Yes , oh , yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice like a weapon so as to pierce their ears . With Charlotte she walked rapidly down towards the pond , hurrying Bridget off between them . " Yes , " said Maman , " why he should tell all the stories on my side of the family is extraordinary , extra-ordinaire , extra-ordinaire . " Her voice was challenging , sparring with , piercing the descending evening to its very heart . " His brother Robert who lives in Saint-Malo today , " she sang in Bridget 's ear , " has had the most extraordinary life . He married a Creole with a great fortune in her own right and six months after their marriage they had a son . " Her voice was more muted than the soft waters of the pond which ran in the wind across the ringlets of stones . " Not a word would he hear about it , but surely he made up his mind never to be her husband again , and being a lawyer in great demand , he would leave her for days at a time to plead a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the edge of the waters and Maman flung up her chin as if there were nothing weighing upon her mind . " One night he encountered your Papa and asked him to come home with him to dine . There was his wife hiding behind the door and before she saw that your Papa was with him she had leapt on his back , ripped the coat from his shoulders and flung him to the ground . " " La , la ! " said Charlotte as if the story were a new one to her . " She had the kind of warm blood that could not do with-p 50out him , " said Maman , shivering a little as if a chill had run down her spine . " And if he would not come into the same bed with her at night , she would go after him and tear the night shirt off him and claw his back . I saw the scars of it myself . " Down they walked , the three women , arm in arm , listening to the silence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars over the trees and she tightened her arms around her mother-in-law and Charlotte . " She finally had a very handsome young man every night in the house , and then your uncle could come home in peace from the courts and get a good night 's rest , " Maman went on . " Robert was a good Catholic and as there could be no question of divorce for him he closed his two eyes to what was going on under his own roof . But she brought things to a crisis and she sued him for divorce to have her own way . " Bridget was listening and miraculously making out the sense of the story , but a strange thing had begun to happen in her thoughts . Before she had gone two steps further she knew that Nicolas was somebody else . Until this moment she had thought of other people , outside , strangers , and as herself and Nicolas one sign and signal of purpose and youth , one figureheadcarved against the surf of the world , one spirited high will . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's younger son . This was Nicolas ' sister who held her in her strong brown arm . " When the case came to court , " went on Maman 's voice , " your uncle asked to plead for himself . It came up in the Paris Tribunal and all of us were there to hear your uncle plead the case of the church against the demands of passion . Passion it was she had for him , " hissed Nicolas ' mother . " Passion , pas-sion . " The sky was as black as pools of ink between the shining stars . Why did you turn from me too , whispered Bridget . She took out her pride and stood it up and shot it through and through a hundred times with her despise . Nicolas , Nicolas , she whispered , and the word led her to no glamour . There it ended , there . " Never had he been so brilliant , " she said , " and he asked as if he were asking for his life that this woman be restored to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame , " she said. p 51 " Poor Maman , " said Charlotte , ready to weep at the thought of it . " And the poor wretch lost his wife in spite of it , " said Maman , " while the son was awarded to him . Here was he with his wife gone and another man 's son left with him over night . " But now the mother exclaimed aloud and started back . " Why , what have we been doing ? " she cried out . Bridget and Charlotte looked down as well and saw that they had indeed in their preoccupation been walking through the shallow waters of the pond . Already their feet and ankles were submerged and on and on they had been walking without a thought for where they were going . There they stood ankle-deep in the water , Nicolas ' mother , his sister , and his wife . Never before had the three women been so close . They leapt apart in fright at the sound of their own laughter , and then flurried together again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whispered Charlotte . " It was Nicolas I saw , " said Maman in a strange grieved voice . And indeed Nicolas was standing beside them , beyond on the path . " Qu'est ce que vows faites la ? " he said . It snapped across the little space of water to them . He looked a hideous , thin figure standing there , snapping his sharp ugly words at them . Even in the fresh light of the stars his face was as yellow as bile . Out of the water they splashed to him , and Maman 's concern was now for their three pairs of streaming shoes . " Ah , Charlotte , your grey suede ones too ! " she cried . Suddenly she put her old hands on Nicolas ' shoulders and absently kissed his averted cheeks . " Where have you been ? " said she . How she could bring herself to say these casual words was a miracle to Bridget . " Nowhere , " said Nicolas as he glowered upon them . " My little Nicolas , " said Maman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shall we all go home together now ? " said she . " We have all been deeply grieved atr absence . " She took his arm.  |p52Charlotte  could no longer hold back her tears and she pressed against her brother 's side . And Bridget watched them in sorrow and concern , thinking that if she were a woman this was the way she must be . She must speak out to him even if it sounded like complaint , but maybe it was this , she thought , that whenever a woman spoke out without reflection it was really some complaint she was making . Everything she could think of to say to Nicolas was no more than a complaint against him because he had done what he wished to do . " Am I nothing at all to you that you could abandon me here with them all ? " she flung with all the whines , the tears , the protests into a dusty corner of her womanly heart . The womanly heart of me , said she in silence , has nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of miseries . " Nicholas , " she said for the first time . " How 's your bunch of miseries ? " " They 're doing very well , thank you , " said he . Then he turned on his mother . " But I 'm not going home , " he said . " I 've had absolutely enough of it . Every time I sit down or stand up or go to the Vater or come back from the Vater , your husband asks me when we are going to have a child . It 's wonderful to have an old Colonel in the family , " he said . " All the devotion , the thought , the consideration for the fatherland . Why do n't you have a child yourself , Maman ? " he said . " You 're only sixty-five . I do n't know what you 've been doing with your life , " he said . " Hush , " said Maman . " Listen , " said Nicolas . " We have n't any money , Bridget and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 've got this thing in my legs that you passed on to me and that I would probably pass on to my son . I have n't any money at all , I do n't know what I 'm going to do , and this morning Papa said he would give me fifty thousand francs if I would have a child . " Suddenly a silence fell upon them all . A terrible silence stopped the beating of their hearts . How would they lift their heads to this , how look into each other 's eyes , Bridget did not know . Without daring to see their faces in the uncertain light , Bridget took Nicolas ' hand . Suddenly he stooped and kissed her mouth . " Mountain , shall we go home ? " she said.  | " Do you know , Nicolas , " said Maman as they all walked up the path around the pond . " Every other year the trees here by the water were thick with nightningales . Never a summer has passed but that they came back to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Charlotte 's garden there was one nightingale that had his nest in the acacia tree before the house . " " Papa said they would be sure to come back this year , " said Charlotte turning her head this way and that as if to catch some sound of them . " But they 're so late , perhaps Papa is wrong . " " Hush , hush , " said Maman in reproof again as they regainedthe wall.  |p54H  OW LUC MANAGED to turn the rabbit over , to get the rascal who was running like quicksilver through his fingers , over and flat on its side , over and pressed perfectly flat down with its teeth nosing through the neat split in its upper lip , was a thing that rattled the girls together like the sticks of a fan . With one finger putting the soft fur back , he pointed out to them the white sore in the rippling flesh close in the rabbit 's side . The place they saw was alive with maggots but the three girls had nothing but real pity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what they felt , and once the rabbit had been cleanly scraped out with a pruning-hook of an instrument and a sponge of iodine had been sopped into the immaculate hole in his side , the little beast made the sprightliest leaps across the run and started in shredding his lettuce leaves with , not his heart even , but the end of his nose fluttering , which was the usual thing . The cold eye was upon them , however , and upon Luc who was wiping his blades clean on the grasses and fitting the ivory hilts of them back into his case . This was the first moment that Luc had appeared really as a surgeon to them , really out of college and ready to meetp55gaping flesh and the pulse of wounds . They had known of the years as an interne in hospitals , but never before had he stood out to them so as a perfect equipment against death . " Against suffering and death , " said Annick 's solemn mind . She could not take her eyes away from the fine young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his hip pocket . " Against suffering , " thought Annick with her hand raised suddenly against her bosom as if to protect her own heart . He was patting the smooth haunches of his breeches with his open palms . Julie , who could hardly bear to lift her eyes to him , observed that the cups of his knees were as shapely as porcelaine demitasses and bulged not a whit above his leatherputtees . " Poor beast ! " said Luc pleasantly , with just the proper cold personal tone required to set their hearts ringing aloud withe flavour of his pride . In deference they turned and followedout of the vegetable garden . It was Marthe , or so it seemed to all of them , who had ne a bit too far . She had hemmed six handkerchiefs for him d in the corners had embroidered his initials with hairs from r own head . This was the thing the country girls did , and therer class girls in Saint-Malo , for their men who were going sea . Even to Marthe herself it seemed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation upon the rabbit had n performed she felt that all sense of reason and proportion re lost . Indeed in L'Illustration were paintings of women , h and noble women , who flung themselves at the feet of a at artist , who shouted themselves hoarse before the foothts , and tore their bouquets to shreds to shower him with petals . Fleeing up the stairs she met Bridget descending and she grabbed her in her arms . " Luc , " she whispered to her , " Luc . The handkerchiefs . " They went into her room together . The Comtesse de illes looked at them with profound understanding . Marthe 's trembling hands fluttered a bit of powder on her , shriekingly she dabbed her cheeks with the faintest blush rouge from Bridget 's bag . " Just because I was born here , here , in this house , " she wasp56saying to her face in the glass and to Bridget , " is it any reason why I should be different from what other women are ? In Paris they would do this , Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing this . But just because I am here , with the family as it is . . . Down the stairs they went together with the handkerchiefs folded away in Marthe 's pocket . The entire family was settled on Charlotte 's terrace . Maman was stitching across the white web of embroidery stretched upon its frame , and the Cross was growing slowly under the deliberate stroke of her needle ; the stalks and the petals were growing strongly under the elaborateflair de lis . Annick and Julie were sitting beside two deep-bellied baskets with broken boughs of acacia and yew piled beside them on the ground . With their bare palms they were stripping off the small bitter leaves from the yew branches into one basket , and into the other they were pluckingthe fresh pink acacia blossoms from the fallen boughs . Jean sat with his slack knees fallen together and his wide hairless hands clinging to his cane . Click and patter went the yew leaves into the basket , shiny they were , like slivers of patent leather . The basket of acacia blossoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour and smell . Charlotte was working a little , idly and gently , here and there . She was moving in a kind of maze of love for them all , turning her head now and then to the cries of the children fluttering up from the garden side of the house . Papa was reading the Quest-Eclair . Luc was with Nicolas somewhere , somewhere not very far for they could hear their voices talking together . Bridget and Marthe as well sat down beside the baskets and set themselves to work . Tomorrow was the village fete , and early in the morning the girls would be up in the square sprinkling out a carpet of flowers all around the church . A deep path of yellow saw-dust would leave the church door and wind through the streets wherever the religious procession was to pass . This would be flanked with banks of emerald yew , and decorated with beds of acacia . The Crown of Thorns , they said , would be drawn in with saw-dust and the pierced bleeding heart with acacia heads . Annick had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The village people would hang the fronts of their houses with enormous sheets so that the processionmight pass along unsullied walls.  |p57Beyond  in the stable they could hear the slow heavy panic of hoofs as the ailing cow was led in and tied up for an injection . Jean lifted his heavy loose head and sat listening . " Ah-ha , they 're giving her castor-oil ! " he said . His head wobbled from side to side with laughter . The girls responded with their high happy laughs and when they had subsided , Riquet watched them all from under his lids and then slowly and gravely repeated his father 's words . A wonderful moment it was for them all that a child of three should say the words so well , so amusingly , and with such charm . Monique flung her arms around her little brother and kissed his flaming cheeks . " Angel , " murmured Charlotte . She caught him up across her bosom . " Riquet . Riquet . Petit Riquet , " she murmured in his neck . He leaned away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down the drive were sweeping two dove-grey nuns withit little faces flushed in the heat beneath their stiff whiteAs . Charlotte set Riquet upon his feet and turned her face against the drive . " Charity . Do walk with me down to the pond , Bridget , " she said . " Maman , tell them I 'm too busy to talk , and give them something , Jean ... " She put her round bare arm through Bridget 's arm and they walked slowly and easily away over the grass . " ' They sell dresses and pillow-slips , " said Charlotte . " I 've bought enough for three lifetimes . You shall have a lot of them , Bridget , when you have your home , your place , and yourbies too  --  " Suddenly the colour mounted in her neck and cheeks and touched Bridget 's hand . " Is n't it silly the way we say these things ? " she said . She led Bridget 's hand against her bosom . " Feel it there , Idget , " she said , " feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely fingers that pressed against own . " It was so terrible a thing for Papa to say to Nicolas , " said Charlotte . " Darling , so terrible a thing to buy a little baby fight out of your heart that way ! And such a little bit of money , too ! " she laughed now and showed her small whitep 58teeth a little savagely . " After all a very little bit of money , you know . Well , maybe that 's the French Papa part of it . What could you do with fifty thousand francs after all ? For a year you could live very nicely in Paris , of course , oh , very nicely , but after that what would you do ? " The pond was perfectly still beyond the bright breasts of the ducks as they streamed through the water . At the edge of it Charlotte stooped and made a soft caressing sound through her teeth . At the sight of her the ducks changed their resolute direction and came towards her over the glossy water . Beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river-bed , a bright blue widening blade . White crescents of movement were soaring above it and dipping down upon it as it came , their clear cries drifting back from the far bit of sea and rising over the luminous mud and the pond . The pond was like a deep sweet bell hollowing and echoing the clear cries of the dipping gulls . " You understand , " she said , looking up from her hands in the water , " you understand how I feel about children . This life here , it is the life I want . Ever since I was sixteen I have worn Jean 's picture in my locket . He went away with his cousins to one of his father 's estancias in North Africa , to see the work and the life and to work there himself . It is from there the income comes to him and his father thought it wise that Jean see the ranches himself and how the sheep were tended and how the work was done . A wonderful future for a young man , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could n't go off to live there and leave the family . So in two years he came back and we were married . We are first cousins , you know , so we had a dispensation from the Pope , and this is the life I want , being so close to the family . Maman and I cried for three days before I got married , and when I went away for my fortnight 's honeymoon I was so lonely that Jean had to bring me back in two days . " They laughed , and Charlotte turned her head over her shoulder , laughing . There were Maman and the Little Sisters of the Poor pursuing them down the long slope . Charlotte rose with dignity , put one arm about Bridget 's waist and drew her slowly on around the edge of the pond . " But I know there are people who live differently , " she said . " Even my own children may choose to live differently . Ip59do not speak of this , but it is the way I feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and steadily , watching the reappearing points of her suede boots as they proceeded . " I do not know about music , " she said . " Some day you and Nicolas will listen to Jeannot and Mimi in duets at the piano . " Her small pale mouth gathered earnestly about her words . " I want one to play the violin , one the ' cello , and one to sing . Mimi has the piano for her own , of course . But what instrumentshall we give the baby ? " She laughed aloud . " You must decide that for me , Bridget . I shall love it . In Paris I took them to a concert and they hated it . Even Monique . So grotesque . They laughed like imbeciles . Was it because they were too young ? " Charlotte 's glance darted back over her shoulder . They had lost Maman and the two nuns . So they walked leisurely on up the orchard , talking together and examining the small green apples that were beginning to swell under the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a nightingale who had sung at night among the great black leaves . Presently they had come along the little path through the pine-trees and they lingered a moment by the umbrella-bushes at the grill . But this year he had forsaken them , said Charlotte , and she stood putting the leaves aside with her fingers , touching them gently and hushing her voice as if she thought she might come upon him then in the tree . Nicolas and Luc were in a garden shed as they came down through the potager to the house . The two young men were in white gardener 's smocks dyeing sacks of saw-dust red and apple green , and setting them out in wooden frames to dry . The family was in a fever of devotion for their church , but it was evident that Nicolas and Luc were enjoying themselves with this business because they had nothing better to do . There they found them working with their bare forearms stained green . When Nicolas perceived Charlotte and Bridget approach- , ! big he turned back to his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . Charlotte exchanged a word or two with Luc and then drew Bridget on around the house to the terrace , to the girls stripping the yew leaves and the acacia into the baskets , to Maman 's needle in her hand again piercing the great white web . But the air wasp6ocool and ruffled as if a storm had scarcely passed . Papa was tapping the ground spasmodically with the tip of his cane . " But what has happened , what has happened ? " asked Charlotte softly looking into the faces of her mother and father . She could not bear things to be hidden away and made gloomy , sinister secrets . They all loved , they were all of the same blood , and they must share one another 's pains . " Your sister Marthe , " said Papa rising , " has done an inexcusablething . " His weary eyes , bleared with remorse , looked upon his children . " She has made certain advances to a young man who has shown her no marked preference over her sisters . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt you all are aware to whom it is I refer . " He looked ominously under their brows and into the very depths of their beings . " Find it in your hearts to forgive this unfortunate young woman if you can , " he said . " I can not bring myself to do so . " His exit was marred by the fact that he had forgotten the Ouest-Eclair on the tin table and that he must a moment later return to fetch it . But this did not lessen the intensity of Marthe 's grief , and as soon as he had departed for the second time , she flung herself at her mother 's knees in a paroxysm of weeping . Her terrifying sobs rang out across the pond and Maman immediately stopped her needle-work and soothed the head that had fallen upon her lap . " How times have changed , my Marthe , " said Maman . " The courtship of Papa was another matter . " Her hands were smoothing down the soft hair in Marthe 's nuque . " Up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing he said to me was would I play the piano for him ? This is what I did for your dear Papa , I played Euranie ' and he sang the words to it , and every time I looked up from the keyboard at him I saw him with his head thrown back and his open mouth singing above me . Euranie , oh , Euranie , ' " warbled Maman now above Marthe 's quiet head . All the girls burst into peals of laughter . " ' Euranie , oh , Euranie , ' " cawed Maman over the terrace and pond . " When he was out of the house my aunt said to me , Well , how do you feel ? What do you think of that young man as a husband for you ? " What do I think ? ' said I. ' I think he has the finest set of false teeth I ever saw in my life , ' I said . And the next time I met him was at the church door when I married him , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much taken by the gallant young lieutenant . " Marthe 's laughter rang out the loudest and the most hysricalat the end of this story . Surely they had heard it before , but now it was a great relief to them . It was wonderful to laugh and laugh in the warm summer afternoon and to know yhat Papa himself was perhaps fallible after all.  |p62MAMAN  AND BRIDGET were seated deeply in the grey cushions , and Papa and Nicolas faced them from the little drop-seats of the limousine . Papa 's hands , in immaculate suede , were gathered one upon the other on the silver beak of his cane , and Nicolas ' profile watched away through the window to the white road that ran out before them . Maman talked on , as if in spite of the two men who sat so stolidly in silence : Nicolas setting himself away from them and turning a dark blind mask to Maman 's voice . Bridget listened and responded with her own few words , and Nicolas sat with his face averted from whatever they had to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . Bridget had begun to think of her own family and how they had scattered their children out like dice and not held them close together this way in the hollow of the hand . There was nothing in the world she expected of her own people , for they had no idea at all of family life or what a family should be . Everyone was an individual to them , with his own individualway to go , and they never interfered . It was easy to know when they approved of something or when they did not , p 63but they never came in between with a severity it would break your heart to defy . But in this way they were separated people at last and it was only another kind of perversity in Bridget  --  in me , she thought , it is the perversity of weakness that asks my own family to be a loving Jewish tribe , to be all the more fierce for each other because there is the same flesh on our bones . Because I am afraid to be one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am afraid to be alone , she thought . There is no necessity to be one person alone , unrelated . I am afraid to have no family at all , she thought ; no one , nothing , I am afraid . Gently she put her hand through her mother-in-law 's arm as she sat talking beside her . The respondingpressure gave her a curious assurance . She was accepted so because she was Nicolas ' wife , she thought , but there was a deep satisfaction in possessing a title that made no demands except that she be gentle , and that she be good and kind . They were riding to Saint-halo in Charlotte 's limousine and the object of their visit was to call upon Oncle Robert . The son his Creole wife had carried but six months was doing his military service in the colonies and Maman remarked that when Robert was not off on a case , he was at home a lonely man . The town appeared bit by bit before them , low and hooded under its high wall , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little boulevardwhich ran half-way about the town . At the farthest end was the bright firm sea and the rocks of the harbour , and quiet sturdy boats of merchandise bulging in past the wall . The family sat heavily and importantly down in Oncle Robert 's frivolous salon to wait , with their peculiarities variouslyrepeated in the eight mirrors which had been built in amongst the panels of the wall . The windows , between lengths of white embossed satin , faced Dinard and the sea . Indeed the family was far too solid and human embraced as they were by the exquisite arms of the gilded chairs , with their stout clean boots bruising the deep creamy carpet and its fine design ofId . Maman and Papa sat heavily but with a great appearance of case in all this splendour , but their voices had sunk to whispers and they looked with reproof upon Nicolas who sat silent and arrogant , stretching his long careless legs in disdain . Oncle Robert 's entrance was preceded by the austerity ofp64three tortoise-shell cats striped in deep black . Their loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they walked . The low rose-velvet chair had been left unoccupied , and now Oncle Robert hastened into it , plucking a white thread away from his black velvet knee and settling himself far , far back into the chair until the unsoiled soles of his velvet slippers faced them . " Imagine me , " he began at once to them , " caught in Paris at the moment of your arrival , my children . I was in despair . My feet were bewildered in the gardens of Versailles , my heart flirting with the gold-fish in the Tuileries , and my voice , incidentally , hopelessly entangled in the law courts . When I freed one portion of my person , I found I was even more firmly secured at still another point . Imagine it , darlings ! " His hands exclaimed . His hair was cut in a straight white bang across his delicate brows . " The Chinese porcelaines in the Louvre were weights upon my metaphysical ankles , " said he with a flurry of gaiety , " and the Athenic bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip receded from his false teeth in laughter . " My daughter-in-law , " he said , " understands but two phrases of the French tongue , my poor Robert : I love you ' and I am not cold . ' " Maman 's voice and laughter revolved in protest . " And what more need a woman know ? " asked Oncle Robert looking with his proud little chin lifted from one to the other . " But you are speaking economically , no doubt , " said he with a gentle wave of his fine hand . " You were always , my dear Auguste , willing to sacrifice whatever imposed upon the success of your delightful repartee : the truth , or the accomplishments of your new daughter . " His eyes moved rapidly over Bridget , proceeded to Maman and Nicolas , and were arrested again upon Papa 's exposed teeth . " Permit me to suggest "  --  thehard contemptuous beads of his eyes examined his brother 's face  --  " that there are capacities of comprehension infinitely more exact than the drum of the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spine ? " cried Papa with a burst of laughter . " The spine , " repeated Oncle Robert , but two little flags of colour had begun to wave on his cheek bones . " The spine , my dear brother , the contraption , you understand , that runs downp65the middle of the back . There is also the iris of the eye , and there is finally the London Calendar which has a motto for every day of the year . " His delicate hand drifted across the rose-velvet chair to the polished desk in acajou and with one linger he lifted the solid pages of the Calendrier Anglaise . " Which has broadened my knowledge of foreign tongues to the extent of "  --  he looked at Bridget with a frail wavering charm suddenly balanced in his eyes  --  " two is company , three is a crowd . ' " Bridget laughed . The tortoise cat relaxed across her knees , fixing her straight in the eye and revealing its deep saffron belly . " We have made an appointment with the specialists to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair as if to hasten the arrival of tea . Oncle Robert lifted his hands in horror . " Do not mention the word doctor to me ! " he said with real feeling . " I have coughed myself tediously from salon to salon . All during my sojourn in Paris my hands were violet and my chest murmurous . Do you know what it is "  --  he pointed his voice over his arched fingertips to Bridget  --  " to be cold to the roots of your being , and fire as futile as jewellery on your bands ? Oh , how I have shivered and shuddered  --  there is nolace , incidentally , where one can shudder as hollowly as Paris . Now , London , " he said , " after all London has its open fires and its grogs . London , " he said . He was suddenly startled by the discovery of Nicolas ' profile yawning against the long piano . " Nicolas , my dear boy , " he said . " Have you been ill ? " But the tea table became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yellow tortoise-shell paw was curving whippedam from the fluffy meringue . " He too has been ill , " remarked Oncle Robert , lifting the cat gently away between his thumb and forefinger . " Barking like a fox . I 've been in despair . " " Really , Robert , " murmured Maman in mild reproof through her tea . Oncle Robert 's fatigued body fluttered on the rose velvet , his eyes returned a hundred times to proudly pierce Bridget'sgaze . They were not friends ; from the outset they suspecetd one another . " How lovely of you to have become one of us ! " he said . " I tell you frankly , Auguste , that were I but twenty years younger I would have asked you for your new daughter 's hand ! " " They will stay with us , " continued Maman down her nose , " until Nicolas is out of the doctor 's hands . Then they 'll be off to Paris , or to wherever Nicolas has the most advantageousoffer . Will you talk to people about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows of any openings ? " Oncle Robert 's nose hung over his long pale hand . " How extremely interesting ! " he murmured . " You know , I 'm afraid I 've forgotten the details of Nicolas ' work . Ah  --  just what is it you do , Nicolas ? " Maman 's voice stepped brightly in between them . " He managed a ranch in California , you know . He speaks English . He knows about livestock and horses and crops . " Oncle Robert broke a fragile biscuit between his teeth , recoiling slightly as if the crumbling of it grated upon his ears . " Doubtless there is a great demand for that sort of thing in Paris , " he said vaguely . Nicolas laughed aloud . " Ha , ha , ha , " said he under his moustaches . He leaned back on the piano and shouted with laughter . Suddenly he threw out his long legs before them . " My dear uncle , " he said bitterly , " examine me carefully . My lower limbs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can understand that I am not eager to propagate the race . Nevertheless , " said he , " nevertheless , my dear one , your estimable brother has offered me fifty thou-sand  --  " Papa solemnly rose . " Let me explain this to you , Robert , " said he with his fingers twitching in fury at his sides . " My son and his young wife find themselves in an unfortunate position . I have offered them this sum to start them off in life together and to establish a little family . . . " I wonder how you feel about it , Bridget , my dear , " said Oncle Robert rather gently as he turned his sharp little head to the windows . " I mean , about the curtains . I 'll tell you what happened to them . Would you ever believe it , they were the loveliest cream colour , just about the same shade as the carpet , or perhaps half a breath lighter . And did n't I have them cleaned , indeed I did , and , believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see them . " He looked proudly about him to see what had been the effect of his astonishing story upon them and his eye fell upon Papa who was still standing up on his two feet . " My dear Auguste , " said he , " do sit down , I beg you . NOW , the question is , would you have them dipped or would you leave them just as they are ? "  | JUNE WAS INDEED a wonderful month that year , but the fifteenth was the most beautiful day of all in it . If it was not yet rightly summer , still the feel of it was in all of them and the girls ' bare arms were already turning tan . True there had been some slight change in the plans on which they had counted so much : in the first place , Pierre had decided that he could not take his vacation at the same time with Luc for if he did so it meant leaving the clinique to subordinates . Secondly , Papa had withdrawn his consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She made no mention of this . She came down to coffee and milk one morning before Luc 's arrival with her eyes raw with her grief . And from this they knew that she was not going away . But on the fifteenth Luc had already been four days in their midst , and his charm and his beauty were warm generous things that he gave out in handfuls to them all . He had taken photographs of the three girls , he had bought them each a small brown leather case containing two silver-topped bottles . But on the morning of the fifteenth he came down to the table with a new wonder and glory about him . His curly hair was combed back with a more drenching comb and his skin was asp69clear and delicate as a child 's . It was the stubborn little moustacheon his lip and the well-shaved look of his jaws that brought up the matter of respect and pride . His eyes were so beautiful on this morning that they should have been anywherebut there in his professional , stubborn head . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean serviette across his knees were : " Well , Annick , shall we have a set of tennis together right away after breakfast ? " he said . And this was really the first definite advance he had made to any one of the three of them . As soon as they had all risen from the table , Julie lost no time in flying out of the family 's garden , through the gate in the wall and down Charlotte 's drive to break the news to that branch of the family . Like magic appeared the camp stools and the garden chairs and the striped umbrellas , and when Annick and Luc appeared with racquets and balls in hand Charlotte and Jean , Maman and Papa , Marthe and Julie and Bridget were already seated along the edge of Charlotte 's court . Maman and Charlotte were exchanging a few deep looks of understanding and it was generally considered more or less a lapse in delicacy on Nicolas ' part that he had chosen to remain at home and read while this important episode in the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true that Luc himself had never at any time suspected that the family had definite designs upon his future , but surely it must have been evident to him that he was a romantic figure to the three unmarried girls . But in that terriblemoment when he put his racquet upon the rosy court , carefully placed the four spotless balls in its exact centre , and stood up to roll back his sleeves , the three pairs of eyes that fled from wrist to elbow as he turned his linen up and over must have seared the golden duvet from his flesh . As sprightly as a top he whirled across the court , skimming the balls with a quick steady stroke across the sagging net . One , two , three , four , they went . He and Annick were getting warmed up , and Annick was hurrying down the lawn after the four balls he had spun away . Her sweet prim legs were hasteningin all directions across the green , and suddenly Luc , with two easy nut-cracker movements of his white-clad legs , had vaulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racquet by her side . The search for the balls seemed a signal top 70the family to turn their heads away . The women-folk bent over their needle-work and Papa cleared his throat deeply as he opened the Ouest-Eclair . Only Maman felt she owed some solace to the terror of Marthe 's fixed bright smile . " He is lost , " said Marthe 's glassy eyes to them all . " I have lost him . " Her crochet needle had fallen twice from her trembling hand . " How peaceful it is ! " cawed Maman to her brood . One furtive eye was watching Marthe 's fingers . " What a gentle and peaceful life we have here when we consider the size of the world around us . Consider New York , for instance , " continued Maman . " Those postcards of Nicolas ' give us some idea at least of how many many men that one city alone contains ! Bridget , now what would be your idea , approximately , of how many men there are walking at this moment on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marthe ! " admonished Maman . " For after all a fact like this should be of interest to all of us , and particularly to young women who know very little about life ! " She kept a wary eye on Marthe 's agitation but Papa suddenlyfolded the Ouest-Eclair . " It is the sorrow of my life , " he said gravely , " that one of my sons did not enter the army . " " Such a lovely life ! " exclaimed Marman charmingly turningher head to Bridget . " A six-hour day for a man , really , " she went on , tossing the fat twist of wool back and forth on her needles . " One fences , one rides . . . So nice for the women , " said Maman daintily . " One travels , meets congenial people , dances , plays cards . . . the Colonel was always home half the day with me , always for tea . " " I never had one unpleasant experience , " said Papa in a grieved tone . Hardly had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tennis court , flushed and laughingtogether and bouncing the four recalcitrant balls . Annick possessed an unfortunate underhand serve , but Luc met it gallantly and soon accustomed himself to tossing the balls back in easy bounces . Some of them soared almost out of sight among the heads of the towering pines and when these finally descended on Annick 's side of the net , they surprised her by bouncing close to her feet and , as they rose to her racquet , by suddenly swerving away . These balls she greetedp71with a little squeal of amazement and was unable to return . Her face was very flushed and sweet as she played , very earnest with its trim little nose winged with white . Never for a moment did Luc 's charm and patience give way . As he stroked the ball over to her slowly he called out words of advice as to where she should place herself and how receive the ball . All the more admirable was this , thought Bridget , because he was not a good , patient man . In him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cool smooth control . Over the net went his quiet counseling voice , saying this and that to Annick as though she were a sister whom he loved and must guide and direct in all her actions . And every note of that quiet brotherly voice was a terrible stab in the hearts of Marthe and Julie . " It 's ever so much better than last year , " he was saying as he began his serve . " But , perhaps , Charlotte , you know , maybe a little bit of something more could be done to the court , you know , to get it a bit smoother . Now , there you are , Annick , right where you are . Now , that was a good one . You 're ever so much better than last year , " he said . He was like a brother who had grown up with them all and surely , thought Bridget as she watched him playing on the inadequate court , if he came back to Pierre 's family every year this way it was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been his friend for fifteen years , and because they welcomed him with enormous feasts and simple excursions , and because he was free to wander where he wished . But the one thing he was free to do , he never did , for whatever his plans for the days were they included the entire family . He never went away alone to a dance or for a weekend . He was their guest , and perfect as a host he was , considering their habits , their preferences , and what to them was a special occasion more than he ever gave a thought to himself . Because he was such a perfect gentleman , and because his perfection in this idle month of the year was always for them alone , what could they do but be in a fury of love before it . He would have shamed any prince had he put a uniform and plumes on him , and on a surf-board he would have been a miracle on any sea . But all this was for them and their two fresh country houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row-boat on the pond , and his body to plunge and stretch in the privacy of their sea . He belonged to them . When he exhaled a breath , they were entitled to draw in the same air that had just passed through his lungs . " Now take this with your backhand swing , " he was counsellingAnnick , and Maman was smiling with pleasure under her nose . But as he turned and stooped to gether the balls upon his racquet , something fell from the pocket which was placed over his heart in his white summer shirt . Although he recoveredit at once , every eye had recognized it . And his face had undoubtedly turned a shade deeper as he tucked the handkerchief Marthe had embroidered for him back into his pocket . He thrust it , almost absently , into a pocket of his trousers , but the fact that he had asked Annick to play tennis with him suddenly dwindled in importance . The family no longer hung upon every word he said to her , and presently Papa began to yawn and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a few letters before lunch.  | T HE SPECIALISTS had examined Nicolas and said that there was really little to be done . For the moment the local doctor could shoot him with injections such as they were giving Jean , and maybe in Paris in the laboratories where they were making a study of such things , there might be a cure . But the best they knew was that he must get away from the habit that he could not use his legs , no meats , no wines ; and seabathsand the sun would be a fine thing . What it was , quite , nobody knew . " The sins of the fathers . . . " said Nicolas to Jean . " Oh , well , dear one , think how our fathers must have sinned and sinned ... " " Oh , dear , oh , dear , " said Jean . Tears had begun to gather on his beautiful lashes . He had no inclination to cry for he really enjoyed his illness very much . Because he could scarcely walk , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other life could have pleased him so much as this one of sitting perfectly still in the heart of the family . What he did not notice was , although Papa confided it to Maman in piercing whispers several times a day , that his mind was beginning to decay as well as his legs . But he felt that every now and then a littlep74display of grief would do him no harm . And he found it the simplest thing in the world to do just before lunch when he had not had nearly as much breakfast as he had wanted . " Now , do n't cry , my little Jean , " said Charlotte kissing his broad bland brow . " Just look how beautiful the acacia is all around us . " Its flowering branches were dripping to the ground . " Why should n't we take a journey to Paris , just you and I , with perhaps Monique , and see what the specialists can do . If we find one who knows a lot , Nicolas too can go to him . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris ! " " Oh , no , " he said wiping his eyes . " I ca n't leave Maman and Papa . I ca n't leave my little children , " he said . The most delicious odours of cooking were beginning to emanate from the house . Jean looked up and his appetite gathered in bubbles on his lip . " What I should like to do , " he said smiling happily , " would be to take a trip to Lourdes ! " " Well , why do n't we ? " cried Charlotte . " We could take Monique  --  " wherever she went the little girl must come  --  " and it would be a wonderful thing . " " That would be a good easy way of getting cured , " said Jean mischievously as if he had got on to his own sly ways . " It certainly would be no trouble , " said he . He looked around to see if Maman or Annick were in hearing , and then he continued : " To put down my canes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long cure in a clinique with injections and whatnotfifty times a day . But if Our Lady of Lourdes would do it very quickly , that would be all right . " Charlotte suspected some blasphemy in this , and she shook her head . " Of course , Paris would be lovely , " she said . " After all , there 's the Opera , and it would be wonderful to have some new clothes , some cloaks and frocks , and some hats that run around the back of the neck ! " She was like a little girl , clapping her lovely hands togetherand dancing about them with her hair in the heat curling over her ears . She clapped her hands softly on Bridget 's cheeks , and in a sudden burst of love she kissed Bridget 's eyes and the corner of her mouth . Rich and seductive odours of chicken in the marmite with mushrooms and peppers were replenishing their nostrils with delight.  | " What wonderful lives we are going to have ! " cried Charlotte . " Bridget , Bridget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have ! " " But let us decide not to take a trip , " said Jean . " We are very happy here , if we went at once in to lunch . " But nothing could quench Charlotte 's joy in them all and Bridget began reproaching herself that it was her own shabby spirits that had discouraged Nicolas . He was ill , and with his father opened like a book of wrath before him , he was unhappy , but what was this but the start of their life together , for until now they had really done nothing at all . If once they were in Paris there were many things they could do to make a life for themselves , and if once he would not take things to heart the months in the country would be a repose for him . They were not trapped , she thought as she looked at him , in no way were they trapped . On this day they were having the mid-day meal in Charlotte'shouse with the creamed chicken and the children and Charlotte and Jean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Nicolas going on with the conversation , " would be to take a few little trips about . " Charlotte opened her eyes wide with wonder . To her it would seem the easiest thing in the world to do . " But you ca n't without money , " said Nicolas . " Or with just a little money . I do n't see anything romantic in going third class . " Charlotte seemed to understand this very well . " But have n't you any money at all ? " she said . Jeannot looked up at them in horror as he heard his mother 's words . " Maybe a few thousand francs ? " she said . " About two , " said Nicolas . " I thought maybe I 'd get well tight away , at once . But here I am . " He looked very grim and bitter , eating away at his creamedicken . The thought of his illness had preyed and preyed on him till his cheeks were hollow and his eyes worn deep in his head . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family . They had brought him up close in thewarm safe bosom , and now he felt that they could not evade it , that here was his plight and it was they who must do something about it . The fifty thousand francs was an insult because of the conditions it imposed ; it did not , so far as he wasp76concerned , exist . It was nothing at all . It was nothing at all , and yet he wanted that money very badly . When he talked about it to her , Bridget thought that he would do almost anything in the world to have enough for them to start life together in Paris . He would do everything to have it , except he would not have a child . For nothing on earth would he have a child with his illness in its bones . The family talked of the future as if Nicolas and Bridget were two normal healthy young people starting out in life , but it was not so simple as this no matter how they looked at it . In every detail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not trapped , she thought , we are not trapped . But she had no plan for escape from the family ; she vaguely knew that some day when Nicolas was better they would go to Paris and they would survive . Escape , said she to herself , escape . It is not a matter of Nicolas ' escape from the family , but from his own miseries . Somehow they seemed unimportant to her , the illness , the poverty , because they were in love . Even if Nicolas had , in the bosom of the family , divorced and disjoined himself from her in his despair , she never doubted that they were in love , that they were more in love than anyone had ever been . The truth of this was even more apparent to her than ever before when Luc came skipping down the drive and joined them for coffee . It was not his habit to leave the family at any time , but here he was stepping through the dining-room window of Charlotte 's house , and as he sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , what do you think of Luc ? " It was some time before Bridget replied , for the wine was so good , the strawberries had been as big as plums , and she was lost in absorption in a minute examination of the way Nicolas ' hair grew on his temples . It f as almost impossible to believe that anyone 's hair could grow so perilously beautifully near the wing of his eyebrow , or that an eyelid could curve and open in just that way . " Luc , " she said finally . " Luc ? " as though it were the first time she had ever heard the name . " Oh , Luc , " she said . " I think he is very nice . " Suddenly she looked at him , and over Luc 's coffee cup for the first time their eyes met and held each other.  | THE THING had now come to be accepted among them all that whichever sister was uppermost in Luc 's affections , J idle at least was entirely out of the running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that when there began to be talk of holding a picnic on Castle Island Julie herself said that she had never in the least cared for these immense picnics . " With hordes and hordes of people , " she said . Maman did not at all consider the family a horde and was very much affronted by Julie 's terms and attitude . On the morning of the planned departure for Castle Island there was a slight scene concerning the matter in Maman 's bedroom . Tears were shed . Not by Julie , who had been ordered to come whether she wished to or not , but by Marthe , who felt that her younger sister should be allowed to do as she wished and saw no reason why , if hersister were remaining at home , that she herself should not wear the new white sneakers which the Galeries Lafayette had deposited at the door . The sneakers were Julie 's but they fitted Marthe to a T , and the inference was that if the rivals had been reduced to two , that the third who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her all to one sister 's success . Marthe lay onp78Maman 's bed , biting the pillow a little to stifle her sobbing . Nothing , nothing would appease her except the white sneakers with their shiny black soles . " But Julie is going with us , " said Maman , " so that settles that . She will wear her sneakers and you , Marthe , will wear your buckskins which were quite grand enough for you last year , so why should n't they be this ? " But it appeared Luc had seen the buckskins every day all summer last year . There was no stemming the tide of tears . " Well , so did he see your sweet face every day all summer last year ! " cried Julie in a rage now . " And do you think he remembers it any better than anybody else ? " Annick had quietly listened , but it was evident that this scene had made her sick at heart . Every detail of it , and the principle behind it as well , had sickened her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " this is what I have decided . " Her calm face and her unperturbed voice alone should have been a rebuke to them without the necessity of the words that followed . " I think it is Marthe who is really suffering the most , and for this reason I too am going to remain home from the picnic . Marthe and Luc are very companionable together , and I am sure that if she goes off happy in the shoes she wants so much that surely everybody will be happier today on Castle Island . " Maman looked at her with pride and admiration . What a sacrifice it was , she felt , how much more than human from the lips of the one among them all who had received a special mark of attention from the young man ! It was almost more than God Himself might have done under such circumstances . " What a pity that all my girls , " said Maman sharply , " do not consider others as Annick has just done ! " " What a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd all stay home from Castle Island and Luc could fish with Nicolas all afternoon . It 's exactly what the poor type would prefer any-way ! " Nothing can describe the look which smote Marthe 's face at her sister 's use of the word type in reference to Luc . She rose trembling from the bed and stuffed her handkerchief into her quivering mouth . Without a word she went into her own bedroom , and presently they heard her calling the servant top 79bring up her buckskin shoes . Bridget and Maman insisted that Annick be one of the party , and Maman finally conceded that Julie  --  " my garcon manque , " she called her as she admonished her to get her hair washed while they were absent  --  might stay at home . The two row-boats had been lifted out of the pond and carried across the dam wall to the salty river , and there they were bobbing quietly at the little wharf at the end of the road . A flock of servants was packing them tight with hampers , and Nicolas manned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other . As if there were no question in the matter , Marthe stepped into Luc 's boat , showing the really beautiful calf of her slim leg as she did so . With the greatest care , she tucked her linen skirts under her haunches . Maman and Papa and Annick followed her lead , and at the last moment Charlotte  --  with her three elder children  --  fled down the road and with cries of laughter climbed into Nicolas ' boat . Bridget and Charlotte sat on the back seat holding the rudder rope and squinting at the sun . " You look a sight , darling , " said Charlotte , " with your hair behind your ears ! " And if this was not the funniest thing in the world that had ever been said , it was pretty nearly so , for they sat shrieking with laughter . " All set ! " cried Nicolas . " Heigh-ho ! " responded Luc . And then he suddenly discovered that Julie had been left behind . " Why , where on earth is Julie ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspiration in her black tailored coat , cried out : " It 's all right , Luc , it 's quite all right , " she said . " Julie was not feeling quite well and preferred to stay at home . " But even though Luc was a doctor he would not take this as any good excuse . " Oh , no , " protested Luc . " I say , we ca n't leave Julie all alone like this ! " " Not all alone , " cried Marthe . " She 's going to have lunch with Jean . " " Oh , no , I say , " said Luc . " Julie must come along . It 's going to be a lot of fun , and Julie 's young , too , she 's the youngest of us all . She must come along ! "  |p8o  Ah , the wormwood of these words to Marthe ! She sat with her face as bitter as gall . But there was nothing to do but send little Jeannot back with a message for Julie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Castle Island at all . They sat waiting and bobbing on the water and Bridget could feel the freckles leaping one by one agilely upon her nose . Castle Island seemed scarcely a stone 's throw away , with its fluffy little woods growing all over it and its ruin of a castle hanging perilously to the rocks . There was nothing honest about it , except the little growth of oaks , for the island itself joined the mainland miles and miles up the river , and the castle had been built in ruins to make a picturesque spot in the Rance . The River Rance seemed now quite a worthy river , for the sea was in , and flowing up as it did from Saint-Malo , was offering them quite an expanse and swell of water . On the first downward turn of the tide , shrimp fishing would be lively along the rocks at Castle Island , said Papa . In anticipation of this several triangular nets had been placed in the waiting boats . Down came Julie and Jeannot together , running at top speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers on her feet had fluttered out as white as the wings of a dove . Oh , what rancour was written upon Marthe 's young face ! But Annick , for the first time that morning , looked extremely peaceful and at rest . Her sweetness was an actual living thing , and whether it was through pride or through humility , the real truth was that if others were not happy , she was unhappy too . Had they known that the island had already been invaded that day , the plans for their picnic would have undoubtedly been postponed , but once they had moored their boats and dragged the hampers ashore there seemed to be nothing to do but stay . An entire regiment of English people was scattered all over the island . Some were perched on the peaks of the quite sizable boulders and the ruins of the Castle were peopled with many English faces . Many of the gentlemen in the party wore little white canvas hats far back on their perspiring foreheads and the ladies wore light-coloured washable skirts which were short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted of a small smooth beach surrounded by high jagged rocks , of a steep rocky precipice on which hung the ruins , and on the heights behind the Castle a mild littlep81wood which grew away into a forest of pines through which ran an wide wild avenue that could easily have accommodated eight riders galloping abreast . On to this smooth clean beach Luc and the girls had dragged the boats up between the rocks and set them out of the reach of the tide . Already the hampers of food had been deposited at the foot of the precipice . Maman and Papa had begun the laborious journey up to the ruins and were grappling with their canes up the precipitous path . Nicolashad found himself weak in the legs after the row across and had sat down to rest . For the first time since Bridget had set eyes upon Luc , she observed an expression of distinct displeasure settle on his face . Some of the Englishmen upon their high vantage points had begun to train binoculars upon the little party of French people who had landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the island , and it was evident that he considered it as particularly their own . He knew exactly where he wanted to eat and where to build his fire , just as he had other years . Marthe and Julie took a hamper between them , Luc shouldereda second hamper , while Annick gathered up the two little baskets of wine . Like pirates with their loot , they started tip the rocky path , followed by Charlotte and Jeannot with the remaining hamper , and Mimi and Monique with packages of madeleines . Bridget and Nicolas were sitting hand in hand together watching the sea rippling in and out as he rested at its edge . It was a half hour before Nicolas had finally gained the top of the rocky cliff with Bridget , walking still with his arm across her shoulders , and they found the family settled in a littleclearing in the woods . The hampers of food were open and although Luc 's face was bleached with his anger everything seemed to be progressing well . The truth of the matter was that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had every summer made use of to build his fireplace . In fact , some years the fireplace had remained intact , just as he had left it the summer before , but on this occasion the English visitors had under his very eyes carried the stones kt sway while he was setting out the hampers of food . The girls set about finding other stones for Luc 's purpose , and Nicolas sat down among the family with his cane . It changed the whole look of the day with Luc 's spirits thusP82blighted , for when a shadow fell upon his face in this way it was as depressing as if the sun had suddenly given way to dreary weather . But presently a little alert Englishman came skipping back with a couple of their stones for them . " Oh , I say , " he called out , " what a delightful place to eat ! We ca n't make our fire burn at all over there , you know . What if we set it up where it was in the first place ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put you out at all ? " he said . " I do n't want to put you people out , you know . " Luc had no idea of his language at all and went on piecing his fireplace together . And then a happy thought struck the little Englishman . " Why on earth should we have two fires ? " he exclaimed . " I think it would be ever so much jollier if we all made use of the one , you know . You 've got such a ripping fire going . " Whether it was that the Englishman read something like acquiescence into their faces , or whatever it was , he suddenly called out to the great regiment of his countrymen . " Look here , " he called out . " Here 's a fellow who knows exactly what he 's about . He 's got a perfectly splendid little fire going . What do you say ? " At this moment Bridget spoke . " Do you really think there 's enough room ? " she asked the alert little Englishman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , do you speak English ? Do you really ? " he cried . " Well , is n't this jolly . But I do think there 's room , you know , " he said . " We look an awful mob , do n't we ? But we 're only thirty-two . " Aside went the branches of the charmed circle ; the deep moss groaned and perished beneath the sixty-four advancing feet , and the little Englishman threw the most indulgent smile upon the party of French people . " I do feel as though we might be trespassing , " he said in the politest way in the world . While two members of his party occupied themselves with the preparations for lunch , the little English leader talked and talked to the others about the physiognomy of Brittany . They had come on foot from Dinah , it appeared , to see this lovely old-world spot and to witness the rising tide late in the afternoon . He had pulled aside the boughs of a thick low oak on thep83very edge and there , directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the sea . Impossible to believe that they had climbed so high or that they were anywhere except upon an inland plain . It was the greatest surprise to English , French , and to the American as well to see the hard steel scales of water among the cones and needles of the pines that stood between . " A safe enough little river from here , " said he . Suddenly he leaned down and seized upon a leaf which he lifted in his narrow sharp fingers . The bough of the oak he had been holding open for them to see so far below swept back like a fan . " Oh , do see what I 've found ! " he cried out to his people . " Do come and see what I 've found ! " " Oh , rare and beautiful , " he murmured . " Not a web broken . Every thread of it perfectly reeled from the cocoon . " It was the skeleton , the magic ghost of a leaf he was holding out to show them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely , " he said . And then his sharp little fingers snapped closed in his palm and his eyes ( lanced after the slow descent of the tufted pinch of dust that fell from his hand . Before the powder of the crushed leaf had time to reach the earth , his eyes had raced to the white silky moss and lingered upon the stalks of moss upon which it was to fall . Suddenly he smiled winsomely at the entire company . " De nihilo nihil fit , " he said . The stubborn professional beetling of Luc 's golden brows had succeeded in boiling the French water first , while two young English gentlemen took turns at holding the English tin saucepan over whatever bits of flame escaped Luc 's vigilance . Almost at the same moment the two parties sat down in the infinitesimal space the clearing afforded them , with the woods and the beach and all the rest of the land going completely to waste . The French people sat deliberately down with theirbacks to the thirty-two English people and ate their hardboiledeggs and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at mealtime , but had they spoken now they had no chance at all of hearing each others ' voices . The other party was conversing in polite English voices and behavingin a very mannerly way , but the number of them conversingsimultaneously put any other thought or speech , or any emotion , out of the question.  |p84The  meal had begun when the little fiery-eyed leader discovered that his party had not provided him with hardboiledeggs . He was very winsome about it , and pretended that he was in the very worst kind of distress because the English women of his group had never thought of preparing hardboiledeggs . " Oh , I do love a hard-boiled egg , " he began . Papa 's back was facing him , and Maman 's gloomy black parasol was opened against the entire English party , but the little leader began to throw the most charming looks into their midst . " Could I possibly wangle a hard-boiled egg from you ? " he said . " I do n't really need a very big one , " he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I mean to say , that one which the little girl has just broken open would be about my size . " Under the relentless eyes of her family , Mimi handed over the egg to the strange little Monsieur . In doing so she was so shy that she could have perished , but she had been taught to be polite . The little man began to talk now . He thought it was awfully decent of them to have given him the egg , he said , and he began to tell them about the parties he took on walking trips around Brittany . He knew Brittany as well as he knew the inside of his hat . " You speak French very well , " said Nicolas , and for this Luc was ready to hate him forever . One long gleaming look of despise from Luc made Nicolas go on . " Hardly an accent , " said he . Papa could hardly control himself . An Englishman speakingof Brittany as the inside of his hat ! But the rebel son went on exchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I teach French to students in the University of Tibet , " said he . " But this is n't a bad way of spending one 's summers , you know . In fifteen minutes , by the way , " said he , looking at his wrist , " I shall begin my talk on the historical legends of the Castle . " " I can give you a good one , " said Nicolas . The little man leaned forward . " It was built just as you see it today , " said Nicolas confidentially to him , " about twenty years ago of machine-cut rock . Did n't you notice the brick lining under the staircase ? " The little man had gone a shade lighter . The globe of hisP85eye was white as milk in his brown face . " How decent of you to tell me , " he said . " But , I say , " he went on , " shall we keep it among ourselves and not let the members of my party in on it ? " His bright little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you all have a drink of cider with us ? " he suggested . He held up two great bottles of the stuff and to Bridget 's surprise every one of the family accepted , save Luc . Glass by glass the family warmed up to the little man and Papa in particular was delighted with the stories he told of the castles and cloisters in the remotest corners of Brittany . It was evident that his life had been an active one and that he was accustomed to directing others . In a moment he leaped to his feet and blew on a little whistle that hung about his neck . " Now , will the ladies be good enough to go over to that side of the wood ? " he said when silence had finally fallen upon them all . " Yes , that 's right . I think you 'll find yourselves quite out of sight behind those trees over there , and will you be good enough not to return until the whistle sounds again ? Thank you . " In some confusion the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were presently lost to sight among the trees , while he himself led the gentlemen of his party off to another corner of the woods . The French family sat talking together , apparently oblivious to the implication of the English people 's absence . Again was the sharp whistle heard on the air and immediately men and women alike began to wander back to the clearing , nonchalantly talking of the clear weather and the view , for all the world as if they had not but two minutes before been poised in the most awkward positions behind the trees . " My fifteen minutes are exhausted , " said the little Englishman , wandering back as carelessly as the others , " and I can not abandon my legends , even for the sake of verity . " With this he led his countrymen away to the tower and there the French family could hear his voice instructing and declaiming .   BEFORE THE AFTERNOON WAS OVER it became evident that a rain storm was gathering in the air . The sea had entirely receded now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward between the great wet flanks of mud . All below them now looked like a volcanic land , and far at the bend which flowed on to Saint-Malo was the storm curving up , solemn and opaque . As it broke over Castle Island , the French family took refuge in one of the tower chambers . There sat Maman and Papa and Charlotte and the children squatting on the empty hampers in the cold stony room . Bridget and Nicolas stood together by the narrow tower window watching through the rusty bars of it the deep banks of mud such miles below them , and the thread of a river , and the swinging white curtains of rain . Luc was in fine spirits again and for the benefit of Marthe and Julie he was doing a lively Spanish dance to the piercing screams of their laughter . In and out of the doorway , and hither and yon did he go , flinging his chin in the air and knuckling his hands on his hips . Never had the old tower room echoed to such peals of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to play the fool , and now they sat talking together about graver things . Annick was putting all her hopes these days upon a trip to Lourdes , the pilgrimage to Lourdes under the direction of Father Bimont which would take place in the early autumn . Their voices were almost inaudible under the bellow and rumble of the storm . Bridget looked at Nicolas ' face as he stood close to her looking away over the drenched beach , over the mud banks and the long deposits of sand . The bed of the river itself was like any earthy river bed , but with the sea washing up it twice every day for centuries much sand had been deposited and left along the surface , and the beach of Castle Island was made up entirely of what the sea had left behind . There was no denying it , thought Bridget as she looked at him , that Nicolas had changed his mind . The romantic thing of love for themselves and for their own pride and strength had altered , and now she thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing beside him . He was perfectly absorbed in the spectacle of clouds and earth below him , she thought , and in some conjectures of his own mind , but without turning his head to her he suddenly began to speak . " How do you feel about having a child ? " he said . " Let 's surprise them , " she said . She put her fingers tentativelythrough the crook of his arm . " Shall we surprise them all and have a child ? " " Are you joking ? " said Nicolas . His face had never changed . " No , " she said . " I do n't believe I am joking . I 'm not quite sure . " She stood holding his arm close to her and watching the warm white swinging curtains of rain . " We would have the money then , " she said . " And we would go away . " " You 're just as criminal as the rest of them , " said Nicolas . They stood watching the storm for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something , " he said . " I 'm not getting better here , and the family irritates me , and in Paris there are doctors who maybe could help me out . We could do translation jobs together , if we had a little money to start off . " " Well , what shall we do ? " said Bridget . She was ready to do anything at all. 88 " I am going to ask Charlotte to lend me some money , " he said . " Jean has never in his life made anyone a loan of money , but maybe he will make a difference for you and me . I want to go to Paris at once , next week , before I get worse . I 'm going crazy here like this , " said he . Bridget felt her heart and her soul melting to him , her blood turning weak in her veins for him , and she flung her arm about his narrow waist . " Yes , yes , " she said , whispering in her love for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " The storm had abated and the few spears of water that still fell were polished and bright with sun . Presently a rainbow sprang up from Charlotte 's pond and arched over the tiny river . In a moment the family emerged from the tower room and descended the dripping steps . With the empty hampers they made their way down the path among the boulders , and now they could see the waters from Saint-Malo beginning to rise and churn far down at the bend . Miles away was the tide coming in and up the river bed to them , and Papa estimated that in not more than twenty minutes the waters would have reached Castle Island and gone past them to Dinan and then they would be able to launch the boats and set out for the homeward row . The family made their way slowly down , for the mud was slippery as glass and the rocks as black as ink after the rain . From this distance the advancing sea seemed ineffectual enough as it came up like a widening blade between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thatched towns . The sea was apparently creeping up the river bed into the very heart of the countryside , but from this distance it was such a small bit of the sea that no one feared it at all . The party of English people had miraculously reappeared , had sprung up after the rain and were crawling over the rocks of the descent to settle themselves in the best positionsto view the approaching tide . The French family settled down at the foot of the precipice they had just descended and waited for it to come . At the present moment they could almost have walked across to Charlotte 's house which looked quite life-size sitting on the edge of its pond . Except for the danger of sinking in the streaming banks of mud and in the clear strips of sand , theyP89could easily have made their way by foot to the river that ran deep in a crevice in the mud , leapt across it , and continued on foot to the other side . Here they sat with their various thoughts and conversationswhen the thunder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a mild looking line of blue sea it was coming up the wide bed of the river with the gulls dipping and curving over it as it came . Even the gulls ' cries they could hear now , and a sort of tang and whistle of the sea on the air . When it reached the wall of Charlotte 's pond , they began really to see it . One straight arrow of water shot directly up the descending river 's course , and behind the arrow came galloping and galloping the thundering regiment of white riders , tearing and pitching forward with the volumes and miles of blue water piled at their galloping heels . Along the edges , there was very little movement and the water seemed merely to be rising steadily but smoothly along Charlotte 's wall . But in the centre was this thunderous advance of white horsemen with the gulls screaming and picking at their heads and their feet galloping steadily and relentlessly on towards Castle Island . The island lay right in the course of the crested thundering waves which advanced abreast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached for Nicolas and clung to his hand , transfixed by the glory and terror of the sea 's advance . The children were close in Charlotte 's skirts , and Luc , with his capable bright head lifted , was sniffing the wind . His small nostrils were spread with delight and he turned to shout something to them but no sound could be heard except the sea 's wild hollow roar . On and on came the sea , and just as it seemed that it must rear up upon the beach at Castle Island , it split thunderously apart and as if with a common will the greater number of the white riders went full speed up the river to the right side of the island with the deep blue sea behind them in full cry . Those who remained turned and snarled and splattered in confusion among the rough rocks on the beach 's edge , and then in a moment turned off to the left of the island with what was left of the pack of sea behind , and thus cantered out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance and was again cut off from the mainland to the naked eye. 90p90Now wherever they looked there was no spot of mud or land until the opposite shore . The closest haven was the wharf on which Bridget and Nicolas had danced one night with the country people and the fishermen , and further down stream was the top of Charlotte 's wall . The waters had mounted almost to the top of it , but only twice a year did the waters really surmount the wall and flood the pond and even , at unusual times , run into Charlotte 's garden . Once the sea had come into her kitchen . But the incoming tide they had seen today was the thing that had happened daily and nightly , day in and day out , for centuries . And day in and day out for centuries had the poor little river been shot through by the advancing waters and been turned completely around in its course and rushed upstream as hard as it could go . Hardly had the first impact of the water passed them by than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sands had greatly diminished since high tide , but Luc had known very well how far inland he must draw the boats and they were still out of water . Into them they tossed the empty hampers , and then Luc and the girls began to drag them out towards the rocks . The sea was lapping in so gently now , sucking between the boulders with a gentle slap and throb . Julie , in her direct mannish way , was settling the oars in their sockets and swaying back and forth as she stood with her legs set far apart . Above them were the English , perched on the rocks with their binoculars , and far , far above them was the ruined tower with its windows open like eyes in exclamation , deserted and far above them in the oaks . It was Luc who climbed upon a rock that had some footing to it and swung the family up and over , one by one , from the beach and into the bobbing boats . Over went Maman and Papa in his strong young arms . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . The veins bulged a bit in his temples as he lifted Papa , but the three girls were like feathers in his hands . Over went the children like puffs of wind , over went Nicolas , but not entirely , for he swung himself a bit on his cane besides . And once in it , Nicolas found his own boat was filled , with Charlotte and Bridget still waiting on the shore . " Well , no matter , no matter , " said Luc . " The others can come with me . " P91Charlotte protested that for nothing on earth would she let Luc lift her over into the boat . " You could get a hernia for life , " she kept protesting . But in spite of her opposition he grabbed her up and swung her great laughing figure into his boat . After this struggle he leaned back a moment against the rock to catch his breath . " You see , " cried Charlotte in remorse , " I 've almost killed you ! " " But nothing of the sort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it leaned over and took Bridget 's armpits in his hands . He swung her up against him , and as he regained his balance he held her there . Her breath had scarcely the time to come in and out , and then he set her down in the boat on the other side , but in that second of hesitation she had felt the deep bell that had been set ringing in his blood . Nicolas and his little party in one boat had already pushed off and they could see that Julie had taken her place beside him and was pulling at one oar . And now Luc 's craft began to nose quietly out through the rocks . He was using his oar as a paddle and guiding them gently out . The sea looked to them now as mild as a lake on a summer day , but they could see that Nicolas and Julie together were having some trouble ahead . And indeed once they were clear of the rocks and out in the open water , the current struck them like the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung them straight about and again the rock teeth tore sharply through the sea , covered and bare and covered again against the ribs of the boat . But Luc was not to be caught a second time unawares . He clung to the oars as if their lives depended on it and , as he rowed , Bridget watched the sharp quiver of his strength down his body and through his braced legs to his wet bare feet . All about them the current was coiled dark and close like a great soft cobra , wrapped dark and stifling about the brittle ribs of the boat . Marthe and Annick sat behind Luc , and Annick was singing to them in her high clear voice . Before him sat Charlotteand Bridget , guiding the rudder , and Bridget looked for a moment at his fine arms tapering to the oars and then looked away . Now the water was swinging in clear ovals of milk and green about them and Luc had rowed them gallantly through the roughest piece of sea . Suddenly they felt the boat released and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his oars a moment and then began to row with long easy pulls at the water . Presently they had outstripped Nicolas ' party although Luc did not seem to be exerting himself at all . There was a burst of laughter from the children as they passed , and the family all called out to one another and waved their hands . Luc 's little boat sprang lightly on towards the shaggy legs of the wharf and the others were left to follow in their quivering wake . When Bridget looked at Luc 's oblivious face and listened to Annick 's voice chiming out in song she had to remind herself that in that moment of hesitation upon the rock she had heard in her heart the rich ominous thunder of his blood. " ... t'es New trop petit , dame oui , " sang Annick , and her voice singing made the air innocent and pure . By the time they had drifted under the wharf with the sturdy legs of it striking the quiet water , Bridget was thinking that maybe it was a dream of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in it at all . P93ON THE FOLLOWING DAY it was that Oncle Robert drove  --  out to them from Saint-Malo . It was his custom to come this way upon them without a word of warning so that Maman complained to Bridget and the girls as she fled from bureau drawer to dressing-table that never by any chance did Robert find her with a clean white band around her throat or any but an old skirt on her . " It would be such an easy matter for him , " she said as she pinned fast a bit of ruching under her chin , " to send a telephonemessage by the doctor . It is n't as if we were cut off from all communication , " said she . " The doctor is every day at Charlotte 's for the baby or for Jean 's injections , or for this or that , so that at times I wonder if Robert does not come with some end in mind . " " It 's the only way he can see you without a collar , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had no intention to change . " It would give him the greatest satisfaction , " said Maman  --  her moistened forefinger and thumb were rapidly pinching into place the pleats of her black cloth skirt  --  " to see a bit of dust that had n't been swept up in the hall , or a dish P94cloth left hanging on the line . " Her mind was making a hurried and painstaking tour of the entire house , peering into odd corners , smoothing out imaginary creases here and there . She squinted grimly at herself in the small glass in her room , cawed a few words to her daughters , and hastened down the stairs . Papa and Nicolas were chatting with Oncle Robert in the salon and Maman 's ardent wish was to hasten him out to have tea in the garden before his eye should fall upon the case of miniatures . She knew quite well that a coffee cup had been set down upon the glass of it and had left a ring . " I can not wait for any of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and put herself between Oncle Robert and the case of miniatures until she could somehow manoeuvre him out-of-doors . " And Bridget , " she said as she began her descent of the stairs , " your dress with the long sleeves and buttons is much prettier on you . I do not mean it as a criticism , my dear , " she said , putting her hand on Bridget 's arm . " But this one is perhaps a little crushed and a little bit too low in the neck for Oncle Robert . " Cawing hoarsely at her daughters , she hurried down the stairs in her high black button shoes . To get inside her head for a minute , thought Bridget as she was left in the hall , it would be a funny thing to get inside and know what was going on . Why do you put up with my low necks and my bare arms ? she thought . Such loyalty to a young man who would stick you in the middle if ever he got the chance at it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rapidly going down and you must cling to me as well as to all the other members upon board . Once you recognize in us the rats who would sell their skins to skurry from the sinking ship , all will be lost . She could hear Maman 's feet striking the tiles of the front hall-way . Her words , sharpened with reproach , pierced the deep well of the stairs : " Mon cher Robert . " Bridget could hear the chirping of her kisses as she pecked at Oncle Robert 's face . " Mon cher Robert , how nice of you to have come ! " As Bridget went into her own room she slammed the door . In this house it was an offence of some kind . In this bosom so exposed to the human love of simple things , of children , of daughters-in-law , this love of the Church , she had almostP95carelessly , but still viciously enough , slammed the door . As she did so at least twenty doves were startled into flight from under the eaves of the mansard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circling about the tidy garden . Bridget paused at the dressing-table and took off her dress . The grass blinds were gently blowing , and beyond them were the trees flowering darkly and richly at the windows , and presently the doves returned to the mansard eaves and were again strutting about and cooing there . Such a cooing of ring-doves there was under the low eaves that not a tear could have been heard had it fallen . And why should I cry , said Bridget to her own face in the mirror . Why in the world should I cry ? She stood watching the tears as they came up , swelling under her lids and rolling singly away down her cheeks . So much more beautiful than any smile could be , and yet they were the speech of sorrow . Nicolas , Nicolas , I could be a brave woman if I tried , she was thinking . She stuck out her tongue at her crying face in the mirror . If I were a brave woman I 'd go out and make a fortune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped lightly at the door and had come in . She noticed nothing but her own shameful face in the glass before her until Marthe suddenly threw her arms around her neck . In a passion of love Marthe held Bridget close in her long naked arms , and although Bridget tried to turn soft and cling to her , she felt herself rigid and hard as bone , standing apart . " My poor sister , " cried Marthe to her in a distressed whisper . " I know why you are crying . You wish to go away . Like all of us you want to go away . Annick wants to go into a convent , and I want to go away and marry Luc . " Marthe sat down upon the bed and her hands pulled Bridget down beside her . " I am sure , Bridget , " she said , " I am sure that I am the one who should marry Luc . Annick , at heart , it is a convent she has always wanted . And perhaps you do not know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons why Julie should not marry anyone at all . " Her voice whistled sharply through her teeth . " Julie is not like an ordinary girl , you know . Every month something happens to all of us , of course , but it has never happened to Julie although she is eighteen . The doctors say maybe it never will . But do n't youP96think Luc should be told this , Bridget ? Do n't you think it should be Pierre 's duty as our brother to tell Luc so that Luc will be able to decide ? I think Pierre could talk to Luc very easily and tell him that at heart Annick would only be happy in a convent and that Julie could never be a mother , you know , and in this way it would make it easier for Luc to decide . " Marthe sat looking eagerly at Bridget through the filtered light of the room . " Do n't you think I 'm right , Bridget ? " she whispered . She sat fondling Bridget 's hand . " Do n't you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Annick 's pure mild voice had floated up the stairs , reminding them that Oncle Robert and Maman were awaiting them for tea . Bridget pulled her modest dress on , combed her hair with a wet comb , and with her arm around Marthe 's waist , she walked down the two flights of stairs . " No , no , " Oncle Robert 's voice was politely protesting as they entered the salon , " I assure you , my dear , I am ever so much more comfortable here than I should be outside . I have not acquired that charming rustic habit of taking nourishment under the trees . The light disturbs rather than allures me and I am constantly besieged by bugs . They flit into my tea and drown there with the greatest unconcern . They relish , in particular , long venturesome excursions between my collar bone and navel  --  " " Oh , Robert , " protested Maman . She had been vainly attempting to whisk a lace tidy from a chair back to the case of miniatures in order to conceal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . And when Marthe and Bridget entered the room arm in arm , Oncle Robert turned to welcome them and behind his back Maman manipulated the rapid change . " My dear , dear Bridget ! " exclaimed Oncle Robert . He laid his frail hands upon her shoulders and with his lips pursed up he drily kissed her cheeks . After he had passed on to welcome Marthe , the clean fragrance of his soft white hair lingered , and Bridget felt a burst of sympathy and affection for the delicate old man . He turned to Maman as she sank at last with unspeakable relief into a chair . " Now , why do you cover up that lovely miniature case ? " asked Oncle Robert immediately , as if possessed . " I do declare , P97Auguste , " he murmured to Papa with the faintest of smiles , " women would be the destruction of all aesthetics were they not the inspiration of them as well . " Across to the case of miniatures skipped Oncle Robert and with two fingers flecked the lace doily away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should never have even a shadow of lace upon them . Have you examined them , Bridget dear ? My beautiful Bridget , " he murmured as she came and stood beside him . His fastidious hand moved absentlyacross her buttocks . " Have you ever remarked that perfectly exquisite miniature of your dear father-in-law , a veritable masterpiece created from sixteen photographs dating from the age of six months until he was twenty-five ? Hence the slight obesity about the middle which was no more than a childish characteristic that completely disappeared once he had forsaken his mother 's breast , and hence also the suggestion of a moustache upon his upper lip . " His hand had progressed upward and was lingering upon Bridget 's shoulder . " It is safe to say that this is a speaking likeness of your father-in-law 's first quarter of a century . But what a shame , " said Oncle Robert in an aside to Maman , " that the servant you now have does not keep things in the immaculate order which has always been such a principle of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass cover to the miniature . " There are several fly specks upon Auguste 's brow , and certainly someone set down a cup of something or other right here on the glass . " Fluttering his handkerchief he sank exhausted into an armchairand crossed his small neat feet before him . " But to come to the point of my visit , " said Oncle Robert as if it had occurred to him that the discoveries he had just made might be mistaken as the cause . " I want to offer a betrothal gift and a luncheon to whichever one of my dear nieces has decided to marry Luc ! " One little hand precisely rapped out the words into the palm of the other , and as he spoke Marthe turned livid , Julie made furtive grasps at the hairs that were straying as if in a high wind about her ears , and Annick looked up from her needlework and smiled . " It is very , very good of you , Oncle Robert , " said Annick. 98 " Not at all , " said Oncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples . " Only I have no idea how matters stand . My own humble conviction is that Annick would be the one most suited to Luc 's professional ways . I am persuaded , my lovely Marthe , that you are still a bit young and extravagant , and I know that Julie 's tastes run more to robust things such as le sport . But Annick  --  " " Annick was always your favourite , Robert , " said Papa savagely . His false teeth slipped up and down in his annoyance . It was evident that both Maman and Papa resented Oncle Robert 's interference . Maman 's silence as she plied her crochet needle indicated that she considered Oncle Robert 's interest most exaggerated and most insincere . . . Annick , peculiarly suited by temperament and inclination , " continued Oncle Robert , raising his voice as if to cry down any opposition . " But here , " he said , " is tea . " " It was certainly no more than that he found he had an idle day in Saint-Malo , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others down Charlotte 's drive , " and so came out to put his finger in other people 's affairs . He is , of course , in terror of dying alone and thinks that Annick would be the most devoted and return to nurse him if he ever fell ill , but as far as any affection goes ! And as for making a present ! " Her voice went off in a shrill whistle of derision . " He has never made anyone a present in his life , " she said . " And of course he is quite mistaken about Annick . Marthe would make the perfect wife for Luc . That is so evident that it is not worth discussingLuc himself came walking up the drive as they went down . At the sight of him all Maman 's worry vanished from her face , the wrinkles of concern perished from about her eyes and mouth . This handsome man , this gleaming god-like man , came striding up the drive towards them , bearing the sun in the roots of his hair even , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapely teeth . This man , was Maman 's heart protesting , must somehow , through the flesh of one of her three daughters , be grafted to them all , be one rich fruitful bough upon the decaying family tree . " Luc , mon Luc , " she said . " How solemn you are , " said Luc , standing still directly before them . Over their shoulders he waved his hand to Oncle99p99Robert and the girls beyond . But Maman could not refrain from turning back to glimpse the admiration which she felt must surely have transfigured Oncle Robert 's discriminating face , turned back as well to see if the three girls were looking at their best , and there was Luc left facing Bridget on the drive . The Chinese tilleul 's boughs dripped down into a saucer of yellow wax and Luc walked close to her and stood before her quietly with his eyes searching hers . When he opened his lips to speak she found that her hand had involuntarily risen as if to stop him from what he was about to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly . " Why have you been crying ? Why have you been crying ? " he said . And then the whole family swept down upon them : Maman and Papa , Oncle Robert , Nicolas and the three girls . Down they swept , with the tittering and talking of the girls , and with Nicolas leaning on his cane . " Ah , Luc , " said Oncle Robert holding out his hand . " Not looking so well as when I last saw you , " he murmured . " Have you been working too hard ? " Upon his words both Maman and Marthe burst into protest . How could Oncle Robert say such a thing ! Why , never had Luc looked so well , si beau , said Maman . Marthe blushed furiously , but she dared not utter the word . Even the country doctor had been astonished this year by Luc 's bonne mine . " Ah ? " said Oncle Robert . Now that he had succeeded in disappointing them as to his opinion of Luc 's appearance , he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little talk with you , Luc , " he continued . " In fact , I might say it is the object of my visit . Shall we take a little promenade along the road ? " As Luc bowed his head in assent the lovely summer afternoon expired , the shadows of the passing clouds darkened the faces of the three young girls who could do nothing now but turn and walk off with their parents down the driveway to their married sister 's happy home . It was this fatal insistence of Oncle Robert 's upon picking and choosing his favourites which made him in the family such an object of scorn . How they resented the right he assumed that he need only indicate who his companions should be for the others to withdraw as if in humility ! A family situation in which he played his part was always dramatized by his discard and his choice , and the 00imposition of his preferences was the great weapon which held them at a distance and intimidated them . At this moment Oncle Robert put a detaining hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ! " he whispered . " I never have a moment to talk with you and Bridget . Do come along ! " Like happy casual people on a boulevard talking and laughing and making jokes with one another , the four of them walked leisurely away . Oncle Robert had drawn Bridget 's arm through his , and Nicolas walked up on the other side . Luc carried with him a blue rubber ball which the children had forgotten in the garden , and as he walked a step or two ahead , he tossed it idly from hand to hand . There were the bits of sun on them that came through the light ragged wind as they walked up the road , pruning and cooing like four clean wellfeddoves . The dust of the highroad was delicately powdering the noses of their boots , and the oaks that shaded donkey carts and wagon ruts rustled and shook their heavy heads above them . " My dear Luc , " said Oncle Robert , rhythmically patting Bridget 's hand as they walked . Her parasol hung over both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm place you have in my heart . You are not unlike my own boy who is now so far away . " He waved his silk handkerchief at a passing dragon-fly . " Dieu suit , it would be charming to have you in the family . " Back and forth went Luc 's blue rubber ball , idly back and forth from hand to hand . " There are many reasons why I should like to be , " he said . Bridget felt Nicolas ' hand resting on her arm , and then he lifted his cane from the ground and swung it viciously at a group of daisy heads which scattered down before their feet like white stars in the dust . " This degenerate family needs you , Luc , " he said bitterly . " We are in desperate need of quarts of new blood in every vein of us ... " " You 'd have such pretty children , " continued Oncle Robertin his vaguest and most absent-minded manner . " You yourself , Luc , were such an attractive boy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert playfully . " It may be difficult to imagine such a thing now , but he had the most beautiful hair and the biggest eyes in the world . " P1o1At this Luc threw back his radiant head and laughed . Up fled the ball from his hands into the heavy summer air , and as it dropped again his eyes turned sideways to see Bridget 's eyes . " Do you think it would be difficult to imagine such a thing ? " he said . He was so like a child then , thought Bridget , looking at her with his clear untroubled gaze and playing with his ball . Suddenly it occurred to Bridget that Luc was too young , really too beautiful and young to be the proper husband of any one of the girls . " Oh , do n't get married ! " she said suddenly . It seemed so important to her that he understood how aloof his radiance should remain from the good family 's vigilance . " Oh , do n't get married ! " she said . Luc looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her steadily through the oval shadow of her parasol . " But you did , " he said to her as if in accusation . " After all , you did , you know . " But whatever Oncle Robert learned from his conversation with Luc , he gave no hint of it to the family . " Oh , my dears , what a family ! " he said . He pressed Bridget 's arm close to his heart as they walked . He threw his hands up in dismay . " Quelle famille ! " he said . He hushed his voice to a whisper : " How do you survive , " he said , " you young ones with your thirsts and appetites ? " They had come down the road towards the river and rounded Charlotte 's wall . Into the midst of the family they walked and Oncle Robert sank down among the cushions of the chaise longue in the shadow of the acacia tree . " I have had the most delightful time , " he told them all as he rearranged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The loveliest time in the world , but now I must be off . Charlotte , my dear , either the coach or the limousine will do , but please , I beg of you , please do n't get out the sulky on my account . " " Oh , but of course I shall , Oncle Robert , " said Charlotte . The whole family knew that Oncle Robert would never cease reviling them to other and remoter relatives if he were not driven to the station in the sulky . He admired the filly and he liked to question and gossip with the driver on his way.  |p102But  Oncle Robert had only just begun his various adieux when the little filly was led around the side of the stable , stepping lightly with her shiny black harness trailing behind her on the ground . Oncle Robert had already kissed the children , and now he pinched the lobes of their ears with more spleen than affection , embraced his four nieces , and approachedAnnick . He paused before her for a moment and a tender light seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured as he kissed her cheeks , " my dear , dear little Annick . . . " When the bright yellow sulky finally rolled out before them , Oncle Robert was at the end of the line and he drew Maman aside a moment to speak confidentially in her ear . Her head was eagerly inclined to him so as to capture every sound , but as she listened a shade of disappointment passed over her face . " Extraordinaire , " she cawed at him . " Extraordinaire . " But it was evident that he had not told her anything she wished to know . He stood up in the sulky as it went slowly up the drive , waving his silk handkerchief at them , and touching his eyes with it from time to time as if tears of regret at leaving them were about to fall . As soon as the tilleul partially concealed him from their view , he sat abruptly down and could be seen opening a conversation with the driver and settling his straw hat precisely on his head . P103WITHIN THE HOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oncle Robert had whispered i n Maman 's ear . Maman had told Papa , and Papa told Charlotte in indignation , and when Nicolas had a long talk with Charlotte in her room and asked her if he could borrow some money from her and Jean , Charlotte told Nicolas what it was that Oncle Robert had said . Although no one took Oncle Robert seriously , Charlotte could not help crying when she told Nicolas . When she came down from her talk with Nicolas she kissed Bridget a hundred times . " I 'm going to talk to Jean , now , " she said . " I 'm going to ask him for the money for you , and I 'm sure it will be all right . I 'm sure , I 'm sure , " she whispered as if convincing herself against her own doubt . But no one could be persuaded to tell Bridget or the girls what it was that Oncle Robert had said . That it had to do with Luc was taken for granted , and like bees about the hive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her tell . Whatever it was , it had evidently given Papa food for reflection , and he had sought his little basket and cane and  |p104gone  off to the hen-house to look for eggs . Annick was sitting in the garden with her group of urchins reciting their catechismbefore her , and around the house , through the strawberrybed , and up to the ringing torrent of the pump Marthe and Julie pursued Maman on her active way . Here she had a path to rake , here a wayward vine to train , here a rose bush to clip into obedience . Marthe was shrieking with laughter and spinning about on the balls of her feet , begging and bribing Maman with an offer to make the mayonnaise for lunch all week if only Maman would tell . Julie offered to take out the ladder and pick the cherries the first thing in the morning . It was an idle hour for them and up and down the garden they went , following in Maman 's hasty steps until dusk began to fall . Just before supper Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a book beneath her arm and she came walking along as if it were the most natural thing in the world for her to come to them at this hour of the day . But never before had she left her own house at suppertime , had abandonedJean and the children to come to the family 's house . She sauntered up the garden with her head somewhat averted so that they should not perceive that her eyes were swollen , and with a coating of powder across her face to conceal the ravages of her weeping . They were all sitting awaiting the call to supper outside the dining-room door . " Could I have supper with you , Maman ? " she said . Had she announced that the world had come to an end the family could not have been more astonished . " Of course you can , " said Maman . Her piercing eye turned a furtive but unerring glance upon her eldest daughter . " I 'll tell them to put another place , " she said . She snapped her eyeglasses back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-room window which opened down to the garden like a door . And there sat the family , Papa behind his paper , Luc and Nicolas playing chess , Charlotte rippling the pages of her open novel , and Bridget and the three girls . No words were spoken , except those which touched upon the new moon and the weather , but it was understood that Jean had refused to give Nicolas and Bridget the loan . All through supper no words concerning Jean or the children or the future were exchanged , and every mention of Oncle Robert 's name brought them back to the same demand . " Oh , Maman , Maman , " wailed Marthe in vexation . " Now is the moment to tell us all what it was Oncle Robert said ! " Had not her pompadour of lightish hair risen so high and exposed such great portions of her face she might have risked more venturesome glances at Luc who sat across the table from her . But with her eyes and brow so unprotected she scarcely dared to dart a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between bursts of laughter , attempting to draw down a portion of her light fluffy fringe in which to ambush her two evasive eyes . " Nicolas wo n't be able to keep it from me , " said Bridget . But at her words Maman 's lips narrowed . Her nose hung ominously over her plate of soup and she turned a severe eye upon her son . It was then that Papa , so far from all that had been going on , suddenly raised his head . " Why , what are you doing at supper with us , Charlotte ? " he said . The warm soup and the few sips of cider had revived Charlotte 's pride . " I had a disagreement with my husband , " she said , " and I came back to you . " She gave him a small friendly smile , and again Papa 's chin sank far into the depths of his sky-blue linen stock . Slowly and reproachfully he shook his paternal head . " What a way to speak before your sisters ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goat 's milk before him on the table . " I think the milk 's a bit sour tonight , " he said with a grimace . " What 's that book you have there ? " He had reached forward to draw towards him the book which Charlotte had carelessly set down beside her plate . He fumbled for his eyeglasses and with difficulty settled them upon his nose . Then he discovered that he was holding the book upside down . He cleared his throat and turned the book carefully around . Slowly and deliberately he read the title aloud , and then as if the words as he deliberately pronounced them had struck some horror to his soul , his eyes started out of his head . " La Revolte des Anges ! " he cried again , and his voice rose o6high and sharp with his displeasure . " La Revolte des Anges ! " He looked at Charlotte with his proud wounded eyes . " Charlotte , what is this ? " he said . Charlotte had no idea what it was . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at the title page and was planning to read it through that night in bed . It was her custom to read for hours at night , for often she could not bring herself to fall asleep until the early hours of the morning . This was because , as she well knew , she led too trivial a life and was idle most of the day . " If I could travel about everywhere with the children , I do n't think I 'd ever read another book , " she said . " But this book , but this book , " said Papa . As a matter of fact , said Charlotte , it was Oncle Robert himself who had brought her the book that day from SaintMaio . " My brother ! " cried Papa aghast . " Yes , " said Charlotte . She made an effort to recall Oncle Robert 's remarks concerning it so as to repeat them to him . At any rate , Oncle Roberts had said that he had selected it for her especially , at the stationer 's shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it was obviously the cheapest edition that could be found . Oncle Robert had recommended it to her , said Charlotte , as a particularly beautifulbook written by Mr. Anatole France . " That is the man who married his cook , " said Maman . She had removed a toothpick from its little paper case and was forcing it in between her teeth . " Anatole France ! " snorted Papa . Anatole France . It hit the window-pane closed against the deep dusk in the garden and sprang back across the steaming plate of antichokes which the servant had set down upon the dining table . Anatole France , who had taken the name of his country in vain . " Anatole France , " said Papa bitterly . The veins were ready to burst in his head . Papa 's intense feeling about immoral literature was no senseless thing . Even though books were placed upon the index by the Church , he saw no harm in such people as Maman and himself , who were immune to passion , in reading them if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to Nicolas and Bridget later , his objection in this case was rooted in the fact that Charlotte was not an ordinary woman . Charlottewas a woman of passion , Papa told them in a whisper , and he had once been dismayed to find her reading a novel which dealt with a lady 's love affair with her chauffeur . " Imagine the ideas this might put into the head of such a woman as your sister , " said Papa in his proud wounded way . " I took the book out of her hands at once , but for weeks I was in terror of the harm it might even so have succeeded in doing . I even suggested to Jean , in a veiled way of course , that it might be wise to dispense with any male help about the place for a while . My one idea was more or less to isolate Charlotte until whatever effects the book might have had , had time to lose their first powerful influence . " Thus was La Revolte des Anger tossed contemptuously upon the serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was despatched to see with her own eyes that it was properly burned . Charlotte had no real interest in it , and no regret , but Nicolas took the matter up as if it were his own special grievance . Whatever Luc 's thoughts were he kept them to himself and devoted his attention to plucking off the leaves of his artichoke and dipping them deeply in the yellow frothy sauce . Hate and hate and hate was in Nicolas ' glance for each face at the table . Hate and hate for everyone except for Charlotte 's face , but even for her he had some little irritation now because she had not protested and because she was willing to accept censure from Jean and Papa as if it were their right to dole out sense and reason to her . Hate and hate for Maman 's face and her adroit toothpick spiking out great locks of shaggy artichoke at which she nibbled nervously . And hate for Luc 's unfeeling cleanliness and charm . Like a man 's face ill and turning on his pillow in pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , eyeing them all . Hate for Marthe 's hysteria , and hate for Annick 's unselfish heart that bade her not take the veil . Hate for Julie 's sullenness that was a barrier to her womanhood , and hate for his own wife who should have somehow mastered circumstances and made the family bosom but a temporary resting-place . Hate it was that made him turn upon Bridget and hold her captive in his bitter eye . " Would you like to know what it was that Oncle Robert said to Maman ? " he asked her in English . He had begun top108grin . He looked at her , grinning , with bright points of antagonismshining in his eyes . " Well , this was what it was , " he said . He could scarcely contain himself , so filled with hate was he for them all . " It was about you , Bridget , " he said . " Did you know it was about you ? " " No , " said Bridget . She watched him as she shook her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it now . Maman had risen from her seat , a signal to them all that she had observed from all their plates that the evening meal was done , and the entire family rose and followed her into the other room . " Yo-ho-ho , " yawned Maman as she smartly whipped the shutters closed across the open windows . Charlotte had caught up with Bridget in the salon doorway and pressed her hand . " I 'm going to bed , I think , " said Charlotte smiling brightly at her people . " He said he was very much surprised , " said Nicolas lazily as he lingered in the door , " that a person who seemed so very much a lady should wear the kind of earrings that you wore . "  | CHARLOTTE 'S LIMOUSINE quivered under the portico , the nickle buttock of the spot-light elongating the ( chauffeur 's mirrored nose until it hung reflected like a fresh sausage between his moustaches . Once Nicolas and Bridget had settled back in it , it leapt away up the drive . Up it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowing down and crying out sharply at the open grill . The children scampered after , waving and screaming after it . " Good-by-ee ! " they screamed after their aunt and uncle . They were learning English with Bridget . " Good-by-ee ! " they screamed , proud of the English Bridget taught them every afternoon . " Good-by-ee ! " before they were finally lost behind the umbrella trees as the road whipped away . " Are n't you a little ashamed to be a governess ? " said Nicolas , lighting a cigarette . " Does n't it debase you a little , gain of sand ? " But Bridget was feeling far from that , going off as she was In elation with Nicolas , escaping from the family with Nicolas to buy some stuff to make herself a dress . Every Monday in I ) inan there was a market in the streets and here they were going off with the money Charlotte had paid her for lessons toP110have a day together and to buy herself some kind of a dress . " But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most pointed smile . " Every situation you find yourself in must be turned to account . " " How malicious ! " said Bridget . She took her hand away from his . The world flowed past them in the windows , broken apart at cross-roads or sharply scarred by a wall . " I 'm not interested in little pieces of money , " said Nicolas . Without turning her head to him she could feel the intense gloom of his profile riding beside her . His mouth went down at the corners as if he were tasting something sour she knew . In her gums and her jaws she could almost taste the queer acrid sourness of his despair . And what days there had been together , she thought ! What days when the horses ' feet had sped over the firm red California clay and the carpet of portulaca flowers ! What mornings when Nicolas had stood half-naked at the pump on the ranch drenching himself with the coldest water the earth possessed ! Some stream they now fled past made her remember the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the yard before the timber house with the California clouds reflected in it crimped tight as a judge 's wig . " Nicol , " she said . She took his hand back again between her own . " Let 's go away and be ourselves again , " she said . " It would really be wonderful , you know , to have a baby , and then we could go away . We are really going to have a wonderful life , you know . " " I get no satisfaction out of words , " said Nicolas . He managed to stifle a yawn . " As long as you want a baby so badly , Bridget , " he said , " why do n't you have it with somebody else ? " After he had said this in his black weary voice of gloom , his spirits seemed to revive . " Well , why do n't you , Bridget ? " he said . His speech had turned as airy as thistledown and was blowing lightly back and forth between them . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . That does n't mean I have to have a child . There are lots of people , " he said , " who have no disease in their bones . What a solution ! " he said . He had begun to laugh aloud . " Such a simple way out of it all , " he said . " Why didn'tP111we ever think of it before ? " He sat beside her with his lip drawn back from his teeth , smiling , his bright eyes pursuing the telegraph poles and tree trunks that raced steadily past . Here he was peeled and fresh again in the lovely summer morning , with a veil lifted fromis features and his eyes washed clear and young . At exactlye same moment they perceived the immense nest of mistlethatwas hanging in the oak . " Oh , look ! " cried Bridget . " Oh , look ! " said Nicolas . " What a huge one ! " said Bridget . " What do you think of that as an idea ? " said Nicolas . The ht of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far from any holiday or any feeling of Noel , d made him put his arm around her and draw her close . " I uld n't bear having an ill child , you know , " he said . He wanted the money very badly indeed , thought Bridget ; hated his people and he wanted to go away , but still she cw this idea of his was just a pretence of his own bitter wit . It was never possible that the devotion of the good family hadbrought him to this . " You 're not a bit funny , " she said . " I 'm not trying to be funny , " said Nicolas . He drew himself away and sat hunched and wounded in his corner of the car . He felt he had been rebuked . He sat all hunched in the corner against the window , staring away . And suddenly Dinan Was flung out of the curve of the valley , more beautiful than any living town could be . The houses of it were clinging to the deep hillside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , edging down in the heat to the cool trough of water . Nicolas looked at it all as if he had seen it too many times before . " You do n't seem to realize the position we are in , " he said angrily to her . " You take things so much for granted . You 'd sit on her all the rest of your life living off my family , taking a few sous from Charlotte who gives them out of charity . I think I 'll kill myself , " he said , " and leave you here where you 're so happy with them all . " Bridget thought that if she did not speak that perhaps his anger would spend itself . But she felt that she would hit his sour face if he said those words again . The family , she thought , PII2who had been motivated by the one thought of bringing them closer to each other as husband and wife had only succeeded in setting them apart . " You would n't so much as lift your finger to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's mostly your fault too that we 're here . It was your idea that we come to France . I know I could n't have gone on with my work where I was , but we did n't have to come here , did we ? We did n't have to come back and get caught with the family , did we ? That was your idea . Well , now it 's up to you to get us away . " He sat tossing his shoulders , hunched up as he was in the corner of the car . They were passing by the clear canal and along it the creamiest of silken oxen were dragging the loaded barges . Charlotte 's car soared up the hill into the market place and deposited them among the great stacks of square white wheat . " Well , here we are , " said Nicolas . Down they went into the crowded place with the high hoarse voices of the merchants calling out all around them across the stalls of food and cloth . At one place they ate some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further on with hot galettes dripping with new sweet butter . All through the meal Nicolas stood in silence beside her , leaning on his cane . When Bridget wiped the running butter from his chin , he looked immovably off into the impersonal distance of the market place . He had no use for her . She had involved him in a nasty mess , and now she must get him out . And not one smile to be cracked in the doing of it . How awful not to feel this , thought Bridget . How terrible not to feel the desperation and gloom of their situation in life . At the sight of the bolts and bolts of materials to be bought , her heart was ready to wing from her bosom . She flung her arms around Nicolas ' neck . " Darling , darling , I love you , " she said . " I am so happy to be alive with you that I could die with joy ! I am so happy we are together in spite of , in spite of everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what kind of feelings you have , " said Nicolas . He had turned away from her , but something like a smile had come into his eyes . They walked together down through the cattle square ,  | avoiding the fresh warm islands of dung . One young calf had broken loose and went frisking down before them , waving the remnant of his tether rope as he gambolled down to the portico of the church and went frisking back again to the corral . They stopped to watch him for a moment , the palpitating pink heart of his nose and the crisp hair which freedom had startled down his spine . The clear thick eye which seemed pierced with light turned upon them as he rocked like a wooden rocking horseown to the church piazza , waving his ragged end of rope , and , eyeing them wildly , frisked back to the edge of the corral . And then they fairly ran into the Englishman who was teaching French to students in the University of Tibet . " Fancy , " said he . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , that will give you an excuse then , " said Nicolas , " for coming back to see us . " The little man threw up his hands in despair . " Oh , it 's miles too far ! " he said . " Of course it 's quite too farfor me to go with all the other trips I have to do . I 'm taking aparty to Mont-Saint-Michel tomorrow . Fancy ! " he said . " You people are practically there , if you know what I mean , but for me it 's quite a journey , you know . " He nodded brightly at them as he spoke , turning his head this way and that to look at all that was going on round about him . For the first time Bridget perceived something rugged and windbeaten in him , something of the weather in the burned flesh beneath his ears . " I might row over one day and have a look around , " said Nicolas . Bridget wondered why Nicolas was so polite to this little man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed the Englishman . " It would n't be a bit of trouble to you , would it ? " When he had given them his address and gone on , they proceeded to the church . Nicolas ' legs were beginning to get weary under him and he sat down on one of the yellow wood prayer chairs which were crowded in the small damp nave . In the baptismal vat Bridget found a school of fish in bronze clinging to the depths of slime which had collected on the aides . With Charlotte 's sous she bought three long candles which she pierced upon the iron pins in the Virgin 's chapel : 1 one lighted for Nicolas ' health , one for a good job for him , andP 114one that he might love her all his life . " If I do n't find the penknife , " said Nicolas , " I 'm going to buy him one and write him a letter asking if he can do something about getting me a job sitting down in the Universityof Tibet . " He had crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place . " It 's too bad you were n't born a Catholic , " he said . And then some feeling of the devil rose in him and he said : " I think the Englishman rather liked you . What would you think of him as a pater familial ? " he said . He stood grinning at her below the Virgin 's sweet mild face . A new thing flashed through Bridget ; an instant of anger , of rancour and despise . She snatched the third candle out of the high burning bouquet and spat upon its flame . With hard quivering hands she broke it into two pieces and flung it down at Nicolas ' feet . " There you are , " she said . " There you are . " She bit her lip with her teeth . She would not cry , she thought fiercely , she would not cry . She looked up at the mild wooden statue of the Virgin , wishing that this woman of wide repute would come to life and damn Nicolas adequately for his venomous ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " she said . She looked into his black motionless eyes . " I hate you , " she said . " I am going away . " She turned from him quickly and fled out the door . Up the market place she went and through the strange bright world . And where could she ever flee to , she thought , except into the very bosom of the family ? Up to the booths of dress materials she made her way , and picked out yards and yards of bitter black . Black would her dress be , she thought ; black for her broken heart and for her love that had perished . Black , and black . All her life would be a mourning for her love for Nicolas which had died . Long tight sleeves to her wrists and buttons up to the chin . " You 'll be a gay figger , " she thought . " You 'll be a joy to the young . "   A T THREE O'CLOCK that afternoon Luc was going away . His vacation had finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end had come . At three o'clock that afternoon the year would breathe its last full breath of wonder and of wealth , and then interminable days of misery faced Annick and Julie and Marthe . Already the sorrow of it had bleached Marthe 's face and it was evident that she had cried all night . She had written to Pierre urging that he speak of Julie 's shortcomings , and on the previous day his response had come . She brought it to Bridget 's bedroom and read her every word that Pierre had penned in answer . " I in no way consider it my duty to inform Luc of such matters as you suggest . Even though I am a doctor and Luc 's associate , I consider that it would be entirely outside my province . . . On the contrary , it seems to me the height of wisdom on Luc 's part to wait until he has fully made up his mind which of you girls means more than a sister to him .. . She looked with queer old faded eyes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be done , " she whispered across the bed to Bridget . Her under lip hung almost lifelesslyp116down . How beautiful is love , thought Bridget cruelly . She imagined an entire regiment of naked Cupids piercing Marthe 's heart with love . The divine passion had penetrated her soul and turned her eyes into dripping wells of rank despair . " There is one thing remaining to be done before he leaves , Bridget . " Ah , Marthe would surely have him , she would get him finally , thought Bridget . The sight of him escaping her now was almost more than Marthe could bear . She must have him somehow , in some way promised and betrothed to her before he went away . How else could she bear the months ahead if there were no hope in sight at the end of them ? These years of terror must ultimately end , with Annick retired to her convent , Julie immersed in her sturdier occupations , and she herself to the altar on Luc 's arm . All the smug arrogance of Madame Roland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady of letters who brooded full length in Marthe 's bedroom , all swelled and persisted in the eyes washed pale by tears . " I know I am the only one who could make you happy , " Madame Roland had written . The record of that arduous engagement she had submitted to with Roland had stirred hopes in Marthe and lent nobility to her lot . " She lost Roland ten times before she finally married him , " said Marthe . " Ten times . Bridget , there is still one little thing that you and Nicolas can do . " She pressed her shoulder against her quivering chin . " You know we each of us have the same dowry , " she said . Dot , was the word she used . " Dot , " she said . " For Annick and Julie and me it is exactly the same . Now , you yourself can see how difficult this makes it for Luc to decide . It is very unfair to put Luc in this position , after all . How can anyone expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was a hot aggression , an insult to their flesh , but in this room they lay at peace in a charmed shadow of tranquillity . Marthe had drawn herself up against the footboardof the bed and from there she surveyed Bridget , so like the great lady of a house , holding her head high with ceremoniousbut nervous smile playing about her mouth . Surely she was visualizing herself now as the married lady in her salon , as Mrs. Luc speaking intelligently with strange callers and wittilyp117referring to this or that . " Ever since I was a mere child , " Marthe was saying , " I have lived in a world of my own in the books I read . In that realm there are greater loves and more beautiful relationships , you know . Never in real life have I found a single person who would do a really great and magnificent thing for anybody else . " In the shaded room the evidences of her grief were less visible and her eyes less piercing under her full lids . " This is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Of course I know that you and Nicolas intend to have a little baby . You would not wish to wound Papa , and it would be so nice for you to be able to go away . Of course we all know that you intend to have a little baby . Maman was talking about it last night and she said : It is such a joy to me that Bridget is so anxious to please us all . ' " Her voice had begun to shake a little in her throat . " Now this is what I wanted to ask you , Bridget , " she said . She had abandoned the role of proud mistress of the house . She had slipped off the bed and down upon her knees by Bridget 's side . With her bare arms she clasped Bridget 's waist . " I want to ask you to lend me a little money , " she said . So tightly she held her that Bridget could scarcely draw a breath . Not very much , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money Papa has promised you for your baby . Ten thousand francs would be nothing at all . And then it would no longer be a problem for Luc to make up his mind . Ten thousand francs added to my dot , Bridget , would make it so much more than Annick 's and Julie 's that it would be an easy matter for Luc to make up his mind . You see that , do n't you , Bridget ? " she said . She held Bridget tighter and tighter in her arms . " You see that , do n't you ? " she said . " Nicolas does n't want to have a baby , " said Bridget . She tried to get up but Marthe drew her firmly down upon the bed again . " Do n't talk like that , " she whispered . " No , do n't talk like that . You know that Nicolas will do whatever you say . " " But he does n't want that , " said Bridget . " There 's no use in talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Marthe . " Yes , there 's use . Nicolas ca n't refuse his own sister . He ca n't refuse me that little thing ,  |p118Bridget  . It means my whole life , Bridget , you understand . You ca n't just throw a person 's life away without a thought like that . You 've got to think of other people in your life , Bridget . That 's what the Catholic religion teaches us . That 's why people who are n't Catholics have n't the same feeling about things . It 's part of the religion to think of other people , " she said . " Nicolas does n't want to have a baby , " said Bridget . She could think of nothing else to say . She put her hands upon Marthe 's naked arms and tried to wrest them away . " Oh , it 's so hot , " she said . " Shall we get out in the air ? " But Marthe pursued Bridget across the room . " Listen , Bridget , you 've got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're married you ca n't forget about everybody else . Before you came I thought you were going to be closer to me than all my sisters . I wrote letters to you such as I have never written to anybody else . You ca n't just put me aside this way , simply because you have a husband . " Suddenly she collapsed against Bridget 's unyielding side . " You 've got to do something , Bridget , " she whispered . " You must talk to Luc , " she said . " You are a married woman and maybe he will tell you what his feelings are . You must promise me that you wo n't let him go away like this . " After Bridget had promised they got dressed together and went down into the garden where Maman and Papa and Nicolas and Jean were playing bridge . All about them were seated the other members of the family , the girls and Charlotte with their needlework , and Luc idly smoking a cigarette . When Bridget saw him there with his head back blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all she had to say to him sprang to her lips . But there it faltered , while her disturbed heart spoke clearly out : " Oh , fly , escape ! " her heart cried out to him . " Oh , save yourself from all they would condemn you to ! If you alone amongst us all would remain faithful to your years and not to sentiment , some glory might survive ! " Beside her walked Marthe , clutching her indignant hand that had essayed escape into the folds of her dress . " Remember you have promised , " whispered Marthe in her ear . But how , but where , thought Bridget , and what am I to say ? Nicolas was smartly snapping his tricks into line.  | " Do you remember the only bonne we ever loved , Charlotte ? " he was saying . " We used to roll our hoops out to . Chateaubriand 's tomb with her at Saint-Malo . Jean , your spade . " Jean had revoked again and they must stop and sort over the tricks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the cards . " She died in childbirth , " said Papa , stifling a yawn behind his hand . Maman 's shoulders disposed of Papa 's words . She cried out sharply : " Auguste ! Fair attention a ton jeu ! " Her eyes paused upon Bridget to ascertain if she had understood , and passed on to Charlotte 's soft contented face . " Your father , " she said , " is a little beast . " Nicolas played his card . " They tell me she protested too loudly against the course of nature and her husband rushed in and split her skull with an ax , " said Nicolas quietly . " Faugh ! " exclaimed Papa , flinging down his cards . He looked in fury into Nicolas ' face . With dignity he forsook his chair , and with his hands twitching under the tail of his coat , he turned and went down the drive . Maman laid a restraining hand upon Nicolas ' arm . " The husband was mad , " she reproved him . " Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite mad . " She looked mildly at Bridget as though her own refusal to be disturbed should somehow diminish the importance of Nicolas ' words . " Nicolas does not think , " she said . " Or thinks so much , " said Nicolas blindly over his cards , " that his mind is twisted and fixed in agony in his head . . . Charlotte , glad to abandon her needlework , rose to follow after and console Papa for this outrage to his feelings . It was a great grief to Maman as well as to Charlotte and Annick that neither of Papa 's sons could get on with him at all . Julie took the place her father had left vacant at the card table and picked up his hand . Nicolas turned to look over his lean shoulder and smile grimly at his wife . " I 've been looking at Luc , " he said in English . " What dop120you think of Luc as a father of the race ? " " I 'm sure you 're talking about me , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , Nicolas ? " " I was saying that you and Bridget never got well enough acquainted , " said Nicolas . " And here y9u are going away this afternoon . " But Luc was not deceived and he closed his eyes half way , as if against the sun , and set his stubborn jaw . " Next time I come she 'll know more French , " he said , " and we 'll be able to understand each other better . " " It might be faster if she gave you a few lessons in English , " said Nicolas . He was being very funny and everybodylaughed . Bridget herself laughed . She knew that she was very slow and stupid about learning French . Only Luc sat stiffly and stubbornly in their midst without a glimmer of humour in his eye . But in Marthe 's laughter was a quivering note that was more a sharp whimper of despair . Not once did her desperate eyes abandon Bridget 's face . It was almost the hour for Luc to be driving off to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Bridget shyly . She stood up and stretched out her hand to Luc . " Come with me around the pond as I do with the children , " she said . " You must begin by learning to say good-bye . ' " " Good-bye , " said Luc in English . He waved his hand gaily to the family as he walked away . " Good-bye , " he called out again to them as he and Bridget went out the little gate on to the river road and disappeared behind the wall of Charlotte 's house . It was low tide and the pond was quite shallow as they made their way around the wall . Out beyond the great wide reaches of mud ran the thread of the river . At the door of the pond the shrimps were leaping like crystal grasshoppers out of the water and back into it again , and Luc squatted down on his handsome legs and attempted to scoop some odd ones up in his hand . Never had the air been so soft , never the hills so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea would be returning with the gulls screaming in after it and the sharp prow of the tide driving a furrow through the River Rance , but for the moment they were moving through a wide landscape of peace . " I think we should begin the lesson , " said Luc as he walkedp121a step or two ahead of her . " There are a great many words in English that I want to learn to say . " But this kind of talk was leading them to nothing at all and in her heart Bridget was thinking : " Now I must speak of Marthe to him . Now , now at this moment I must speak . " But the only words that would come to her mind were : " Luc , Luc , you must save yourself , you must run away . " She wanted to be just to him , and above all just to Marthe who had put her confidence in her , and she knew she must speak out and tell him that Marthe loved him with all her soul . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her his wife . But when she tried to find words for these thoughts she found herself thinking : " Luc , Luc , do not relinquish the miracles of your self to these women . Do not give them one moment of your life , one drop of your rich blood . " But Luc was carrying the conversation on , turning to look at her and talking to her in his youngest and most innocent way . " It would be the greatest help to me in my work , if I could speak your language , " he said . " And there are other things , besides , there are other things I would like to say  --  I mean , to you . " It was this remark which shaped the resolution of Bridget 's intent , for ever since Luc had intimated to her by glance and speech that there might be something more between them than there was , she had determined that there should be nothing at all . If it were chaff , or if there were some kind of gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Nicolas ' wife she knew she had no right to know . And now there were so few minutes left to them before they would have to turn and make their way back again around the wall . " Luc , " she said , " I have come out with you to talk about Marthe . " " And I came out to talk to you about English , " he said . Even through his banter she could see his stubborn jaw grow firm . " I have talked about Marthe all my life , " he said . " And I 've never been able to talk for a minute to anybody about you . " He stooped down and then in a moment he came back to where she was making her way along . He was carrying ap122frenzied little black lizard to show her in the palm of his hand . Beneath the frantic lizard were all the bold lines of his hand marked out : the heart line strong and unbroken , the head line a little short and thick , and the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Put him on your dress , " he said , " and watch him change his colour . Is n't he funny ? " he said . " Amusant . " He looked with such eager interest at the little black animal , now with a shade of blue on his belly , scrambling across her skirt . " Luc , " said Bridget suddenly out of her dry throat . His head was so close that she could have touched his brilliant hair with her fingers . " Luc , I 'm sure that Marthe would make you very happy . " She spoke with great intensity but in shyness she turned her eyes away to the curve from which the sea would presently emerge . Her blood was kindling with the shame of thus interfering in other people 's lives . " I am sure you would be very happy with Marthe , " she said . But even as she spoke she knew that she had destroyed any beauty which remained in the day , and she was angry that she had lacked the courage to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw clearly how dull and filthy was the water of the pond beside them , how thick and odorous the long slippery banks of mud . Even the castle on the island seemed more artificial than it had at any other time . " Oh , Luc , " were the words she could not utter , " what are you doing in this barren country with people who would wrench children from you ? Oh , flee from them while you are still able to combat them ! Oh , Luc , do not submit through reason or despair ! " " Is it really true that you want me to marry Marthe ? " Luc was saying . He was standing looking at her under the big hat which fell around her eyes . Every separate piece of her face he looked at very carefully , at the eyebrows , at the cheeks , and at the freckles across her nose . He was very close to her and his underlip was trembling like a child 's . " Is this the lesson you came out to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you want me to marry somebody else ? " " I think if you want to marry now , I think you should marry Marthe , " said Bridget deliberately . She kept her eyesp123turned far away on the safe distance of the sea . " I think she loves you the best , " she said . " I think she loves you more terribly than the others do . " Terriblement . Terriblement . Yes , terriblement was the word . " But do you want me to marry anybody ? " persisted Luc . " Do you really want me to marry anybody else at all ? " " I ca n't see what difference that would make , " said Bridget . " It makes all the difference , " said Luc . Because she had turned as if to walk back towards Charlotte 's house he had to pursue her for a few steps along the rugged wall . " Listen to me , Bridget , " he said . " It makes all the difference , because you can do whatever you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want with me , Bridget , " he said . He had caught up with her and the sight of his clean tan feet suddenly keeping pace with hers was almost more than she could bear . To escape with him into a new life , she thought , with his capable , stubborn jaw and his bright beauty holding the world at bay , would be a thorough way of abandoning Nicolas to his disease and his despair . At the thought of this she turned upon Luc . " You 've had enough years in which to make up your mind , " she said to him , " and now you ca n't make it up this way by putting it on to somebody else . " " If it had n't been for you , " said Luc gravely , " I think I would have proposed to one of the girls this year . " They walked along for a little while side by side and then Luc said with a certain delight as if he had finally caught her in a trap : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what it is you want me to do . " She had opened her mouth to speak again , but Luc interrupted her . " No , no , not now , " he said . " Because I want you to think about it . I want you to think about the thing that is really true , I mean , that you can do whatever it is you want with me , and I 'll come back again and then maybe you 'll be able to tell me what it is you want me to do . " A regiment of crabs was hastening along ahead of them , rattling over the stones of the wall with their queer shifty gait . Into the water of the pond they sidled , one by one , and at the sight of them Luc threw back his head and laughed.  | " Ha , ha , ha ! " echoed Luc 's laughter over the stretch of water . It struck the wall of Charlotte 's house and rippled back to them . " Ha , ha , ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no doubt in anybody 's mind that Luc had gone . All the afternoon it had seemed that he must surely reappear around the drive , or come suddenly through the doorway , in spite of the fact that they had all seen him step into the train . That Luc was gone there now could be no doubt . All the afternoon the filly had waited and stamped her small impatient feet in vain . And when darkness began to fall and it became evident that Luc would not appear , she set up the wildest neighing in her dreary stall . Peal after peal of bell-like neighs invoked the unresponding air , and suddenly she began kicking with mad intent , as if the whole stable must collapse if Luc did not sing out " Who-oo yet ! " and fling the easy saddle over her . Surely the minds of the three girls were filled , as Bridget 's was , with thoughts of Luc alighting from the train at Rennes , crossing important busy streets , and taking up the threads of his arrested life again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the garden in the evening was in harmonious complaint . For all they knew they would not set eye on him again till Christmas , and perhaps not then , for usually they hadp126to bide their time until summer came around . Nor could they expect letters from him for three days at least , for being dutiful young women they had been brought up to know that a man 's work in life comes before all else and that he would have a great deal to do . Hence the girls wandered as far afield as possible , avoided the postman , made calls upon the poor . And Nicolas , as if infected by some of the contagion of the uneasy atmosphere , announced that he was going to try to find the penknife which the little Englishman had left behind . Against the advice of Maman and Annick and Jean , and in spite of Papa 's predictions of disaster , Nicolas and Bridget packed up their lunch one morning , climbed into the Boris and set out for Castle Island . They had their fishing-rods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there between the mainland and the island was really a very harmless looking sea . Nicolas had no trouble at all in rowing the boat across and beaching it . What a relief , thought Bridget , to be doing these active things with Nicolas instead of being at home with him and his contempt ! No gentle words had passed between them since the day they had ridden off to Dinan in Charlotte 's car , but here with the sea and the strong bright air between them there was no need for speech . They laid their fishing tackle and their lunch away in the rocks near the foot of the great rocky cliff , and they started up the climb . Nicolas used his cane and progressed slowly , saying nothing , but in his whole demeanour scorning any aid . Bridget climbed ahead of him , but slowly too , turning back to look at the world below them at every step of the climb . All along the edge of the beach were little ruffles of sand packed hard in the coast as if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks that still had water about them were black with seaweed , and mussels hung like bunches of dark rich grapes upon the rocky boughs . The path they walked was oozing with fresh damp things , steaming under the mild sun with the pungent odours of earth and mosses . Every rare blade of grass along the side was coloured a strong bright green and pointed sharply like a turtle 's tongue . As they climbed higher and higher out of the salty air some small unknown flowers began to blossom.  |p127Among  these strangers were the little orange star-like ones which everyone knew meant death to rabbits ; and blue ones quite faded out before they had fully opened , bleached there for lack of sun or too much of it on the moist side of the hill . Whatever this higher earth-life had as complement , it had no link with the rough , ragged shoreline and the sea below . The wan blue flowers here were strangers to the ebony moules . It had no part in all the marine life that flourished in brine below it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the bushes of this underbrush were leaves as tender and sticky as any springtime foliage , for into the depths of it there came hardly any sun at all . In the branches were birds and their nests , and hence the mainland sounds of unadventurous forest birds , and even the usual sulphur caterpillars humping their silky green hides along the edge of the wood . How far from the sea-gulls and their appetites ! but not so far , for on certain ledges of the cliff was the spotless snow of the sea-birds ' droppings piled up in shallow drifts and hanging here and there in icicles of lime . Here and there was this record of the sea-birds ' contempt for the immovable land . All the light airy green contained in ferns and in the grasses led on to darker richer shades . First were the oaks , rooted as only oak roots could be , reaching out to grapple with the air and drawing sustenance as strong from it as they could from any other soil . And beyond them stood the forest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shakingtheir lean heads in dignity and reproof at the spirited wind . Far , far below them all was the same wind on the water patiently braiding and unbraiding the tangled skeins of the shore . Not a word did Nicolas and Bridget speak as they climbed up the precipitous side of the land . Once at the top they set about looking for the penknife that the Englishman from the University of Tibet had left behind . They walked through the deep pine needles with their eyes searching the ground , walkingin circles under the tall bony trees . From time to time Nicolas stopped to rake the needles this way or that with his cane . It was Nicolas who found the penknife . " Here 's the penknife , " he said with a certain satisfaction in his voice . " Here it is. "  |p128He  slipped it into his pocket and then he lit a cigarette . They went down the side of the cliff again in silence . In complete silence they ate their sandwiches upon the rocks , and after Nicolas had wiped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rolled up the cuffs of his flannel trousers and set off with his cane and his fishing-rod for the edge of the sea . Bridget threaded her own fishing-rod and started off farther down the beach . From then on she saw him only at moments when she returned to where he was perched on his rock to select fresh bait from his tin can . He sat there fishing in silence , with his profile set against the water , and not an eyelash flickering in his set dark face . Finally on one occasion he spoke to her . " I 've caught three big ones , " he said . " I have n't caught a single one yet , " said Bridget . She sat off by herself , fishing alone . After an hour or so she saw Nicolas sliding down from his rock and with his cane he came across the packed damp sand to her . " If we 're going to do any fishing after moules , " he said , " we 'd better do it now . It wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his fishing tackle away and the little bucket in which swam his three handsome fish . He set them all back safely against the cliff out of reach of the tide , and armed with a shrimp net and a basket for mussels he set off into the sea . Deeper and deeper he waded into the bright shallow sea , striking out for the rocks that horned out of it with their polished growth of moules . Bridget rolled up her skirt about her hips and started wading after him . He had come to the first rocks and was beginning to twist the sharp mussels from their sides . When Bridget had caught up with him she began to pull at the mussels too . They grew in such strong bold vines , mingled with seaweed , up and down the rocks ; and save their lives they would so that picking them off was no easy thing . They clung like demons to the rocks and to each other . They snapped closed their brittle jaws . They knew they did not want to go ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridget 's fingers and set them to bleeding , while Nicolas picked silently and competently on around the laden vines . His basket wasp129filling rapidly up with the juicy black fruit of them and he was growing bolder and bolder and making wider and wider detours through the sea and over the little stranded beaches of sand . The whole receding tide , as far as the opening far down at the curve , was striped and broken with long slim beaches of sand that only served to encourage one to go farther and farther away from shore . Like a deadly wash was Nicolas voyaging from rock to rock storing the honey away , the sweet warm honey of the yellow-fleshed mottles . " Nicolas , " called Bridget after him . Her fingers were so torn that she had lost interest in plucking off the mussels . " Maybe the tide will be coming up soon , " she said in warning to him . But he paid no attention to her , although he must have heard her voice across the little expanse of sand and sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no word or thought of hers could ever touch him again . The thing is , thought Bridget as she sat upon the rock holding her knees and watching him plod here and there with his cane , that I have brought him back to France and the heart of his family and now it is up to me to get him out . Everything that had happened to him had been a wound and an insult to him , she thought . Everything had made him despair . She saw so clearly the wounds in his spirit from which he would never recover , the terrible death wounds of his father 's offer to him and of Jean 's refusal of a loan . The unforgivable insult that they had let him be born at all . Down at the mouth was the sea beginning to run like a white thread towards them , and Nicolas in his white clothes was standing shading his eyes and regarding it in the sun . He stood out clear and bright-looking against the qualities of sea and sky and sand . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make his way back to her over the sand . Down from her rock slid Bridget and fled through the water to meet him , splashing the sea all about her as she leapt and cavorted down . " Hurry back , hurry back , Nicol ! " she cried out to him . " Hurry back before the tide ! " But Nicolas had almost imperceptibly changed his course , and although he was still coming inland his steps were takingp130him more and more to the cliff side of the island . He seemed to be going directly and willfully into the shallow water at the sheer side of the cliff , and from that side there could not be any escape at all . " But there 's no need for this , " said Bridget under her breath . " There 's no need for this , Nicol , " she said . She saw so clearly what it was he wanted : to evade them all completely , to get away from them all into death . When she saw that this was the truth she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sea and the thin islands of sand . To the left of them was the tide approaching and at the sight of it so near she began to be afraid for Nicolas and the weakness of his legs . " Come back , come back ! " she shouted , but he pretended that he had not heard her at all . Down through the sea she splashed to him . If she held his hand , she thought , surely he could run faster with her than quite alone . Surely no tide could have them if they clasped hands and fled from it side by side . " Nicolas , Nicolas , Nicolas , " she cried to him . " Eh ? " he said , lifting his head to her as if in irritation . " What is it you want ? " " Come back , come back , " she shouted , " the tide is coming in ! " " Well , what about it ? " said Nicolas . She was coming close to him now . " Give me your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must come back . " " Why should I come back ? " said Nicolas . He stood looking at her in his dark gloomy way . " What reason is there for me to go back ? " She had grabbed his hand and his cane firmly in her hands and was trying to pull him back through the water . " You do n't want to be killed , Nicol ! " she cried . " Why not ? " said Nicolas drearily . " Why should n't I want to be killed ? " " Because I ca n't live without you , " said Bridget . At this he relented a little and took a step or two forward . " It is n't true , " he said . Bridget was tearing wildly at his hands . " Yes , it is true , it is true ! " she cried . " Nicol , Nicol , youp 131make it so hard ! " Whether for fear at the actual sight of the water coming along , or whether because of her words to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a moment they were running at top speed together across the beach . Through the coast of rocks they splashed and stumbled , and on to the final beach of Castle Island , with the waves of the sea blowing and gallivanting a pace behind . Only when Bridget had hauled him partly up the path of the ascent did she turn and look at him . With her two hands she pushed him down upon a rock . She stood before him looking at his exhausted panting face and at the faint smile which was lingering about his eyes . " Why did n't you let me be killed , Bridget ? " he said . But the usual despair had left his voice . " You would have been much better off . "  | FORWARD MOVED Charlotte 's sweet round nose and chin . On and on she sailed against the hedge and the wheatfieldswhich flowed by the limousine window . Beside her sat Nicolas , talking about America . Beside her and beyond her he sat with his long nervous hand hanging from the armrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed Charlotte with her pale grave mouth . " Yes , tell me , Nicol . The colours in the rocks there ! The red earth ! Tell me , Nicol ! " Ahead was the wall and the great gate and the worn stones of the houses gathering there in the windshield . Bridget watched the roofs of Saint-Mato clustering about the chauffeur 's white linen cap . " Oh , it sounds beautiful , really it sounds beautiful ! " said Charlotte . She lifted her hand and made the sign of the Cross upon her brow and bosom as they passed the graveyard of St. Servan . She listened to him but it was evident that her thoughts were upon other things . Her hands jerked over the little girl 's smooth hair . She straightened the white square of the little boy 's collar . Only when they had all descended from the car and settledP133upon the sand in the shadow of the town wall , did she give her real attention to Bridget and Nicolas . Her shy furtive smiles took courage . She leaned forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches of sand . " Nicolas , my darling , " she said . Her face was low and shy and quivering over the trembling fingerfalls of sand . Nicolas was always more at rest with Charlotte , always easier in his heart when his older sister was there . And today he had a certain sense of achievement as if it had not slipped idly past like every other day . For the chauffeur had been sent off to despatch the penknife and the letter Nicolas had written to the professor at the University of Tibet . With it had gone Nicolas ' college certificate and an outline of all the work he had ever done . " Nicolas , my darling , " said Charlotte , so occupied with her little puddles of sand . " I have been going over Jean 's business a ( lairs and I find there is a place open to you in North Africa if you will have it . I want to know how you would feel about taking it , " she said , speaking with great haste to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will not get well , " she said . Her voice quivered over her deep handfuls of sand . " I know so well that you are going to be strong again soon , " she said . " But in the mean time I ca n't bear the strain to be so terrific for you . In this place on the estancia it does n't matter if you can walk a great deal or not . Whether you could get out a lot or not , it would n't matter . It is work you could supervise , " she said . Nicolas sat quite still looking at the water . " You mean on one of Jean 's estancias ? " he said . Charlotte 's fingers released the burning threads of sand . " Yes , yes , but it is no form of charity , Nicol , " said Charlotte . " I thought of you because it is your sort of work . It would be a future for you , Nicol , " she said . " I know , I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was nothing to do to prevent them from seeing what had become of all his vanity and all his pride . " Oh  --  oo ! " exclaimed Monique . " Tonton Nicolas is crying ! " Charlotte bit her lip and the tears fled from her eyes . " Ah , do n't , do n't , Nicol , " she said . She sat speaking softly to him over her trembling hands . " It is the natural thing , myP134Nicol . It is so natural that we should offer it to you and that you should go . " Her voice was lost in the soft storm of her tears . She reached out to clasp Nicolas ' and Bridget 's hand in her agitated fingers . " I am so glad , " she said smiling at them through her clear unhidden tears . " I am so glad . " Her small teeth shone in her pale quivering mouth . " I am so glad it is so , " she said . " Charlotte , " Nicolas was trying to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The bleat of the children 's voices as they played was following up the wind , and the big brilliant sea gathered softly under Charlotte 's chin . " I shall speak of it soon to Jean , " she said firmly , blowing her small nose . " I may have a little trouble making him understand , " she said . " But it 's going to be all right . Everythingthat I suggest to him at first , it takes him a day or two to understand . " Monique crouched back on her heels , watching them all . And suddenly Charlotte began to speak again to them . " There is something else too I want to tell you , " she said , watching Bridget shyly . " There is something else . . . " she said . She sat looking shyly at Bridget . " Did you know . . . " she said to her . " Did Maman tell you yet ? " Bridget looked into Charlotte 's eyes and shook her head . Charlotte 's lids lifted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her bosom approached the sun-stained crescent which lay about her throat . Bridget suddenly and distinctly knew . " I 'm going to give you another little nephew or  --  niece , " she said . She had turned a rosy red and she was laughing . " Oh , what a wretched business ! " said Nicolas in real distress . " Lolotte , you 're only thirty-two , and five of them already ! Is n't it time you decided whether your responsibility is to the living or to the unconceived ? " It was all a sort of joke to Charlotte . She sat in the sand shaking her head and laughing . " One more wo n't matter , " she said . " It 's my life , is n't it ? " Upon the homeward ride Nicolas shyly took Bridget'sP135hand and drew it through his arm . " How will you like it ? How will you like being in North Africa ? " he said . His voice was soft and whispering close in her ear and neck , hidden from Charlotte and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great humility to her , shy and apologetic , scarcely daring to look into her face . " It will be too wonderful , " she said . He held her fingers tightly in his palm . He sat close to her , holding her hand as though there was so much he wished to say to her , but not a word of it could he force from his lips . " I have been terribly worried , Bridget , " he said . Suddenly he lifted her hand against his cheek . " I have been crazy with worry about what we should ever do , " he said into her palm . " Oh , sweet children ! " said Charlotte to them , teasing them and laughing as they sat holding hands in the deep cushions of the car . " Now I see you happy ! " she said . " But now that things are arranged , I ca n't ever let you go . I shall die without my Bridget and my Nicol , " she said . Bridget had not yet really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicolas ' words and Charlotte 's talking of this to her , it became an actual thing . To go . To go away . To go away to another country . To go so far away . " To go so far away from what ? " she asked herself . All the way home in the car , up the white road and down the valleys , soaring , screaming out at turns , all the way home she sorted the litter , the bits of ribbon , the remnants of disorder in her mind . This feeling of relinquishment in her was foul as a rat-trap and stiff and relentless there like a dried bouquet . This is what becomes of idleness , she thought in anger . She wanted the whole summer back again to make it all anew . Why am I having these bunches of old lavender , these dried knots of garlic infecting the thoughts that I have ? Why this chop suey mess of uncertainty in me ? Down the drive they swept with a splatter of gravel upon the bridge table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away from what , thought Bridget as she looked through the window at the faces of Maman and Papa and Jean and the three girls . To go so far away from what , she thought , as she stepped out of the car . But before she had time to take a step towards them , the girls had rushed up to her waving their elation in their exultant hands.  | " Luc , Luc , Luc ! " they cried as they surrounded her . Each one of them had a letter from Luc and before Bridget could have her tea even she must sit down with them and listen to every word that Luc had to say . " Luc , " they said to her , as if it were a caress ; Luc , as if the mere dwelling upon it could prolong it into syllables of sound . Luc , thought Bridget as she sat listening to them reading out his polite small words . Luc , Luc , Luc . To Marthe his letter was a sign to walk slowly out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road that had been built by peasants to go from field to market , and from farm to farm , and which did not linger by the side of the Rance . Castle Island was a melting vision between the tree stems , for Charlotte had been allowed to plant them this way to conceal the dock 's stone walls . Luc in Rennes now strong and bitter as stone , to be washed against by little ripples of love , to be caressed by cloud kisses . Marthe 's face flushed with shame at the thought of this , but now it was begun and ringing in her . She would be soft as the flowering crest of the river 's salted wave , soft as the evening and the dry floury sand for all that was doctor , shell , competence in him must be breaking in him like a heart for gentleness . To Marthe it was a sign to come to Bridget 's room and look in the glass for a long time at her face , at the front and the side of it and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she grew angry wanting to escape from the face before her . Then she would almost see it herself , the witless way her lower lip hung down when she was absorbed in anything , and between her eyes that would not stay back in her head the look of a calf with his brow swollen from blows , the glazed dull look as if he were slowly understanding slowly why he was there . This way she stood looking into the glass and drawing her lips into place when she saw them and saying without compromise : " Luc . " To Julie it was a warning to her own hidden soul to crouch deeper and deeper into the flesh , to hide more perfectly than ever from any prodding eye . Her shaggy top-knot slipped lower in her neck , her ears were covered , she kept her lids down so as neither to see nor to be seen . Her hands , thrust away into great masks of gauntlets , gripped a cane which she followed out around the high-water mark along the banks ofp 137sour aging foam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow ; like the curved side of a ' cello her ruddy chest contained the deep loud chuckles of her laughter . She slapped the leather of the wind with the side of her walking-stick ; she could be seen from the windows of Charlotte 's house walking with her head lowered and her face turned to the cold company of the pond . What of it ? A letter from Luc , qu'importe ? In front of them all she had turned the colour of a ruby and torn it up into little pieces . Before them all , " chere " and " mer " and " amities " had fluttered away across the lawn . Annick alone had retired to her room , with Luc 's letter among a little sheaf of correspondence , folded away between pink blotters in a tooled leather case . She had selected a book marker to send him to mark his pages , always of such use to a student and to a doctor with reference books open at his elbow . She undid its folds of tissue paper to show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing his plague spot to a bevy of cherubim who had never seen anything like it before . " The thought of embracing a calling wholly devoted to others , such as yours , " was but a part of all she wrote to him before she retired , " draws me more every day . Men can be doctors , but for women there is but one way to serve and that is in the convent . " This so gently , so admirably written to him , and in such innocence that entertained no thought of threatening Luc with what his indecision might lead her to do.  | IN CHARLOTTE 'S SALON the card table thrust its green baize corners at the four players : at Papa , at the silverhead of Jean 's cane , at the embroidered buttons of Maman 's front , and at Nicolas ' white sweater . Charlotte herself was squatting on the floor cutting out Bridget 's perfectly black dress . Annick was seated on the sofa , quietly stitching at some strong serviceablegarment , with her grieved gaze lifting from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were scarred deeply in Annick 's heart , and although Maman 's hands continued to work unfalteringly at her knitting , the waste of time as well as the sullying of it by a few gamblers ' tricks , grieved Annick sorely and wounded her . In the creases of Papa 's mouth a little of his breakfast chocolate still lingered . His watch-chain strung across his vest caught and held captive five fine links of light . His hands moved ponderously over his cards . " Is black quite suitable for such a young woman as Bridget ? " said Papa as he played his card . " And why not ? " asked Nicolas sharply . " I love it , " said Charlotte touching the cloth . She was leaning forward upon her two round elbows . The scatteredp139pages of Femina were all about . " I 'm going to make every stitch of it myself , " said Charlotte firmly . " Ah , well , time have changed ! " said Papa . " I should never have wanted to see my young wife in a gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see black . Every young mother is told that she should never dress in black on account of her baby 's dislike of it . It is n't appropriate at all . " " And neither is chocolate a proper beverage for an old warrior , " said Nicolas with a gleam of contempt . " Imagine a wrathful old colonel sipping hot chocolate ! " " Nicolas ! " said Maman in reproof . " The thing is , " said Charlotte with a deep sweet smile at Bridget , " that maybe you wo n't have much occasion to wear it where you are going . But it will be nice to travel in . " Jean 's face looked up in mock distress . " But , Bridget , " he said , " you 're not going away ? " He sat at the card table imitating the small passing sorrow of one of his own children , with his blue eyes filled with mourning and his mouth beginning to turn down . " Ah , that 's a secret ! " said Charlotte . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't want to talk about Bridget and Nicolas going away , " said Jean . Maman was listening as she settled back to knit while Nicolas dealt out the cards . Miraculously all the needlework in the two houses had blossomed into baby things over night . " What 's this , what 's this ? " she said with her old sharp nose . " What 's this , Bridget ? Shall I have to be making bootees for another little grandson too ? " Riquet was watching his grandmother and bumping his round felt toes against her chair . " Bootees for Riquet , " he said in such a grown-up way that they all burst into laughter . " No , no , not for Riquet , " said Maman as she curved fatuously over him . " For a little , little brother or sister who will come to play with Riquet . Maman is going to buy him this winter at the Galeries Lafayette , " she said . In his small strong fist Riquet grabbed and held firmly the pleat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blood rushed to her face and her words were strangled in her mouth . She sat in her chair with her face swollen , gurgling asp14oher grandson strangled her . Charlotte leapt to her feet and slapped his rosy hands . " Vilain ! " she cried . " Vilain ! " Once she had freed Maman and the bonne had borne Riquet away , Charlotte put her handkerchief to her mouth . " Oh , I am felling so ill ! " she said . She turned away from them and hastened out of the room . " You see , it 's beginning , " said Papa darkly . " Poor girl ! She wo n't be able to eat another mouthful now for six months . How she is ever strong enough at the end of these confinementsto bear such beautiful children , " he said , " I do not know . " Nobody , indeed , knew . They all agreed it was an affliction peculiar to Charlotte . Six months ahead of her stretched out on a chaise longue , murmured Maman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little about how badly she feels , " murmured Maman so softly that one could scarcely hear her . " After all , all women suffer , all women bear suffering for months and months , " said Maman . She turned the heel of the bootee and started courageously across the sole of the foot . " But anyway , Pierre might examine her and give his opinion , " said Nicolas . " Tut , tut , " said Jean . " Let 's not have any doctors here messing about . My case ought to prove to you , Nicolas , how little they know about anything . You modern people have such a belief in scientific things . " " Charlotte has five healthy children , " stated Maman . " Jeannot and Mimi are weak as water in the legs , " said Nicolas . " Weak as water or not , " said Papa with decision , " they are the joy of existence , Nicolas . " " I do n't see what joy any one of your offspring has ever brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough ! " cried Maman . But two weeks later she wrote to Pierre and asked him to come and see his ailing sister . Pierre replied , in no great haste , that he would run out within a day or two one afternoon . He was really too busy to take a vacation that year , and it was even difficult for him to get away for the day , but he would do his best , and although nop141mention was made of Luc , the hope began to grow that Luc would come as well . In this expectancy the days took on a gayer tone , and the little group around Charlotte 's chaise longue wore fresher dresses and kept their hair in curl . Hour after hour Charlotte lay patiently wrapped in a blanket , retching into her little basin of bile . They were all settled beneath the acacia tree in front of Charlotte 's house . Papa was reading the Ouest-Eclair with his ears pricked up for any sound of steps coming down the drive . Every drop of his blood was restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand darting fierce furtive glances over the edge of it at his daughter who was feeling so badly in her chaise longue . With all his aged contempt he was ready to fling to scorn the medical knowledge that Pierre would bring . He had known him , a mere scrap of flesh wetting his diapers , and now he was coming to antagonize and patronize him . And then the sharp crackle of steps rounded the shrubbery and came down the gravel drive . Papa bridled to the hammer of Nicolas ' words . His eyes sulked below his lids , avoiding the sight of his two sons coming arm in arm around the acacia tree . Pierre was carrying his gun with him , evidently hoping to enjoy a bit of hunting upon this unavoidable visit to his people . When he had come in among them , he set his gun against the tree and embraced his parents . Then he kissed Charlotte 's pale brow . He sat talking a minute with them , the small bones of his shapely hand pressed down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come alone . The family sat in silence about him . Suddenly Maman removed her nose-glasses with her sharp impatient fingers . The sun which danced upon them flashed across Pierre 's intelligent sharp face . He looked up uneasily as if it were almost painful for him to bring himself to look upon the alien countenances of his family . His head was lifted and his nostrils withdrawn as if to escape a bad odour that assailed them . " Pierre , I wrote you about Charlotte , " said Maman . " What can you prescribe for your sister , my Pierrot ? " Her voice was brisk and casual as though she could by this feint of natural spirits and affection between them create a sympathy which did not exist . Pierre turned his head to regard his sister pleasantly , and she smiled wanly up at him from herp142chair . " I hoped for better luck this time , " said Charlotte as if in apology for putting him out . Jean smiled under his great moustaches and tapped the yellow leg of the reclining chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre , men vieux , " said Jean with a gulp of laughter . " This is the godfather of all my children , this varnished animal ! " " Of course you wo n't eat eggs ? " said Pierre pleasantly . Charlotte 's face contorted and Papa tossed back and forth in indignation in his chair . " Eggs ! " cried Papa contemptuously . Pierre shrugged his shoulders and gave his attention to a minute examination of his small , clean nails . " It is like this , Pierre , " said Maman . " She eats toast and a little pink jam . " Charlotte groped below her for the porcelain basin and retched over the low arm of the chair . " I think I had better be left alone for a minute , " she gasped . Pierre turned pleasantly away . " Nor milk ? " he said , when she was done . " All I can say is what I have said to you before , Charlotte , " he said patiently . " You should eat eggs , drink a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maman threw up her hands . " Mon petit Pierrot , " she said . " Does n't she suffer enough , does n't the poor child suffer enough ? Let her have her toasted bread and confture if it gives her any joy ! " " Let me have peace , let me have peace ! " cried Charlotte wanly . " You have wounded Papa with your impatience , Charlotte , " said Maman . Over the rims of her glasses she watched Papa 's retreating and agitated back . Annick put down her work and slipped quietly away after him . Charlotte lay moaningin her chair . " After five confinements , Pierre , " said Charlotte . As though suddenly reminded of the others , Pierre looked up and brightly about . " Ah , where are the children ? " he asked . Bridget and Nicolas went off with him to the pond where the children were skimming small bits of blue slate over the surface of the water . Beside them sat the bonne , crochetingp143with a great amber needle that gathered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absently over their heads , running his white palm up and down the gleaming muzzle of his gun , his eyes prodding sharply at the remote closed crescent of the sea . In answer to his questions Nicolas told him that the tide would be starting up soon . Between the pond and the basin emptied for the sea were meadows of sour sea-grasses and long wet naked banks of mud . It was very like the afternoon that Luc had walked around the wall with her , thought Bridget . But at the far edge of the pond in the sea-reeds there was a movement like the passing of the wind , a sedate and austere rift furrowing the briny blades apart . When Pierre lifted his gun to fire the children scurried with joy to Bridget 's skirts . Beyond the clear water of the pond and the dam wall was the high grass sagging slowly away . They all stood silent as if a spell had been cast upon them by Pierre 's short amiable command . Across the pond the reeds were pressed apart and a mammoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head through the blades and picking here and there at the roots of the reeds in search for stranded fish to sweeten in his dark belly . Pierre fired twice . " Delicious meat , " he said as he led them delicately around the wall of the pond . " Best when served not overdone so that the tang of the flesh is preserved . " He picked up the bird whose breast he had shattered open , holding the dark scaled feet of it securely in his palm . In silence they all followed him back around the water . He walked lightly on the balls of his feet over the great seascarredstones , swinging the plumed bleeding body far from the fine cloth of his breeches . From time to time he turned his head to talk with Nicolas who walked beside him , and his keen eyes would go beyond to examine the distance and the thin edge of sea uncurling like an opening finger . " Gulls , " he murmured . Jeannot stroked the blood-torn breast of the dangling crow . " Can you eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eat gulls ? Eh ? Oh , no . But what of feathers for your bonnets ? What of wings for the little girls here ? " P144He indulgently pinched a cheek below him , and Mimi and Monique swung on Bridget 's hands and averted their shy faces in laughter . The gulls were coming steadily on with the sea , scattering and dipping before the advancing wave . Nicolas and Bridget and the children followed Pierre on back around the pond .   " WHY , " SAID CHARLOTTE SUDDENLY , " why do you supposethe nightingale never came back this year ? " She lay on the great bed with the richly embroidered sheets turned down below her chin and her dark eyes suffused with injury . " I want the nightingale ! " she said in a high childish voice . She beat her feet with irritation in the bedclothes . " I 'm sure that Pierre shot it down last autumn after he had gone back to Saint-Malo ! Bridget , I want the nightingale now , " she said . " I want him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nicolas , but I had the nightingale . " Her eyes were filling with tears . " Last year I did n't have you , but why should I have to choose between you . He was so lovely , Bridget , " she said . " You have no idea . He was as soft as a feather himself , and you could see his little throat rippling when he sang . " Bridget and Nicolas and Jean were having their coffee and cigarettes in Charlotte 's room . " I want to get the sea-gulls in , " said Nicolas . " Their wings must be broken . They 're floundering around out there in the pond . " " Ben , Nicol , " said Jean . " Let them be . Pierre 's a good  |p146shot  . " Through the window of Charlotte 's bedroom could be seen the three fallen gulls that Pierre had shot the afternoon before . They were floating clearly and quietly on the water . One was drifting with his wings spread widely apart and his small smooth head moving slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was washed steadily up and then down upon the sea wall , first up on the wall and then sucked down again into the vacuous edge of water . And the third one was managing to arch his slim neck and peck from time to time at passing objects as he drifted . Bridget stood beside Nicolas at the window watching the filling pond and the poplar row shuddering along the beach . The sky was grey with foreboding and there was a fresh wind combing the waters . " Jean , I want the nightingale ! " said Charlotte 's querulous voice behind them . " What a spoiled child you are ! " said Jean with a convulsionof laughter . " What shall I ever do for my tongue ? " said Charlotte . She called Bridget back to look at it , thrusting it out at her white as wool and slightly speckled with toast . " I ca n't bear being ugly ! " cried Charlotte suddenly . She pressed the palms of her long white hands into her eyes . " I ca n't bear being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to be left alone ! " " Oh , Charlotte , " cried Jean . " No one is going to leave you ! " The soft expanse of his forehead was abruptly furrowed with distress . The great wide hairless hands stroked at the sheets of the bed . " Do n't be sad , Charlotte , " he said . " No one is going to go away . We are all here and so happy together , " he said . His vast face had slowly begun to collapse . " Nothing is ever going to change , Charlotte , " he said . " Look up at Nicol and Bridget . Do n't be sad . " " But Nicol and Bridget must go away , " said Charlotte . She took one of Jean 's hands in hers . " Of course , Jean , you know that Nicol and Bridget have to go away and make their living somewhere . " " I do n't see why they have to go away , " said Jean . His great chin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about it , " said Charlotte . " I want to talk to you about it now . " " But you 're too ill now , " said Bridget . " No , wait , Charlotte , until you are better soon . " " No , I want to talk about it now , " said Charlotte petulantly . " I want Jean to bring me the papers about the estancias so that he will understand and we shall talk about it now . " Jean looked at her in bewilderment and she patted his hands . " There , there , Jean , " she said , " you must understand how things are , you know . We must all try to lead better lives the way people of the world all do . And , Jean , you must promise to take me away after this . We 'll go to Paris and we 'll go to the theatre , and it will take the bad taste from my mouth . We 'll see Mon Cure Chez Les Riches and Mon Cure Chez Les Pauvres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevalier sing . We could go out when he began singing his bad songs , Jean , and just once we 'd go for the aperitif to the Cafe de la t'aix . " " Charlotte , Charlotte , " Jean began to whimper . He had taken out his handkerchief and was beginning to wipe his beautiful mild eyes . But the arrival of Maman in a state of extreme agitation gave another turn to his attention . Down sat Maman by the side of her daughter 's bed . Her old fingers fumbled in her skirt and drew out her crocheting . tier hands were always a happy independent couple in themselves ; in themselves a complete menage continuously occupied in some rapid work they shared between them and in which the old lady herself had no part . Now did these two elderly members toss the wool back and forth , weaving and working in and out in perfect accord and as if with minds of their own , while Maman 's detached face looked gravely on and finally addressed Charlotte and Bridget and Nicolas and Jean . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rapid undertone . " Really extraordinaire , extraordinaire . " No one else could give it such a flavour . " Uncle Robert has written a letter to your father making an absolute offer to add fifteen thousand francs to Annick 's dot if she gets married within the next six months . " Every pigment of colour sapped from her face as she spokeP148these words to them . Her voice had turned hoarse in her throat . It was easily the most astonishing thing that had happened in the family since the day that Nicolas had married a foreigner . This news could mean nothing else , surely , but that Annick was as good as betrothed . There could be no question now , as far as the family was concerned , as to what Luc would do . The girls ' dowries were handsome enough as it was , but with fifteen thousand thrown in to boot , there could surely be no more doubt as to how Luc would make up his mind . " Ah , poor Marthe ! " said Charlotte softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had echoed the fear in her own soul . " What can we do for poor Marthe ? " " If only someone could give her that much too , " said Charlotte , " to give her an even chance ! " She turned her head upon her pillow but she did not look at Jean . With delicacy and tact she looked away across the running sea . But her words , although not addressed to him , had caused a distinct change to alter his countenance . His eye diminished and his chin grew firm . He set his face as if against some sinister force which , the more because he could not comprehend it , he knew he must stubbornly resist in silence to the end . If his mind 's eye did not perceive legions of unmarried sisters , aging relatives , sick brothers-in-law trespassing upon lands that were his , at least some sense in him made him suspect the intention of their presence near his home . Here was his defeat for them all , then , in his whole shrinking face which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His triumph lay in flapping his loose knees together , clinging to his cane and looking as if he had not understood . His softening brain could , in the miracle of silence , finally outwit them all . " How does Annick take the news ? " asked Charlotte . " She wished to write to Oncle Robert at once and suggest that he transfer his offer to Marthe , " said Maman . Completely unobserved in her lap , her hands were turning the sleeve of a baby jacket . " But your father and I persuaded her that it would not do to appear to be critical of Oncle Robert 's choice . She has always been his favourite and I must confess that now I consider he has done enough to merit her tending him in his last illness when the time comes . I only hope for all our sakes that it wo n't be a lingering one so that Annick will not be longp149away from home . Your father is writing to inform Pierre , " finished Maman , " so that Luc may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The excitement of all this was too much for Charlotte and by the time Papa had joined them in her room she was gagging aver the porcelain basin beside her bed . Papa watched her darkly as she sank back upon the deep pillows in their embroidered jackets . The pages of Vogue and La Femme tWgante had glided down over the quilt and collapsed on the floor . Charlotte smiled gently up at him and held out her hand . " Will you open the shutters a little , just a little , Papa , " she said , " on that side so I can see the acacia tree ? "   NICOLAS LEAPED OUT OF BED into the middle of the bright morning , wiped his feet on the square of sunshine and began to shave . Never had such a beautiful room been theirs . The bed was shining like a golden throne , and over the long golden mirrors the cupids floated endlessly away with their cheeks swelling to the trumpet-tubes and their toes curled close on the architraves of the fluted pilasters . Nicolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the September harbour fell in upon the floor . Beside the bed squatted the valises , their sleek leather jowls rubbing against the petticoats of lace . Nicolas ' fingertip drawn down the surface of the mirror as he shaved before it , left a gleaming pathway through the infinitudes of dust . The night before they had pulled the shrouded covers from the gilded armchairs , and now the brocaded satin of them , stuffed fat as pigeons , swelled smooth and glossy in the morning light . " This is our honeymoon , " said Nicolas . He was transformed with peace and gaiety in Charlotte 's and Jean 's bedroom in their house in Saint-Malo . Beneathp151them was the nursery , empty except for a headless doll and a scattered string of beads . " This is our honeymoon , " said Nicolas , and Bridget thought of Charlotte stirring upon her pillows and discussing whether this year they would return to the house in October or if they would linger on in the country until she was up and about again , perhaps even until the Toussaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nicolas must have a week of it , for the harbour and the sea there were like none other in the world . " Before you go to Africa . . . said Charlotte . " But will jean ever be persuaded ? " said Nicolas , in doubt . " Oh , but that goes without saying , " Charlottehad answered . By the time you come back from SaintMalothat will have been decided .. " This is our honeymoon , " said Nicolas . He took her hand as they walked down the stairs of the empty house , each hollow step of it reproaching them for their intrusion . Six months it had been since the house had been closed away , and in all the rooms there was the faint humid scent of early spring . The salon was shrouded like a tomb , and the family portraits veiled that hung upon the walls of it . In spite of all the words there were to say , even at coffee that first morning on the strong sea wall the conversation turned again to Luc , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend of it , back it came to " Luc lived here , and in this corner house Luc was born , and in this villa which was a hospital in time of war Luc had lain side by side with Nicolas for two months and Annick was the head in firmiere . " Bridget felt a certain resentment in the thought that Annick had been there to nurse them both when she was far away . Nicolas was so contented , drinking his coffee in the shadow of the cafe awning and talking there . He told her about Chateaubriand and pointed out the island , the closest one , where they had buried him . And beyond was where Conrad had lived the first year of his marriage , but they would need a boat to get to it . There , on that hard packed beach , Nicolas and Charlotte had rolled their hoops together . " Do you think Luc will marry Annick ? " Bridget suddenly said . Nicolas sat puffing at his cigarette . " Maybe he will , " he said . " Fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been talking about a new wing on theP 152clinic for some time and he and Luc could use that money very well . " " Do you know what I want to do , Nicol ? " said Bridget in a moment . " I want to go to a bird shop and try to find a nightingale . " All morning they spent in climbing over the dark strong rocks , exploring the two beaches and discovering clearer and clearer pools of sea hidden on the outskirts of them . It was unbelievable that salt water could be so thin and clear , so fresh that it was difficult not to lie down beside it and drink great draughts of it . Here and there were fish poised static a moment in the little basins of sea and then darting off under the roots and caverns of the rock . In the running waters were occasional minnows woven into the movement of the flowing weeds , transparent fish opening and closing their crisp short fins . This was the most wonderful morning of all . Although it was late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water there were stalks of white coral like polished skeletons , and branched fangs of rosy coral hung with glassy ornaments of the sea . When they grew hungry before lunch they pried open quantities of yellow clams and ate them off the tip of Nicolas ' knife . In the afternoon they went to call on Oncle Robert . Oncle Robert was in a state of exhaustion incident to the endowment he had made upon his favourite niece . Scarcely a whisper of his voice could be heard from the depths of his velvet chair and the folds of his satin gown . " Dear , dear children , " he murmured . He laid an expiring hand in each of theirs and then he closed his eyes as if he were about to swoon away . " Tell me how each member of our dear family has taken the news , " he said when he had again recovered sufficient strength to speak . " I wonder if it was wise of me , " he continued , " to have put my finger in the matrimonialpie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " Oh , dear , " he murmured . " At times I fear my spontaneity makes me actually imprudent ! " " Annick has decided not to take the veil for a while at least , " said Nicolas , " and spent the entire day upon her knees thanking the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost . " " The dear girl wrote me a few sweet expressions of her gratitude as well , " said Oncle Robert with a deprecatory smile , making a gallant gesture with his hand as though the realp153honour belonged to the Holy Tree . " I love Luc as I do my own dear boy , and rather than see him united with that absolute serpent of a Marthe who would consume him so completely that there would be no virility left to pursue his high career  --  or with that guffawing graceless creature who is half man and the remainder quite indescribable , I refer to Julie , of course  --  rather than see him united to either of those two monsters of womanhood who shy like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to sacrifice my entire fortune , small though it may be , and enable him to marry a good and lovely woman who has washed enough behinds in hospitals to take a husband as a matter of course . " Oncle Robert was seized with a fit of ague , and interruptedhimself to ring for tea . " But we enlightened ones , " he continued with his tedious cough , " must use our wits to guide the lives of others who are less gifted . Thus I have , like Fate , indicated as best I could the way that it would be best for events to dispose themselves . My dear brother Auguste has just telephoned me that Luc is expected for the week end . I fully expect this will mean an engagement formally announced within the week . " The words dropped like bitter pills from off his dry sharp tongue , and Bridget put down her tea cup with a clatter . Luc in the country , and they were here in Saint-Maio ! Luc in the country , riding the filly bareback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole week end of Luc in the bosom of the family . Forty-eight hours of gold squandered in handfuls , and she not there for a single moment of it . " And Charlotte is feeling better , " continued Oncle Robert , " and sat up the entire afternoon . The horror of that affair ! " said Oncle Robert as he sipped his tea . " That 's one thing I can never forgive your mother , Nicolas , " he said . " Your mother is a woman who considers she knows best about every matter that comes under her nose . She never could see any harm in Charlotte marrying jean . Of course the whole explanation of Charlotte 's sieges is Jean 's disease . Everyone knows that there should be no children from such a union at all . They are all doomed to it , and it poisons Charlotte like the plague . How wise you two children are ! " he murmured . " How wise of you , in spite of my brother 's tempting but most indelicate offer , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken approbation of them Bridget felt there was a gleam of censure in his eye . " Now Luc is another matter , " said Oncle Robert . " What a husband for any woman ! " he exclaimed . " Too bad you ca n't marry him , Bridget , " said Oncle Robert playfully , " for you would really be a charming pair . " He laughed lightly and with the greatest agility turned the conversation back to jean . " But as for jean , " he said , " of course he should be burned alive for being a dullard , and Charlotte should be put on the rack , if she is n't there already , poor thing , for having married a nit-wit . " He wiped his fingertips in his silk handkerchief . " Oh , dear , " he said , " how people do abuse their lovely , lovely lives ! Now you two handsome ones are going to do something perfectly gorgeous , I 'm quite sure . I can see in your eye , Nicolas , that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world ! " Oncle Robert shook his finger playfully at his nephew whose eye , in truth , was particularly grim . " You see , I 'd never dream of offering you two anything because it 's so evident that you just could n't get into straits of any kind . Such a relief to have competence , and charm , in the family for once in a way ! " And thus Oncle Robert disposed of any necessity of doing anything for them . He looked at them sharply over the porcelain edge of his cup , just on the point of speaking of other things , for it was perfectly clear that he did not want the conversation to go on in the way it was going . It had clearly occurred to him that they might just say that they had nothing in the world to do and that they thought he might let them have a little money . But this he solved for the moment at least by passing his fragile hand across his forehead . " I 'm really feeling much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't imagine what it is except that I must be getting old . " After this there was nothing to do but go . They went out of his house on to the wall , and there was the afternoon already moving down the beach to sunset , slipping away from them in cool clear tides of light . They walked into the precipitous streets of the town and sought out a bird shop , for Bridget was determined to buy a nightingale . By the greatest stroke of good luck , they found a solitaryp155nightingale in the first pet shop they entered . He was put into a little unpainted wooden cage and they carried him out with them into the open square . Behind them was the sea wall , matured and bosomed with dusk , and before them in the street a military band was passing by . The little pieces of bottle glass on the court wall of the mediaeval prison yard were bladed with the last rays of sinking light . They sat down with their bird at a little tin table on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had she felt such desolationin her heart . Never before had faces looked so grim and decorous , never had complexions seemed so sallow and worn . Nicolas was wearied and gloomy after his conversation with Oncle Robert and he sat sipping glumly at his ruby drink . Bridget thought of Luc 's short bright moustaches , of his thick square lashes , and of his scalp scrubbed clean as a timber floor . Great expanses of gold had been splashed on him as if from a brush dripping with fresh paint . Splash had gone the brush on the crown of his stubborn head . Splash , splash went the brush and gave him his yellow brows . " ' The twilight attempered Hyperborean Apollo , ' " she thought sadly , " ' gleaming at times with a supernatural brightness , and exposing to those who love him a golden thigh . ' ' Not even the sight of the nightingale perched in his small wooden cage could revive her fainting heart . There sat the little bird with his merciless eye upon her , clutching the perch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp censorious eye upon them from the outset , and not a leaf of lettuce would he consider , judging moreover the tiny grains that they had scattered for him as fit only to bear his droppings . A critical small bunch of feathers turning this way and that upon his perch and uttering no sound .   THE SHARP SEPTEMBER DARKNESS was awaiting them as they stepped down from the train . Autumn was coming in like a wet leaf blown across - their faces , a sign for the blood to turn to wine in their veins , a promise of new countries , and winds , and faces . There was always this jubilation in the changing of the seasons , and now the thought of winter on the estancia where they were to begin all over again made shivers of delight pierce Bridget 's heart . Outside the station there were stars . Far above them the stars were hanging in the darkness , and near by the night was puckered like golden silk about the bright lamps of the sulky . Charlotte 's coachman leaned in after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . Then he too climbed . up and took the reins . With a chirp of his tongue he flecked the whip across the filly and her hoofs started out in a tentative rhythm on the road , her uncertain ears quivering forward and back in the cones of light . Forward they would go , pointing with distrust into the perilous night through which she must advance , and then back they would flash revealing their soft lining to the gentle cluck of the coachman 's tongue . " The night throws her out , " the man said to Nicolas .  |p157Nicolas  stirred beneath the carriage robe to find Bridget 's liand . Before them they could see the pure bright ripple of the filly 's buttocks and the nervous flash of her cropped tail across her rump . The dainty dance of her hoofs was rapidly diminishingthe distance that lay between them and the good family . " Are you glad to be coming back ? " asked Nicolas . " Yes , " said Bridget . Everything would be settled now , she was thinking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annick would tell them that she was engaged to Luc ; everything would be determined in its own unalterable fashion . She thought of two pictures she would like to paint before she went away . In her mind everything was settled and arranged : the mornings that were left to them would be spent in oil painting and the afternoons in walking over the cliffs and woods that now would be so altered by the severe September nights . In this determination her mind was like a stranger to her , a freshly starched object , agreeable to the eye . How long before you wilt , she asked herself . There 'll be no wilting , she said sharply . Smartly the coachman 's whip splinteredthe air . Down the road chattered the bells of the filly 's harness , and her sharp , nervous hoofs danced in the gate . Maman came quickly down the steps to them , came hastening around the syringa bush with the three girls following behind . A week they had been gone , and how the weather had changed ! The hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could n't get a stick of wood to burn in it ! In the salon chimney only were there a few tongues of flame licking inadequately at the cold . As she removed her hat amongst them all Bridget could hear the filly snorting away through Charlotte 's grill and down the drive . Out in the night she could hear the soft puddle and snort of the filly 's muzzle and the chirp of her bells . " How 's Charlotte ? " asked Bridget . " I have brought her a nightingale . " There were glassy cracked moons upon each one of Papa 's knuckles as he spread his old hands at the fire . " No wonder you two never have any money ! " he said grimly . " Buying nightingales ! " His old shoulders were withdrawn from the chilly room . " Charlotte is naturally much better , " he continued in a moment . " In spite of Pierre 's effortsP158to inveigle her into his clinic in Rennes , we , in our poor humble way , have managed to make her practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was no word , no hesitation , no silence hallowed there for Luc . No one so much as spoke his name . Bridget looked at the faces of the three girls hoping to find some record of his visit there . But their eyes bespoke no elation and no despair . " September shutting its jaws on us , " said Papa . " We 'll see its teeth before morning . " Nicolas walked back and forth in the firelight , rubbing his hands and nosing the sharp eager cold . " It 'll go off in the equinox rains , " said Nicolas . Papa wondered about that . In the morning only Monique could remember how many sour-balls Charlotte had eaten the night before . Charlotte herself lay perfectly hidden beneath her lids . " After such improvement ! " said Maman . The happy menage of Maman 's hands continued their uninterrupted life below her , occupied in making a bonnet for the head of Charlotte 's unborn child . Papa 's voice was ominously narrowed at the door , hushed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village to telephone Pierre , and that Pierre had refused , refused point blank , to come . Jean was relieved . He settled back in satisfaction under his moustaches and then suddenly he leaned forward and cried out to them : " Family ! Leave her alone ! You and your Pierre ! Do you think I want my wife carried off to a clinic ? Do you think I want my child to point out a clinic as the place where he was born ? " Maman 's false but ringing laughter attempted to restore the normal tone . Only her eyes , swelling like amber beads against her nose , betrayed her indignation . " By way of precaution , jean , " said Maman judiciously . " We are merely discussing , you understand , discussing the wisdom of . . . Bridget remembered that Charlotte had once shown her over the entire house , explaining every stick of furniture and its history to her , pausing at the prayer-chair in her bedroom to point out the hollows cupped in the plush of it by the devotionp159of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , she had said , entreating God to render him more patient and more tolerant of others . Jean 's eyes were gentle as larkspurs , but Charlotte had smoothed out the bruised plush of the chair and remarked that jean was not a patient man . " He prays for it , " she had said . " For patience , patience ... " patience to extend like a gentle and forbearing hand upon his brow . Papa sat in his shabby old lavender coat , his breath sweet with port and his chin relaxed upon the shredded velvet of his coat lapels . Behind his head was a small oblong of landscape which one of the ancestors had hung in place . " Corot , before he discovered picnics , " Charlotte had said of it with her small brilliant smile . " My children ! " cried Maman . " You all forget this is no new thing . Why all this to-do about it ? Why are you grave , my Auguste ? Why is my Marthe weeping . . . " But in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger to them in her own house . Behind that closed door she had become a presence which they spoke of in whispers . Bridget felt that if she went in to her that she would find an alien creature , for even Maman 's laughter could not soothe them . But Maman insisted that they go in , that they sit upon the bed and talk with her , that they speak of ordinary things and show her their needlework . Bridget went in first to her and kissed her warm bewildered brow . " Darling , " said Bridget as she kneeled beside her . " Here is the nightingale . Look how lovely and soft he is . " Charlotte stretched out her hand towards him but she was frightened when he flew startled against the bars of his cage . Her lids had grown so heavy that she could scarcely lift them from her eyes . " Is n't it funny , Bridget , " she said . The quality of her voice had changed and her words came slowly as if drawn singly from a mire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tender mouth . " I ca n't possibly lift my eyelids , Bridget , " she said . After this she was too tired to say any more . But she had such a lovely long sleep all that day that no one disturbed her again and everybody was reassured . At supper Papa suggested that as long as Pierre was so busy , that perhaps Luc might come out and give his advice , and it was decided that ifp160Charlotte were not completely herself by morning that Luc should come . " But was n't Luc here over the week end ? " said Nicolas , as if suddenly reminded . " Oncle Robert told us that Luc was going to come . " Maman 's fingers set the silver straight under the shadow of her soup plate , the blade of the knife approached the last fine tooth of the fork and the spoons were crossed precisely below the fluted glass of cider . " Luc was expected , " said Maman , " but Luc was detained . He had to wait for an estimate on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was very anxious to come , but he was delayed by this estimate which required his presence there . " Across Maman 's nose was a flushed saddle of colour which she stroked with her fingertips , telling Bridget that this mark had afflicted her at the time of her second pregnancy and that it returned to her now at moments when she was overwrought . " I am very nervous now , " she said . " For some reason , I am very tired . " She recounted to them that she had laced her corset so tightly at that time , in order that none of Papa 's associates should suspect , that she had fainted quite away . It had been at a dinner party , and everybody had been so delighted and so amazed to learn that the young Colonel 's wife . . . and only seven months after the birth of baby Pierre ! Papa laughed out loud at the remembrance of the water they had dashed on her and the bodice slit open by the blade of Capitaine le Beaufils ' sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Taut as a fiddle-string . " Nerves , nerves , nerves , " murmured Papa . " Always nerves . .. Charlotte had even broken down in the convent play , with the Noelists so sure of applause , and little Charlotte at twelve collapsing in " Poet and Peasant , " a piece she knew backwards and forwards .. . " Ah God , ah God , ah God , " Maman cried out and covered her eyes with her hand as though she suddenly knew . " No , no , I am all right , " she said to them . " We shall all say our prayers very well tonight and go to bed . I am worn out . I am tired . " P161For once her hands had collapsed and lay idle in her lap . She did not move again until she led the family from the table to the salon where the candles blazed and re-blazed in the mirrors . And there , as if life had revived in her , she sat abruptly down at the piano . " Par-umph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles twinkled about the weary lines of her old faded hair . Slyly she watched them all over the fatigued slope of her shoulder while her fingers searched sharply on the keys . " The talented young musician who married your father ... " she said . " How ravishingly she played for him on their first meeting . . . " Her fingers selected the notes as they would , tinkling along in smooth flight of sound . " Oh , we had such a bridal suite with a real gold piano ! And Monsieur and Madame dined together on their first evening .. . " Tinkle , tinkle , tinkle went the old piano . " And now would Madame have the goodness to play a selection on the pianoforte for Monsieur son maxi before retiring ? My poor Auguste . . . " She crashed the notes with her laughter . " The talented musician he had married had no notes with her and could play nothing , but nothing , from memory ! " The tuneless old piano could scarcely express her mirth . " Out he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my tears stop flowing he bought me a little red and yellow cap , children ... " Her hands abandoned the keys for a moment and she swung about on the stool to face them . " Do you remember the little red and yellow cap , Auguste cheri ? " she said . She cocked her little old head on one side . Papa tossed his elbows on the arms of his chair . " I do n't remember , " he growled at her . For nothing on earth would he show her that he was amused . " Oh , Auguste , " cried Maman . " The little red and yellow cap , voyons ! " Maman crashed the notes one final time , closed the piano , blew out the candles which burned upon it , and stood up and looked at them all . She looked at the girls who were tired , and at Bridget , at Nicolas , and at Papa . She looked at them all . And then like an old general she gave them their orders , her wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the coming battle . " Take your candles and go to bed , " she said . " Get some sleep now . " P162Presently Papa and Nicolas and Bridget were left alone by the fire . " What of Pierre ? " said Nicolas . Papa 's eyes started up from the fire . " Eh ? Oh . .. Pierre .. . " he said . His hands fell down on the arms of his chair . " He wanted Charlotte to come to Rennes , " he said . " He spoke of operating . That wo n't do . " Nicolas leaned forward , striking his palms softly together . " But should n't Pierre be the one to know ? " he asked . Papa stirred in his chair . " But she 'll eat , she 'll eat , " he said impatiently . " She 's been this way before . You do n't know . You 've been away the other times , Nicolas . You 'll see , she 'll eat tomorrow .. . or the day after . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Nicolas . " Eh ? " said Papa vaguely . He was looking at the fire again . " Eh ? Oh . . . yes . She 's been as bad as this before . " They sat like three survivors of some storm , huddled closeto the fire with the rosy curtains of the salon drawn against the night . " But I think you should have Luc or some other doctor come , " persisted Nicolas . " Will you let me go to the town and telephone for somebody else in the morning ? " he said . Papa started a little at the sound of Nicolas ' voice . " Oh ... Luc ... yes , " he said . His head had sunk lower on his bosom and he was smiling softly , inexplicably . Suddenly a snore escaped him . " I think I 'll go to bed , " he said as he started up .   THE RAIN , which had been imminent all week , suddenly smote the ground . A high wind accompanied it and swung the giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over went the garden benches and the bright clay pots which covered the bleaching heads of chicory . The wind could be clearly seen streaming up the river and flinging the crests of it sky-high . From the windows of the billiard room the great livid banks of mud were speared with rain . " ' The four and twenty sailors , ' " read Jeannot 's precise tried voice across the page , " that stood upon the decks , were four and twenty white mice " '  --  his impatient eyes darted over the edge of the book which Bridget held , to the click of Jean 's and Nicolas ' billiard balls  --  " with chains around their necks . ' " Jeannot 's blue eyes wandered all over the green baize table , examined Nicolas ' hand squared below the polished cue , drifted off to the small white umbrella that was progressing over the head of a little girl who was carefully making her way in the rain over the mill-wall . Deliberately and slowly Bridget shaped the words for Jeannot : " ' Robin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His sweet patient sigh fluttered across the pages as he turned to her , and then he said suddenly :   " I hate English . " " I hate English , " said Riquet like a parrot . In his red felt slippers he strutted about the room . " I hate English , " he screamed . Nothing could silence him . The nursemaid slapped at his bulging thighs and his father pounced on him with a gulp of laughter . " I hate English , " he shouted . It was all of no use . The skin of Charlotte 's children was fair and beautiful and their hair was as soft as flax . When they opened their mouths to wail or shout they revealed red velvet caverns studded with priceless pearls . Their ears were neatly buttoned to the sides of their heads , and their eyes were stainless like the clearest marble . They were as clean and warm as spotless young rabbits in their nest of hay . A round green ball of candied sugar popped into the jaws of their yawning jewel boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an eye . " Pierre is not a father himself , " said jean when his younger son had quieted down about a sour=ball , " or else he never could have suggested to Charlotte that she go away . It 's terrible , " he said , " to have to leave your children . " Pierre 's pleasant medical manner suddenly took shape in Bridget 's mind . She saw him quite distinctly balancing before them on his heels , holding in one hand an immaculate pair of black kid gloves which he slapped repeatedly against his thigh . He had just concluded a successful operation in Rennes , seconded by Luc . " The twins on the operating table labouring in the womb of the unconscious woman , " he had said . " Magnificent as Wagner torn with his Tristam and Ysolde . We removed the cist , replaced the womb in the woman 's body , and three hours later the normal birth took place . . . " Listen , jean , " said Nicolas leaning on his billiard cue , " maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jean looked at him in bewilderment as if the injury of this was more than he could bear . His mild , gentle eyes were brimming now with tears . " Do you know what they did to me last night ? " he said . " They told me I could n't sleep in the same bed with her until she gets better . Everyone is turning against me , " he said , " and turning against poor Charlotte now that she 's so ill . " The imaginary figure of Pierre exposed his small brightP165teeth to Bridget . " My hands , " he said prettily , " are tied .. . " It 's against my wishes that the family has telephoned for Luc , " said jean looking at Nicolas with his mild injured eyes . " And when he comes I do n't want to see him at all , " he said . " I do n't want Luc and a strange doctor in my house doing things that will only be harmful to Charlotte . At first Papa was on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turned against me too . I know he 's the one who told you to telephone for Luc . Now that Charlotte'sill , " he said , " there is n't anybody to take my side . " So jean sat quietly up in the billiard room with Annick and the children when Luc and the little white-bearded doctor came . Into Charlotte 's room went the two medical men while the family waited and did their needlework in the adjoining room . There was a sense of peace and assurance now that the medical men were here . Nothing could happen now . The lines were smoothed out of Maman 's face , her hands had resumed their active life again . And then , delicate as a flute , Charlotte 's voice sounded through the door to them : " Il n'etait qu'un petit navire , pet-it na-vi-re-e . " And Papa burst into shouts of laughter . He looked from one to the other of them in bright vindication . " Lullabies ! " he exclaimed in triumph . It was quite evident that Charlotte was singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang on behind the closed door . " Qui n'avait ja-ja-jamais navige. . . " she sang , and the whole family burst into laughter . Even while she laughed the tears streamed down Marthe 's cheeks , and Julie shouted with deep guffaws . Papa shook in his garnet vest and the links of his watch-chain slid up and down upon his belly . Maman 's teeth gripped fiercely over her lip with laughter . " Charlotte , " said Luc coining out the door and closing it behind him , " is much stronger than when Pierre saw her last . " Maman 's fingers abandoned their work and clasped one another tightly across her bosom . " Oh , children , children , the champagne we 'll drink when Charlotte is up again ! " she said . " The gay dinner we 'll have for her , children ! " " It is her head that is a little bit light , " said Luc , " fromP166not having eaten enough all this time . " Luc was wearing a dark blue suit and a stiff white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen him look . When he walked across the room he took great strides and rubbed his hands together in the most professional way . But whatever he did , the attention of everybody was turned upon him , and the girls sat looking and Bridget sat watching him as if they could never see enough of his fine ways . When he reached the window some kind of a change came over his face , and he stooped down by the table and looked into the nightingale 's cage . " Oh , here is the nightingale ! " he said . He squatted there , balancing on his heels and looking through the brass bars of the family 's cage at the little bird which he had terrified and which was making short hurried flights here and there . He whistled softly through his teeth to it , and the little bird cocked his head and eyed Luc with a shrewd eye . Presently the feathers about his neck began to rise and ruffle in delight as if Luc 's serenade had spurred his flagging pride . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear to Luc 's ceremonious tongue that chirped and chuckled words of highest praise . But if the nightingale had succumbed to Luc 's sweet wooing , Maman and the girls were outraged that he should be spending his brief time with them in squatting whistling before a wild bird 's cage . " Come now , Luc , " said Maman . " Tell us what we are to do for Charlotte and when she will be able to get up . " " We are all of the opinion that she should go to Rennes , " said Luc . He stood up and pulled down his cuffs in his sleeves . " I think you ought to make up your minds to that . " " Jean wo n't hear of it , " said Papa . " There 's no use talking about it at all . " " There 's no use talking about it at all , " whistled Luc through his teeth . " Bridget , I think the nightingale is lonely , " Luc said . In the midst of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting a cigarette and looking into her eyes . She was trying to knit a necktie for Nicolas and now the stitches of it went running like drops of water off the needle . " I think the nightingale 's heart is probably breaking , " hea1P167said . " What are you going to do about it ? " he said . " What do you think you will do ? " " I think I will have to let him go , " said Bridget . When she looked up into his face she saw a tremour of pain cross his eyes . " Oh , but you ca n't do that ! " he said . " You 're responsible for him , you know . You ca n't just turn him off that way . But I think you ought to see that he 's not alone , " said Luc . " Somethingvery silly might happen to him , you know . He might grieve away for love , or for the lack of it , " said Luc . Such health , such fortitude faced Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh that she mistrusted any matter could fall into decay , could pine and perish for love or lack of it . Even the nightingale , for all his fragility , had a certain wise preeminence which could survive an accumulation of restraint . But for the moment Luc had lost the courtly ways which had always been his obeisance to each member of the family . " Ah , well , " he said to Bridget . " You ca n't just give freedom . It 's a much more complicated thing than taking it away . " And now , if ever , thought Bridget , must they come to understand each other . She thought of the money Oncle Robert had promised Annick and of the wing that the doctors wanted to build in Rennes . She thought of Marthe 's fast avaricious love . Whatever respect she had , thought Bridget , it was for Julie 's proud indifference and what it served to conceal . In all of this was Luc , who could have been , who might have been the rainbow , the horned stag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him and turning all he touched to gold . " Well , it is just that that I should like to give him , " said Bridget . She looked at the little nightingale . " Instead of bits of grousel and grains of corn , " she said , " I should like to give him that . "   IF THERE WERE BOOKS WRITTEN , things said , women to talk wisely of other people in preparation of an atmospherewhich would give a grace of mind and action to those who are too young to be prepared ; if there were a tradition of gentility that could stand without the prejudice of inexperience in each person who upheld it , it would be a good thing . A tradition is an explanation , is in itself an education which people should be proud to carry on but should not sit down within and make no effort to assert . I can not , thought Bridget , support the tradition of the family , for it has no pride to it , and it has not made them lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have liked , she thought , to have had heroes behind me with which to have shamed them . Men who gave up family , fortune and whatever the world could then offer them to discover a new planet , a radium , or to fly alone across the Atlantic at a time when no one had flown across it . With these men behind me I should have carried on in smaller ways their grace . I should like to have had successful ancestors , by which I mean that they could have died sick , ill , or despairing but whether they knew it or not they had still got the best of the details which take you by the flesh and wear you to the bone . P169Had they succeeded in writing two lines that declared them , or lived in any shiftless way , I should now have some indignation inherited with which to confront Nicolas ' people . This , she thought , is the crafty way of the young in putting the blame upon the old . This is the way , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame them for is something else again . There was my grandfather , she thought , and whether I could live with him or not he was a fine arrogant man , and perhaps with a legion like him behind me I could now lift my head among these people . But through lack of education and that tradition of old warriors I should have relished , I resent the purpose of the good family , for I myself have no purpose at all . She was sitting in the billiard room of Charlotte 's house making a very pretty darn in the heel of a sock , while Nicolas was idly knocking the spotless balls about the table . " Do you know what I 've been thinking , Bridget ? " he said . He was in a sour temper and he drew his cue rapidly back and forth before he gave it a vicious shot at the ball . " I 've been thinking that if anything happened to Charlotte that our chances of going to the estancia would be in a bad way , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was smiling rather bitterly as he stood examining the balls for his next play . " Everything we touch vanishes into thin air , " he said . " I suppose you 've noticed that ? " It was in such moments that Bridget thought that , had she refused and challenged and antagonized the family from the outset , things might have taken a better turn . All by himself in his resentment Nicolas was getting nowhere at all . Nicolas ' own particular gloom had once seemed a thing of distinction to her , but the bitterness of it had increased to no purpose , and when things were holding out no promise to them it possessed and poisoned every moment they shared . " What do you want me to do ? " she said . Riquet was gravely watching his Tante Bridget finishing off her darn . " Perhaps you could have a little talk with Charlotte , " said Nicolas with his sour shameful smile . " I mean now , " he said , " before she gets any worse . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asking for Riquet . " Do you think I could take him ? " said Bridget . She had picked up the little boy in her arms . " I have n't seen her for two days . Do you think it would be all right if I should go ? " Jean was off playing bridge at the family 's house and Bridget went down into the dark stench and terror of Charlotte'sroom , carrying Riquet high like a torch in her arms . The blinds were drawn and in the first moment the one visible thing was the porcelain basin waning like a dim moon in the interminable gloom . Gradually the bed took shape below them , luminous and unstirring and heaped with confusion , with one thick braid of ebony hair lying across the pillows . Bridget stood with her arm under Riquet 's small close thighs , watching that motionless braid curved across the linen . And suddenly Charlotte loomed slowly up out of the darkness , loomed up upon them with the loose flesh of her face sagging down on her jaws as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Charlotte , Charlotte , my love . .. " she said . The tears rained down her face . But Charlotte squatted below them with her face peering up from under her dark puzzled brows , her dark offensive face attempting to fix Bridget in all the chaos of her sight . Slowly she lifted one hand to shade her eyes , and from under it she peered suspiciously up at Bridget . There she sat crouching in her bed , peering cautiously up through the obscurity , crouchingthere silent and dark and offensive with odour . " Embrasse , " said Riquet , leaning softly down with his hands outstretched . " Embrasse , Maman . " Suddenly Charlotte 's mouth was blurred and swollen with sound , with apology and explanation , with no words that could be distinguished , but with a blind fumbling flow of sound which sought coherence in the small gestures of her hand . She was apologizing , Bridget could make out , for her condition . She was apologizing to them because she could not form language any more . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pillows and the inarticulate voice tapered out in her small weary smile . In the darkness she lay smoothingthe polished brow of Riquet 's hair and he patted her cheeks with his open palms and listened incuriously to the black torrents of her mouth . For a moment Charlotte lay watching Bridget , and thenp171she thrust her head up on her neck and held it there in poised offensive strength . Her tongue was swinging thickly in her mouth , and the acacia was moaning at the window in the wind . Through the ribs of the closed shutters Bridget could see the dripping white globes of rain which clung there , slid , and dropped away . Charlotte 's loose mouth had fallen open and sagged upon the back of her hand . " The acacia , " she said . She spoke it in a deep stricken voice , and the sound of her own words so startled her that she gave a cry of fright . Holding her loose jaw in place with her hand , she sank back and turned heavily to the pillow , averting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . Her lips hung wide and loose about the deep snores of her sobbing , and Riquet burst suddenly into tears . He pulled fiercely at the lace of Charlotte 's gown , crying aloud , and drawing her nightgown down from her full shaken shoulder . The terrible snores of Charlotte 's grief resounded in the room , and now the nursemaidtiptoed lightly in . " Oh , dear , oh , dear , how naughty , naughty ! " she whispered . She picked Riquet up and bore him rapidly away . All night long the wind shook at the house and smote the walls of it with great blasts of rain . In the morning when the family hastened down for news of how Charlotte had passed the night , they were halted by the sight of the great acacia fallen and lying enormously across Charlotte 's drive . The whole family stood aghast before the awful sight of it snapped off like a reed to the very stump , the great acacia that had stood for centuries of bad weather before Charlotte 's house . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been no more surprised . There lay the mammoth beast , with its thick dark trunk gaping and ripped wide with fresh wood , and the sap running out like sirup all over the ground . After the first moment of horror the family picked their way around it under the rain , stepping gingerly over the stout branches that only yesterday had swung like demons high above their heads . Jean was having his hot chocolate in the dining-room . He had passed , he told them , a terrible night . " Ben , the tree crashing down and Charlotte screaming like a maniac , " he said . Papa said he had always expected it toP172happen sooner or later . He wiped his shoes carefully at the salon door . Jean sopped a long crust in his chocolate and bore it dripping to his mouth . Maman was humping slowly away upstairs to see her daughter . " She 's quieted down now , " said Jean as he ate . He had n't closed his eyes all night . Bridget and Nicolas stood at the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge below the esplanade . The wind would sweep suddenly down upon it and lift up mouthfuls of the foam in great quivering gulps , shattering it against the bars of the grill and the window pane . Splatter , splatter went the foam in a million rainbow bubbles before their very noses . And the sea itself looked as though it had no humility left in it , and that its clear intention was to rise upon them and possess them all . " Anyway , it 'll give us enough fire wood for the winter , " said Jean of the acacia . " We 'll have a young tree planted in February and , you 'll see , in two hundred years it will amount to the same thing . " He spoke of those two centuries as if they were years in which the children would be growing up , and Charlotte 's hair turning grey , and even Nicolas and Bridget still there to pull off the acacia blossoms and the leaves of it for the Fete Dieu every summer just as they had this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild and unalterable , with Bridget and Nicolas eternally visiting , Luc returning for his vacances every summer , and Charlotte giving birth again and again unceasinglyjust as she had always done . His greatest sorrow was that the hard red wine of the country had a restrictive action upon his intestines and therefore he could not drink as much of it as he would have liked . North Africa and the estancia had certainly never for the last ten years entered his calculations as an actual place . But here , without turning away from the sight of the rearing ocean , Nicolas took up his words . " But doubtless we wo n't see , as long as we 're going to North Africa , Jean , " he said . " Going to North Africa ? " said Jean . " Ben , that 's a funny idea of yours , Nicol . " But something canny and suspicious had crept into his eyes , and when Bridget smiled at him he said : You do n't want to go to North Africa , do you , Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " she said . " Oh , it 's horrid ! " said Jean . He shook himself in his skin like an animal unpleasantly wet . " Ugh ! No water closets ! " he said . " And bugs ! Such horrid things ! " " But Charlotte spoke to me  --  " began Nicholas . His face had turned as white as chalk . The sight of Maman walking in on them stopped him short . She seemed to have grown smaller . She had shrunken in her clothes , a small withered old woman whose fingers could manipulate no coherent work but which buttoned and unbuttonedendlessly the opening of her corsage , whose hands must fold and crease and tremble over whatever chanced to fall beneath them . She removed the tortoise-shell pins from her old hair and as promptly restored them to their place among her locks . " My daughter , " she said hoarsely , " my daughter is very ill . We must send for Pierre at once , Jean , " she said . " We must send for Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go at once with her to Rennes . We must resign ourselves to the operation , Jean , I see that now . We have not made any mistake at all , Jean , we have been wise to wait and see if the operation was really a necessity . And now I am convinced , and I am quite ready to accompany Charlotte to Rennes . " Nicolas was dispatched in the limousine to telephone Pierre . He was to tell his brother that the family would now consent to anything , only Pierre must come . " And now Charlotte must be dressed , " said Maman . Her hands were shaking in the ribbon of her pince-nez , her fingers pecking furtively at nostrils , scalp , at the corners of her eyes . " Charlotte must be decently attired , " she said . As she went here and there picking at this and that about the room , Jean sat huddled in his chair , shuddering and watching her with apprehension from his easy chair . His larkspur eyes never forsook her for a moment as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the aged general who had always mustered them before . Now that a sinister attack was being made at their very gates , he turned to her for counteraction and for a successful peace . Up the broad stairs went Bridget and Annick and Julie and Marthe to dress Charlotte for her ride to Rennes . Here were the stockings to put on her , and here the embroidered shirt .   Here was the blue sweater that Maman had made her under the summer sky and by the warm sea in the mildest of garden winds . Charlotte lay quietly in the elaborate sheets which she herself had embroidered so long ago with a C and a J and the most innocent of cupids piercing their two hearts . Bridget lifted one sweet leg , and Annick the other , and on they pulled the warm cotton hose . Like the limbs of a doll they were , carved motionless , as stiff and artificial as the impersonal limbs of a wooden doll . Into the sweater went her doll-like arms , and over her head went the magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets with her eyes half-closed , waiting quietly and unprotestingly for her ride through the lovely Breton countryside to Rennes .   SOON AFTER LUNCH the ambulance snorted at the grill and glided down the drive as far as it could before the fallen acacia tree barred its way . The agile young interns leaped out and walked in their leather coats down through the rain , bearing the encased stretcher between them . Gravely , and gleaming in his rubber cape , Luc came behind . Down the drive he came and into the house with a dignity and a presence that set their hearts at rest . Whatever it was worth , thought Bridget , this sweet gravity alone deserved a homage , this stern grace in one so limited and young was rare enough to merit loyalty . To him and his activity could be given a devotion which more sensitive men did not require . Of what use am I to Nicolas , she thought as Luc came across the room , of what use ? Papa sat sunken in his chair with his chin dropped upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there , " he said , " in taking her off to Rennes this way ? Why take her away from all of us who love her ? " Luc spoke to them all , and then made his way up to Charlotte 's room . When he came down to them again he spoke
