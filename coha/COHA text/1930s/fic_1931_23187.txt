CASTLE IN ITALY A STORY BY LEONARD HESS T HE Trunns were journeying , with but occasional deviations , toward Merano where in the season people with " stomachs " eat the justly famous grapes . Peter Trunn had one of the " stomachs " in question . As for his wife , she did not believe he had that kind of a " stomach " at all , but she knew she would find old castles in the neighborhood of Merano , and old castles were her archeological passion . One difference between Peter and Beatrice Trunn was a lack of feeling for the historic past in him and its extravagant presence in her . Beatrice could look at the Conciergerie and see the tumbrils carrying the condemned to the scaffold . The Place de la Concorde , however bright the sky above it , darkened as Beatrice Trunn witnessed , in a perfervid imagination , the last moments of Marie Antoinette . She could rest on a bench in the Place des Voges , where it was no effort for her to be a horrified spectator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been slain . This historic sense was a magical possession which could persuade the substantial present to dissolve into the vapors of the past ; and could , indeed , so detach Beatrice from everything as meaningless as the nowadays as to destroy to an alarming degree her center of balance . She was able to indulge this hobby almost everywhere in Europe . There was always a cemetery where she could wander among crumbling headstones , murmuring inscriptions from which her stimulated brain wove chronicles of houses long since vanished , while Peter sat patiently on a mound , reading the Paris Herald , which followed him about the Continent like a faithful dog , or drawing on his cigar ( he had given up Havanas since the market crash ) , blinking mildly through his pince-nez , and thinking that Europeans had an amazing faculty for departing this life . Except for some odd corners , Merano was not antique enough for Beatrice 's tastes , but castles were in plentiful evidence on the surrounding hillsides . Their gray turrets , festooned with the ivy of ages , pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dramatic effect . So , while Peter spent his days on the promenade , Beatrice tramped up hill and down in search of ruins , with an indefatigableness which would have exhausted her in two hours of household duties . One might imagine that taking the Merano grape cure would entail nothing but pleasure . This delusion is fostered by the first glimpse of the sunlit promenade , made musical by the rush of a river alongside , and set within the beauty of semi-tropical vegetation and the more removed beauty of noble peaks . But a study of the faces of those who are " curing " awakens the suspicion that this is labor not to be belittled . Their intensity of expression speaks of an exhausting application . It is not so much the devouring of several pounds of grapes a day , or the drinking of several liters of juice , as the perplexing question , " Am I being cured ? " which constitutes the herculean task . Happily , Peter Trunn went at the business more sanely . The joy of consuming a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their purple blood satisfied him thoroughly . in fact , had Beatrice not been so obviously relishing her immersion in the past of the region , Peter would have considered his recuperation from his imaginary malady accomplished , and he would have gone to visit the children in the school in Switzerland . It was Peter who most often suggested seeing the children . Beatrice would then say , " You spoiled them quite enough at home , my dear ! Do stay away from them a little longer . I spoiled them , too  --  I admit it  --  but I 'm going to stay away from them and give them a chance to readjust themselves ! " Peter had had for years a dim suspicion that his wife developed theories when she wished to avoid facts . Long absences from her offspring did not seem to work havoc in Beatrice 's maternal constitution , although when she was with Janet and Billy she was in a continual flutter over them . Some such thoughts as these were passing insubstantially through his head as Peter sat on a bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the idea with a critical faculty somewhat unreliable because of the shock its inception had administered to him , and he was about to eject it from his mind as unworthy , when a gentleman let himself down on the same bench with him and launched a remark . " This is a great place , ai n't it ? " " Very nice , " Peter agreed , noticing that the gentleman was eating no grapes and wore , indeed , in addition to a suit of furious pattern , an aspect of health that could have stirred the envy of a pugilist . " Guess you come from the same gen'l d'rection as me , " the man of ponderable proportions went on , outstretching a bearish hand toward his presumed location of the western hemisphere . Peter beamed at hearing his native tongue , his joy not diminished by his companion 's ability to gulp down vast quantities of syllables . He acknowledged himself a citizen of the United States of America ; just how much longer he and his family were to remain abroad , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment . " I guess I 'm fixed here , " the large man interrupted . " I got property here now , sort of . Rented a big house up on a hill , for five years . It 's a schloss . ' " " Indeed ! " exclaimed Peter , " Really ? A ? schloss ' ! A castle , eh ? " " Yeh , a castle . A schloss . " He placed a peevish emphasis on the word . It may have been a castle to all the rest of the world , but to him it was a schloss . He frowned . He had a round head of which the least part was a negligible brow . Except for this , the features were good and vaguely reminded Peter of those he had seen on the bust of some Roman Emperor ; he could not recall which one . " I suppose that , like myself , you 've deserted business for a while , " Peter ventured . " By the way , my name 's Trunn . Peter Trunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm from Noo York . That 's right , I ai n't in business now . " Peter blinked . Something perplexed hint . The Roman Emperor named James Clark had an anomalous qual-ity , as had also the accent or enunciation with which he spoke . " May I ask what line you were in ? " Peter inquired . " I was in the market , myself . I barely avoided the crash . " " Hardware , " answered Mr. Clark . " That was my line , hardware . " " Things are pretty bad back home now , " Peter commented meditatively . " You said it , " agreed Mr. Clark . But it developed that Mr. Clark 's worldly interest had its entire being in his schloss , and upon this theme he dilated with eloquent variations , informing Peter that although the dwelling was a schloss according to the vocabulary of " Goimany " and " Orstra , " by virtue of this territory now being Italian domain , he should say he lived in a castello . Only , the feller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schloss . These details , however , were unimportant , and finally Mr. Clark turned a pair of black eyes upon Peter , scowled under dark , luxurious eyebrows and said that his schloss had been built by a robber baron in the fourteenth century . This part of his recital he developed most dramatically , his imagination charging over his syllables like the robber baron over the corpses of the slain . " Dear me ! " said Peter . " I 'll have to tell my wife about it . She 's tremendously interested in all that sort of thing . " " Well , " admitted James Clark , the Roman Emperor , grudgingly , " the place has been kind of renovated . It was kind of in pretty bad condition , and the feller I rented it off , feller by the name of Sehwinkler , had it kind of renovated . " " To be sure , " said Peter . " Fourteenth century ! " " It 's all there , all the same , " Mr. Clark assured Peter and himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it , only kind of renovated . I got the robber baron 's suit of armor in the hall . Believe me , boy , it was onehell of a place to get to in them days and it 's one hell of a place to get to now . Way up on a hill . Nothin ' but stones . Steep ? There ai n't a ear made can climb up there ! " Peter exclaimed his astonishment and asked how Mr. Clark ascended to his stronghold . " On a horse , same as him ! " declared Mr. Clark . " Mighty interesting ! " cried Peter . " Mighty interesting ! I wonder if by any chance it 's one of the schlosses my wife 's been visiting . " Mr. Clark guessed it could not be , since he was unaware of any callers having been there . And at this moment Beatrice came fluttering down from the Tappeiner Way , which she had followed out to the Schloss Tyrol and , after an introduction to Mr. Clark , said that no , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she " cover " it ? For unfortunately she had had no chance thus far to " cover " one of those fortresses from which the robber barons had swooped devastatingly down to ravage the countryside . Thereupon Mr. Clark , who in the presence of a lady did not feed so gluttonously upon syllables , enunciated in his best social manner that it would give him great pleasure to let Mrs. Trunn " cover " his schloss ; hut , he went on , the building had been kind of renovated to make it habitable . At this Mrs. Trunn gave a little cry of pity , and her husband soothed her by murmuring , " Fourteenth century , my dear ! " " I go up on a horse ! " said Mr. Clark . This idea comforted Beatrice for her previous disillusionment , and it apparently did not lessen the thrill to think of the extensive Mr. Clark , in a madly checked suit of gray and purple , riding up a hill on a horse . Peter joined his wife the following morning , and they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merano by intervening hills . There they were met by their host . They were to have luncheon in the great hall of the robber baron 's castle . The day was of soft , blue mist , with the mountains and hilltops appearing in brief glimpses of silver radiance through vapors which still were not clouds . Atop the particular hill below which they stood Beatrice saw gray , powerful walls jutting ferociously up through the wisps of bright fog , like the walls of a castle one sees in a dream of medievalism . She could not wait to ascend . Mr. Clark , himself on foot , regretted he had not been able to hire two more saddle horses ; which was just as well , since the Trunns had never ridden in their lives . The expedition set out on the hard upward climb , over a stone-strewn path winding among bowlders and thorny shrubs . They left beneath them the rich green of the terraced vineyards and felt , perhaps , something of the robber baron 's contempt for the lowlands . Humble roofs , crusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwindled away below them into jumbled clusters . The bowlders became more menacing , until at last they passed between two that formed a natural gateway to the brief sward ending at the castle walls . Then Mr. Clark led his guests in beneath a grim iron grating which , he informed them , was called the " portycullus . " This was guarded , against what possible intrusion is not known , by one of Mr. Clark 's retainers , a ruddy-faced , gawky peasant youth whose manner revealed an ignorance as to what it all meant . Mr. Clark , indeed , boasted a small legion of retainers but admitted the difficulty of garbing them in a feudal style that would look convincing . So he had " let it alone . " To make up for this deficiency he hastily introduced the Trunns to themassive suit of mail which bad once encased the robber baron . The jointed fingers of a steel gauntlet had been curled around the hilt of a broad-bladed , two-edged sword , and the baron might even then have been leaning upon his weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lowered visor . " He looks as if he were still lord here ! " Beatrice exclaimed , clasping her hands with a quick gesture almost of alarm . " Guess he ai n't , though , " Mr. Clark chuckled . " Because I 'm that ! " There was a certain charm about Mr. Clark , for all his boasting , his fortissimo clothes , his diet of syllables . The luncheon was indeed a small banquet , served under the stained , raftered ceiling and with the now triumphant sun blazing in through the Gothic windows of leaded glass . Two retainers , dressed in green , performed the magic of invoking the dishes and whisking them away , and Mr. Trunn could not but forget he had a stomach and indulge in the wonders of culinary achievements , to say nothing of the bewildering variety of wines constantly replenished at his elbow . " This is good , " he murmured . " If you do a thing , do it up brown ! " So Mr. Clark stated his philosophy . He too had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wide motions , declaring that he was doing his best to " live up to this here schloss " and that there was nothing in the whole world comparable to the " great feeling " you got from living in the schloss of a defunct robber baron ; and furthermore , by Cripes , he sometimes had the feeling that he was the robber baron himself ! " Oh , " Beatrice protested , " but you would n't be that kind of a man ! You would n't pillage and plunder and kill ! . I declare , this wine 's gone to my head ! " Which was proved by the giggle following the statement and by the enlarged , fumy eyes she turned on Mr. Clark . " Naw , I would n't do anything like that ! " Mr. Clark assured her . " Cripes ? no , nothing like that ! Give me a great feeling all the same to live in this here schloss . Like to live in it rest of my life . Guess I will live in it rest of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here rest of my life ! " Mr. Clark rose from his chair and swung out an arm to embrace every coign in his castle . " Robber baron 's schloss ! " he intoned . " Robber baron 's sehloss ! " He fixed his mellow eyes on Peter Trunn and demanded to be told at once who the hell Trunn had ever met before who lived in a robber baron 's schloss . In all truth Peter could reply that never before had he met such a one . This satisfied Mr. Clark , so that he roared out , " Come ' long ! Show it to you . Show you every dam ' hole in it , garret to cellar  --  dungeon ! Come on ! " So Mr. Clark 's charm , together with his wines , threw a nimbus around the ensuing hours . Until , presently , repletion of food and drink and facts about the schloss overcame Peter , and he thought he would just smoke a cigar on the western terrace ; retiring thereto , he found a reclining chair , stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmed by the sun , was asleep in three minutes . They discovered him in this slumber when the day had begun to wane behind the hills . Beatrice jerked his sleeve and called him a sleepy-head . How could he have had the heart to miss a single inch of this wonderful castle ? And how could he have had the heart to lose a single word of Mr. Clark 's wonderful exposition upon the wonders ? Why , Mr. Clark had recited the whole history of Schloss Beckenschwann , as it was called , but she had n't caught a quarter of it , it was so bewildering ! She would have to go over it all again with Mr. Clark , just as soon as he could accommodate her . " You bet ! " said Mr. Clark . Peter still lay in the mists of wine , through which it seemed to him that Mr. Clark was not Mr. Clark and had no business to be Mr. Clark , but should be , say , the Roman Emperor whose portrait bust he so closely resembled . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His wife , Peter observed , also had recovered ; her present ardor and her sparkling eyes were caused by her interest in Schloss Beckenschwann . " I 've never had such an opportunity before , " Beatrice said as they walked homeward . " Sightseeing can be so unsatisfactory ! I 've been simply rushed through the other castles ! I 'll have a chance to study Schloss Beckenschwann ! " " It 's romantic up there , all right , " admitted Peter , while he made a mental comment that he must retrieve his stomach by abstinence for half a week . " Romantic ! " his wife echoed . " It 's stunning ! " Peter Trunn was eating grapes and somewhat vacantly looking at the other curers on the promenade . He was solitary , for such an opportunity as his wife had found she could not be expected to neglect . A robber baron , in these matter-of-fact times , knocks but once at every door . Beatrice was up at Schloss Beckenschwann . Shc had been up at Schloss Beckenschwann every day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not nearly completed her archeological studies and might not complete them for a month . Each afternoon , when the sun had already faded , she dashed into the hotel , her cheeks burning and her eyes gleaming , and poured into Peter 's patient ear a long , delirious recital of that day 's researches . " I think , " said Peter tentatively , " I shall run over and have a look at the children . You seem to have a good deal still to do here . You wo n't mind ? " She protested that her own yearning to see the children was so strong , she was not sure how long she could withstand it ; but that Schloss Beckenschwann was really a duty  --  in a way  --  since it was a complete study of medievalism ( she was taking notes on every foot of it ) ? and that  --  oh , dear ! the children would have to spare her a little longer ! But of course Peter could go . He must go ! One of them must go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the man to associate archeological research with love-making . His anaemic faculty of imagination could scarcely compass the idea of an historic Italian-Austrian past influencing a present-day American lady 's conduct . Still less would he have been able to conceive his wife  --  she being the sort of woman he knew her to be ? " falling for " Mr. James Clark , who , even though possessing a certain likable gusto , was obviously a social upstart , crude , and not at home in the amenities of the English language . In other words , he would have overlooked the fact that he was dealing with a woman in a very special set of circumstances , and that while to him the Place de in Concorde was just that , and the Place des Vogea just that , and the Castle of Chinon just that , to an intrepid pursuer of ghosts , like his wife , Mr. Clark of Schloss Beckenschwann might lose his material personality and become something or someone else . What , indeed , first impressed Beatrice was Mr. Clark 's total immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwinkler , had , he said , produced a bundle of old records . These , Mr. Clark explained , being in " Med'eval Goiman " he had not himself been skilled to decipher ; but Schwinkler , while negotiations pended , had been kind enough to read and re-read the more melodramatic passages until Mr. Clark had them fairly by heart . He unlocked the bolt of a huge carvcn chest and laid a manuscript yellow with age , and stained so that it resembled a sheaf of autumn leaves , in Beatrice 's hands . " Oh ! " cried Beatrice , standing transfixed , with the past in her hands . Such little " Ohs ! " coming from the lips of an extraordinarily pretty woman whose face is all alight , have sometimes more potency than a long string of words . It is not the intention to show Mr. Clark as the villain of this piece , but there is no denying that he was a man . He had in his favor in the game he began to formulate at that lovely " Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the necromantic spirit of fled centuries . He was , indeed , the most romance-flavored man she had ever met , and she easily saw him as the robber baron , though not as the kind who would wreak violence ; rather he was the essence of robber baronetcy . So , while she fluttered the brown and yellow veined pages , she did not stir when Mr. Clark slid an arm , rather casually , around her waist . Not the least advantage in such circumstances as were arising was the intricate architecture of Schloss Beckenschwann . When it was not her feet that lost themselves along some labyrinthine vaulted passage , up and down short and long flights of stone steps , in and out of low iron-shod mysterious doors , Beatrice 's mind so lost itself ; and she moved physically and mentally in a haze in which mundane contacts , casual at best , such as a brushing kiss , for instance , did not count for overmuch . Which is to say that she is to be absolved of the charge of guilty intention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kisses , abetted by the numberless secret corners of his schloss , became more frequent and less restrained , there always rose before Beatrice an image of Peter , her husband . Yet this VMS curiously unreal and meek and unprotesting , as Peter himself was ; and it was quite unthrilling , like Peter himself these last few years . Accordingly , with a sudden breathlessness , Beatrice found herself abandoned to a strenuous flirtation within the enchanted precincts of Schloss Beckenschwann . From two points of view it was strenuous ; Mr. Clark 's efforts to cap it with absolute triumph for himself , and Beatrice 's struggle to hold it inside bounds , that there should be no regrets . To achieve this , she had often to summon hastily that vision of Peter , or the children , as a medieval lady might have made the sign to ward off the devil . But since Schloss Beckenschwann and its lord had become the only realities for her , this little world contained her only precepts of right conduct ; and very surely Mr. Clark was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Clark mumbled at last in her ear , after a short scuffle punctuated by kisses , in an oak-panelled chamber where the robber baron had housed some guest as perfidious as himself . " My husband , " moaned Beatrice . And as she said it , she seemed to have no husband in this twentieth century . She was a captive of the fourteenth , in the not objectionable power of an indomitable but handsome tyrant . It was , in a word , rather beautiful , if perilous  --  and exceedingly thrilling . Husbands , in such emergencies as this , were merely to be swept aside by Mr. Clark . But also , as in such emergencies Mr. Clark was prey to a complete inarticulateness and forced to make himself understood by actions , Beatrice was abruptly imprisoned in his mighty arms . She fought . He managed to bring out , " Gee , it 'd be great , sweetheart ! " " No , no it would n't ! " she wailed . " It 's so much better this way . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spoil it ! " He dropped his arms and muttered , " All right , if that 's how you feel about it ! Look here  --  this here porcelain stove has got the coat of arms of the Taugau family . The baron , he had ' em put on special . " But Beatrice was in too distressing a whirl just then for further archeology . Mr. Clark 's submission to her will unbalanced her more utterly than his adjurations or even his schloss had done . In his massive lineaments she saw something noble , and she knew that now , finally , she was wavering . " I must hurry home ! " she gasped . " I 'm expecting word from my children . " She said nothing about Peter . For three days she stayed away from Schloss Beckenschwann , not without the greatest effort of will . She would never enter it again . But it seemed to call her to return to its great rooms , on the boards of which trod the solemn feet of the past . Nor was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her resistance came , on the fourth day , in the shape of Peter returned . " Janet had the chicken pox , " he announced , " and they never let us hear a word ! " " But she 's quite all right now ? " Beatrice gasped . " All right enough now , " Peter answered . " Well , then ! " said Beatrice . " You enjoyed the trip ? " " Yes . But I must say , I missed my Merano grapes . " Peter repaired that very afternoon to the Kurplatz , to make up the loss , and Beatrice went with him , clinging wordlessly to the sense of security his restored presence gave her . But it was not long before Peter remarked that something seemed to be worrying her . Her manner was , in fact , not a little distracted . No , she protested , nothing was wrong . Perhaps , Peter suggested contritely , he should not have told her about Janet . " Oh  --  there 's nothing to chicken pox ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounced with the passing of the days , Peter grew worried . This first disconcerted her , and then it angered . She thought Peter an awful fool . He was meeker than ever , absurdly shrunken in her eyes , and irritatingly commonplace . He looked silly , with the drops of grape juice streaking his chin . No longer able to bear the spectacle , Beatrice ran off to mope in the hotel . This defection saddened Peter deeply . He worried over all sorts of things that might have happened during his absence , with the futile gyrations of a dog chasing his own tail . During this , Beatrice , shut up in her room , somberly admitted to herself that she was in love with the master of Schloss Beckenschwann . She wept over this self-revelation and did not know what she was to do . There is a fraternity among the grape curers which develops passing nods into acquaintanceships and these , now and then , into friendships . While his wife was trying to adjust twentieth-century standards to fourteenth-century impulses and flying into hysterical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a contact in the form of an American university professor who had taken a sabbatical leave because indigestion was imparting a sour flavor to his lectures , and who was something of an archeologist . " You 'd be interested in a castle in this neighborhood , " said Peter . " My wife 's been studying it . " And he recounted the tale of Schloss Beckenschwann and its inmate , Mr. Clark . Professor Winslow said that , certainly , he must have a look at that place . It was strange that he should have missed it when he had charted all the ancient pieces in the region . " It 's been renovated , " said Peter . " Perhaps that 's it , then , " said Winslow , sucking on his pipe . " I suppose it 's lost its significance . I hope it has n't been ruined . " He stroked his tawny Van Dyke beard . " My wife says it 's quite marvelous , " said Peter . The professor trusted it would not be too forward to suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , no ! " cried Peter . " I 'm sure she 'd be glad to . " It was arranged . Beatrice resisted the desire to conduct Professor Winslow personally to Schloss Beckenschwann . She admitted to herself her fears . The professor trotted away alone , with the note Beatrice had given him . And with this , for somewhat over a week , the archeologist totally disappeared . It was as if the robber baron had come alive and thrown him into the dungeon-keep . But as Beatrice was still at odds with herself and reluctant to approach Clark upon any excuse whatever , and as her unaccountable mood frightfully upset Peter , the vanished professor was not even mentioned . In the midst of a dismal revery , with unseeing eyes fixed on one of the tall pines of the promenade , Peter heard a voice offering the opinion that he , Peter , was probably an American . When Peter looked up at the wiry man who had addressed him , and acknowledged the fact , the other said , sitting down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you right away . I 'm one myself . " " More English people than Americans around here , are n't there ? " observed Peter . His companion nodded a long sandy head and Peter noticed that his eyes , small and greenish , were really gimlets , " Have I anything to conceal ? " Peter almost asked himself , in alarm , " I guess you stick to Americans ? " asked the man , lighting a cigarette while he observed Peter sidewise . Peter , in his usual fashion , sketched his peregrinations , ending confession-ally , " I do n't really mix very much . Oh , yes , you might say I do stick to Americans , though . " At this juncture the formality of names was exchanged , and then Mr. Henderson admitted that he represented a firm of attorneys " back home " and was searching for a particular American whom he had traced to this general vicinity . The firm of attorneys was McGee , Levy , Levy , McGee , Henderson  --  himself being the Henderson in question . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite finished , Peter exclaimed : " That would be Mr. Clark ! I 'm sure it 's Mr. Clark you 're looking for . " Peter thought of legacies . " Would it ? " said Henderson . " A Mr. Clark  --  what ? " " Oh , yes ! " said Peter . " Absolutely ! That would be Clark , all right . James Clark . Looks like a Roman Emperor . " Some minutes Mr. Henderson consecrated solely to puffing the cigarette . Then he turned a most friendly and confiding eye , not a gimlet at all , on Peter , and stated that he took Peter for one of the most trustworthy men it had ever been his blessed lot to meet ; and that  --  well , there was a mystery attached to Mr. James Clark , if it was Mr. James Clark he was looking for . Then Peter gave a start . Henderson 's last words had crystallized for him what hitherto had been a formless suspicion . Mr. Clark never had , he vowed , seemed a Mr. Clark to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blinking through his thick bifocal lenses . Henderson stretched out his long , thin legs , grinned more to himself than to Peter and asked , ' Not Clark  --  what ? Well then , how would Cozotti do  --  Jim Cozotti ? That fit the gentleman any closer ? " " You mean  --  an Italian ? " Peter thrust his face forward , while his fingers poised a grape on its way to his mouth . " Italian ancestors , " said Henderson . " Naturalized American . Nothing for Uncle Sam to be proud of . " Peter tingled . This was excitement ! " He said he was in the hardware business , " be volunteered . " Hardware , eh ? Ye-es , you could call it that . . . . I 've got to see Mr. James Clark in a hurry , just in case he is Mr. James Clark . Is this him ? " Peter saw the Roman Emperor glowering at him from the photograph Henderson had whipped out of an inside pocket . " It is ! " shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jim Cozotti , " Henderson grunted . " We 'll take him back to America on a large assortment of counts  --  and forging a passport is about the least of them . " " Really ! " Peter darted his eyes about him , then leaned over and whispered hoarsely , " You 're a detective ! " " You 're almost one yourself , are n't you ? " said Henderson , with an admiration too excessive for sterling worth . A remarkable transition now changed him from a smiling man into one with a heavily portentous brow . " I thought I 'd catch him through an American , " he said , " once I 'd tracked him into this district . Had it all figured out just that way . He 's a loud speaker and he 'd look for someone to broadcast himself to  --  only he did n't broadcast the truth . I took you into my confidence , Mr. Trunn , because I 'd kind of lost track of my man and I admit I needed some help . But this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Peter . " Cozotti was a bootlegger , and no mean one , let me tell you . But I ca n't bring him back for that . He 's wanted for murder , and lots of it . He lit out when the temperature back home rose to a thousand . " All of Peter 's amazed soul was in his bulging eyes . " I never ! " he cried . Then he cried immediately afterwards , " Here is my wife ! " Beatrice had come out into the fresh air to escape the madness she had felt coming on her with her solitary reflections in the hotel . Peter was too upset and horrified to remember he was pledged to silence , or to be aware of his wife 's pallor and the drawn and miserable appearance of her face . Or , it is likely that , having taken his wife into his confidence in matters small and large for the past fifteen years , this had become an ungovernable habit with him . At any rate , he blurted it all out then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing from one foot to the other . This was his wife . Mr. Henderson , a detective . And did she dream that Mr. Clark  --  yes , Mr. Clark ! ? was a bootlegger and a murderer ? And that he was wanted in the United States for his crimes  --  yes , yes , of course  --  for murder ! What did she think of that ? His real name was n't Clark  --  it was Cozotti . Murderer ! Well ! " There 's no time to stop and pick up the beans you 've spilled all over the lot , " said Henderson , with much severity . " Now you lead me up tothat Schloss Beckenschmidt and we 'll get him . " " I believe my wife is n't well ! " Peter cried . " What is the trouble , dear ? Are n't you ? ? " She had sunk down onto a bench . Her cheeks were white and a rather ghastly smile curved her lips . " It  --  it is n't true ! " she said , the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Peter , his cheeks beginning to turn white . " It is n't true ! " she repeated . Then she began to cry . A tragic illumination grew brighter and brighter in Peter 's brain as he gazed mournfully at his wife and wished he could comfort her . He was angry with the historic past for betraying Beatrice . Completely forgetful of the presence of the agent of justice , he might have given words to some of these sentiments , had not a familiar figure rushed into view toward him , breathless , and with eyes as protuberant as Peter 's own . It was Professor Winslow . He halted before the group , waved his cane , and poured out another episode , perhaps the most astounding of all , in the annals of Schloss Beckenschwann . " What do you think he 's doing up there ? . . . He 's breaking up the place ! The whole castle ! Chopping it to atoms with an axe  --  one of those battle axes from a wall ? He 's ? ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it all . Who are you ? " The preliminaries were got over to the detective 's satisfaction . It then appeared that the professor had spent the week in investigating the archeology of Schloss Beckenschwaun . He had discovered that , as it were , it had no archeology . " Fake ! " he announced , with a snort midway between the grunt of a pig and the whinny of a horse . " Fake , from top to bottom ! Built by some Viennese actor in 1895 ! Stage effects from CASTLE dungeon to turrets ! That real-estate fellow , Schwinkler , or whatever his dishonorable name is , saw our friend Clark coming , and furnished the robber baron and the family tree , and the records  --  everything ! Renovated ! Ha ! " Another snort . " I should say  --  renovated ! " Another snort . " I thought I 'd do Clark a favor , open his eyes to the fraud ? that had been imposed upon him . Went so far as to get the true records , showed them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped with my life . He was smashing things right and left when I fled . Yes sir  --  I 'm not ashamed to say it  --  I fled ! " " Is he up there now ? " asked Henderson crisply . " I 'm telling you , he 's attacking the masonry ! " The professor foamed , profoundly shocked by Mr. Cozotti 's ingratitude . " Lead the way , " said Henderson . " I 'll get him if I 've got to dig him out of the ruins ! " Peter remained behind with his wife . The afternoon was closing in an exquisite glow and tenderness and silence . The curers , their labor of the day heroically accomplished , had most of them returned to their hotels and pensions . It was the kind of perfect coda to a day , whose music would have been destroyed by any speech . So Peter , at least , thought . He merely took his wife 's hand and sat patiently with it in his own . Then Beatrice , after a very long while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was Janet 's the only case ? " About a week thereafter , on the very day when the Trunns were leaving Merano for Venice , Peter met Professor Winslow on the promenade . The professor had not found it in his heart to forgive the late master of Schloss Beckenschwann , and he related with dyspeptic venom how the detective , with the aid of three lusty gendarmes , had trussed up the murderer , after finding him still engaged upon demolishing the castle . " He 's on his way to America  --  to jail ! " snarled the unforgiving archeologist . " But what do you think he did after they nabbed him ? He yelled that he did n't give a hoot ; only he did n't say hoot , ' I can tell you . He said he was glad to go back  --  would have gone back of his own accord , after what had happened to him over here . Said he 'd break jail and raise the dickens all over again and be worse than he ever was before ! Pretty specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and cried ! " " No ! " gasped Peter . " Yes ! Like a baby ! Said he did n't care what they did to him . Said he could have led a quiet , harmless life in a robber baron 's schloss  --  made him feel great , bossing it in a robber baron 's schloss ; but that now , as it was n't a robber baron 's ? " " Will you excuse me ? " Peter interrupted shyly . " I 've got to fetch my wife . We 're off for our train in an hour . I was very pleased to know you , Professor Winslow . " " Where are you going ? " inquired the bilious professor . " To Venice . My wife wants to look at the art down there , " said Peter . " I suppose , being on the sea , Venice must have had her troubles with pirates in the old days ? " " That goes without saying , " answered the professor , as though Peter were a weak-minded sophomore . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No robber barons down there , eh ? " He waved a hand brightly . " Well , auf wiedersehen , as they say in these parts ! " And he trotted briskly off .
