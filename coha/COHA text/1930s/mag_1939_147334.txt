Three years ago , handsome , curly-haired Fred McClung , 29-year-old pastor of the Highland Park Church of Christ at Fort Worth , Texas , encountered a sore temptation . During the Fort Worth " Frontier Centennial " he met smart little Showman Billy Rose , who told him he would do well in the movies . When Producer Jesse L. Lasky 's Gateway to Hollywood contest set up its sideshow in Fort Worth fortnight ago , star-rapt Parson McClung thought he saw his chance . So did Lasky 's talent scouts , who put him down as the best prospect+ they had found in many a Texas mile . <P> Pastor McClung 's congregation was unsympathetic , kept his phone buzzing with spirited protests . Milder than most was the understatement of red-faced , elderly Elder R. V. Castles : " A preacher would be lowering his aspirations if he sought to become a movie star . " Parson McClung took counsel with himself , finally told his flock he would stay with it . Said he tearfully : " I never intended to do anything wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much leisure time to do church work . I . . . thought it was the proper thing to do , especially when I would start at a salary ranging from $125 to $1,000 a week . " Last Sunday Preacher McClung took his mind off might-have-beens by starting a revival . His subject : " Little Things . " <P> <P> + Michael O'Daniel , son of Texas ' Governor Wilbert Lee ( " Pass the Biscuits , Pappy " ) O'Daniel , did not wait for a contest , went to Hollywood last fortnight , landed a Paramount contract ( TIME , Aug. 14 ) . His Pappy has still not decided whether to let him take it .
