Organized in 1927 to promote mutual understanding between the various branches of the industry , the high-sounding Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences now exists mainly for an annual banquet at which its 700 members can gorge , guzzle and gratify their egomania by awarding prizes for meritorious cinema performances . Last month it looked as if this year 's banquet might degenerate into an open brawl . Cliques in the Academy objected to the six nominations for best performances because Bette Davis , Shirley Temple , George Arliss and others were omitted . The Awards Committee quickly changed its rules to permit members to " write in " their votes , regardless of nominations . Last week , at the Biltmore Bowl in Los Angeles , the Academy banquet went off with no more disorder than is customary . <P> Of the 16 awards , valued by Hollywood purely for the publicity attached to winning them , five went to Columbia 's famed comedy , It Happened One Night ( TIME , Feb. 26 , 1934 ) : production ; direction ( Frank Capra ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Robert Riskin ) . Columbia got two more , best musical scoring and sound recording , with One Night of Love . Best original story was Manhattan Melodrama by Arthur Caesar . Best shorts were The Tortoise and the Hare , La Cucaracha , City of Wax . Best song was " The Continental . " <P> To Cinemactress Shirley Temple went a special gold statuette . Said Toastmaster Irvin S. Cobb : " When Santa Claus did you up in a package and dropped you down Creation 's chimney , he brought the loveliest Christmas present that I can think of in all the world . . . . I 'll give you this , if you 'll give me a kiss . " Said stoic Shirley Temple , up three hours after bedtime : " Thank you . . . very much . " When Claudette Colbert received her prize , she burst into tears . Said Clark Gable : " It 's a grand and glorious feeling but I 'll be wearing the same size hat tomorrow . " <P> Absent from the banquet was Columbia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capra on Lady for a Day , Broadway Bill and whose The Whole Town 's Talking last week had its Manhattan premire ( see below ) . Now 40 , Scenarist Riskin was brought up in Baltimore , attended Columbia University for two years . After 15 years as a cinema director , playwright , free-lance producer and scenarist , he struck his stride with Lady for a Day , has since become one of Hollywood 's highest-paid writers. * He lives at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel , plays expert tennis , writes longhand . Says he : " In writing for the stage there is an enormous satisfaction . . . . Adapting stories for the screen is often a thankless job . . . . " <P> *A crack scenarist like Riskin makes about $2,000 per week .
