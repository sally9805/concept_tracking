Only a few months ago , King Carol II picked a Premier , the late Octavian Goga , who was one of the most arrant reactionaries , Jew-baiters and oppressors of minority peoples in all Europe ( TIME , Jan. 10 ) . Last week the present Premier , <P> Patriarch Miron Cristea , who is well under the King 's thumb , suddenly issued what is for Rumania an enlightened Minorities Statute . Between sunup and sundown one day it gave a new status to 1,568,000 Magyars , 900,000 Jews , 790,000 Russians , 792,000 Germans , 400,000 Slavs , 290,000 Bulgars and 170,000 Turks , who together with smaller groups make up nearly one-third of Carol II 's subjects . <P> It appeared that the King , virtually a dictator , had acted forehandedly to keep Rumania from later becoming the butt of demands like those now being made in Czechoslovakia by the Sudeten Germans . Although Rumania 's fine new Minorities Statute spelled definite progress , it was also an admission of the servile status in which for 20 years Rumanian minorities have been kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time they can be elected without racial disqualification to State and civic jobs . The State will lend its support to public schools where teaching is in the minorities ' tongues . Most priceless boon : Moslems , Jews , Unitarians , etc. may now enjoy full religious liberty in Rumania .
