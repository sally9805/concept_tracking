HELL ! SAID THE DUCHESS-Michael Arlen-Doubleday , Doran ( $2 ) . A trickster in a tricky trade . Author Dikran Kouyoumdjian ( Michael Arlen ) has altered the cut of his books at fashion 's wink . Ladies in green hats are long passes , but duchesses are never out of style . Hell ! Said the Duchess is nicely calculated to tickle the fancy of detective-story addicts , of tycoons tired of trilogies , of all persons except young children who are for the moment sick of being serious . <P> Author Aden 's title is a calculated come-on . The Duchess never finishes the well-known sentence and Author Arlen 's advertised salacious spread , of course , proves a Barmecide 's feast . His brillian-tined tale tells of a young , beautiful , rich but extremely respectable Duchess , a widow who is a model of propriety to less proper peers and inferiors , and of the ghostly suspicion that falls on her when London becomes the scene of a series of lustful murders . <P> Though the Duchess rarely goes out in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . A policeman , perspiring with embarrassment , is about to take her into custody when her intrepid kinsman , a V. C. , risks a fate worse than death to prove her innocence . Author Arlen eventually saves his heroine 's reputation , without materially damaging his own .
