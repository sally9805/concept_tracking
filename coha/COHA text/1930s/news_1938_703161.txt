txt Further modification of the Maloney Over-the-Counter Bill to meet additional objections of the industry appeared certain Monday evening , following conferences between representatives of the Securities &; Exchange Commission and a group of New England security dealers . Spokesman for the group said it would report back to the New England dealers and indicated there would be further conferences with the SEC . Meanwhile , Senator Maloney ( Dem .. Conn. ) , author of the bill , said the Senate Banking &; Currency committee would postpone its executive session to consider the measure until February 22 in order to afford ample time for all interested parties to study and confer on the bill . The Maloney bill would set up a system of cooperative regulation of over-the-counter markets through the activities of voluntary association of brokers and dealers , under governmental supervision . The consensus here is that the bill will be favorably reported by the Senate committee and that although there will be some modifications the committee will not grant municipal dealers an exemption . Should anything develop that would kill the bill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure before Congress providing broad direct regulatory powers over over-the-counter brokers or dealers . The commission will confer Thursday with a group representing the national security traders association .
