Poppa Loeffler pined for the old country . For years his neighbors had heard him talk about going back . There were no jobs for his two strapping boys in Watertown , Wis. , and Herr Hitler 's own agent in Milwaukee had told him about the glorious opportunities in the new Nazi Fatherland . One fine day last spring , with 150 other Wisconsin families , the Loefflers picked up and went . The Fatherland paid all the passage money , every pfennig . <P> In the steel mill at Brandenburg , Poppa Loeffler made good money-52 Reichsmarks a week . The boys , blue-eyed Eric , 20 , and Erwin , 19 , made 31 Reichsmarks ( $12.50 ) each . <P> But Eric and Erwin did not much like the Nazi doctrines preached at them by an uncle : they sounded somehow different from what they had heard in Wisconsin . Then one day the order came to report for the labor corps on October 1 . <P> The Loeffler boys said nothing to anybody , but on August 28 they skipped out of Brandenburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later Germany went to war . <P> Last week Eric and Erwin were back in Watertown and glad to be there . Poppa Loeffler , a veteran of the last war and still young enough to be called again , was still in Germany . So was Momma Loeffler . So were the other 150 Wisconsin families .
