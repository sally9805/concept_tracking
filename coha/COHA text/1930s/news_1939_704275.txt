txt Construction of new homes -- long the weakest link in the recovery chain -- is progressing this year at the best rate reached since 1929 There will be 300,000 new dwelling units constructed in 1939 with a value of a billion dollars , E. L. Ostendorf , president of the National Association of Real Estate Boards , predicted yesterday at the annual convention of that body in Los Angeles . This estimate , based on reports from member boards throughout the country , represents a gain of more than 22% over the 245.000 new dwellings constructed in 1938 and is 42% over the estimated 211,000 homes built in 1937. the previous peak recovery year for general ' business since the 1933 upturn started . Still 25% Behind 1929 However , a 300,000 new home total for 1939 would still be 25% under the 400.000 dwelling units provided in 1929 and would amount to only 40% of the 732.000 dwellings constructed in 1925. the high point in the building boom of the 20 's . This rising level in home construction will continue despite the war , in Mr. Ostendorf s opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a slight upward trend in cost of building materials has become apparent since the war started and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board warns in its October bulletin that increasing demand for labor as result of the war might " bear directly upon the cost of labor used for borne building . " Wholesale prices of building materials as measured by the Department of Labor index have been rising steadily since the week ended August 12 , moving up to an index figure in the October 14 week of 92.5 from 89.5 in the August 19 week , a rise of three points or 3.3% . Cost of both materials and labor rose sharply during the upward swing in residential construction of 1936 and early 1937  --  a factor w ? Ich probably ' helped to reverse the upward movement . Material costs thereafter declined while labor costs continued to climb . Eight Months ' Total Actual number of new residential units during first eight months this year in cities of 10. - 000 population and over is estimated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board at 194,000. a gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Estimated cost of these dwelling units was 5701,000.000 or about 53,600 each as against $543,000.000 for those constructed in the first eight months last year or : 53,900 each . During August there were 28,342 new dwelling units provided in cities of 10,000 population or over , a rise of 20% over July and 34% over August . 1935 Much of this rise ? FLI due to renewed activity cn the %part of the United States Housing Authority which started building nearly 8.000 dwelling units in August at a cost of 527.000,000 . There were 16,100 one and two family houses started in August or 51 ' 7 , of the total . September home construction is believed to have held at about the same level as in August although there is usually a slight seasonal decline in September . Effects of War It appears that thus far the war has not had any serious effect on the volume of new home construction beyond a slight stiffening in the price of raw materials . Whether its effect will continue to be largely a negative one is open to question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then is by no means controlling because of changed conditions now existing . According to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board . residential building suffered during the last war- During the five years preceding outbreak of that war , new home construction here averaged 508,000 units a year . From 1914 through 1916 the average was approximately 360,000 units . In the five years from 1919 through 1923 the annual average was 536,000.
