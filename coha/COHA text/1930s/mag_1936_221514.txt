GUNNAR 'S DAUGHTER-Sigrid Undset- Knopf ( $2 ) . <P> In company with a good many contemporary European novelists , Sigrid Undset has a faculty for making the life of the past appear rich and meaningful in comparison with the involved perplexities of the present . Her three-volume historical romance , Kristin Lavransdatter , pictured a medieval Norway that was brutal and hard , but one in which people fitted into the few simple grooves that society provided and fulfilled their destinies with dramatic symmetry . A prime example of historical fiction , its elaborate documentation artfully grained into the narrative , that book became a best seller ( 204,000 copies ) in the U. S. when it was translated in 1928 , helped win Sigrid Undset the Nobel Prize . But only the most loyal of her admirers were likely to struggle through the long , tedious , devout series of novels laid in the 20th Century ( The Burning Bush , The Wild Orchid ) that followed . Sigrid Undset 's antique figures might come to violent ends , but her unprincipled and purposeless moderns never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of her first novels , was published in 1909 , when Sigrid Undset was 27 . A brief , direct story , melodramatic as the folk tales on which it is modeled , it lacks both the involved psychological analyses that weight down her modern fiction , the realistic details that distinguish her historical romances . Since it is laid in the reign of King Olav , when Norway was undergoing the transition from paganism to Christianity , it also reveals Sigrid Undset 's profound religious feeling , is an early expression of the devotion that was eventually to lead her to write thesis novels for the Catholic Church . <P> A widower , old Gunnar of Vadin had lost his faith in the old pagan gods without accepting the new Christian doctrine that Olav was spreading . In the interim , he " put all his faith in his own strength , " lived to learn that his strength was not great enough . When young Ljot of Iceland arrived at Vadin on a timber-buying expedition , old Gunnar made him welcome , was not adamant when 20-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fatherless , headstrong , impulsive Viking . At 13 he had killed his father 's murderer , become widely known both for his deeds and his songs . When he set his heart on Vigdis he refused all counsel of patience , tact , forbearance . <P> Apparently Icelanders were country bumpkins to sophisticated medieval Norwegians . Without realizing what he was doing , Ljot allied himself with old Gunnar 's enemies , could not visit his sweetheart at Vadin . They poisoned his mind against her . until in the shameful abandon of defeat he made up a song slandering her . Vigdis had been willing to marry him until she heard " it . When she agreed to a last meeting , turned Ljot away forever , he raped her and fled . She bore his child . Gunnar 's enemies taunted him with his disgrace , killed him and burned his house . <P> Vigdis fled with the baby , fell in with robbers , found protection at Olav 's Christian court . To Ljot she said : " May you have the worst of deaths-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And may you see your children die most wretchedly before your eyes . "
