Parents since the world began have taken comfort in the thought that they could pass on to their children not merely the possessions they had acquired , but also the improvements they had made in their minds and bodies . With regard to material legacies , the state has in recent years been taking increasing toll in the way of inheritance taxes . But a far more sweeping " inheritance tax , " Science tells us , is levied and has always been levied by Nature on the mental and physical attributes which we have acquired . For all preconceived notions as to the inheritance of acquired characteristicschanges people make in themselves or which are made in them throughout their lives ? have been shaken by this fact : that our hereditary factors are passed along from generation to generation unaltered by any of our actions or experiences . In other words , every single thing that has happened to you in your lifetime is an utter blank so far as the heredity of your children is concerned ; all the hereditary factors that you could transmit were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were neither added to nor detracted from thereafter . This is no mere theory . It is a conclusion reached by the world 's leading biologists after years of intensive experiment and research , and revolves around the ultimate discovery of exactly the way the very complicated mechanism of heredity works . Biologists have further established beyond question that these hereditary factors of ours consist of infinitesimally tiny strings of living substances called chromosomes ; the chromosomes , in turn , are made up of particles called genes . It is the genes which singly or in groups determine all the innumerable hereditary traits , from the color of one 's eyes to the workings of one 's brain . Since the genes carry all that we transmit physically to our children , in order to pass on acquired changes every change as we make it would have to be accompanied by a corresponding change in every specific gene concerned with the trait affected . Just imagine that you had a life-size , plastic statue of yourself and that inside it was a small , hermetically sealed container filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , that you pulled out of shape and enlarged the nose of the big statue . Could that , by any means you could conceive , automatically enlarge all the noses on all the millions of little statues inside ? Yet that is about what would have to happen if a change in any feature or characteristic of a parent were to be communicated to the chromosomes and thence to the child . Again , if you inherited genes for straight hair , you could have been given permanent waves from the day you were born and still your children would receive , unaltered , the same straight-hair genes you started with . So the binding of feet among the Chinese , circumcision among the Jews , the facial mutilation and distortion among savages , wearing of tight corsets by women ? all the artificial changes made by people on their bodies throughout generations have produced no effect on their offspring , because these practices have not altered the genes . The same rule applies to the mind . Nature performs many seeming miracles in the process of heredity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you took a lecture course or read an informative book and put a new wrinkle in your brain , the mental genes destined to be transmitted to your children would be brightened up accordingly . On the other hand , let us assume that you started life with the very best of mental genes ? factors which might have destined you to be a brilliant person ? but that sickness , lack of opportunity , or perhaps laziness , prevented you from developing your mind . The mental genes which you would transmit to your children would at the end be exactly the same as they would be if you had gone to half a dozen colleges . You may have been beautiful in girlhood , but subsequently through some misfortune you may have lost your looks . Despite that , a child born to you at your worst would receive exactly the same feature genes and have the same chance of being beautiful as it would have if it were born before your looks were impaired . If you are forty , the hereditary factors received by a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those transmitted when you were twenty . Your age has no more effect on the genes you transmit than does your physical or mental state . This is equally true with regard to your husband . If he is seventy , a child fathered by him today would  | be basically no different from a child . of his youth . Or , if your husband is broken in mind and body because of injury or accident , a child fathered by him today would receive herediary factors just as potent and virile if he still had his full vigor . It is true , however , that a parent 's condition may alter a child 's traits , through heredity but through enironment . Thus , a child of old age . at well differ from one born to young parents . Physically it might be - delicate because of the poorer prenatal environment provided by the older mother . Mentally it might be quicker , and temperamentally more high-strung , because of the different type of atmosphere and train-provided by older parents . Very frequently it happens that traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . is especially true of habits . Consider drunkenness . It was long nought that a man who had acquired the drink habit , or fallen victim to - rime or some serious vice , ran the sk of transmitting such habits to children ; that , in fact , a vicious -. habit might even skip a generation and be inherited in later years . All such contentions have now been discredited . While it is conceivable weak will power , and quite proba weak mind , may be inherited , making one an easier prey to bad habits , evidence suggests that , when a son follows in his father 's - : i1 footsteps , it is not heredity but precept and example that are most likely to blame . So interrelated are the forces of heredity and environment that the one can hardly be considered apart rom the other . But there is an important distinction between them . You as a parent have no control -a hatsoever over the hereditary factors that reach your child , unless it be through the selection of the mate who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even then , there is no predicting what the new and singular combination of genes received by your child will produce . In the case of the child 's environment , however , you do have tremendous power for control . Indeed , if you are a mother , you can begin influencing the child 's physical environment as soon as the child is conceived . If your condition is good , the child will begin life to advantage . If your condition is poor , it may start off with a handicap ? in some instances , if a mother has a contagious disease , or has been using drugs , alcohol , or tobacco to excess ? and the possible effect on the child might be extremely serious . Thus , in many cases when a child is born defective , it is not heredity but bad prenatal environment that is to blame . Such congenital conditions are frequently mistaken for hereditary ones , but there is this great difference : A purely congenital condition , acquired through the mother 's influence , can not be passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary condition , even if cured in the child , can continue to be transmitted by the child when it matures . Under normal circumstances , however , the role of the mother is far more limited than is popularly believed . There is never any direct connection between mother and child , either in blood or nerves , and so there is no way by which a mother can transmit psychic influences , thoughts , or " impressions . " The mother 's influence , one must always remember , is purely environmental . Every single one of the child 's hereditary traits ( including its sex , as we explained in a recent article in Good HOUSEKEEPING ) is fixed at the instant of conception . From that moment on , the mother has no more effect on her child 's heredity than has the father . After the baby 's birth both parents join in the environmental molding of the child 's life , both physically and mentally . Here is where the acquired characteristics of the parents can make themselves felt and can frequently be transmitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains to keep physically fit will probably also lead their child into habits of healthful activity . The mother who has always been fastidious about her appearance will undoubtedly tend to have better appearing children than will the slovenly mother . And , while the mental genes that a child receives at conception may to a greater or less degree determine its intellectual capacities , nevertheless , when the parents have been zealous in their own mental development , the child will in all likelihood be stimulated to mental achievement . There are , of course , limits to what environment can do . No amount of training or conditioning can overcome certain types of bad heredity , physical or mental , or lift certain hereditary unfortunates to a normal level . Conversely , even an unfavorable early environment often does not prevent individuals with unusual hereditary endowment from forcing their way up to the top . But everything being equal , it is well to remember that while your child can not inherit any of your acquired traits , good or bad , you do have it in your power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior traits of his own , or avoid harmful ones .  |
