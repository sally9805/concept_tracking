 | WHENEVER parents send a son away to school or college , their chief concern is usually with the human contacts that their child will make in that new and unknown world into which he has departed . They wonder about his classmates and his teachers ; for these , more than campuses and buildings , are to be his true environment , affecting powerfully his present happiness and his far destiny . Every teacher should realize that he has this radio audience scattered in hundreds of homes all over the land . These are the true attentive listeners to what he has to say ; and though they do not hear him now , they will know later what he has said . For he will help to make or break their sons and daughters ; and whatever changes are perceptible in their characters are due in large measure not so much to the knowledge acquired in any course that he may teach , as to the strange influences of sympathy , or the repellent power of its opposite ; to the integrity of the teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should like , as one of the great army of teachers , to tell parents how their sons appeal to us ; to report on our awareness of our invisible audience ; to make them understand that we feel the critical responsibility that is ours ; and to thank them for affording us the possibility not so much to instruct , as to be instructed . For I have long since been persuaded that age can learn as much from youth as youth can from age ; and indeed much more that is radiant and joyous . For thirty years it has been my privilege to be a teacher of boys , but I have learned a great deal more from them than I have taught them . I am obliged to teach a prescribed subject ; they unconsciously instruct me in the vaster field of life itself , permitting me to learn much about the human heart , the generosity and gallantry of youth , the nobility in every human soul , there for the finding , the suppressed tenderness under @#  | the boldest and roughest exterior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this revelation of human nature with the bloom still on it . We have been hearing much lately of the younger generation , and what has been said has , in general , been uncomplimentary . But I have not found that young people are radically different from those of thirty or of twenty years ago . In many ways they appear superior to the men and women of my own generation . For example , they have a sane and wholesome frankness that we never had as young people . I believe they posess all the old virtues , though these manifest their spirit in new ways . Boys have taught me the ludicrous fallacy of the doctrine that all men are created equal . Nobody is really very like anybody else ; and unless every one is treated as a complete original , small progress will be made toward a mutual understanding . The minute we try to place people in groups and treat them as small , conveniently segregated herds , we are in for trouble . People can not be pigeonholed . For example , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each individual . One responds to praise , another to blame . I have taught more than six thousand boys , and never yet have I known one who would react favorably to sarcasm or ridicule . Except against a downright criminal , and one who has a chance to answer for himself , they are cruel and unfair weapons . To be ironic toward the de- fenseless is to fail to apprehend the function of irony . Happily we do not employ sarcasm against children ; and students are intellectual children . It is a great and a legitimate weapon against tyranny , pride , mature presumption . But for a teacher to employ it to lacerate the sensitive feelings of those in his keeping , wounding fatally the sensibilities of those whose good-will and faithful trust determine in part his own effectiveness as a teacher ? against those over whom he has every advantage ? is rather dastardly . The real trouble with sarcasm is that its venom embitters an otherwise gentle and trusting human spirit . I recall a sensitive and high-souled lad whose whole temper was warped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his whole character changed , so that he became hard , mirthless , suspicious , and ironic himself . He had been a lad of exciting promise , but sarcasm literally blighted his heart in its bud . And he never recovered that early sweetness of nature . Not long ago an alumnus , twenty-two years out of school , said to me : " I have but one rankling memory of all my days at the Academy : and that is the recollection of the invective that my teacher of history used . He scared me so , and kept me so miserable , that I never had a chance to learn . And he was the first person who made me lose my faith in human nature . " " Sarcasm , " I once heard a teacher say , " is the only spear that will pierce the hide of a rhinoceros . " But this opinion reveals rather unenviably the teacher 's character by affording us his view of a student . And for purposes of instruction ( as , indeed , for most human contacts ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it leaves no wound to be forgotten ? or remembered . Is there not a power in gentleness of which we have but a faint appreciation ? Tolerance , invincible good nature , patience ? these are worth infinitely more than venom and @#  | violence . It seems to me that the greatest lesson any human being can ever teach is to be charming . And charm and unkindness can never be associated . Of the latter , sarcasm and ridicule are forms . Boys have taught me that there is always a way to reach them . They trust , and they delight in being trusted . They expect nobility of behavior in their elders , and they love it . It is easy for them to believe in greatness , and for them the world is full of heroes and heroines . To kindness they always respond , for it justifies their high , unsullied faith in human nature . I have never met a boy who could not be reached by an appeal to his better nature . Whenever I find a boy who is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair over his work and perhaps his character as well , I deliberately give him a high mark that he does not deserve . The following week he is almost certain to make it for himself . With a sensitive boy ? and it seems to me that all young people are sensitive ? who is discouraged , a word of hope at the right moment may work a positive revolution in his life . If the leader despairs , the whole expedition is liable to be lost . To teach another , one has to understand another , and the study of individuals is a primary requisite to effective work . I usually have under me about eighty boys , and I know that I have eighty distinct human souls , not only diff erent , but even opposed in hopes , fears , ambitions , admirations , and disgusts . How to comprehend these authentic personalities must be my first business before I can hope to impart to them any knowledge , if that imparting is to be of the lasting and effective kind . There are teachers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the martinet sort . Perhaps the method of each is determined by his preconceived idea of students . But one attitude only is of universal appeal and power , and that is the attitude of sympathy . This is the open sesame to the human heart , and it is this alone which makes of the profession of teaching , which otherwise might be the dreariest drudgery , a delight and a consecration . For what a student remembers after he has left the classroom is usually that which is imparted from the heart to the heart , not that which is imparted by the head to the head . IT WAS my privilege to know and to teach John Coolidge and Calvin Coolidge , Jr . , As I think of what these boys taught-me , I recall two incidents that typically characterize their spirit . I learned to know Calvin best not by classroom association , but in our long walks together . I used to take him arrowheadhunting ; he was a keen student of nature , and he loved this hobby of trying to recover something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red man 's relics . But I think he was most interested in every human being we met or happened to mention . This interest came to an affectionate culmination in his adoration of his great father . One day , as we were trudging home together through a heavy April rain , I said , " Calvin , what do you expect to be ? " " I do n't know , " he answered in his quiet yet incisive fashion , " except that I want to be like my father . I do not mean be President . I just want to become exactly like him . " For me and for other parents , here was a great lesson ? this longing of a brilliant and high-spirited boy to be like his father . The Age of Heroes is ever with us , and I think our children naturally regard us with a kind of worship . Perhaps the finest thing in any parent 's life is to merit that worship , and to feel it unchanged by the passage of years . One day , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator should vote to please his constituents or to satisfy his own conscience . A good many boys had something more or less inconsequential to say . Finally John Coolidge raised his hand . He was usually last and usually right ? which makes one wonder at the @#  | folly of modern educators who put a premium on fast thinking . As often as not , it is both shallow and inaccurate . " I think in all ordinary cases , " John 's modest voice said , " a senator should try to please the people he represents ; but if it is a moral question , he must obey his conscience . " I recall mentioning that incident to the President , who fully appreciated its sanity and its sagacity . " I hope , " he once wrote me , " that you will continue to make the boys work hard , and do what you can to make them behave themselves . " Before taking leave of this delightful American family , perhaps it will not be out of place for me to tell a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The incident , I think , typically illustrates her inimitable charm . WHEN our academy opens , one of my duties is to care for parents and to see that their boys are quickly registered . If a boy is accompanied by a parent , I always put him at the head of the line . The first time I ever saw Mrs. Coolidge , she was standing , with her two sons , about thirtieth in a long line . Of course , I asked her t o let me put her boys at once at the head of the procession . " " Oh , no , " she said , smiling in her delightful way . " I would much rather just have them keep their regular places and await their turn . " That incident , so simple yet so full of meaning , has always remained vivid to me . We learn much from parents , as well as from boys . Every teacher of experience has learned the salutary lesson that students silently demand complete integrity of mind . They will not tolerate disillusion through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but merely the trust in intellectual honesty . Too many teachers lack the rugged manliness of Johnson , who , being taken to task for a mistake in his massive dictionary , instead of making an elaborate and disingenuous defense , merely said to his friendly fair accuser , " It was ignorance , madam ; pure ignorance . " Such candor disarms criticism and is more salutary for the soul than a display of knowledge could possibly be . Too many teachers , by evading questions , create a distrust in human nature . No frank admission of ignorance can ever possibly be as damaging , either to the confessor of it or td his audience , as the slightest show of disingenuousness ? a weakness that youth is especially keen to detect . It is a kind of dishonesty , and as such is corrupting . No human mind , so vast is the field of knowledge , should ever be embarrassed by an inability to answer any question . One of the very ablest English teachers I ever knew could never write a page without slips in spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that he never could remember how George I happened to have a claim on the throne of Great Britain . Any teacher of experience knows that questions are sure to be asked him which he can not answer . He has the choice of being candid or evasive . The effect of frankness is salutary ; of evasiveness , defiling . For if a teacher evades , what can we expect a pupil to do ? What these young minds are learning about is by no means mere technical things , but about life itself , human motives , human behavior . And from their technical superiors they expect no less than truth . If a teacher does not know the answer to a question , a frank confession of ignorance is infinitely better than all the parleying and sophistry in the world . Boys are instinctively swift to detect deception and imposture . Having an inherent love of truth , they hate to see it violated . Besides , the teacher who makes an occasional blunder is only revealing his human side ; for , as the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect is merely saying that he is a human being . " Boys have taught me to love frankness , without which there can never  | be mutual confidence . We can trust a man who makes mistakes , or who has forgotten a date or the spelling of a word , but never one who lies . I recall being asked by a boy to give the full name of John Dryden 's father . I told him frankly that I did not know . As I was theft young in teaching experience , I feared that he would lose all respect for me at this confession of ignorance . Years later he said to me laughingly : " I was not sure of you until you said you could not answer my Dryden question . From that time I trusted you . " Another man said to me , long after gradua-tion , " My first idea of the immensity of the field of knowledge came when I learned that even a master of one province of it could not know everything even in his small domain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whose function it is to introduce boys to the classics of literature , it is inevitable that these young men should not sooner or later reveal their preferences for types of women . I think every mother would be greatly heartened if she could really know that her son thinks clearly on these matters , and has a vision of an ideal . I have learned from boys that virtue and modesty have as authentic and powerful an appeal today as in the Age of Romance . A characteristic remark on this subject was that made by a lad of sixteen who had been reading a modern novel , the heroine of which was , to say the least , a very much experienced lady . " I prefer my heroines pure , " he said refreshingly , with no tinge of unction or puritanism in his tone . Even in this age , with so much harsh clangor in its voice , so much apparently radical change in human standards , the old commandments stand . Virtue remains an eternal criterion , and for it there is no substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were obliged to draw my conclusions from my mature friends only , but young people convince me that all is well for the future . The vast majority of them think uprightly , feel with sensitiveness and grace of heart , and prefer their heroines , whether in literature or in life , to be true and good . Man 's destiny is often completely determined by the type of woman he loves . And as long as boys instinctively love the best , the race will preserve its integrity and will advance . There is more hope for humanity in its ancient preference for the good than in all its inventive achievements . MY ALMOST lifelong association with boys has wholesomely taught me that a teacher 's superiority over his pupils is purely temporary and artificial . He sees , almost every day , possibilities in those he instructs that he himself never possessed . Many of them are destined to triumph in fields in which he would fail . In our uncertain world the assumption of any complete authority is perilous , for by such an assumption the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds of the morning . It has long been my opinion that only the deferential teacher is putting himself in one sure way of enlightenment . Though he may be a strong river , his wearying current is revivified by the in-pouring of the fresh streams from the crystal fountains of youth . The teacher who is a patient and a gracious listener will soon discover that his pupils often have a freshness of viewpoint that confounds and at the same time charms scholarship . For example , I have kept a record of the original annotations made by my boys in reading " Macbeth " for the first time . They have suggested more than two hundred admirable emendations that had escaped the conjecture of all the learned editors . Among the general run of boys there occasionally appears a genius ? as much out of place in an ordinary classroom as a wood thrush would be in a factory . How to deal with such a lad is a delicate problem . It has always seemed to me better to leave such a boy alone intellectually , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generalizing ; and as he comes to terms with the individual and not with the class , his perilous responsibility is made clear to him . For to him comes a bronzed Apollo , six feet tall , clear-eyed , intelligent , fearless . But he is far from being the man he appears . Here , the teacher finds , is a sensitive child , waiting to be led by the hand ? either where grow the white lilies of truth and virtue and ancient sound morality , or toward noisome mental growths of poison ivy and deadly nightshade . Sensing his duty as a guide , the teacher is obliged to become essentially a knight-errant . He is forever breaking lances , attempting to unhorse adversaries . His everlasting enemies are the Powers of Darkness , lurking in the shadowy , virginal recesses of the adolescent mind and heart . His daily business is to hunt down and destroy error ; and those who regard teaching as a tame and colorless business fail to realize that this whole matter of education is , in its last analysis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gallant affair ? a part of the great tournament of life . Some champions battle with objective opponents ? with the forces of nature ; against seas , mountains , tides , deserts , and the air . The teacher 's fight is with subjective foes ; with everything that is wrong in thought , reasoning , feeling , motive .  | AM NOT aware that to discomfit error is the main purpose of every profession . In law , for example , the successful prosecution or defense of a case may depend wholly upon the disingenuous conception and pertinacious maintenance of some gross error . In teaching , this can never be so . Being as fallible as any 1 other human being , the teacher is naturally liable to a multitude of mistakes . But it is never his business to dissemble . Truth and Right ? these are the things for which he must constantly contend . And when he finally persuades some doubting childish mind that two and two really do make four , he has achieved a giant victory . That mind will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; within limits , he has determined a human destiny . There is a genuine triumph of principle in that , which , as Emerson reminds us , is the only thing in this world which can bring us peace . You see a teacher , stoop-shouldered perhaps , peering , gentle of voice , self-effacing ? and you are inclined to think him pathetic , futile . You contrast him with some Apollo of the social world , or some Hercules of the physical or financial world . But be not deceived . That same pathetic figure is the grimmest of champions . Daily , almost hourly , in the invisible lists of the spirit his business is to call the gigantic bluff of the Devil . If a teacher is really faithful to his formidable task , no one has a better right than he to say , at the end , " I have fought a good fight . " Teaching is a militant crusade to rout the hosts of darkness and to capture for God the holy city of the human soul . But not only is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error ; he has the privilege of dealing constantly and intimately with the commonplace celestial stuff called human nature ? the stuff of which glory and love and sacrifice are made . He is not forever starving his soul by handling bills of sale , invoices , bundles of calico , crates of prunes . His contacts are with the human spirit . He walks with mystery . His intimates are the heart 's eternal affirmations . His comrades are the hopes and fears and aspirations of others . While he is teaching some particular subject , he is learning from the great book of humanity . Daily he takes the lives of others into his heart . A teacher may be regarded ( if he is honestly a teacher and not a burlesque ) as an agent of God , for it is his function in life to deal with the most delicate and most perfect material , as far as we know , that God ever created . To work directly for and with people for their mental and spiritual advantage is probably the most fascinating task in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , its privileges would remain inestimable . Wordsworth 's doctrine that " the child is father of the man " does not always appeal to a teacher , for while some lives develop according to a mild process of evolution , others undergo revolutionary changes , so that the man is utterly unlike the boy he used to be . Thus I recall Sidney Blackmer , who used to dream in my class and talk North Carolina hunting out of it . I thought he would become a country gentleman . Yet now he is one of the foremost actors on the American stage . I remember how Donald Davis and I used to spend extra hours over the rules for spelling and punctuation . Yet now he is one of the head readers of scenarios in the great studios at Hollywood . I remember a carefree , happy lad , always restless , always joking ; yet now that heart has come to its own ; those hands have steadied ; and almost every day some fellow mortal 's life depends on this great surgeon 's skill . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Fleming , honor him every day I live . We who are teachers are likely to discount the effect of our own influence over our students . Life has too many facets for one contact to be often vital . But when we see a boy we have taught rise , to just renown , we take a happy pride in the mere fact of our having known him in his simple boyhood days . Artistically to create is said to be life 's purest joy ; to watch others create is joy also , especially if the spectacle is that of a once irresponsible boy establishing his own manhood . SAY the teacher 's task is a great one , for it is no less an undertaking than to make the mind and heart aware of the beauty and the majesty of the laws of existence . He has nothing to do with creating either the mind and heart of the student , or the laws of God . But he makes the student conscious of their existence ' and their power . He may even go beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconcile the spirit of youth to them . A teacher is a rising bell sounding in the retired hallways of the spirit . With the dormant soul he must be incessant , provocative , pitiless , but his work is done when the sleeper awakens . Seldom supplying a student with anything , a teacher simply alarms the student with the consciousness of his own power and possibility . Privileged to deal forthright with human nature , a teacher learns of it while he is teaching . He learns that immature minds are astonishingly good judges of character . They are quick to respond to nobility . Their sentiments are lofty and generous . I repeat that I do not find the younger generation lacking in the fundamental virtues . The longer I teach , the more I love human nature . There is an essential nobility in it that , discernible even in children , is the stuff of which immortal spirits are made . Teaching develops one 's faith in the race . Humanity may have a long way to go toward perfection , but we teachers believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is compelled to associate with the human springtime . He lives in a country of April tears and laughter . Always his contacts are with joyous and buoyant and radiant youth , ignorant mayhap , but full of courage and loyalty to the ancient virtues . In the other walks of life , a man grows old with his associates , or with his patients , or with his customers . In teaching , the pathway is always lined with perennials in full bloom . A teacher has no business growing old , and I know many a teacher of fifty who looks like a youngster ? and acts like one , too . Is it not fortunate ? this forced , delightful association with he freshness and beauty of young minds/and hearts , this lingering ( though one 's autumn is due ) in the incredible gardens of a spiritual springtime ?
