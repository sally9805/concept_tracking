SOMETHING ENDS A STORY BY MARK SCHORER HAD come to think that the best I time in life was childhood . I was twenty-five years old then , but looked , I think , more like twenty , with a fresh untouchedness in my face , no lines at all and empty , griefiess eyes , as if I had never really lost my childhood , as if I were still living in it , still a child . Only then , I thought , are you quite free , without care , quite without burden ; and thinking this , I would lapse into a state of reverie in which the world about me wavered into unreality and I would find myself reliving acutely some episode of my youth , not merely remembering it , as something remote and vague , but living it , actually , being in it again actually , joyously going through it like a child gaily wandering across a meadow in the sun , feeling the grass under the bare soles of his feet , feeling the moist earth , feeling too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart the unknown song that a child forever sings . I was , in fact , remembering such a meadow when Jared Smith came to my office for the third time . I was remembering a creek that ran through the meadow , winding and circling and turning , clear water running between steep banks of black earth , with shallow places where you could build a dam . I was remembering a day when I followed this creek to its mouth at the river , remembering wandering all of an afternoon along its banks in the long grass of the meadow , with the earth moist under my feet and the sun warm on my face . Then Smith came in again , looking more grave than before . Of course I did n't take him seriously . Too much of this sort of thing went on all of the time , and you came to expect it . Only most students were less persistent than Smith . This was the third time he had come about it , and I had grown increasingly impatient with him , so that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had , there would still have been the fact that I could do nothing about it . His grades showed a certain average and I had turned that in for him ; now the semester was over and the matter closed . Smith thought that if he could only make me see how important the thing was to him it would be easy enough for me to call someone up and say , " Look here , I 've made an error . Jared Smith should have had a B instead of a C. " For the third time I tried to show him that this was impossible and I went over all of his grades again , and all he kept saying was , " I see that , sir ; I 'm sure a C is exactly what I earned ; but do n't you see ? " Then he launched out into the whole tale again : he was a swimmer and he had given up swimming in order to put more time on his work ; he broke with his fraternity in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that he wanted to give to his studies ; he had sacrificed everything to studying and he had done well in everything except my course , but the C I gave him was enough to keep him out of the honorary society which was the only evidence he would ever have for his achievement . " In high school they always thought I was stupid and I wanted to show them ; I 've got to have the grade because I 've got to show them . You see , sir , they always thought I did n't have a brain at all , and now I 've got to , I 've simply got to ? " For the first time I began to see what an intense person he was , and at another time it might have surprised me , for I had come to think of him as a rather stolid youth . But now I was frankly bored . You read fifty or a hundred freshmen themes every week for ten months in the year and you soon find yourself without much interest in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't pay much attention to any individual 's writing unless the student comes to you and takes it up with you himself . Smith had never asked for a conference , or even for any kind of casual assistance , and , naturally enough , I had paid little attention to him . Now I had gone over the whole matter three times and had tried each time to keep my patience , told him that I did think he was a high B student but that his writing simply did n't show it , that since the middle of the term it had been down to C and less almost consistently . Each time I said , " If you 'd come to me before , we could have gone over your themes and perhaps straightened out your difficulty , but it 's too late now to do anything about it except get the B next term . If you want , I 'll see to it that you get another instructor , that is , if you think you 'd do better with someone else ? " Against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair with me , sir , but that is n't the point . The point is that you wo n't see now how important it is that I get a B. It means more than anything ever has , I 've simply got to get it ? " I said again that he over-emphasized grades , but that even if I did agree that making the honorary society was vitally important , I could n't help him a bit . Finally he seemed to get the point . He looked at me steadily for a long time and then suddenly all the tenseness went from his body and he slumped down in the chair by my desk . He sat there for some minutes , completely dejected , staring at the floor , and at last got up and said , " All right . I 'm sorry I bothered you . Thank you , " and went out . I have n't described him at all or tried to put down much about him beyond the facts of that last interview , because after he went out of my office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this point on , the story is not Smith 's , but mine . Late in the next afternoon a boy whom I had never seen before came rushing into my office . " You know Jared Smith ? " he cried , and I , knowing somehow at once what had happened , feeling everything inside me contract in a momentary spasm of faintness , said , " Yes , of course . Why ? " The boy stood with his mouth open , panting . " Sit down , " I said . At last it came . " His mother sent me . He committed suicide this afternoon . It 's going to be in the papers ? your name too . She asked me to say that the story did n't come from her and that she does n't hold you responsible in any way . " I took hold of the edge of my desk and forced myself to say what seemed to be the most important thing at that moment , " It 's very good of her , I 'm sure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of pain crossed the boy 's blond face . He was quite young , handsome , very distressed . He said , " It 's awful . It 's too awful to think about ! " " Lord , yes ! " I said . " You knew him well ? " He nodded , mutely . " How did he do it ? " " Gas . There was n't anyone at home . His mother was down town at the movies . She came home and found him on the kitchen floor . " " Lord ! " I got up abruptly and walked over to the window , looked down at the campus , and thought of that boy 's body stretched out dead on a kitchen floor and gas still hissing from the stove . I felt myself struggling against something , I did n't know what or why , and wanted to turn round and cry to his friend that I was n't to blame , that nothing in the whole business could touch me . I did turn round , but I spoke quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing is dreadful and please tell his mother that I ca n't say how sorry I am . But of course I 'm not responsible . Any teacher is likely to have this sort of thing happen . Sometimes you ca n't possibly tell which students are hypes-sensitive , which hysterical ? " The Iook in the boy 's face checked me , made me see suddenly that I was trying to defend myself ( and before he spoke I asked myself , " Against what ? " ) , and then he said , " He was n't hysterical . I think you might have seen that he was sensitive . " Scorn came into his eyes before he added , " But no one thinks you 're to blame , " and turned his head away from me . Yet , when he looked back , his face was only sorrowful , his eyes bleached with loss , and when he got up to leave he offered me his hand . I thought for a second that I was going to lose my hold on the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry out a protest , scream that I did n't deserve this and that I could n't be blamed . I thought that in the next moment I should be weeping like a child , blubbering out that protest , and yet , when I took the boy 's hand something else made me cold , almost rude . I said , " Thanks for coming . It was good of Mrs. Smith to send you . I do n't mind the papers ' running the story , because of course no one would think to blame me . Tell his mother how sorry I am . If she 'd care to see me , I 'd like very much to call . " A pause . We looked at each other . His eyes were cold again , chilled by my voice . " Good-by , " he said , and fled out as he had come , half-stumbling . When you are young , I would keep thinking , remembering , you are free . I would think in the next three days ( at night especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to face such things , and that is the best time surely  --  when you are young and free . Waking in the night suddenly , in fright , feeling the presence of that boy in the room , lurking in the shadows somewhere , in the hiding dark , I would remember such an incident as this : I am quite young  --  six or seven , perhaps even ten  --  and after supper one evening ( it is summer ; in the marshes by the river the frogs are setting up their monotonous croaking , soothing , comforting , a steady sound in the night that stabilizes the dark and makes it a friend ) I leave the family assembled at table and go into a little-used parlor . I must be very tired  --  from a day of wild running in the bright , protecting sun  --  for I lie down on a sofa in the dark of the parlor ( and this I seem never to have done before ) , and in the sleep that follows I hear voices and confusion and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the voices are like the croaking of the frogs  --  comforting , stabilizing the darkness , making of it a friend one need not fear  --  and I do not wake for a time , until suddenly , abruptly , I am snatched out of sleep and I find myself in my father 's arms , hungrily held , and then in my mother 's ( and she is weeping with relief ) and I see the faces of my brother and sister , looking at me with something like awe . Then slowly I awake , I see more people in the room , and I know that outside the house half the town is assembled . Then , from a mixed report from the whole family ( breathless , broken , excited , relieved , all of it mingled with weeping and laughing , with kisses and quick embraces ) I gather that I have been lost , that the whole town has been aroused , that for the two hours I have been asleep in the little-used parlor ( where no one thought to look beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been going on . Then all of us go out on the front porch and I am shown and I say , " I 'm found , " and the whole thing delights me immeasurably . My mother , who has felt the burden , still weeps beside me , remembering suddenly , in the midst of her happiness and gratitude , her fright . This was no new memory , suddenly recollected . It was part of a childhood that I lived with constantly , a retreat into which to flee , always there , always somehow adequate , where the memory of lying in a sun-bright meadow with the steady drone of bees in clover in my ears was enough to soften any blow and make it ineffectual . And so now again , in those three days , those three nights especially , i found myself , inevitably , without will , going back , not searching and yet remembering . I remembered this ( lying in my bed , with the ghost of that boy somewhere in the room , powerful against me ) : Another summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy with pollen dust , and I am walking with an aunt to the cemetery , a mile out of the village . On the way , we pass a field of buckwheat , and my aunt stops in the path for a moment to point it out to me . " Buckwheat , " she says , her arm lifted , and moves on , the flower-filled basket on her arm swinging a little as she walks , bumping now and again against her hip . At the cemetery we attend to the graves of relatives , snipping grass with the shears from the basket , pulling up weeds , arranging flowers under white headstones pink in the low summer sun , and when we start back to the village , it is evening , almost dusk . The air is very quiet now and cooler , the dust of the day settled . Once more we pass the buckwheat field and now , with a start , both of us smell in the air an incredible sweetness . We stop again and breathe deeply the per fume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes , breathing in the heavy fragrance  --  and then move on toward the village , marked now in the dusk by a dozen yellow-lighted windows , friendly , home . But now , in the three dark nights , these memories were not strong . In the struggle that went on between the part of my brain that brought them up and the part that knew the boy was in the room , a thin ghost , pale , unhappy , accusing , the memories lost , until , on the third night , I found myself abruptly awake , sitting erect in my bed , perspiring , a scream that must have been mine echoing in my ears . In my fright I knew that I was utterly helpless , that there was no escape from it , nothing with which to fight against it . Then slowly , my fear ( and what was I fearing ? ) ebbed away , and I lay down again in the darkness and thought that now the boy was buried and that on the next day I would call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes ? the themes I had not dared to read again for fear that now I should see in them a whole ( or even half-run ) cycle of hysteria that I had missed before , perhaps from careless reading  --  and then I should be done with the whole thing . I fell asleep again . And next morning the years of my childhood were still with me , a golden aura , beautiful but , now , very far away . Now I remembered winter nights before the fire and the quiet sound of my father 's voice reading aloud , but I remembered them only , as one remembers an image or a picture , as something one looks at from afar , not as something one is actually in , actually living . I remembered a pool where one fished for sunfish with a bent pin , a path leading up over a birch-covered hill and down to a strip of sandy beach by the river ; but now , in these memories ( like pictures ) there was something distant , far , something remote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew itself for what it was , there was the threat of the end of something . It was afternoon . It was time now to go to the mother . Twice I had taken the rubber band from the packet of themes , twice brought myself to the point of reading them , but now , having decided , I stood by my desk and snapped the band firmly on the papers and thought , I will not read them . I will return them to her now and then I shall be done with this thing forever . I thought that if I read them and found nothing there  --  I remembered a theme called " War " ( Jared Smith had been a pacifist ) and another called " My Religious Views " ? then I should be free and certain . But if I did find something there , some growing hysteria , some increasing despair ( what had he said in the theme called " My Religious Views " ? ) then I might never be free . And I decided that I would rather be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to forget . The mother let me into the apartment herself . She was a large woman , heavy and strong-looking , standing before me in the dark hall a great hulk of strength . I told her who I was and she said , " Oh-h-h , " with a kind of long sigh , and then , " Please come in . " The room was all shadows and through the windows I could see the gray beginning of the winter evening . The woman pulled a chair out of a corner and said , " Please sit down . " Then she lighted a lamp so that the light fell on my head and face , and she stood over me , looking down , and said finally , " I did n't think of you as such a young man . I thought of you as somehow older . From Jared 's accounts I thought that you 'd been teaching for a long time , that you 'd seen years of such service . He felt at the end that you were treating him perfunctorily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a human being to you  --  any longer . But that could be true of the very young as well as of the older , could n't it ? " She smiled then and sat down across from me , her eyes quizzical , interested . It was almost as if I had come to have casual tea with her , as if in a moment we should begin to talk about poetry . Her composure as she sat there made me feel my weakness . I said , " Try to understand . We meet perhaps a hundred students a week , and we read a hundred themes , and it 's awfully difficult to do much with them individually . Especially if they do n't come to you . He never did , you know . Naturally then I knew him almost not at all . " She leaned forward , concerned , apologetic . " Oh , I do understand that  --  quite ! I did n't mean ? " " No , of course not . It was awfully good of you to send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blow ? if I 'd just read about it in the papers or heard about it suddenly without some warning . " " Yes , " she said . " I knew that . " " I 've brought his themes . I thought you 'd like to see them , perhaps want to keep them . I ca n't tell you , really , how upset I am about this . " " But , child , " she said , smiling again , " I know you 're not to blame . I know you could n't have done anything about that grade . I told Jared so ? " " It is n't the grade , " I said . " It 's not having known him . It 's not having seen in him the possibilities of the kind of hysteria that must have been behind his suicide . I should have seen that  --  if it was there . I certainly did n't . And now I do n't know if it was there or not . I have n't had the courage to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it might be . . . . Here they are . " I leaned forward and gave them to her . She put them in her lap and folded her hands over them . I could see how calm she was by the steady rise and fall of her bosom , by the quiet hands in her Iap . Outside it had begun to snow very lightly . Through the window and the thin veil of snow I could see across a gray field to a bare tree standing beside a wooden fence , its empty branches reaching up into the dreary sky . I felt myself wavering away from the room and the woman across from me , to another tree in another place , an elm this , heavily laden with leaves , with great strong branches , with white-clouded blue sky above it , and high in the tree somewhere , a platform with a child  --  but how far away the child , and how strangel  --  lying on his stomach , reading , idling through pages of legend , lost in the pages of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the almost mythical intricacies of branch and green , green leaf . But the woman 's voice wove itself into the myth ( for now I knew that it was a myth , an impossible legend , a dream of bliss that had never been , that could certainly never be again ) , drew my mind back from the imagined tree to the real tree and the dreary landscape outside , back to the shadowy room , and back to her hands , symbols of her strength and quiet . She was saying , " . . . and of course , you must not let this disturb you , it might have happened to anyone . It was by the merest chance that it should have happened to you . I hope that you will be able to see it that way . . . " " Yes , it might have happened to anyone else . But someone else might have seen what I failed to see , might have thought of Jared Smith as a person who was living too , who was alive , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , with desires and a life to live . . . . " ( Oh , the green of the tree , the fabulous strength of its branches , and the lost child lost in the legend ! ) . . with a home to go to and a childhood to remember , with burdens to bear ( but he bore themr ) and a manhood to come to ( but he came to itl ) . . . for if Jared Smith had ever had a childhood , he had put it behind him ; if he , now and again , had escaped into the marvellous dream , he knew that it was not that dream that he would meet in the hissing gas , knew that in breathing in those fumes he was not losing himself in an impossible bliss but was taking on his burden , coming into his manhood . . . . The quiet voice again , " . , . always unstable , really , highly-strung , neurotic , I suppose , taking his disappointments terribly hard . . . no sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always feared . . . . " Outside , the barren tree was lost in the winter evening . I got up to go , said , " I think I must go now . It 's quite late . " The mother rose with me . She put the packet of themes on a table and walked into the hall with me . I struggled into my coat . Then she put out her hand . " Thank you for coming , " she said . I took her hand . It was cold . I said , " You 're quite wonderful . Your strength , your composure  --  I ca n't help admiring you . " I felt her hand tighten in mine , heard her voice struggling to speak , and then , in a sudden , fearful sob , heard her voice drowned in grief . Her whole body shook in a spasm of weeping as she sat abruptly on a little bench in the hall , weeping violently , sobs torn from her body with a fearful violence . She clamped her hands together between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , spoke between her sobs , " Oh-h-h , " ( the long sigh , tragic now ) " I loved him , I loved him . . . you do n't know , you do n't know . . . there have been terrible moments . . . you do n't know ! " The weeping of a frail , small woman I could have borne . But the racking violence of the grief in this woman , large and strong , as she sat rocking back and forth in the gloom , was more than I could bear . For a moment I had an impulse to throw myself at her feet , to share her grief , to weep in her arms with the same violent sobbing , to relieve myself as a child does in exhausting tears . But the second impulse was to flee , to leave her behind , to avoid at all costs the confession that tears from me would mean . For I was not to blame ! I did that . I opened the door and went quickly out . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head tip , so that the wind would strike my face and tears could not come . Blindly I ran through the streets , in no direction at all , and ran until I was exhausted , until my feet dragged reluctantly along and yet would not stop , would not try to find the way . I pressed my eyes shut against the wind , reeled sometimes like a drunken man , stumbled through little drifts of snow that the sharpening wind was piling across the sidewalks . It was cold , I knew , but I was not feeling the cold ; and the wind was biting , but I did not feel the wind . My body was an empty place and in my brain was only the picture of the grief-stricken mother and in my ears the violent sound of her sobbing . I came at last to a church , and saw it , dark , towering up into the sky , blacker than the night . For a moment I stood looking up at its great doorway and its steeple , and then , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down in the wide stone doorway , out of the wind now . I had never been in the church , but out of some remote time I was remembering nuns moving quietly across an altar , lighting tall candles , suffusing the white , glistening altar with a luminous warmth , giving to the stone images of pedestalled saints a soft , deceptive life . I had never knelt in a church , but now I thought that if I went in and knelt on a rail worn into grooves with many kneelings , if I could bury my head in my arms and empty my ears of the sound of weeping , I should find a penitent 's peace . Then , over and over , I began to say , " God , I am not to blame , God , I am not , I am not .. . " but no such peace came , and I wondered in despair what I should do with the burden of this blame , which was not mine but which I could not lose . I thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I could go in there and confess , and be forgiven , then I should he free again . Confess ! Confess ! something cried to me , some voice from the lost years , from the fabulous tree , from the fires on winter nights , some voice that came like the wind , sweeping across the sunny meadows , rippling the water of a child 's dammed creek , Confess ! If I could confess , pour out my sins , empty myself of the pain of this load . . . if I could ! Confess ! Confess ! the voice whittled , blowing through the branches of the unknown , the mythical tree , driving great billows of white cloud over a dream-blue sky . But what ? Confess what ? I called hack to the voice . The voice answered ( sadly now , soughing through the tree 's branches ) , Confess . .. confess .. . But what , what ? Then , like an echo , weakly , from afar : Confess .. . Yes , yes , but what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the branches of the tree are bare and still , no longer the voice like the wind in the marvellous tree ! ) and the silence tore me from the madness of that hoping dream . I sat in the doorway , oblivious of the cold , of the wind , straining forward , trying to hear an answer . But there was none and , suddenly ashamed , sobered , I leaned back against the door , wearied with hope . Something was ending . The desire to confess , the urge to relieve myself of the heavy burden  --  what was it but the flight into youth , what but imagining that tree with its wonderful foliage that had never been ? It was to say , Oh , take from , me this burden which I am not strong enough to bear , because I am a child and weak ! And that was like saying , Let me be a child so that I need not be strong ! But the tree was dead , its branches bare , and all the lost years were dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Then something had ended . I stood up and went down the steps . The wind , sharper now than ever , came with a blast up the street , sweeping the snow before it , striking me sharply , keenly in the face . I stood still in the empty street and let it blow at me , blow through me , blow the ashes of the years away into the dark sky . Then I started back through the cold night , shivering now , but resolved ; resolved to find the way I had come and the woman 's house . Something had ended , and now I could go back to her , fearless , and say that the blame was mine and that I took it , that , like her son , I had found a place to lay the burden . The wind blew strong , scattering the years across the sky .
