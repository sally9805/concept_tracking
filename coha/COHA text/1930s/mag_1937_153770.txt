If , for two successive Sundays , every family in the U. S. had a wild duck for dinner , the wild duck would be as extinct as the passenger pigeon . In 1886 the same number of U. S. citizens could not have extinguished the wild duck population if they had eaten duck for a fortnight . But ducks had already begun to decrease and it was in that year the Bureau of Biological Survey was created to study U. S. wild life . As the Bureau grew bigger , the U. S. game bird population grew smaller . <P> The Bureau , tottering along on meagre appropriations , had not been able to make much progress in the direction of Conservation when , in 1934 , President Roosevelt finally gave ear to the agonized howls of 7 million sportsmen . He appointed a Committee on Wildlife Restoration . The Committee promptly recommended that $25,000,000 be earmarked for the restoration of lands suitable for wild life preserves . It was not forthcoming , but famed **26;7545;TOOLONG Jay Norwood ( " Ding " ) Darling passed the hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U. S. Biological Survey , had managed to scratch up $8,500,000 . From o.ther sources a total of $21,000,000 was finally obtained . In Denver , at the annual convention of the Western Association of State Game &; Fish Commissioners , Ira Noel Gabrielson , rotund present chief of the Survey , hefted himself to his feet to explain what had happened since his bureau took the money , largely drawn from relief and work-making budgets , and really moved into action . <P> Said he : " Already we have more than 3,000,000 acres in States like the Dakotas and Nebraska , which were once the normal breeding grounds for the dm 5 , which we are restoring to the natural state of marshland . We have already spent $20,000,000 on the program . Ultimately it will cost about $50,000,000 . ' ' Goal : a minimum of 7,500,000 acres of Federal duck preserves . <P> Drainage of U. S. breeding lands had another effect . It left those regions completely vulnerable to floods and droughts . Flood and drought control measures now-being executed with CCC and WPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck grounds , and vice versa . Principal engineering problem is to impound and regulate waters in rivers , lakes , marshes . Equally important is the planting of trees to help prevent erosion . Thus in the past three years 200 duck refuges have been created on previously useless land . Last year , for the first year in many , more ducks returned to the breeding grounds than in the previous year . <P> Until last week the Bureau 's 7,500,000-acre program was largely a hope in the heart of Mr. Gabrielson and fellow duck shooters . One sure source of income was from the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act of 1934 . In its first two years that brought about $1,000,000 . Then , after much dallying . Congress unanimously passed the Pittman-Robertson Federal-Aid-to-Wildlife Bill to appropriate to the various States the 10% excise tax on sporting arms and ammunitions . It assured the program an annual $3,000,000 as a friendly President signed it at Hyde Park last week .                   @ @
