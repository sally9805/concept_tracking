However , in her ignorance , she let the " Mr. Goliath  --  the man who wheels opportunity pass . As she gathered up him about . Of course I do n't know if the innumerable ash trays and collected that 's his real name , but that 's what the pencils she merely looked rather the Colonel calls him . And it 's very wistfully out at the chestnuts in bloom suitable , do n't you think ? Such a on the Common , and thought how monster ! " " Very , " Miss Smith agreed . " But the Colonel never complains . Never . Never . He 's such a good man . So patient . " Miss Smith , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more sympathetic . " Has he always been like that , Mrs. Jefferson ? " " No  --  not always . " Mrs. Jefferson 's voice was suitably bushed , but her eyes sparkled , for she saw that at last she had a clear run for her story . " Come and sit here , my dear , and I 'll tell you about it . It 's a very very sad affair . " Miss Smith patiently sat down and waited . " Colonel Meryon is a very distinguished soldier , " Mrs. Jefferson proceeded , " I do n't know how many times he was mentioned in despatches , and they say that he ought to have had the V. C. at least . . . . Put another coal on the fire , will you , my dear . .. . Anyhow it was at Hill 60 ? I dare say you 've heard of Hill 60 ? that the terrible thing happened . There was an attack . The Colonel was at the head of his men , sword in hand , leading them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket too ! " Miss Smith suggested , getting quite excited . " I do n't know anything about the bombs . " Mrs. Jefferson was not too pleased at the interruption . " But I am quite certain he had his sword . Up over the crest , they went and down a steep hill , then just as they got to the bottom , a mine exploded and blew them all to bits ! " " But not the Colonel ! " " No , not the Colonel  --  but he never recovered . He had lost the use of his legs . It was the shock , they said . " " Oh , poor man ! " " Yes , but that was n't the real tragedy . " " Oh , there 's more ? " " Yes , they brought him home and they never expected him to live . He had a house in the country then , a few miles out of Bath . And my cousin Agnes volunteered to nurse him . Of course she was n't really a nurse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . But she was absolutely devoted to him . " " Did she think he was going to die ? " " Certainly not . She saved him , gave him something to live for . We were all so delighted when we heard they were going to get married . Agnes was such a capable woman , and it was such a comfort to think that he would have someone like that to look after him . . . . But then . . " But then , I suppose , she found she could n't stick it , " Miss Smith suggested brightly . " My dear , really you must not interrupt  --  especially if you are going to say outrageous things like that . " There came a deep gurgle in Mrs. Jefferson 's interior , a distressing thing that always happened to her when she became indignant . However , she sat very upright and continued : " Agnes never deserted anyone . She was a very exceptional woman . I simply can not tell you what she did for that poor man  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman can do . A most devoted couple . Really touching to see . Yes , for two years they were very very happy . . . and then ... Oh I really can not go on . " " Oh , please do , Mrs. Jefferson . " " Well , it was one day at lunch , " Mrs. Jefferson just touched her eyes with her handkerchief . " The Colonel was sitting in his wheeled chair at the table , and Agnes was at the sideboard , near the French window , carving  --  she always waited on him herself , you know ? Then . . Oh , my dear . . . before his very eyes a man crept up to the window , And before he knew what was happening , he had darted in and stabbed her  --  dead , with her own carving knife . " " Oh , I say ! " Miss Smith at last was moved . " That was pretty horrible . " " Horrible ? It was too awful . Think of that poor man , helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what he must have suffered ! " " It was nasty for Agnes too , " Miss Smith observed . This rather took the wind out of Mrs. Jefferson 's sails , and Miss Smith went on : " But what did the man do it for ? It seems so silly . " " It was an escaped lunatic , my dear . They caught him afterwards . Quite , quite mad . He did n't remember anything about it . " " And was he hung ? " Miss Smith asked eagerly . " Hanged , please , Miss Smith . No , he was not hanged . He was sent to Broadmoor . " " Oh , I say ! And the Colonel did n't die even after that ? " " No . But he has never " ? Mrs. Jefferson sighed ? " absolutely never been the same man since . " " I should think not ! " Miss Smith put her head on one side and considered for a moment all the strange things that could happen in life . Then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her story , and as some suitable comment appeared to be called for , she added : " Funny after all that to end up by just playing bridge ! " Mrs. Jefferson stared at the girl . What possessed me to think she would ever do as a companion ? she wondered . She does n't even seem to know the rudiments of her place . She was , in fact , just on the point of saying something rather sharp to Miss Smith , when the door burst open , and Rawlins , who ought to have knownbetter , dashed in in great distress . " Oh , mum . . a terrible thing has happened . . . the Colonel ! " Goliath , having closed the door of Mrs. Jefferson 's room , put on his bowler hat from behind , just like Mr. Robey , and proceeded to steer the chair down the stairs . It was not one of Goliath 's good days , and he bumped the chair at most of the corners on the way down . Colonel Meryon , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition exposed him , and he made no complaint . Not that he was the good patient man that Mrs. Jefferson supposed him . In spite of his charming manners , he was n't even very tolerant of Mrs. Jefferson herself . Silly old trout , he was thinking . Always puts me at her table , and she plays like a fish . Rawlins was at the door , holding it open , and she said good-night both to him and to Mr. Goliath . A moment later Goliath lifted him into the big bath-chair that was waiting , and proceeded to attach the neat little wheeled chair , in the usual way , behind it . " Lovely evenin ' , Colonel , " he remarked as he did so . " Yes , a very beautiful evening , " Meryon agreed . " Win any money , sir ? " " No , I lost . " " Well , that 's too bad . Had a bad day meseff at the races . . .. However , we 'd better be getting along . " As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that he would like a turn in the fresh air before going home . " I think we might go back through the park to-night , Goliath . It 's such a very fine evening . " " Oh , we ai n't hardly got time for that , sir . " " But it does n't matter if we 're late . " " Do n't it ? " Goliath snorted . " Mrs. sharp outline of that tense moment Meecham 'll blow my head off if I do n't before the attack  --  hearts beating even have you home in time for dinner . " louder than the deafening roar of the With that he gave the bath-chair a barrage . sharp twist , away from the park , and Of the attack itself there was no proceeded towards the sepulchral si picture .

Must n't sit in a draught . . . a mere etching of a sane world with Not a nurse , not a wife , but a wardress. fixed values . And it was also a stab Even now as the bath-chair trundled of pain .

And finally the For be had always been a martinet in his regiment , and his word was law . But he had been delivered helpless into the hand of Agnes . Whenever they had servants soft enough to give him the little things he wanted , or keep up the pretence that he could still command , Agnes , on some pretext or another , always got rid of them . And yet to the outside world her tyranny appeared to be devotion . It was terrible the vengeance that life could take ! Must n't read too much ! Must n't sleep too long ! Must n't sit in a draught ! Sometimes when he was alone , it had made him cry like a little schoolgirl , for he was too proud to ask for mercy , and his quiet requests were just brushed aside . And the way she cut a ham ! That might have seemed to have been a small thing , but to the cripple it began to assume gigantic proportions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of religion with him . In the Mess he used to take young subalterns aside and show them how to slice it into thin transparent flakes , and woe betide them if it were ever half a millimeter too thick . But Agnes cut it like hunks of bread ? and they had it every single day for lunch . He had tried to teach her how to do it , but she told him not to be fussy . He had begged to be wheeled up to the sideboard so that he could do it himself , but she told him that he must n't tire himself . Only on special occasions , when he had been very good , was he allowed to sharpen the knife ! Thus one day in May , for the hundredth time , they had sat down to their servautless lunch of ham and salad and cheese . It was a heavenly day , and the French windows by the sideboard were flung wide open on to the vivid green lawn outside , separated only by a stretch of crazy paving from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharpener were atthe Colonel 's place at the table , for they had a new servant who did the little things he wanted . Agnes pushed his chair up to the table , handed him his napkin in case he might forget it , then went over to the sideboard to carve the ham . " Tchah , " she made a querulous sound with her tongue and teeth . " That fool of a girl has forgotten the carver . " " Here it is , my dear . " The Colonel had just picked it up to sharpen it . Agnes came over briskly to take it from him . " I 've told her dozens of times not to put it there . " " But do n't you think it wants a little sharpening , my dear ? As it is here , could n't I ? . . . " The Colonel was reluctantly parting with his prize . " Nonsense , it 's quite sharp enough . You 're getting very fussy , Michael . " Her back was turned and she started carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot lunch for a change , my dear ? " " I thought you said you liked ham . " " So I do , my dear . . . All the same . . . " " Of course , if you want the servants to give notice . " " Very well , my dear . " He realized once again that revolt was useless . " Just the merest flake for me , if you please . " A moment later she came over with his plate and put it in front of him . Great slabs of ham cut anyhow ! He stared at it as she turned back again , and started to carve for herself . The blood was mounting to his face , and his hands were clenched . It was intolerable . Intolerable . . . . Intolerable . For a second his helpless fury increased to a climax , then suddenly he realized that he was standing upstanding up after all these years . It seemed like an hallucination , but he took a step forward , and his legs supported him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tottered forward up to Agnes , stiffly , like a robot . She never saw him until he was right on her , then a deadly fear paralyzed her . She could n't move or cry out . " Great slabs of ham ! " she heard him mutter . " I 'll teach you ! " Then he took the knife from her lifeless fingers and plunged it in her breast . For three eternal seconds he stood looking at her as she lay on the floor . Blood , he was thinking , but not on me . And it 's better than some poor harmless German peasant . Then he hobbled back to his chair again . For half a minute after that he sat staring fixedly out of the window . " My God ! " he murmured , " I 'm cured . . .. And now I 'll always have to be a cripple ! " And quite suddenly he began to scream . The fingerprints  --  his and hers  --  were so confused upon the knife handle that they told no tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told how he had himself sharpened it . The crazy pavement could not retain a footprint in that dry weather , and the Colonel managed to mutter , over and over again , that the man had not come across the grass  --  he would have seen him in that case , and so would Agnes . He had suddenly leaped in through the window from the paving . And there was an escaped lunatic aboutMeryon simply repeated the description he had read in the newspapers . It all seemed very probable , especially as a few helpful and deluded people at once imagined they had seen the man near the house that morning . When caught , the lunatic insisted that he was Charles the First , andtalked a great deal about the Divine Right of Kings , which did not help the police to trace his movements on the day in question . However , a half-solved mystery was better than one that was not solved at all , and in the end they duly put him in Broad-moor , although the experts insisted that his insanity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel and certified that he could not possibly have done it . This was for the private information of the police , and was not made public , for nobody dreamed , except one skeptical inspector , that the Colonel could or would have done it . Meryon himself felt that he was lucky in that it had happened in the twentieth century . In a less enlightened age they might have stuck pins into him until he gave definite proof that he could use his legs : but as it was , they confined themselves to scientific methods , and he escaped . Escaped ! It was an odd sensation . About Agnes he had no regrets . He felt that the manner of it was more merciful than she deserved , and he would have done it again , even if he knew he had to swing for it . For the lunatic he did feel rather sorry , but he consoled himself with the thought that one asylum must be very like another , and that anyhow he probably imagined that Broadmoor was the Palace of Whitehall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks that followed was how long he would have to wait before he dare show that he was cured . Six months , he thought at first . But when the end of the six months came , he put it off . Must n't be in a hurry , he thought , must make a job of it . And he decided to wait till the year was up . Meanwhile at dead of night he sometimes got out of bed , and hobbled round to see that the precious nerves were still alive . He knocked over a vase one time , and was nearly caught by Mrs. Meecham , which made him more careful than ever in future . The strain of this assumed immobility was almost unbearable at times , but when the end of the year came he still felt it was too soon . He could n't make up his mind whether it should be a sudden cure or a gradual improvement . It was all so difficult to stage . Better wait a little while longer . Another six months . . . another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Now it was already five years since the date of his crime . Goliath and Mrs. Meecham had grown almost as tyrannous as Agnes , and he was still a prisoner in the cage of his own making . Would he never escape ? Sometimes he thought that he never would . Sometimes he made plans . St. Andrew 's Church and Margaret Buildings . Brock Street and the Circus . . . . The bath-chair was just bumping up on to the pavement as they crossed the road into the Circus , when he suddenly came to a decision . " To-morrow --  -- yes , I must make a start to-morrow . " He had made resolutions like that before , but this time he felt that he meant it . The rooks were cawing in the four magnificent trees in the center of the Circus , and up on the right there was a gray-haired woman at a window watching him . She waved , and he waved back . A cripple like himself ! He wondered who was the despot in that house . " To-morrow  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just turning the corner , down the steep hill , into Gay Street , when a puff of wind came up and blew off Goliath 's bowler hat . Just for a second Goliath Iet go the chair to reach for it , but another puff followed and blew it just out of his reach . Cursing under his breath , he plungedafter it . . . and the chair began to move . The Colonel saw his danger at once . He gave a sharp cry , and even as he cried out the thought flashed through him  --  Now , now , I must get out now  --  they 'll think the shock of the danger has given me back my legs . . . There 've been heaps of cases . People paralyzed for years . And I 'm not helpless . There 's no reason why I should n't . The chair was already moving fast , and Goliath had stumbled as he started back to save it . Now  --  now  --  now , thought the Colonel . Faster and faster went the bath-chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . But he could n't move  --  those carefully cherished nerves refused to work . He , who had always responded to the thrill of necessary action , however dangerous , could not respond now . Yet only last night he had walked round and round his room for his usual hour , patient , sure of himself . . . . Now , for the first time , a vision of that unexpected crime came back to him , but not as it had occurred . It was as though , for one strange vivid moment , his story had been true , and he had seen , helpless in his chair , the maniac spring at Agnes and plant the knife in her breast . The helplessness he had not suffered from then or since seized hold of him , as though his maniac had come to life and were holding him down . The Colonel realized , with a grim inner smile , the revenge his nerves had taken , and he accepted his beating like a soldier . It was an astonishing sight that met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath-chair hurling down the middle of the road , with Goliath , bowler in hand , panting after it , and the Colonel sitting foward , steering it , alert , alive , intent , just like a pilot in the Schneider Cup Race . What was stranger still , they distinctly heard him shout as he whizzed past : " At him ! At him ! Up and at him ! " It was supposed by some that he thought he was back at Hill BO , fighting the Germans , charging down that slope with the mine at the bottom . There was no mine at the end of Gay Street , but the Bristol bus was up to time . It turned the corner just at the wrong moment , and it did what the mine had failed to do . A very gallant soldier was what they wrote on his tombstone . That was perfectly true . They might have added  --  and a very great artist too , but then of course they did n't know that . PROTEST BY E. 0 . LAUGHLIN I T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust should be created ; And yet more strange that only dust endures , And soft , sweet flesh so soon is dissipated . The Artist who so infinitely planned , And through long , patient eons grew so skillful To fashion beauty with unerring hand  --  Why should he be so whimsical and willful ? The works of man survive . The pyramid , Crude pile of stone , refuses still to crumble ; The Grecian god of marble , ages hid , Lives on in palace , crypt , or attic , humble . The effigy remains upon the vase , The saint upon the canvas , smiling sweetly ; But long ago each living , breathing trace Of shepherdess and saint was lost completely , It is so strange ! From dust to dust again  --  What is the plan ? What purpose that increases Through endless ages to attain , and then To toss aside incarnate masterpieces ?
