UNDERWOOD G UNDERWOOD President Wilson leaving the railroad station at Chateau  --  Thlerry in a snowstorm early in WO on his second cleft to the battlefields . Mrs. Wilson is entering the gate to the left . W E SAILED for Paris on the George Washington on December 4 , 1918 , expecting the peace conference to begin at once . Lunch over , the President crossed to his suite , on the opposite side of the deck from mine , and lay down . In a moment he was asleep . I was so happy . The long strain of war was lifting . For three hours he slept without stirring , and got up looking so refreshed and renewed . Those naps were daily occurrences during the voyage . Sometimes he would sleep four hours without moving or , apparently , breathing , and then sleep again at night , undisturbed , storing up energy for the trials ahead . Nine days later we landed at Brest amidst much ceremony and drove through triumphal arches , to the steady chorus of " Vire Vil-s-o-n ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was spread to the very steps of the train . President Poi/ware had sent his own special train  --  an linpressive array of dark-blue coaches , each bearing the letters , " R.F. " Again there were flowers presented to all of us , and much formal leave-taking  --  this despite the fact that it seemed as if we were carrying with us every official in France , each with several aides , as well as newspapermen , photographers , Secret Service guards , and many very important-looking personages who , as far as I could see , had no reason for being there . The French ambassador had , for example , brought back with him eight servants ; the Italian ambassador , two children and four servants . So there may have been some excuse for the mix-up in rooms which followed . The day before landing we had received a wireless asking for the full names and family relationships of those comprising the President 's party . This information had been furnished in detail . Nevertheless , the printed list found in each compartment designating the disposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Secretary of State Lansing and Miss Edith Benham in Room A ; Honorable Henry White and Mrs. Benson in Room B ; Mrs. Lansing and Miss Margaret Wilson in Room C , " and so on . This caused all sorts of amusement and some hardships . Serious-looking Frenchmen in charge of the train had placed all baggage in rooms according to the lists . When such consignments were disputed , they would solemnly produce the list . The Rough Road to Peace T HIS confusion did not apply to the President or to me , for at our disposal was an entire car , We were told that this was the French President 's own car . While much better than many of the others , it was far from being modern or luxurious . The beds were very narrow , hard berths , running crossway of the car , with only room for a folding chair at the side . No part of the train was clean and the sheets felt damp , as though just washed . The dining-car service was terrible . The tumultuous welcome given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Installation of his party In the Murat Paluco and the attendant ceremonies are omitted bore. ? En .1 We now had been in Paris four days with nothing done . So the President called a meeting at the CrilIon Hotel , where our delegates were housed . He was told that the English did not think it possible to open the conference until after their elections were held ; that Mr. Lloyd George said his political fortunes were at stake , and he could not leave ; that both England and Italy felt a personal visit from the President to their countries would do much toward smoothing out domestic differences and making it easier for their representatives at the Peace Conference . The British and Italian ambassadors urged the President to visit London and Rome at once . This was confirmed the following day by a personal visit from the King of Italy , who came to Paris especially to extend the invitation . With few attendants , he arrived at our house wearing his field uniform with a queer double-decker cap , and looking so tiny and unimpressive . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one could fail to respect and like him . Gazing around the beautiful room in the Murat Palace , he exclaimed : " My God , I could n't live in a place like this ! " That same morning M. Clemenceau brought me a small piece of the flag of truce which the Germans had carried when they came to sign the Armistice terms . It is a square about two and one half inches large of what looks like an old piece of damask tablecloth . The French premier wrote a few lines on a sheet of paper and pinned the bit of cloth to it  --  a very gracious thought on the part of this bitter old man with a black skullcap on his head and gray cotton gloves always on his hands to cover the eczema which must have added to the pessimistic view he took of life . The following afternoon , when we went to the Sorbonne , where my husband was given an honorary degree , a funny incident occurred . Just as we were ready to leave the house , a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , and would be there at a certain hour . So I went before the hour set and found poor , dreary M. Martin , our guide , at the doer , awaiting me , and looking his saddest over the failure of madame to appear . He begged that I would be so gracious as to pause for a few minutes before ascending to the box , as he was sure she would be delayed only a moment . An Affair of State S 0 I WAITED a few minutes , but my secre- tary , always jealous of the prerogatives , protested against my waiting longer , saying that she felt madame should await me , as I was the guest . So , at Miss Benham 's insistence , we went up to the box , where we found Mme. Poincarll seated in state , and furious with Martin that ho had not been on hand to attend her arrival . She was so angry at him that she almost forgot to be polite to us . I decided not to let her ill temper mar the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own fault if she Caine ahead of time , thus inconveniencing everyone , I settled down to enjoy myself . This I did thoroughly , for it was a very interesting occasion . We got home in time for a brief rest before dressing for a dinner given for us by the British Ambassador and his wife , Lurd and Lady Derby . On the way home my husband confessed that he was afraid Lady Derby thought him dull , for she had asked while at table : " Do you in America arm after dinner ? " And he , whose thoughts had been so concentrated on armaments , could not for a moment focus his mind on the social amenities and recall whether , after dinner , the gentlemen escorted the ladies from the room or merely stood while they withdrew . He said he tried after that to rally his wits and follow her more closely . The next day was Sunday , and instead of going to church we started early , with a ear filled with flowers , for Neuilly to visit the American Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what tragedies of suffering and death those silent walls had witnessed .

Their very name depresses me , and I visit . my friends or family connections only from the severest sense of duty , never losing the feeling almost of nausea which strikes me at the very door . I confess this with no wish to pose as a martyr , but only as an apology for that side of my temperament . The Price of Victory ? T HUS I went , and we spent five hours going from bed to bed , talking to the boys who were getting well , and trying to comfort those whose wan faces told the awful story of approaching death or helpless invalidism stretching over long difficult years . My heart ached , and I felt I would disgrace myself and burst into tears as we went up and down the endless rows of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown the very modern operating room . I was counting the minutes until we could get away and breathe God 's pure air free from the odor of disinfectants and anesthetics , when the doctor opened a door and stood back for me to enter . Never shall I forget that awful sight ! The room . seemed to be turning upside down , and through a mist I saw human forms with faces so distorted and mutilated that the place seemed an inferno . I think for an instant only my will to hold on and not let them see my horror kept me from fainting . Suddenly 1 heard the doctor 's even voice saying to my husband : " Yes , this is the facial ward . You see , we put them all up here together , so they wo n't get sensitive about seeing people and sort of help each other . If each were off to himself they would not know about the others , and would got morbid and self-conscious . " This brought me up with a jerk , and I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt so ashamed that I should grow faint at merely looking at what these boys were enduring without a murmur , There they were , some with their entire noses blown away , some totally blind , others with chins and half their faces gone . Well , I shook myself free of horror and stayed on and talked , and told them how proud I was just to touch their hands . My husband made a little talk to them as they gathered around him like children . ( Conittnu  --  d an Page 56 At midnight on the twenty-fourth we left to spend Christmas with our troops near General Pershing 's headquarters at Chaumont . The special train of the president of France was waiting . There seemed to be no heat in the cars at all , but with fur coats we managed to keep fairly comfortable . Alas , when we went to our sleeping compartments , they were as cold as vaults . So we all spontaneously sought one another to see if every car was the same , which , unfortunately , they were  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the icy beds felt dampand dangerous . We sat up another hour , and Ambassador Jusserand was so funny and so indignant that such a state of affairs could exist in his country . At last , front sheer weariness , we again disbanded , but the hours between that and dawn were nightmares , and I have never understood why we did not all have pneumonia . We did not mind having to rise at seven , for anything was better than that cold inaction . We found it was snowing fast , but closed Army ears were waiting for us and we started on a long drive , attended by General Pershing and his aides . We went where the boys were billeted , often in forlorn barns where the mud came up to our shoe tops . Sometimes they were in a loft , reached by a ladder . Signs were posted prohibiting smoking or having a light , for fear of fire  --  which , of course , was necessary , but how utterly dreary ! In one place was a sort of cantonment where temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This the boys had made a pitiful attempt to decorate for Christmas with a few green sprays and little bits of red paper . Some faithful American women were there to minister to and try to entertain the boys , but they were all so brave , and things were so lonely and uncomfortable , that they brought tears to our eyes despite their efforts to pretend they were full of Christmas cheer . Ji Khaki Christmas The end of our long drive was near the village of Humes , where , in the center of a great open field , was a small grandstand , which we reached by a narrow plank walk raised above a sea of mud . The anow was still falling . As soon as we were seated , a sort of review of every branch of the Army service began . The President and General Pershing made little talks to the troops , and the commander of the 77th Division , from New York , made me a graceful little speech , saying that his boys had asked that I be made an honorary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I still keep among my treasures . It shows the Goddess of Liberty embroidered on a blue field , the same as worn by the soldiers on their left shoulders . After a prayer by a chaplain , we drove to where a big Christmas dinner was held for the troops . It was a traditional American dinner . General Leonia , who was beside me , said he had heard of pumpkin pie , but never seen it before . He looked dubiously at the great yellow square before him . A very conservative corner morsel was his first and last tribute to good U. S. A. pumpkin pie . The reports of delay in opening the Peace Conference had been only too true . To help fill in the time , we left for England on the day after Christmas . The King 's equerry greeted us at Calais , the hospital ship , Brighton , escorted by French and British destroyers , took us to Dover , the King 's luxurious train carried us to Charing Cross Station , and Their Majesties , King George and Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive us . We rode in medieval royal coaches , drawn by four horses each , and preceded by a stunning mounted guard to Buckingham Palace . As in Paris , roofs , windows , trees and posts were laden with humanity . There was wild enthusiasm , the Queen bowing graciously from side to side , but insisting that the huzzahs were for us . As we were passing Marlborough House , my eye was caught by a figure waving an American Ilag . She had no hat and around her shoulders was a little shawl . The Princess Mary , startled out of her silence , exclaimed : " Why , its Grand-mamma . " Sure enough , it was the Dowager Queen Alexandra . kissing her hand to my husband and waving the Stars and St ripes . Ai Buckingham Palace When finally we turned into the courtyard of the palace , it was crowded with American troops , and the foreground was reserved fur those on crutches or in wheel chairs . What a gracious and thoughtful act on the part of our hosts ! A great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the carriage , bared his head and greeted them . The King and Queen personally escorted us to our rooms , which are known as the Belgian Suite . An open grate of glowing coals gave a note of cheer . My husband 's quarters consisted of a bedroom , with a large alcove cut off by heavy red curtains . His Majesty lifted one of these to disclose a well-equipped bath and a small electric heater . This last proved a life-saver , on account of the shortage of coal . My room was enormous , with the largest bed I ever saw . It contained no heat at all , but in a cozy dressing room was a tiny grate fire and red hangings , which looked very homelike . My bath , at the end of our hall , had a marble tub , beside which stood a high-backed chair as big as a throne and covered with a double blanket , which I was grateful for after a plunge in the marble tub . Their Majesties withdrew , but returned almost immediately to say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They explained that it was their custom never to refuse such requests . Before us , extending as far as the eye could reach , was a sea of faces  --  thousands upon thousands of people , giving us welcome and calling , " Speech , speech . " My husband responded , displaying a union jack which the Queen had given him . The King and Queen waved small American flags . This over , they insisted upon returning with us to our suite , leaving with the promise that they would be back to dine with us there at nine o'clock . As soon as they had withdrawn , Sir Charles Cust , the equerry . appeared to know how soon we could be ready to start on a round of calls on the ( ConrInuad an Pas . RIU 58 ! C  --  nrinued from Paz ? Gel members of the royal family . 1Ve said in twenty minutes . I had traveled in a black tailored suit with a big rolling sealskin collar , and a small blaels tricot hat . I changed to a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar and long bands of the same on a Russian-blouse effect . With this I wore a big black beaver hat with three soft gray ostrich tips at the side . I took my secretary , Miss Benham , whom the British insisted upon calling a " lady in waiting . " Our first call was oil the Dowager Queen Alexandra . That gracious lady met us at the threshold , kissed me on both cheeks , and introduced all her household , who were assembled about her . After presenting them to us , she performed the same ceremony for those who accompanied us , after which she asked that my husband and I go upstairs and the rest remain below . When we reached the top of a long stairway , she led the way into a large drawing room packed with furniture . Here we were joined by the Princess Royal , whom she introduced as " Victoria , " and the Queen of Norway , whom she presented simply thus : " And this is Maud . " Then , seating herself on a sofa , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria , " " Maud " and I talked together while I surreptitiously kept my eye on my watch ; for I had asked Sir Charles how long we should stay , and his answer had been : " Fifteen minutes  --  not longer , but not less . " Both of these ladies wore dark dresses , as did the Queen , but , to my surprise , all had on long brown suede gloves to the elbow , and no hats . Reflected Glory The Princess said she had u great favor to ask of me : " Would it be asIdng too much if I requested you to sign my book ? " Whereupon Maud clasped her brown suede hands together and said : " Oh , I so wanted the same thing , but , alas , my trunks have not come ; so I have no book and must miss this great opportunity . " Of course this struck my sense of humor  --  for these two royal ladies to want the signature of a little Virginia girl whom fate had picked out to share a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what I was thinking , but told them heartily how glad was to do what they asked , and followed Victoria to a desk where a beautifully tooled leather book was open , ready for signing . They both stood over me as I wrote . Instead of stopping after writing my first name " Edith , " as royalty does , I added " Bolling , " and then " Wilson . " Their eyes nearly popped , and they said : " Oh , you sign three names . " I could not determine whether that stamped me in their eyes as three times more royal or deducted in like proportion from my social status . But as Maud seemed even more desolated at the loss of such an autograph , I asked if she would like me to sign on a sheet of the paper bearing the royal crest which was on the desk , and she seemed enchanted by the suggestion . I then looked to see how my husband was faring with Queen Alexandra . I had been told that deafness made it next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sensitive reTHE SATURDAY garding her afflietion , she talked incessantly , producing the effect of n monologue . This being hard for both parties to sustain for fifteen minutes , I thought it would be tactful to ask if they would not also like to have the President 's signature , They answered in concert : " Why , of course , but we could not think of troubling him . " I assured them he would be happy to do it . When this was done , our time was up and I rose to go . But the Queen said we must not leave until we had seen " Maud 's child . " So he was summoned , and while we waited she said " Oh , then you have not seen the picture , " and turning to her daughters she added : " Do light the picture . " They ran to do her bidding and pushed a number of light buttons near the door until at last the right one was discovered , which illuminated a picture in a far corner of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two by three feet was hung . It was the interior of Westminster Abbey at the time of the funeral of Queen Victoria . I stood gazing at this , not knowing just why it was designated as " the picture " in this room where all four walls were covered with what seemed to me much finer paintings . Then it occurred to me that its importance must lie in the fact that Queen Victoria 's death marked the accession to the throne of King Edward and Queen Alexandra  --  for which they had waited many years . Therefore it was a symbol that marked a new epoch in the life of this lady who held my hand in hers as we stood and looked upon the painting . So I pressed the thin hand and said : " It is certainly very interesting . " My husband said afterward that the comment was an inspiration , for he was wondering  --  just as I was  --  what comment to make . From there we made a tour of the other royal . relatives , but Sir Charles would leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . Back at the palace he escorted us to our suite , saying he would leave us to rest before dinner . Remembering the brown suede gloves , I asked if he could tell me whether , as the dinner was to be informal and in our suite , I should wear gloves . He said he did not know , but would find out immediately . He was back in no time with this information : EVENING POST ller Majesty will not wear gloves , but she and Princess Mary will carry a new pair with the string still keeping them together , held with fingers up , in their left . hands . " Even such an insignificant detail as this was thought out and arranged in this marvelously ordered country of England . On the hour , Their Majesties arrived , accompanied by the Duke of Connaught , Princess Mary , the Duke of York  --  now the King  --  and his younger brother . The two ladies carried stiff , long white gloves , held upright as in our old game of " Simon says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a like pair held in the same way . The Test of a King We went in to dinner informally , and what I had dreaded as a difficult meal went oft merrily . My husband told a good story , which broke the ice , and the Ring responded with several that concerned our doughboys , who seem to have delighted him . One of these I give as nearly as I can in his own words : " I went to France and to one of the sectors near the front where many of the Americans were billeted with our troops , who were standing in line for me to review them . As I went up and down the lines I was followed by many of your boys , and I saw them staring at me . Finally I heard one say to another : ' Who is that bug ? ' And the other said : ' Why , man , that 's the King of England . ' And the first one shrugged and said : ' Hell ! Where 's his crown ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I did not mind at all being called a ' bug , ' but . I hated to think that I was expected to review my men with a crown on my head . " Another of his stories concerned the time Her Majesty and he had attended the opening of the Liberty Hut in London . " One of your privates , " said the King , " came forward and said : I Excuse me , but am I right that this is the King of England ? ' I said ' Yes . ' at which he extended a horny hand and said : ' Put it there ! ' " This true American praise , His Majesty said , was " most extraordinary , " but he liked it . When the dinner was over , we had a brief talk around our fire , and then Her Majesty asked if I would like to see her own rooms , and thus give our husbands an opportunity to talk over serious things . As I recall it , we went through nine rooms , eaeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had belonged to Queen Victoria . She said that august lady never threw away anything . I remember her pointing to an enchanting child 's silver tea set which , she said , had been made for the old Queen when she was tittle . There was no heat in any room , and I had to hold tight whenever I spoke , to keep my teeth from chattering . It was December , and we wore evening gowns . Oh , the joy of our fire when we returned to join the gentlemen ! This ended our first day in London . At Lady Reading 's luncheon the next day occurred my first meeting with Margot Asquith , and I found her about what I had pictured  --  clever , egotistical and exceedingly plain . I sat between her and my hostess . She smoked one cigarette after another , striking the matches , as I have seen certain men do , on her own anatomy . She January SY , 1930 wore a severely tailored coat and a tight skirt . Her first question to me was : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied that I had just been introduced to most of them . " Well , " she said , " then I will tell you about them . This one on my right is Countess  - -  -  , the biggest liar in London ; the one next is an American , but ashamed to let anyone know it until lately . Since Wilson 's Administration , it has become fashionable to be an American , and now she is disgusting in proclaiming it . Then , of course , Mrs. L. G. does n't count , " and so on . This remarkable conversation I endeavored to get into another channel by asking her if she was to be at the great dinner that night at the palace . This proved another unfortunate topic , for she said : " No , I was not invited , " adding that she had sent word to the King that she did not want his food , but did want to meet President Wilson , who , she was told , " really had brains " ? a quality she had never yet found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said they talked only of themselves , and that she made it a rule during these long eulogies to plan her future life and think her own thoughts , for she never listened . " How can you know , then , they have no brains ? " I asked innocently . To this she only sniffed , and I turned to try to talk to Lady Reading , who was a lady in every sense , but so deaf it was very hard to carry on a conversation . This left me rather at the mercy of Mrs. Asquith , who attacked me again with this : " As you and I are both second wives , I am interested in what you think of your stepdaughters . Are they very awful ? Of course , you would say nice things about them generally , but to me you can tell the truth . " Romantic Mrs. Asquith " Thank you , " I said , " for that privilege ? " But before I could finish , she was off again : " Instead of hearing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the President , and all about your romance . " By this time I had decided that Mrs. Asquith had taken a leaf from what she said was our American " men 's book , " and wanted to talk only about herself . So I countered : " Oh , I am sure your own romance is absorbing , so tell me about that . " She beamed , and launched into a detailed and intimate narrative , to which she warmed as she proceeded ; and by the time luncheon was over , the veil bad been stripped from the most personal and sacred things , and I felt a sense of dismay that any woman was so devoid of reticence . When I got back to the palace , the wife of the Lord Chamberlain , Lady Sandhurst , asked to see me . After a few moments of conversation , she said the object of her coming was to learn if I would wear a tiara at dinner , as all the ladies had given up wearing them during the war , and put most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her if I had a. tiara I would certainly wear it on so great an occasion , but I did not own one . I think the fact of not having one had never occurred to her , but she said : " Oh , then of course no one else can wear one . " I assured her I would not consider it in any way lacking in courtesy if they did , and I personally would love to see them . After she was gone , I rang for my maid . Susan arrived , breathless with delight . She had just been taken up to see the throne room , where the tables were spread for dinner . Her eyes were ( Conilerued on Peg . 60 ) 60 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 21 , I9 ? 39 ( Continued from Poi* 58 ) popping out at the gorgeous gold service which had been brought up from Windsor Castle . With true Southern-. darky genius for getting words wrong , she called it the " Thorn " Room . From there she had been taken to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the table and what she thought of it . She said she had told her : " It was jes beautiful , " and that she did not believe there had ever been anything so lovely " since the Queen of Sheba danced before King Solomon . " I had instructed her , before we came , that , should she be in the presence of the Queen , she must curtsy , but I had had no idea she would be accorded an audience . Later , at the dinner , His Majesty asked me if the Queen had told me that she had met Susan and how much she enjoyed her . So I hoped from this that she had acquitted herself creditably , notwithstanding the fact that her Bible knowledge was a little mixed . Earlier in the day there had been a conference with my husband as to what style of dress was to be worn . Mr. Wilson explained that our chief executive never wore uniforms , and that evening clothes were suitable on every occasion . Accordingly , the King decreed that he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This caused much scurrying around , as during the war only military uniforms had been worn by his Majesty and the members of his suite . Consequently , there was a perceptible odor of moth balls when the gentlemen appeared . Returning from Mrs. Lloyd George 's tea , we found in our rooms a printed diagram of the great table , with the place of each of the ninety-six guests designated . At the proper hour the Lord Chamberlain , Sandhurst , and Lord Farquhar appeared to escort us to the royal family , and this is how they did it . As we emerged from our suite , the gentlemen stood facing us , each holding in his two bands before him a slender wooden wand , which was his badge of office . In perfect unison they bowed until the wands almost touched the floor  --  from an athletic point of view a really creditable performance for gentlemen of their years in dress suits . Then they stepped backward one pace and bowed again . Then one more step  --  backward , remember  --  and another bow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up , for , judging from the length of the corridor , we had a long way to go . . fl Royal Progress But we made it , with one bow about every three feet . Then we turned and confronted a great stair . Up the steps tripped our escort. , backward , still making their bows at the correct intervals . I was both alarmed and amused , and had some difficulty keeping a straight face . Another long corridor , and finally we rear.hed our destination ; Lords Sandhurst and Farquhar having had as much exercise as they could have got in a cricket match . Later , on better acquaintance , I asked Lord Farquhar the origin of the custom . It was very old , he said , and was used only in the case of heads of states . I expressed my admiration for his agility . Lord Farquhar laughed . As there had been no formal entertaining for four years , he said he had really feared for his form , adding : " My dear lady , had you looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two elderly gentlemen practicing , up and down . Even the maids who were placing flowers in the corridors could not disguise their amusement . " The progress described conveyed us to a white drawing room , oval in shape , where our hosts received us . With them was the jovial old Duke of Connaught and his lovely daughter , the Princess Pat , who at once made me the recipient of a feminine confidence . She said that , although her engagement had not been publicly announced , she wished me to know it , adding that to be engaged , to have new slippers  --  the first in four years  --  not to mention meeting the President of the United States , all were very exciting . I recall this to show how informal and unostentatious these people were  --  the Princess Royal in velvet and marvelous rubies ; the Queen of Norway ; the Duchess of Sutherland , the tall and very lovely lady in waiting to the Queen ; the Princess Mary , and so on . A Legend of the Beefeaters His Majesty presented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rite with the gentlemen and me . Introductions over , the King took me in to dinner and the President escorted the Queen . The room was vast , with tables forming three sides of a hollow square . Tall golden candelabra ablaze with wax candles alternated with vessels of gold holding tall stems of the Christmas crimson poinsettias . Everything on the table  --  service plates , goblets , and so on  --  was gold , and huge formal gold pieces adorned the racks on the walls . At the far end of the room was a minstrel gallery where musicians were playing Swanee River , Maryland , My Maryland , Old Kentucky Home , and , at last , Dixie . At the other end was the throne , almost hidden by magnificent flowers . To add to the colorful scene were dozens of men in livery . Some wore uniforms of the time of Queen Anne , in a heavenly shade of blue with silver . Others were in crimson . All had white wigs and short . trousers , with great buckles on their shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Yeomen of the Guard such as one sees at the Tower of London , in their pie-turesque Tudor uniforms . Armed with ancient halberds , they stood without moving a muscle . During the course of the dinner , a man with a pink coat , white breeches , high hat and boots appeared through the doorway , carrying a slender wand . He went to each of the " statues " touching its toes with the end of the wand , and thus all around the great room . I asked the King why he did this , and he explained that the man was head of the Beefeaters , who are all old soldiers receiving a pension from the government , their only duty being service at the Tower of London and at very formal dinners at the palace . The one requirement is that they maintain the cut of beard and hair in harmony with the period of the costume . The King went on to say that on an occasion , hundreds of years ago , when they were first used as they were tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military postures , Ile found one man had relaxed , with one foot out in front of the other . He touched the offender 's toe with the wand of office , and seeing the blood mount to the face of the man , and feeling sorry for him , the kindly commander went the rounds , touching each man on the foot , as though it were a ceremony . Ever since , this has been the custom  --  a sort of memorial to a kind heart , I think this is a pretty story , and so am doing my small part to preserve it , During the dinner , His Majesty rose and made a very graceful little toast to my husband , but before doing so ho confided to me that he was always so nervous when he had to speak that he dreaded it . As the address was typed on small sheets of paper and put . before him , I wondered why he should feel nervous . But when I saw how the paper shook in his hand , I realized that lie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose the King 's health , and , as was his custom , he had pride . After but spoke spontaneously . His graceful speech made me thrill with After dinner we went into another large drawing room , where we stood while the guests were brought up for a few minutes of talk with each . Two of the gentlemen of the household were detailed for this  --  one to me and one to my husband . There were so many guests that it was a long ordeal standing , which I did not mind , but which was trying to others . One of the ladies in waiting fainted and was carried out . After these little ceremonies Her Majesty still stood , so , of course , everyone else did . But I saw the elderly Princess Royal looking so fatigued that I asked her if she could not sit down , and she said : " Oh , no , not while the Queen is standing . " I then suggested that she rest against the end of a large davenport , which she said she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had not stood so long since before the war , because there had been no formal entertaining . The dear old lady looked . over at the Queen , who was apparently as fresh as though the day had just begun and , shaking her head , said : " Oh , she never gets tired . She stands for hours , but for me it is terrible . " rho balance of the English visit to omitted . With the opening of the Peace Conference now set Pm- January is , 1010 , tho ' resident and Mrs. Wilson returned to Park on December twenty-eighth. and the same day boarded King Emmanuel 's special train for ROW . ED " To my surprise , the Italian train was the most magnificent of the three we had ridden on that day  --  King George 's , President Poincare 's and now Emmanuel 's . I had never seen anything like it  --  servants in livery of royal scarlet ; plate , china and glassware bearing the Italian arms ; table and bed linen beautifully embroidered . The Eternal City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmanuel , was a I all , lugubrious individual wearing a long-tailed spike coat and looking like the undertaker at an important funeral . He insisted upon observing official etiquette in the seating at table , which , for a long journey , was fatiguing . It meant that he sat . next to me at every meal until the Prince of Udine , a cousin of the King , took his place at Rome . Fortunately , we breakfasted in our compartments . Our arrival in Rome will always be the most brilliant canvas in all the rich pictures in my memory . Before leaving , Paris nod been gray with constant rain , rain , rain . But here the sky was a dome of sapphire pouring sunshine over a radiant world . But those who know and love the ancient beauty of Rome must picture the added brilliance of streets covered with the golden sands brought from the Mediterranean Sea , a time-honored custom accorded returning conquerors and visiting heads of states . The long windows of every house along the Way were open wide , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . And the flowers I From the roofs , windows and balconies poured a shower of purple violets and golden mimosa . From baskets filled with them , from white arms laden with them , they fell about our stately coaches . We were to have lunch with Their Majesties at their Villa Savoia , just outside the city . So we parted at our suite in the Quirinal Palace , but a moment later our hosts reappeared to beg us to join them on the balcony to greet the people , who had been waiting all this time . Facing us were more than a hundred thousand persons . Happily , this was an informal lunch , so we could dispense with the Duke de Lante and all our escort . When we drew up to the entrance of the villa the door was thrown wide , and down the few steps ran His Majesty bareheaded . Before the footman could dismouut , he had opened the car door and was greeting us in English without a trace of accent . The Queen , wearing soft , filmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of solarium , with four of her children grouped about her . The oldest daughter , dark , slim and tall , wore a ruddy shade of red ; the second daughter , smaller and very blond , was in green ; the charming little girl was in velvet of violet color with a big lace collar ; and the heir to the throne , a handsome boy with fine dark eyes , was in black velvet with a lace collar . The Italian sunshine illuminated a scene that called for the brush of a Van Dyck . Near the family stood a great Russian wolfhound such as I always associate with portraits . The only other guests were the old Duke of Genoa , uncle of the King , and an English governess who had been responsible for the fluent use of our language by all the children . Only the Queen did not speak English . His Majesty asked if we would like to see his apartments . For the bedroom of a king it was indeed a surprise . The floor was bare , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On these were war relies of every kind , each tagged with its history . A low flat-top desk , on which , in a silver frame , was a picture of the Queen  --  the one concession to ornamentation . An army cot , two chairs and a few toilet articles completed the furnishings . X Conversation at Cross.Purposes The state dinner was to he held at the palace that night , and a splendid affair it was . Everything was as formal as possible . The table was laid in a long tapestry-hung gallery . Beautiful china , glass and gorgeous plate adorned the table , and great high-backed , crimson-cushioned chairs gave the impression of a series of thrones . Remembering what His Majesty had said at the Murat Palace in Paris ? " My God , I could n't live in a place like this " ? and seeing how much more magnificent the Quirinal was , I reminded him of it . Turning in his quick , jerky way , and encompassing the room in a glance , the King said : " Oh , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? with a wave of the hand ? " does not belong to me any more than the White House belongs to you . " The one amusing thing which occurred at the table was a conversation between Margaret and the old Duke of Genoa , who was almost stone deaf . He was seated between Margaret and me , and we both had made unsuccessful efforts to talk to him . Among theguests was Signor Marconi , the inventor of wireless , and so Margaret said to the old Duke that she thought Marconi such an interesting man , and how glad she was to meet him . The Duke asked her to repeat this , which she did  --  u second and a third time . At this moment one of those strange silences which sometimes happen in a big company fell upon us , so poor Margaret found herself the center of everyone 's interest , even of Marconi himself , at the other end of the long table . But still the Duke did not understand . Marshaling all effort , Margaret fairly shrieked : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marconi . " The Duke 's reply fell upon the ears of many listeners : " Yes , there are more tunnels in it than any other in the world ; eighteen between here and Paris , I am told . " An Italian Welcome That afternoon the President had had a request from the people to address them in the great square surrounding the monument to Victor Emmanuel II . As the program was arranged for him to be received by the Pope the next day , he said he would go to the square immediately after leaving the Vatican . Being a Protestant , and knowing the temper of many of our people at home regarding the Pope , the President decided he would also call on his old friends , Mr. and Mrs. Lowrie , the former of whom was then in charge of the American Episcopal Church in Rome . I went with him . Then we returned to the palace , where my husband was to be joined by a formal escort . Some of the White House Secret Service men who attended him were Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax of their lives . I had been asked to accompany my husband , but we thought it better for him to go alone . So Miss Benham , a duke whose name I have , unfortunately , forgotten , and his wife , who had been assigned to me as a " lady in waiting , " decided to follow along and see the crowds on our way to tea with the Countess Cellere . Never before had I seen so many people anywhere as were gathered in every street , and when we reached the region of the monument , the way was blocked with humanity . They gave a great shout as my husband appeared on his way to the Vatican . The police could do nothing to control them . lie finally got through , but our car was detained thirty or forty minutes . There was nothing alarming about it , the people were all so friendly . I regretted when we did get through , and wished I had an excuse to linger instead of going to the tea ; for I was crazy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ! It seemed that the government , seeing the outpouring of the people , and especially the soldiers , feared that if the President addressed them he would say something which would enlist their support for his Fourteen Points . Though Italy had agreed to the Points as the basis of the Armistice , she had no intention of standing by her word in the Peace Conference . So , before my husband had left the Vatican , the police were instructed to disperse the crowd . To do this without consulting the President was a gross discourtesy , and when I got back to the Quirinal he was already there and fairly blazing with anger . He expressed himself both to the press and to the officials , who tried to explain their action by saying the crowd was so vast they feared it would get out of ? hand and cause a riot . Thus they tried to save their faces , but the veneer was too thin to fool anyone . The second day of our sojourn , Their Majesties sent word to Mr. Thomas Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us at the embassy . The King and Queen having never before been entertained at an embassy , the President and his wife , of necessity , became the hosts pro tern . So we arrived at the charming old palace used as our embassy ahead of them . We found Mrs. Page and all the secretaries of the embassy flustered , for fear everything had not been arranged as it should be . The King and Queen arrived promptly with their suite , and as we were going into the dining room the Ambassador to send all yer stuff . You look good , old pal . I been down on my luck a little since them days . I 'm train ' to get back to Kansas City . I got a job with East-West wires waiting for me there , pal . " The Gazette man stirred impatiently and said " Oh , scram , will ya , bum ? .. . This guy 's put the bee on four guys already with the same gag , Perry . They sweep him out of Jerry 's Bar down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knew the man was a drunk and a bum , but he was not in the mood to offend the gods and possibly jeopardize Rusty 's chances , for want of a little charity , even if it went . for drink . He pulled a dollar from his pocket and handed it to Spelvin . " Here 's a buck . Beat it ! " " Gee , pal , thanks . I 'll get in touch with you when I get back to Kansas City . " He turned and shuffled off towards the revolving door . " Right for the gin mill , " commented the Chronicle man . The Gazette reporter had been doing some worried thinking . He addressed the assemblage . " Gentlemen , " he said , " much as it pains me to have to call this to your attention in the presence of our Mr. Perry Brown , I am forced to note that our distinguished colleague , Miss Ruth McGowan , is not in our midst this morning . And any time , on a yarn like this , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , I am not happy . I think I will just take a little look around . " He arose , stretching . The other reporters stirred uneasily and began to climb to their feet . Thus they were all standing in time to see the commotion by the elevator , which had just descended and discharged a brown-uniformed state trooper and a hotel maid with some sheets and towels over her arm . The trooper was leading the maid over to the desk by the elbow , which was unusual , but what made it even more unusual was that the maid , aproned , mob cap drawn over straggling , copper-colored hair , some of it down over her forehead in approved maid style , was Rusty McGowan . Rusty was grinning amiably , and winked at Perry and the boys , but Perry groaned inwardly . The trooper , a young , pink-checked chap , was highly indignant about the whole business , and a little scandalized . He was saying to the hotel manager , " This girl claims she 's one of the maids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in there say she 's a reporter , and ? " " Oh , do n't be a silly , " interrupted Rusty . " Of course I 'm not a maid . whispered to my husband : " It is the custom here to offer the health of the King just after the asparagus has been served . " The President waited for the asparagus to appear . Course after course was served , until finally the table was cleared for dessert , Then the President rose and , addressing Their Majesties , said that one of the early precepts instilled into him as a small boy was , " When in Rome do as the Romans do . " Certainly here , he continued , where he had seen and been the beneficiary of the gracious customs obtaining in Rome , he hesitated to depart one jot . or tittle from such a standard . So he begged the indulgence of Their Majesties if in his ignorance he should offend the code . I 'm an international jewel thief , and I am trying to steal the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow now . " She smiled winningly at the manager and said , " Good morning , Mr. Hoskins . Do n't you think I 'd make a good maid ? " All the reporters were standing around grinning , most of them with relief . " What happened , Rusty ? " Perry asked . Rusty looked just the least bit dubious , the smile on her broad , pleasant mouth turning just that much childlike and trusting as she faced Perry to reply , " I went up to the room and rang the bell , and when Mr. Granville came to the door I said , ' It 's me , the maid , sir , with the towels and the sheets . Can I come in ? ' So he let me into the vestibule , and the light was on when the brat walked out of the front room and took one look and said , ' Hey , dad , that 's not our maid . That 's a reporter . I 've seen her at the Stork Club . ' So they called my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , ho , " said Perry gloomily . " So that 's where you go when I 'm out of town . We will take that up later . I hope this will be a lesson to you . I will send you some temperance tracts over to the jailhouse . " " You think you 're kiddin ' ? " said the trooper . " That 's just where she 's going . We 've had enough of these didoes . . . . If you 'll come over and make the charge , Mr. Hoskins ? " It was the Gazette man who spoke up . He said , " Oh , be yourself , trooper . She has n't done any harm . And you broke up the play . It 's no crime in this country if a girl likes to go in for fancy dress , is it ? Forget it . " Rusty made the trooper a little curtsy with a finger under her chin , and said , " La , sir , if your worship will just let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . At least , " she added to herself , " not that way . " The trooper began to grin self-consciously , and looked at the manager , who waved his hand wearily and said , " No charge , trooper , no charge . " The poor man had been living in a madhouse for the last two clays , but he liked Rusty . The trooper walked back to the elevator , waving his hands and shaking his head , while the delighted reporters surrounded her , whoopi.g and gagging with her . But later , when she had changed her clothes , Perry went up to her room and they discussed their latest failure . He said that the Ambassador had whispered to him : " Do not offer the health of the King until after the asparagus is served . " So he had waited ; but as he saw that this very delicious meal could not go on indefinitely , and , not knowing whether Roman customs included asparagus after ice cream , lest he lose entirely this unique opportunity of welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was considered  --  he ventured to rise and offer a hearty welcome and a toast to the health of Their Majesties . To this , dear Mrs. Page said audibly : " Oh , but there was no asparagus in the market ! " Editor 's Note  --  This is the sixth of n series of articles by Mrs. Wilson . The next will Lipper. - next week . " The team of McGowan and Brown is laying one fine , fat , juicy egg on this story , " said Perry . " Nothing works . " " I  --  I 'm sorry , Perry , " Rusty began , when Perry interrupted her : " Oh , hell , forget it. , kid . It was just a bad break . And anyway the gag had whiskers on it . This is the first job we 've had together in nine months , and I hate to flop on it . " " Maybe Jenny 's fit will work , " suggested Rusty . Jenny Jones , the ex-parachute jumper with the ash-blond hair and ingenuous smile and manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , the Blade city editor . Jenny could throw fine fits outside people 's doors , and more often than not was taken inside until medical attention could be sought . And once inside " What time does she get in ? " asked Perry . " I 've warned the guys about no cracks . I think they 'll all play ball . " " Around four , " said Rusty . " The train gets in at three-forty-eight . I 'm sure Jen will be able to do something . " It was really pretty to see the arrival of Jenny Jones , of the New York Daily Blade . Perry and Rusty were in the lobby of the hotel , drinking coffee with some ten other reporters , and there were men and women reporters scattered all around the place  --  at the cigar counter , rolling dies for cigarettes , lounging on the settees , standing about in little knots . Three quarters of them knew Jen intimately , but not one of them made the slightest sign that he had ever seen her before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she marched into the lobby of the hotel , clad in a , smart tweed suit , furs and a quits mad hat , followed by a bellhop bearing a suitcase covered with European hotel labels . Jenny had bought the suitcase , labels and all , at an auction . She found it useful for occasions like these . Only Perry and Rusty knew that its chief contents were oranges and graham crackers , on which Jenny practically subsisted . Al Vogel , who was sitting with Perry and Rusty , had the most difficulty masking his feelings , because Vogel and Jenny were in love and were going to get married too . He turned quite purple with restraint , and his eyes grew so large and lovelorn that Perry had to mutter , " For Pete 's sake , Al , get that kisser of yours behind a newspaper before you give the show away . " Jenny marched to the desk and registered as Mlle. Jeanne Jonais , Paris , France , and the desk clerk was terrifically impressed . She looked him    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
