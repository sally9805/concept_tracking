In the last 20 years , surgery has explored every organ of the body . Many a surgeon , flushed with scientific and financial success , thinks of his profession as a game of skilled slashing and speedy patching . Greatly worried by this too-common , hardboiled attitude are Dr. Elliott C. Cutler , chief surgeon of Boston 's famed Peter Bent Brigham Hospital , and his associate , Dr. Robert Zollinger . To them surgery is not only a science but an art , a religion , and a means of self-expression . Last week they published their new folio-sized manual of surgery , * first book of its kind since 1853 . Full of brief , " intimate " instructions for every type of standard operation from appendectomy to tonsillectomy , their manual is also crammed with scalpel-neat pen-drawings by Medical Artist Mildred Codding . As important to the authors as the practical instructions for " unfledged surgeons " are the simple , poetical introductory chapters on the " science of gentleness . " <P> Young surgeons , say Drs . Cutler and Zollinger , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells , because they are usually taught anatomy and pathology on " tough , dead , chemically fixed tissues . " Older surgeons may be " irked by the constant emphasis on gentleness . " But each cell in an operation must be protected " with exquisite care .

" but " the belly of the scalpel should be swept across the tissues , not pressed into them . " Sutures should be of silk " so fine that it - breaks when such strain is put upon it as will cut through living tissue . . . . One-handed knots and rapidly thrown knots are unreliable .

" A surgeon must know the benefits and dangers of every type of anesthetic ; local anesthesia , for example , should not be used in malignant tumor operations , or in the presence of infection , for the anesthetic needle may pick up cancerous cells and start the " seeding " of tumors , or it may injure healthy cells and make them prey for dangerous bacteria already lodging in the body . <P> " Handling of tissues with fingers can not be as facile , gentle or safe as handling with properly designed , delicate instruments . " A surgeon should spend his life in " a constant search for better instruments until he emerges finally as an artist , not an artisan . " Blood transfusion is " essential in certain disorders , and most valuable in preparing the patient for a major ordeal ; but its use following a surgical performance is at least suggestive that a more careful technique would have made this unnecessary .
