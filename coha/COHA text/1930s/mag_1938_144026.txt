For the past month , ever since President Roosevelt demanded $800,000,000 above the regular Navy appropriation of $500,000,000 , popular forums-from village stores to the U. S. Senate-have resounded with debate . Why does the U. S. need a bigger Navy ? What kind of Navy should it be ? Last week new verbal ammunition was discharged on the floor of Congress and in the White House . <P> Maverick Bombs . Most of the constituents of San Antonio 's flamboyantly talkative Representative Maury Maverick have never seen a battleship and never hope to see one . Said fiery Mr. Maverick to reporters last week : <P> " Airplanes can sink battleships and the bigger the battleship the bigger the mark . Japan , England and Italy know it . Why are the American people not allowed to know it . . . ? <P> " The existence of Navy Department reports on the vulnerability of an attacking fleet is not denied . I have been told that I could see the reports if I would keep them secret . . . . Obviously the secret is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The same amount of money now being sought for big battleships , invested in pursuit planes and bombers , would make the United States invulnerable . If that is not true , let it be proved untrue . " <P> The explosive effect of these remarks was not due entirely to the fact that they revived the old argument whether capital ships are outmoded . The President proposes to build three of these $70,000,000 giants ( besides two now building and two provided for in the 1939 appropriations ) , and by opposing them Maury Maverick , leader of the pro-Roosevelt left-wing bloc , showed his independence . His distaste for both the Naval and recession policies of the Administration he summed up on the floor of the House , saying : <P> " We Democrats have got to admit that we are floundering . The reason for all this battleship and war frenzy is coming out : we have pulled all the rabbits out of the hat and there are no more rabbits . " <P> White House Dreadnoughts . The Naval experts ' reply to the Maverick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not true . Day after Mr. Maverick dropped his bomb , a retort was fired by Franklin Roosevelt , a lover , like his top admirals , of big ships . He told a press conference that he had been studying Naval reports , secret and otherwise since 1913 , and that , if he had concluded therefrom that battleships were obsolete , he would not have recommended building new ones . When torpedo boats were invented and again with the development of undersea and aerial weapons , the President said , amateur strategists had declared that battleships were done for . As a professional ex-Assistant Secretary of the Navy , he was still convinced that they were the most effective seagoing armament extant . <P> Naval Big Guns . The argument about the relative value of plane and battleships boils down to a complex problem in strategy . In current naval theory planes are employed primarily not to sink rival battleships but : 1 ) to scout their position , 2 ) to disable them by bombing , 3 ) to direct the fire of their own ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
