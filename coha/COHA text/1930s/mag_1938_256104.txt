Radio to the Ryot <P> Old Mother India is too poor for radio . In the whole peninsula no sets are manufactured , and imported receivers are subject to heavy duties . But India 's ryot ( farmer ) needs radio . He gets news only from bazaar gossip on market days , loses even that source when impassable roads through the four-month rainy season keep him home . So for three years All-India Radio ( controlled by the Indian Government ) has been trying to figure out a broadcasting scheme to enlighten rural India . <P> Obstacles to the scheme are many . A.I.R . has insufficient money for broadcasting , furnishing individual receivers , servicing them throughout India 's 1,800,000 square miles . Polyglot India speaks 200 languages , assorted dialects of each.No one program would be universally understood . And lastly , Indians have the idea radio is a new device to boost taxes . <P> A borrowed transmitter and some receiving sets lent by Marconi Co. in 1935 made possible the first experiment in taking radio to the ryot . A.I.R . boldly chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community sets , trumpeting Government propaganda . The villagers objected passionately , pegged rocks at the loudspeakers . That experiment was abandoned . <P> Last week the rural broadcasting scheme revived when the Government installed receiving sets in 120 villages of the 573-sq. - mi . Delhi district . Installed in village chowpals ( clubrooms , usually a raised earthen platform some 50 feet square with a portico at one end ) , instruments are kept in locked rooms , loudspeakers installed out of reach . Each evening at sunset an automatic device switches on the sets , turns them off after one hour of blaring . Automatic operation is necessary to prevent ryots from damaging the sets either through ignorance or anger. * <P> Delhi broadcasts in Urdu and Hindi . And A.I.R . hopes for a lingua franca that would make broadcasts from Delhi understandable to all of India . Stuck with the job of making radio interest the ryot is India 's Radio Chief Lionel Fielden . Dapper , dark-mustached , youthful Broadcaster Fielden came to Indian radio two years ago from Eton and Oxford by way of B.B.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty stories . What he gets from Etonian Fielden 's programs is clean amusement and instruction . The instruction , however , has to be well disguised . Instead of lecturing the ryot on the use of fertilizer , Delhi broadcasts a farce in which Dulari , the peasant , becomes a millionaire . Dulari strikes it rich by spreading his fields with bone manure . <P> *In Central Australia , a more radio-wise part of the British Empire with a rural isolation problem , flying physicians go out on radio calls . Ranchers , farmers , miners have pedal radio transmitters , take exhausting rides on stationary bicycles to generate power for calling the doctor by radio .
