The Canadian coast patrol boat Givenchy landed at Nanaimo , B.C. last week with the laconic statement that , for the benefit of fishermen , 2,200 sea lions had been killed during a three-week cruise . The Givenchy ' ? , crew used rifles ( borrowed from the Navy ) instead of machine guns , because a certain amount of sharpshooting is necessary . The carcasses were left where they fell . <P> Sea lion lovers on the Pacific Coast were further horrified last week when California 's Governor Frank Finley Merriam signed a law providing that the Fish &; Game Commission be " empowered to reduce the seal or sea lion herds by humane methods whenever such a course is deemed advisable , and to sell the animals , the pelts or carcasses . . . . " But reassurance came when it appeared that the Commission had no intention of using its destructive powers for several years , until the herds had increased to the point where control measures are necessary . The amendment also tightened the restrictions against killing or capturing the animals anywhere along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected . <P> Sea lions belong to the family Otariidae . The two species found off California are Steller 's sea lion ( Eumetopias jubata ) and the California sea lion ( Zalophns californianus ) . All trained ' ' ' seals " in circuses are actually sea lions . True seals , which belong to the family Phocidae can not be taught to toss or juggle a ball . California sea lions make the best circus performers ; the Stellers are too big , too pugnacious . An adult Steller bull weighs 1,500 to 2,000 lb. , a cow up to 1,000 lb . California bulls weigh up to 1,000 lb. , the cows up to 700 . <P> First white invaders of California found huge herds of sea lions on almost every rock . After 1860 the creatures were killed by thousands for their hides and oil . Soon it became unprofitable to hunt them and by the turn of the century they were on the increase again . Fishermen claimed that they ate great quantities of salmon and damaged many nets . Zoologists doubted this . One professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but squid . Fishermen were in the saddle , however , and forced the Fish &; Game Commission to start slaughtering . In 1909 some measure of protection was provided , but sporadic killing continued , many animals were taken for zoos and circuses , and hundreds of bulls were slaughtered every year for their genitalia from which Chinese manufacturers make a compound supposed to rejuvenate old men . The last census recorded only 6,363 Steller sea lions and 941 Californias . <P> There is no doubt that sea lions eat a few salmon , damage a few nets . But the California Fish &; Game Commission now believes that they do much more good than harm because they eat valueless and destructive fish such as morays , squid , octopi , dogfish , deepwater crabs . The Commission also believes that there are enough natural checks to keep sea lions from , increasing too fast . It takes six weeks for the pups to learn to swim , and many are drowned before they learn . Others are trampled to death by careless parents . Killer whales and sharks eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stomach , when opened , was found to contain the remains of eight sea lions .
