One morning last week , Pilot Hugh L. Woods of McCracken , Kans. raised a big Douglas transport plane off the airfield at Hong Kong . He had 13 Chinese passengers , including two women , a young child and a baby . Half-hour later , as the liner scudded over swampy Chinese delta lands , eleven Japanese planes came tearing in from the direction of the Ladrone Islands , and Pilot Woods promptly ducked into a cloud . When he reached the end of it , five Japanese planes were on his tail , power diving at the Douglas to force it down . " Japanese planes chasing us , " radioed Pilot Woods , then three minutes later : " Forced land river : all safe . " <P> Pilot Woods calculated his landing perfectly . The only thing he did not calculate correctly was the intention of the Japanese . The Japanese dived again &; again , spraying the downed plane with machine-gun bullets . The transport 's crew and passengers went overboard into the river and the Japanese planes fired on them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried away by a swift current and reached shore in safety . Radio Operator Joe Loh and a passenger , Chinese Civil Servant C. N. Lou , with a bullet in his neck , also escaped . Two days later , while the British gunboat Cicala stood by , Chinese extricated three bullet-riddled bodies from the transport , sunk in 40 feet of water . Among the missing were President Hsu Sing-loh of the National Commercial Savings Bank and General Manager Hu Pei-kong of the Bank of Communications . <P> The reason for the attack was soon deduced . Dr. Sun Fo , son of the late great Chinese Revolutionist Sun Yatsen , had recently visited Russia and toured European capitals seeking aid for the Chinese Government . Arriving in Hong Kong , he and his party booked passage with China National Aviation Corp . from Hong Kong to Chungking , China 's temporary capital . Japanese spies evidently informed the Japanese Air Force that an easy job of assassination could be carried out . <P> Unfortunately for the Japanese , Dr. Sun did not fly in Pilot Woods 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . ( 45% German-owned ) and flew in safety to Hankow , the Chinese capital against which Japan 's forces uneventfully continued their offensive ( TIME , May 9 , et seq . ) . <P> The Japanese at once announced that the Douglas was shot down " by mistake , " so a Japanese Army spokesman at Shanghai was asked by correspondents what transport planes in China could do to keep from being " mistakenly attacked " in future . Said he sagely : " The best thing they can do is not to be in the air ! " Later the spokesman gave the part-German Eurasia line on which Dr. Sun flew safely last week priceless advertising by implying that its planes will continue immune . At once China National Aviation Corp . canceled all flights . Its officials said it might resume business with departures at " secret hours " if customers wanted to buy tickets on that basis .
