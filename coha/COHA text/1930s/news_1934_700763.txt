txt Consolation , if not an outright virtue , in the silver-purchasing program is being found in some quarters . It will , it is believed , lead to an export of gold from this country , and so prove an important step toward achieving that " redistribution of gold " throughout the world which economists have long been advocating . That the silver-purchasing program will lead to the export of a certain tmount of gold is doubtless true . To achieve the objective of a 25 per cent ratio of silver to gold in the monetary stocks of the country will require the purchase , according to present esti , mates , of about 1,300,000,000 ounces of silver , of which approximately 1,000 , - 000,000 ounces will have to be obtained abroad . Treasury officials are said to estimate that this silver will cost an average of about 75 cspts an ounce . This would mean an expenditure of $750,000,000 . Last year the United States , according to the estimates of the Bureau of Commerce , had an excess of " exports " ? counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a similar excess this year , or a slightly larger one of , say , $300,000,000 , the purchase of $300 , - 000,000 in silver would balance the accounts , and any purchases in excess of that might be paid for out of our gold . ' While this is a possible result , it is not a necessary one . Gold movements do not work out in precisely this fashion . Instead of importing gold in 1933 , for example , to balance our export excess of other items , we actually exported $173,000,000 of gold , and had to redress the total balance by a net increase of our loans abroad of $336 , - 000,000 . Yet the purchase of silver will undoubtedly increase the pressure on the dollar compared with what it would otherwise have been , and it should provoke gold export , especially if it leads to any renewed fears of the stability of the dollar . Even if this movement should take place , however , its advantages as an offset to the other effects of the silverpurchasing program would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not directly intended or even foreseen by the great majority of the Congressmen who voted for the measure . If it were achieved , it would not help to solve the problem of redistribution unless the gold went to the countries that needed it most as currency backing . It would do no good if a great part of it went to France , for example . If it tended to gravitate toward the sellers of silver , most of it would probably go to India and China , which are not the countries most seriously affected by a lack of gold . As a means of redistributing the world 's gold supply , in short , the silverpurchasing program would be both inefficient and costly . And whatever may be the case politically , the silver we are buying from abroad is from the economic standpoint altogether needless . We shall be paying a grossly excessive price for it . Whatever gold redistribution is achieved through it must end as soon as the silver buying itself ends . The only sound way of securing a redistribution of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be by a reduction of our tariff barriers sufficient to let in an adequate volume of imports . Then we should be taking for our excess gold , and at normal market prices , goods that we could use , and not just another metal to be promptly buried in vaults .
