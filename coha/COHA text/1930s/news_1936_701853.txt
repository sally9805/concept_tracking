txt On March 3 the President sent his message to Congress proposing three new taxes . One was a new processing tax on farm products , one was a socalled " windfall " tax to get back the former impounded processing taxes returned to processors by court order , and the third was a proposal for a complete revolution in our methods of taxing corporations . It was the last that attracted most attention . The President suggested that the three existing Federal taxes on corporations  --  the graduated tax on net income , the excess-profits tax and the capital stock tax ? be repealed , and that in their place be put a single tax on Undistributed corporation profits . The purpose of this tax was to force the corporations to pay out practically all of their earnings in dividends so that these dividends could be taxed as part of the income of stockholders . The President expressed the belief that Such a revision of our corporate taxes would effect great simplification in tax procedure , in corporate accounting and in the understanding of the whole subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these suggestions now appears in the 249-page bill finally drafted by the Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee . The new processing tax makes no appearance at all ? on the theory , no doubt , that sales taxes on the necessaries of life are not advisable in an election year . No substitute tax is proposed to raise the revenue that these would have brought . The " windfall " tax is in the bill , officially labeled a " tax on unjust enrichment , " and is placed at 80 per cent . The new corporation tax proposal is also there  --  but it is indeed transmogrified . This " great simplification in tax procedure " is shown , for example , in the two tables of rates presented in the bill for corporations with net income in excess of $10,000 ( there are separate tables for smaller corporations ) . The bill offers the corporation a choice of figuring its tax on either of these tables . On the first table there are fifty-seven different rates applying to fifty-eight different percentages of undistributed net income to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety-nine different rates applying to a hundred different percentages of dividend credit to adjusted net income . Instead of being baffled , as under the present law , by having to figure a taX of 15 per cent on its total net income , the corporation merely looks up the table . If it has paid out 90 per cent of its income in dividends , it pays , according to this table , a tax of just 2.85714286 per cent . Suppose it has paid out 901,4 per cent of its income in dividends ? Then it must figure out the tax rate for itself , in accordance with the following simple formula : If the dividend credit is a percentage of the adjusted net income which is more than 86 and less than 100 ( and such percentage is not shown in the foregoing table ) the tax shall be a percentage of the adjusted net income equal to twosevenths of the amount by which 100 exceeds the percentage which the dividend credit is of the adjusted net income . It would seem impossible for clarity and simplicity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting fractions , an infinite possible number of percentages up to 100 which dividend payments might bear to net income , so there are an infinite possible number of different tax rates under the bill . Simplicity is piled on simplicity , moreover , by a long series of exemptions . Foreign and domestic banks and insurance companies and corporations in receivership get a flat rate of 15 per cent instead of all this , and corporations either under contract or undertaking to postpone dividends to pay off debt are entitled to a flat preferential rate of 22% per cent . There is no longer any excuse if the whole subject is not Clear to our citizens . The labyrinthine complications of this bill are , in fact , among its minor defects . Its central danger is that it must either bribe or coerce corporations to pay out practically all of their earnings in good years and have nothing left in bad years . This can only aggravate the violent swings from boom to depression . Finally , the Government is abandoning an assured collection of $1,100,000,000 from existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in its present form , the Treasury has not yet even attempted to estimate .
