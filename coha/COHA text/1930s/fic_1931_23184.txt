THE PEARL FISHERS A STORY BY GRIFFITH BEEMS J ITNEY and Al shed their shirts and pants on the riverbank . They were naked in a moment . Twelve-year-old Clark Cunningham took longer . He stepped out of his underwear , holding it so that it did not touch the ground , and sat down on the tussock-grass at the edge of the mud-bank and began to take off his black cotton ribbed stockings . " C'm on . Hurry up . " " Get a move on , Clarkie , " Al said , " or we 'll leave ya . " The July sun , high in the south , burnished the willow leaves and shimmered on the bodies of the three boys . The heat lay over the river like a sheet of distorting glass . The mudbank had dried into slabs , split by inch-deep cracks . Al worked loose a slab larger than his hand and heaved it into the river . " Shot put , " he explained , dusting off his hands on his legs . Underneath the dragging branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty chain , lay a homemade scow with one of its square ends settled in the mud . Al started walking the gunwale of the boat , holding out his arms for balance . Animated by his weight , the scow lifted out of the mud and tugged gently at its chain . Al had to step down . " Beteha ca n't walk the side far as I did , " he challenged , sitting down at the far end and shoving away the branch that dabbled yellowing leaves in the water . Clark , working at a knot in his shoelace , did not answer . Jitney had gone into the brake that grew higher than his head a little way back from the river . Jitney was fourteen . He was older and larger than the others . He came back with the oars . It was his boat . The muscles under his tanned skin were beginning to have the firm definition of a man 's muscles . He fitted the oars between their pegs , unlocked the padlock , and rattled the chain at Clark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what a slow poke . " " How about hidin ' the clothes ? " " Whatcha worryin " bout them for , Clarkie ? " Al said . " Traid somebody 'll swipe that belt o ' yours with the fancy buckle an ' initials all over it ? What d' ya call it , Clarlde  --  gold munnagram ? Ya ca n't even read it . Criminy , I would n't even be seen with it at a dogfight . Who give it to ya , Clarkie  --  Santy Claus ? " " Aw , cut it out , AL " " Cut what out ? " " You know what . C'm on , cut it out . " " Gim me a knife an ' cut it out . " " Put ' em back in the weeds , " Jitney said . " They 'll be all right . Nobody 'll take ' em . " " They know better'n to take me an ' Jitney 's clothes , do n't they , Jitney ? " " Hurry up , Clarkie . " Clark picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put his bare feet carefully among the broken weed stems and sharp dried grasses . " Don'eha put your shoes on shirt , " Al yelled after him , " or kill ya . " " Aw , leave said . Clark came back . " There 's nettles in there . " " They 're nothin ' , " Al said . " Why don'cha get your feet toughened up . Ya step around in there like ya was walkin ' on broken bottles . " " Those weeds are sharp . " " Your feet are no good . " " Well , I bet you wish you had shoes on when you got to walk around on hot cement sidewalks . " " They do n't hurt my feet . " " For the love o ' Mike , you two , " interrupted Jitney , " cut out the blabbin ' . If we 're goin ' after pearls , we got ta get goin ' . We ought a be up at Second Island now . Shove off , Clarkie . " Clark shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purchase . As he shoved , black mud , rough with leaf mold , oozed up and pulled at his feet . A leap seated him in the stern , and while the scow headed around he dragged his legs in the river , wiping the gumbo off his soles and out from between his toes . Jitney rowed . The wooden oarlocks creaked , and at every stroke an inch of tepid fishy-smelling water swashed hack and forth over the scow 's flat bottom . The Wapsipinicon River was a stone 's throw wide . It cut across a valley between hilly pastures and cornfields . The lowlands were grown over with swamp maple and willows , and the spring freshet had bung dead wood against the tree trunks . Several feet of gray mud bordered the river , marking low water . Opposite , where the cattle came down to drink and stand inthe river , the bank had been stamped bare and roughened with the casts of hoofs . In the lazy sunlight of the Iowa afternoon the Wapsipinicon looked green and deep . Dog days were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface like lint . Leaves drifting in the river scarcely moved . The oars dribbled and splashed ; water gurgled under the square blunt bow . Clark , sitting cross-legged on the stern locker , felt the summer quiet . A dragonfly veered across the river toward him . He dodged . " Whatcha duckin ' for a snake-feeder for ? " Al twitted . " I do n't want them flyin ' around me . " " Do n't be afraid of ' em . They wo n't hurteha . " " You are n't afraid of anything , are you , Al ? " Jitney , rowing , had his back to Al , and at this question he winked at Clark and pulled his mouth down sideways . " Naw . " " Some guy . " " You bet . Jitney knows , don'cha , Jitney ? " " Sure , you 're a ring-tailed snorter , " Jitney admitted . In half an hour they had rounded two bends . The hills following the river came closer and were wooded , and twice broke away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they fell back , leaving a flat , on which old man Strassman had got in thirty acres of corn , fenced with barbed wire , above the reach of the spring floods . The corn was in tassel and seemed to grow visibly in the heat . The third bend brought them to Second Island , which had washed away many years before , leaving only its name for the spot . Where the island had been , the Wapsipinicon , sweeping head on around a curve , ran eight to twelve feet deep and gouged into a treeless hill , fissuring it with clay gullies . The hill was steep and covered with outcroppings of limestone and patches of lavender horsemint in the burnt-out grass . A buggy road , cut in the clay halfway down the hill , edged along to Straasman 's farm , half a mile upriver . On the opposite side were willow flats ; the wilderness of pointed leaves hung straight down , unstirring . " This is where you mean , is n't it ? " asked Clark . " Yeh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , " Jitney said . " See that ? " He pointed to the shore . At the water 's edge , tied to a stake and running out into the stream , were two feet of fish-line . " Walt Parsons 's got out a throw line . " He rowed over to it . Al climbed into the stern and , pushing Clark aside , leaned over and tested the line . " Anything on it ? " " Ca n't tell yet . " He felt along it hand over hand . " It ai n't no throw line , " Al cried . " It goes clean across the river . By God , there 's somethin ' on it , " his fingers sensing a pull that was alive . Ten feet farther on he lifted the cord from the water and located the branch hook line , which jerked about , fretting crazy triangles in the water as he pulled at it . " Get outta the way , Clarkie . " Breaking the surface in a spatter of water drops , the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly rotating on the hook and flashing . " Channel cat , by God , " ejaculated Al . " I 'll bet ' e weighs four pounds . " " Yup . " Clark looked down at the chill eyes , at the coarse whiskers , the gaping mouth , and at the convulsed scaleless body . " You are n't goin ' to keep him ? " he asked . " Oh , no , " Al answered sarcastically , gripping the catfish by the gills so as to avoid the horns , while he worked the hook out of the jaw . " Walt Parsons will be mad as an old hen . " " What Walt do n't know wo n't hurt ' ina . Besides , that scrimy ol ' heel ai n't got no right to run a line like this . It 's agin the law to have ' em all the way across an ' with over six hooks . I 'll bet ' e 's got twelve hooks on this here line . Yeh , an ' he dynamites for fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back into the river . " We 'd better go up a bit farther , " Jitney said . Thirty yards upstream , at Jitney 's word , Clark threw overboard the rusty flatiron that anchored them . " Now I 'll show ya how t'get clams , " Jitney said to Clark . " All ya got ta do is t'f eel ' round in the mud at the bottom for ' em . " " Do n't they ever dose up on your fingers ? " " Ya see that ? " Jitney cried , thrusting out his hand . " I been clam fishin ' for three years . Lookit the mutilations . See that ? " He stuck his hand in front of Clark . " They 're the marks of clam teeth , " pointing solemnly at his unsearred fingers . " Clam teeth ! By God , Jitney , you 're good , " said Al , standing up in the stern , and in his laughter pretending to fall off , he dived . Twenty seconds after the river had recovered its stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tightly shut clam , black and dripping mud . " How 's that ? " rolling the clam along the bottom of the scow toward Clark . Clark tucked lip his feet involuntarily . " They 're awful ferocious , " said Jitney . " Jes ' like octopuses . Ya had a hard fight with ' im under water , did n't ya , Al ? " " Jeez , yes , " with a grin . " I thought I was a goner for a while the way ' e bit . But I ai n't afraid of ' era like some people . I know how t'handle ' em . I 'm an awful good clam diver . " Clark poked the clam with his toe . " I 'm not afraid of them either , " he said , picking it up and examining it . " Watch me , Clarkie . " Jitney stood up on the bow seat , ready to dive . " Lookit . Watch me . I 'll let ya see the moon rise in broad daylight . " Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow , he scraped some gumbo off the bottom of the scow and lumped it in his hand . As Jitney , holding himself otherwise under water , floated above the surface of the river his round naked buttocks , Clark threw . The mud struck . Jitney floundered and came up with a sputter . Just as Clark threw , Al wobbled the boat and teetered Clark off . He avoided a belly flop by turning in midair and fell sideways with a splash . The three heads , their hair matted over their foreheads , grinned at one another . " Nice work , " said Al . After the heat of the day the river was pleasantly cool . Clark felt himself expanding , pores opening , chest enlarging , legs becoming heavy , huge and far away , as he floated on his back , sculling now and then with his hands . Looking into the broad flat sky close over him , he seemed to float on something equally oceanlike , until the high-up sun glinted in his eyes and filled the sky with jiggling red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two small splashes , he knew that Al and Jitney had made surface dives . Throwing his legs into the air to weight his dive , he followed them downwards , swimming frog-fashion . The river was deep , much deeper than he expected . His lungs became pent up , enormous ; he released his breath in a chain of bubbles and in the final foot of his urgeful descent he touched bottom with his hands . He pushed upwards desperately and burst gasping into the sunlight . With one hand he pushed back his hair and wiped away the water , slightly acrid in his eyes and nose . Al had found a second clam . Treading water , he tossed it into the boat . " I got bottom , " Clark said , washing the mud from his fingers . " Keep it , " said Jitney . " We 're lookin ' for dams . " Clark swam a dozen feet upstream , took a series of long breaths , held the last one , and dived , kicking his legs out of the water until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , he quickly came slanting down to the bottom . He did not open his eyes but searched through the mud with his hands , making a spreading motion and crawling along slowly . Everywhere mud , unless he stuck his fingers deep into it ; then he could touch sand . His hands in their plowing sweep struck something solid , roughened with small ridges , half buried . He seized it . At the surface he washed the mud off the clam and , through a crack that closed as he watched , he saw the pinkish-white flesh . " I got one ! " he cried , laying it in the scow . Yep. ? " It 's a damn ' good place , ? said Al . " They 's lots here . " The heap of clams accumulated slowly . Clark tired first and drew himself up into the boat . He shivered in the sun , which lapped him like a friendly dog . He felt the water drying on him , his skin tightening under it , and his hair becoming muggy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al and Jitney went on diving . Along the road cut in the hillside , Erny Durgin , the hunchback who lived with old man Strassman , drove his mare and buggy . He waved his crooked short arm to them . They shouted hack . " D' ya know what 's the matter with Erny , " said Al to Clark , resting his hands on the side of the scow , " what makes ' im all humped up ' n ' everything ? I know all about it . The day before he was born his mother was goin ' out to the barn for somethin ' , an ' right on the back porch she saw a great big snappin ' turtle an ' she was so scared she jes ' yelled and yelled an ' fell down in a fit . So when Erny was born he looked jes ' like a turtle . " " That 's what makes him look like a turtle now ? " " Sure . Didn ' I jes ' tell ya ? " " How do you know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't it , Jitney ? Ai n't that right ? " By four o'clock , when Al and Jitney climbed into the boat , they had thirty-five or forty clams . Al rowed . They landed downstream , beaching the scow on a mudbank , and threw the clams out into a pile . From the stern locker Jitney took out three knives and they set to work opening the clams , inserting the knife blade near the hinge and hacking about till the clam loosened . After pulling the shells apart , they ran their fingers through the pockets in the flesh , feeling for pearls . In the fifth one Al found a slug , a small irregularly shaped pearl . Clark fingered it , unimpressed and disappointed , and dropped it into the Bull Durham tobacco sack that Jitney held out . There were a number of slugs already in the bag . Clark disliked the work . The clam flesh was slimy ; the water that ran off smelled sweetishly animal . Clark took care that none of it dribbled on any part of his naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rapidly ; the pile of opened clams became larger and larger . Another slug was found . Then Clark felt underneath the flabby meat something like a large sand grain . Tearing and prying the flesh with his fingers , he rolled out into his palm a pearl as large as the head of a carpet tack . " Hey , look ! " be shouted , jumping to his feet , careless that he had spilled the clam juice down his legs . " Look what I 've found . Look ! " Al and Jitney jumped up , and Jitney took the pellet from Clark and rolled it about in his hand as the three bent over it . " A pearl , by God , " Al ejaculated . " A real pearl . I 'll bet it 's worth a hundred dollars . bet we can get a hundred dollars for it easy . " " I found it , " Clark put in with pride . " It 's worth maybe twenty-five dollars , " Jitney said calmly . " Lemme take it , Jitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemme hold it jes ' once . " Jitney paid no attention except to shut his fist over the pearl when Al snatched for it . " I 'll give it back , Jitney . I 'll give it right back . " " No , let Jitney hold it , " said Clark proprietarily . " I guess I got a right t'hold it if I want to . " " You have not . Not if Jitney an ' me do n't want you to . I found it , did n't I ? " " It was jes ' luck you found it . I was jes ' gon na open that clam next myself when you took it . I 'll betcha almost ruined it the way ya opened it . Jeez , it was clumsy . I 'll betcha missed lots in them clams ya cleaned . " " That 's not so , Alfred Hayden , an ' you know it . An ' I found it an ' it 's mine . " " Say , how d' ya get that ' I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell it 's yours . Me an ' Jitney dug those clams an ' brung the boat an ' found the place an ' done all the work , didn ' we ? We jes ' let you come along . " " You 've got to be fair , do n't he , Jitney ? Whoever finds anything it belongs to . I found it an ' it 's mine . I 'm goin ' to give it to my mother . Is n't it mine , Jitney ? " Jitney made no answer at once but blew on the pearl , rubbed it dry on his arm , held it up toward the sun , squinted , and dropped it into the tobacco bag with the slugs . " Say , " bellowed Al , encouraged , and stepping towards Clark , " I 've had just about enough outta you . That ai n't your pearl an ' you shut up tryin ' to say it is when it ai n't . " " It is too mine . " " I said for you to shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are you goin ' t'shut up ? I 'm gettin ' tired hearin ' ya . I ai n't gon na keep my temper under control much longer . You 'd better shut up . Shut up now . " " I do n't have to . " " If you know what 's good for ya.  --  " " I do n't have to . " " Say , one more word outta you  --  you lily-fingered little shrimp  --  one more word an ' I 'll give it to ya . You ai n't got no mama to run bawlin ' to out here . You 'll get it right . " " That 's not so , " shrieked Clark , frightened , and feeling the uncontrollable angry tears coming into his eyes . " You  --  you better look out , Alfred Hayden . " " Lookit ' im , Jitney . Ca n't keep the tears back . Ca n't keep the tears back . Bawlin ' already . Bawlbaby . " " If you want to fight , you just go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big -- you big  --  snot . " They squared off at each other . They were about the same size . Clark stood with his left foot forward , as he remembered having read that a boxer should , although it felt awkward . The hot tears kept coming and he worried because he could not remember whether his thumbs belonged inside or outside his clenched fingers . Al got into a crouch with his fists down near his knees . He lowered his head and swayed back and forth , growling and glaring at Clark from under his eyebrows . Jitney went on opening clams . " You just touch me once . Just once , " Clark repeated . Swaying and shifting , Al stepped on a piece of clam meat . He slipped . Itunbalanced him , rattled him , made him angrier . He set himself , screwed up his face and swung a haymaker . It missed . Clark had not ducked , but it missed by four inches . " Yaali , " jeered Clark , advancing a step . " You just hit me once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al fell back . His attitude had tired him . " Why , " he delivered , straightening up and pretending to be amused , " you little lop-sided , hammered-down , sawed-off , cock-eyed , yellow-bellied slob . If ya was n't so small , I 'd knock the goddamn stuffin 's right outta ya . I 'd be ashamed Oa a little runt like you . " " Yaah  --  yaah . You just try it . Go on  --  I dare you to touch me . I dare you to . " " Yeh , you jes ' make a pass at me an ' I 'll knock your block off . " " Yeh , I dare you . " " I dare ya , " Jitney sensed the lull . " Say , you two , " he broke in , " cut it out . What d' ya think you 're doin ' , anyhow . There ai n't no use fightin ' . Listen . I got a fair proposition . " The fighters lowered their fists . " These here pearls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found by all of us . We all did somethin ' about it and Clark found it , didn'tcha , Clark ? " " Sure I found it . " " Well , what I say is , we three are all good swimmers an ' I got a boat , so we ought a make a company , sort of , No pearl fishin ' , an ' when we get through we 'll sell this little bag an ' split what we get three ways  --  thirty-three and one-third per cent all round . Now what 's the matter with that ? That 's fair enough . What d' ya say , Clark ? " " I wo n't be in any company with Al , " said Clark . " Not after the names he called me . " " He didn ' mean nothin ' by ' em . Did ya , Al ? Did ya ? " " No , " said Al sulkily . " Make him take them all back , " demanded Clark of Jitney . " I take ' em all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " " By God , I said I took ' em back . By God , I ai n't gon na ? " " Aw , go on , Al , " urged Jitney , " go on . Go ahead . " " Aw hell , anything eplease ya . I eat ' em . I said it now . That ought a satisfy ya . " " All right , " said Clark . " We 're partners , then , for pearl fishin ' . " " You bet , " said Jitney . " We 're goin ' t'find lots o ' real pearls . I 'll bet by the end of summer we have three pearls apiece . An ' this time Clark gets the catfish to take home , nex ' time Al can get it , if they 's any on the line , an ' then me . " They finished the remaining clams amicably and pushed off to return to their clothes . Clark rowed . " I can row good , ca n't I , Jitney ? " Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure , " said Jitney reassuringly . " You 're a regular ring-tailed snorter . " Behind them , over the heap of opened clams , a cloud of flies buzzed . A faint smell went up from the pile to the late afternoon sun . SIC TRANSIT . . .
