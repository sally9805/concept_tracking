&gt;Ohio 's ambitious Republican Senator Taft strove vainly last week to prevent the Senate from doubling U. S. Housing Authority 's $800,000,000 loan capital for slum clearance . Half that much more would be enough , he thought . U. S. H. A. is authorized for the next 60 years to give municipalities outright rent subsidies , which help them pay interest &; principal on their loans . Senator Taft thought that upping the annual rent subsidy from $28,000,000 to $58,000,000 ( instead of the $73,000,000 ) was plenty . The Senate repeatedly overrode the Senator , one of whose strongest arguments was that slum clearance discriminated in favor of urban families , left poor country folk in the cold . <P> With only ten minutes of debating time left , New York 's Democratic Senator Wagner , slick as five foxes , thereupon executed a breath-taking maneuver . He introduced an amendment directing U. S. H. A. to devise a program , and spend upon it any part of its total $1,673,000,000 in borrowed capital and rent subsidies it sees fit , " for families of low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdone , begged that the amendment be delayed . But other Senators quickly whooped it into the bill , then whooped the whole through 48-to-16 . <P> Thus was a vast new chapter in farm relief written in less time than it takes a farmer to cast his vote . <P> &gt;Quick to make political capital of the House Republicans ' heavy vote last fortnight for the fantastically expensive Townsend pension plan was Democratic National Chairman Jim Farley . Radiorating last week from Washington , he cried : " The only excuse suggested for the 55 Republican potential squanderers is that they knew the Democrats would defeat the bill . . . . " With the Townsend chimera dead , the road was clear for passage of amendments to the existing Social Security setup . The Administration favored amendments to increase immediate outlays , decrease intake in order to keep Social Security reserves et a practicable $4,000,000,000 to $5,000,000,000 instead of the dreamy $47,000,000,000 envisioned by 1980 . One change would raise to $20 the $15 maximum which the U. S. now gives to match old-age handouts by the States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taking full advantage of the $15 maximum . Representatives from poor States were hot for raising the proportion of the Federal contribution . Mississippi 's Colmer led off by demanding four Federal dollars for each State dollar up to a Federal maximum of $20 . The Republican " potential squanderers " stood fast with the Administration 's men and Mr. Colmer lost his motion 174-to-97-Arkansas 's Terry , another Democrat , asked that the U. S. advance $10 of the first-$15 of pension grants , thence match dollar for dollar up to a $40 total . Again the " squander squad " stood fast : Mr. Terry was beaten 131-to-65 . Even when Republican Woodruff of Michigan asked two Federal dollars for each State one , up to a maximum pension of $45 , most of his party mates remained frugal ( 142-to-79 ) . Together with other amendments the Administration 's 50-50 , $20 maximum was safe .
