No sooner had U. S. publishers congratulated themselves on the outcome of the Louisiana newspaper tax suit before the U. S. Supreme Court in Washington , D. C. fortnight ago than there began in Washington , Pa. a criminal libel trial which most U. S. newspaper owners looked upon as another major threat to their liberties . <P> The Philadelphia Inquirer is known as the ' ' Bible of Pennsylvania Republicanism . " In the heat of last autumn 's state campaign , the Inquirer declared that " law partners and associates of Charles J. Margiotti , Attorney General and political bludgeon of the Earle Democratic Administration , are out to grab a tax collection authority which may net them millions in the next four years . " <P> Attorney General Charles Joseph Margiotti is said to control the votes of 200,000 Pennsylvania Italians . A candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor in 1934 , he turned Democrat after losing the primary , won a place in Governor Earle 's " Little New Deal . " When he read in the Inquirer that his law partners were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of collecting back taxes for a worth-while percentage of the receipts , he declared : " I am not , nor ever have been , a party either directly or indirectly to any such plan . . . nor does any such plan exist , " demanded from the Inquirer a full retraction unless it wanted to be sued for criminal libel . <P> No retraction was printed , and on the eve of last autumn 's elections , the Inquirer 's President Charles A. Tyler and Editor John T. Custis were haled before a Jefferson County grand jury in Mr. Margiotti 's home grounds . " A desperate attempt to muzzle the Inquirer in the midst of a political campaign ! " wrote Editor Custis . The Inquirer got a change of venue to Washington County and a postponement . <P> Fortnight ago , in an atmosphere bristling with Pennsylvania politics , the Inquirer showed up at the Washington courthouse with a scrappy lawyer named Ralph B. Evans . Plaintiff Margiotti was flanked by the pick of the State 's prosecutors . Lawyer Evans put the Attorney General on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given advice in some of the tax cases the Inquirer had originally mentioned . When the Attorney General persisted in elaborate asides to the jury , Lawyer Evans infuriated him by leaning back , hooking his thumbs in his vest and observing : " I have the bulge on you , Mr. Margiotti . I can talk to the jury after your mouth is closed . " <P> On its part , the prosecution introduced witnesses to show that the motives and methods of Charles Joseph Margiotti were above reproach , that the Inquirer had maliciously defamed him . When it came to charging the jury last week , Judge William S. McLean Jr . announced , among other things , that the Inquirer 's article was privileged-i. e. , the paper was entitled under Pennsylvania law to inform the public in full about Mr. Margiotti 's activities as lawyer and Attorney General , so long as the information was true , unless the jury believed that the publication was maliciously made . After more than 28 hours , the jury acquitted the Inquirer of criminal libel .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
