A we predicted , all eyes were upon Mrs. Stanwood Menken at the Beaux-Arts Ball . And lo , she appeared in cloth of gold  --  the gold threads frayed , yes , but still gold . It was an omen . Another thing we remember about the affair ( and this , we confess , puzzled us somewhat ) was that prior to the Ball a Dutch Treat dinner dance was given in the roof garden of the Waldorf . It was not quite clear to us whether the " Dutch " quality of the dinner was meant to harmonize with the Early New York motif of the Ball , or whether it had something to do with the city as it is today . MHE other day we entered lightly I into a colossal emporium in West Forty-fourth Street . A large sign had attracted us . " Newspapers from all parts of the world , " it read . " Give us an Evening Sun , " we said to the clerk . The clerk congealed slowly before our eyes .

Except for giving us the word " decibel " ( which we have already carried out to three decibel places ) , this is no boon , as far as we arc concerned . T5 our timorous cars , the tinkle of milk bottles at dawn has always been one of the least objectionable of all city noises : it breaks in on bad dreams at exactly the right moment to give its assurance that the honest errands of the town are beginning , that the terrors of the dark are dissipated , and that burglars have gone home to bed . As a child we owed an inestimable debt of gratitude to the milkman , the hooves of whose slow steed meant daybreak and peace and security . We loved every decibel of his rattling bottles and his forthright tread . It made bed seem warm and fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved you well ! ASTUDENT of simplicity , we have often been amazed at the world of art  --  its variety , its irrelevancies . We have just been studying , for instance , the acmouncement of an exhibition at L'Elan Galleries , including a long list of patrons and patronesses . To us it is a peculiarly baffling list , lumping together such patronizers as Malcolm Cowley , Mrs. Sidney Borg , Mrs. Ely Culbertson , Adolph Lewisohn , e e cummings , Grand Duchess Marie , Michael Paterno , and Hope Williams . From such a list it is difficult to know what to expect of the exhibition ; yet we should love to sce all these people together in a room , even if there were not a picture on the wall .

Things arc looking up . We have been getting pretty sick of people simply writing us ( as they ' once in a while do ) : " Your magazine is very nice . " Those arc empty words , and we are getting old , and times are lean . We want fruit cake , or Pfe ' rename , or even a medium-boiled egg . ONE of the deadly ideas that arise from these bilious times is the notion that if only everybody would run out and buy something  --  no matter what  --  trade would revive and the nation 's health would be restored . All sorts of necromantic devices for restoring trade are being proposed by Big Butter and Trade Restorers .

In the years of our grandeur , after the war , when the country had its thumbs in the armholes of its vest , that pleasant theory of economics was good enough . It is no good any more . The old blood of our fallen enemies has begun to stink , the proud walls of our political aloofness have begun to collect cold , drafty airs . If our businessmen go on imagining that nothing more is wrong with the situation than that a few Americans are afraid to buy a new shirt , then it wo n't he long before life gets much more real , and a lot of us who own electric iceboxes will be glad to turn the switch off and crawl inside to keep warm . 7-11 A YOUNG lady hailed a cab with al a Negro driver and told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fine fettle , but when they were almost at 713 the driver found that the curb in front of it was already lined with cars . He swung in behind them and his fare got out . She discovered him looking at the number of the building they had stopped at with a beatific grin . She held out a dollar and he came out of his reverie  --  but not to take the dollar . " No , lady , " he said . " Not me .

Cloth of WE said something recently about V V the wistful Prince Charlie of Belgium , who wandered about America incognito in one suit . The tale reminded Mr. Basil Livingston , retired lieutenant of the British navy , now living here , about something that happened when he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1916 . At the beginning of one term , there appeared a new and fair-haired young cadet . It was observed that his kit was not very extensive  --  indeed , it was further observed that he did n't change his " fugs " ( English cadet for underwear ) as ofeen as regulations required , and finally one of his dormitory mates told the cadet captain in charge . The wretched blond youth was ordered to stand by his sea chest one afternoon for an inspection . This was carried out by an ancient and venerable chief petty officer , of the sailing-ship type , and revealed that the young man only had one pair of socks , one suit of underwear , and one shirt , The contents of his sea chest inventoried one pair of pajamas , nothing more . Regulations called for at least six pair of each of these articles , and was the chief petty officer hastonished and did he hask ' arsh questions ? It came out that the cadet 's papa had thought that the British navy was a rough life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a softie , so he told him not to take more than one suit of everything . This unhappy little blond was Prince Charles , himself . The poor boy has had a hard life . Old Metal LST week , we dropped in to see how things went at one of the auction sales of the Provident Loan Society . It was the watches , gold jewelry , and silverware day ; the diamonds had all gone the day before . About fifty customers , mostly named Epstein , were gathered in James P. Silo 's auction-room in Forty-sixth Street , buying watches , clocks , rings , gold spectacle-cases , and knives and forks . Most of the articles , all of which were pawned with the Provident Society and not redeemed , apparently dated back fur years and had been dug up out of trunks when the pinch came . There were a good many old gold watches , with little keys to wind them . Most of them were out of order , as were most of the ornamental silver clocks . Had n't run for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the metal and it made little difference whether the works were working , or even whether they were all there . Gold-mesh bags were popular , too , and brought good prices . The buyers knew the value of the pieces offered at least as well as the auctioneers , who worked in relays . When they thought starting prices too high , they were inclined to hoot . They were inclined , also , to raise bids a quarter at a time , although the auctioneers asked them over and over not to quibble about quarters . They had come to quibble about everything , however . They quibbled with the auctioneer and with one another , and while we were there two of them got in a fight over a bid and had to be separated . Looking over the catalogue while the Epsteins fought and laughed among themselves , and while they were told that " the auctioneer loves IL cheerful bidder , " we found that most of the wedding rings offered had been pawned at the Fordham office . Lots of the older articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  came from Brooklyn . We did n't see any romance about ; the young couples we had thought might drop in to pick up wedding rings cheap were n't there . The rings , anyway , were the wide , heavy bands of yesterday . We suspected a good deal of yesterday 's romance was represented by some of the things which had found their way to the Provident Society . The East Sixtieth Street office  --  the Provident people have offices all over the place  --  sent some articles which had come from Tiffany 's once , and from Black , Starr &; Frost , There was one silver-mounted manicure set which had come from Tiffany 's and we felt there was drama in its decline and fall , if we only knew . One of the Epsteins got it . The day before , we discovered from the catalogue , a lorgnette with two hundred and thirty-seven diamonds , also originally from Tiffany 's , had been knocked down . We said " Well , well " and thought a little of the snows of yesterday . Innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town in Westchester , following right on the heels of several similar thefts , all unsolved , and the po-lice decided to throw out a dragnet the way they do . It pulled in a nice young man whowas motoring around in a nice little car trying to sell oil-burners . He had parked somewhere and was study-ing a map of Westchester and this looked suspicious to a po-lice officer . The young man explained that he sold oil-burners . After some thought , the cop told him to tell that at Headquarters . They drove to Headquarters and there the salesman explained that he sold oil-burners . All this time he had n't been given an ink-ling of what was wrong , and he was becoming pretty much annoyed . The desk sergeant thought a while and said he guessed the young man bet-ter tell his story to the chief , so he was taken in to the chief , with whom he was left alone . When this dig-nitary asked him what he did , the young man not only said he sold oil-burners but grimly went into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end , the chief buzzed for the sergeant and the arresting officer to come in , and they came . The chief looked at them , with the expression of a man who has made a decision , and said , with finality : " This man sells oil-burners . " That having been decided , the salesman departed . Them Bells YOU 'LL remember our tale of the Russian bells in Lowell House at Harvard : how the Russian bellringer who was brought over to ring them fell into a mood , took to drinking ink , and had to be sent home , go that the bells have never been rung . Nobody so far has denied that the Russian bellman drank ink , but several people up there have written us indignantly that the bells do ring . It comes out that every Monday evening at six-thirty Lowell House holds High Table , which is a secret  --  and , we should imagine , sad  --  sort of dinner , attended only by House members and invited dignitaries . After this function , the High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a solemn procession up into the tower to see and hear the bells . The most detailed description of the bells which our story brought Forth comes from Mr. Frederic W. Swift , of Leverett House , so if it 's wrong , write him . He says there are fifteen bells , four of which are attached to a stick which is held in the right hand and jiggled ; nine others are attached by a complicated system of wires and pulleys to nine chains which are worked separately by the left hand ; the fourteenth is worked by the right foot , and it takes two men to operate the fifteenth and largest . " The usual procedure , " relates Mr. Swift , " is for the operator to start jiggling with his right hand , proceed down the scale with his left , bring his right foot into play , and nodhis head for the two strong men to start ringing Bell No. 15 . " No tune results , but there is a terrific clangor . As soon as all the bells get going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Leverett , Winthrop , Adams , and Claverly Houses , and even in Lowell House itself . Students whistle and shriek , alarm clocks ring , and everybody wails " Rinehart ! " ? the old Harvard wail . The bedlam lasts for about ten minutes , after which the High Tablers leave the belfry and the students take a stiff drink of ink and go back to work . Depression in Gaming ALOCAL boy returning from Eu- rope rushed from the boat to our office to tell us of an innovation in the Casino at Monte Carlo . In the largest salle de jeu there now stands a slot machine exactly like those found in the less sumptuous speakeasies of our own sporting city . It is placed on the north side of the room , directly behind the table at which Charles Wells won hundreds of thousands of prewar francs and inspired the song about the man that broke the hank at Monte Carlo . One drops a franc in the machine and , after the lever is pulled , the proper combination of cherries , grapes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as ten francs . The man who told us about it was standing before it , staring , when another American came up and said : " I guess the Brooklyn boys must have muscled in . " Gangsters are supposed to have charge of the machines in Brooklyn , which Monte Carlo ought to know in case it is asked to come across with a cut . Yuvbairg THE Swedish so- prano , G8ta Ljungberg , did n't sleep much the night after her debut : telephoned down for the morning papers at six A.M. , before they had reached her hotel . When she read the critics ' notices , she was pleased as she had n't been pleased since Queen Victoria of Sweden told her she " had God in her throat . " That was when she was eight years old and had sung " Home Sweet Home " in English with no idea what the wordsmeant . The Queen gave her five crowns , too . Miss Ljungberg has always been musical  --  her father played the accordion  --  and , after the usual training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was around twenty-five . She has sung all over Europe ; the past five years in the Berlin State Opera . She was married in 1922 , diorced in 1928 ; no children . She has some thirty riles ready at any time and takes Swedish exercises every morning . " I do n't like to he fatter , dat 's why I do dem . " She drives a car for pleasurebut did n't bring it to New York . " I always go with the subway . " She has found a long-lost brother since she came to New York . They all thought he was dead . He called at the Metropolitan when he read about his sister . Turned out to be married and comfortable , but a bad letter-writer . Miss Ljungberg put the meeting down to good luck , and concluded it probably came about because she had been very careful to get out of bed on the right side that morning , put on her right stocking first , and had n't gone back to her apartment for anything she had forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstitions we have encountered in a long time . If she had gone back to her apartmentthat day , everything would have been ruined ; she would n't have found her brother . And if she had met an old woman first thing when she went out , her brother would have been dead . Meeting an old woman first thing when you go out is the worst of all omens . The only thing to do then is spit three times  --  not necessarily at the old woman  --  which takes the curse off a little . As Miss Ljungberg does it , the spitting is really a lip movement . When she left her hotel to make her first appearance , she did n't meet any old women for quite a distance and she did meet several old men . That 's why the debut went off so well . Miss Ljungberg is accompanied here by her friend Frau Gerda Bten , who came over to stand by . The night of the debut she stood by nobly . " A hundred times I ask : Gerda , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did I look fat ? Did I look thin ? ' " The friend stood by nobly the first night they were in this country , too . The singer found that the Hotel Ansonia , where she is staying , swayed a lot all through the night . She was prepared for this , having heard that New York buildings , being so high , swayed with the wind , but nevertheless it made her restless . She mentioned it to the hotel people next day , just to let them know she 'd noticed it . They suggested it might be a swaying left over from her rather rough voyage on the Europa . Sure enough , it was . She is going back in April after making eighteen appearances at the Metropolitan , and expects to be seasick again , even if she does n't meet an old woman on the way to the boat . Uncertainty THE confusion among businessmen seems to be pretty widespread these days . This little generalization is suggested by the report of a friend who , of a breezy evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue in the Twenties to light a cigarette . The light of his match revealed a sign . It was headed " To Our Patrons , " and read : " In a few days we will be glad to announce to our many friends our decision of the whereabouts of our business . " The firm had signed its name , being sure of that anyway . That was something . La Cellophane YOU may get some satisfaction out of knowing who is to blame for the hundreds of thousands of man-hours this nation has spent taking things out of cellophane wrappings . It was n't an American who invented it , Hail Columbia ! It was a Frenchman , a Frenchman of the good old French name of Brandenherger  --  Monsieur J. E. Brandenberger . He came upon it while experimenting with rayon back in 191/8 . Be had . developed it to pretty much its present state by 1912 . He named it , too  --  la cellophane . The French government used it during the war , taking the entire production to make eye-pieces for gas masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . They made it waterproof and now everything wears it . It is made of wood pulp , as you may know , and it keeps everything out , from germs up , and is really very valuable , if annoying . It has all sorts of uses besides the familiar ones . They are making hats out of it , artificial grass and water scenes for the stage , raincoats for emergency use , costumes for burlesque-show choruses , and coverings to protect table tops from glass marks . Kosher cellophane is made to wrap up kosher products . You can make your own flypaper by smearing it with glue and laying it over something flies like to eat . It 's very effective . The flies do n't see it until they are stuck on it . In Oregon a fishing guide discovered that a little piece torn off a cigarette package and stuck on a hook fools trout and salmon . It looks like nothing at all to flies , but it looks like flies to salmon . Nature is very wonderful . A man on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rolled tightly , would piece out a wire from the coil to the distributor . It got him home . Somewhere  --  these discoveries are made all over the world  --  a man found that if you wrap a cigarette tightly in cellophane you can tie it in a knot , and that long-felt need was taken care of ; Many trick things are done with it . A Canadian automobile company once wrapped a whole automobile in it , put the car in a window , and attracted attention . The original du Pont cellophane plant has been greatly increased in size and two new plants built . The business keeps on growing . The name , incidentally , is a coined one , " cello " being suggested by " cellulose " and " phane " coming from " window . " Get it ? M. Brandcnberger is living prosperously and happily in Paris , an official of La Cellophane , the company which manufactures his invention and hears its name .

The British customs inspector who examined the jar was puzzled . He called his chief . The chief smelled the liquor , stuck his finger into it , and licked off a drop or two .
