The French High Command , normally taciturn , last week authorized an extended commentary which contained both a major boast and a major threat . It said : <P> " Our work of fortification , carried out from the start of war at an accelerated pace , is now virtually complete . The essential purpose of this work was , in a sense , to double the Maginot Line . Thus , in the north of France and in the Jura Swiss border there has been constructed a line of defense that may well be described as formidable . <P> " From the first of this month our new line of fortifications seems to have removed any hope the enemy may have entertained either of crossing or flanking the Maginot Line . <P> " Furthermore , the completion of all this work places the French High Command in a position to attempt maneuvering operations , going beyond the defensive phase on the day and at the hour it may suit it eventually to fix . " <P> Only to laymen do the French military use the phrase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forts and ramparts is called " The Permanent Fortified Positions . " In physical terms , the commentary meant that these positions have now been lengthened at both ends , and also increased in depth , on the same principle as the Siegfried Position-a network of strong points capable of being extended backward indefinitely should they be cracked in front . In psychological terms , the mention of " maneuvering " and " beyond the defensive phase " seemed to mean : " Germans , not only can you neither crack nor flank us , but we are now so strong we can move out to meet you in Belgium or The Netherlands or Switzerland , or anywhere else that you may strike-even in the Balkans-and indeed we might move there against you without waiting for you to strike . " <P> The return to Paris last week from the Near East of General Maxime Weygand , to report on his preparations for an Allied Army there , added interest to the commentary . With Finland getting hers from Russia , and with Rumania apparently earmarked next , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamelin said he feels free now for a war of maneuver-somewhere . His High Command made further show of this free feeling by sending home 3,000 of 27,000 civilian doctors who were mobilized for service in the West . Perhaps spring will find some of these doctors in French Syria with Weygand 's Army , ready to stem a Russian march into Bessarabia , or to drive at Germany through the postern gate of erstwhile Poland .
