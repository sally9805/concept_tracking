txt Whether the Senate reduced the stock pile appropriation from $100,000,000 to $40,000,000 on the ground of economy or on that of unnecessary defense , I do n't profess to know . But on either ground , it seems to me , the action was inadvisable It was Adam Smith who said that " defense is better than opulence . " When a country is in the midst of a nar , expense is no consideration at all in prosecuting hostilities to the limit . Cost is of no account , equally , when a nation is under the threat of war . Now the United States is neither at war nor in any danger of being invaded . But the situation is such that economy is no argument against wise measures of defense . The situation I refer to is the constant threat of war elsewhere . In that case there would most certainly be an instantaneous repercussion upon the import into the United States of those commodities which come from abroad . So it would be the part of wisdom to take forehanded measures against such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stock along the lines of the Thomas bill which the Senators have just trimmed . That is the kind of defense that nobody could call equally offensive , as some of the defense items are . , f A Those who think that the United States is entirely self-sufficient are , of course , quite mistaken . They ought to read a handy little book called " Dependent America " written some years ago by William C. Redfield soon after he resigned his post as Secretary of Commerce . Mr. Redfield left his job with a vivid realization of America 's dependence . I myself once gave a list in this space of the baker 's dozen import materials that go into a simple hand telephone . Most of us might welcome for a space a surcease from telephones , but we would grant , I take it , that business would be more than a little disturbed by any interference with the telephone-building industry . Not all of America 's import materials should be stocked , of course . But there is a list of " strategic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program of national defense , and it has already been made out by responsible military heads . Such a list includes manganese ore , chromium ore , mercury , mica , tin , rubber , tungsten ore . cobalt , radium , coconut shells , among other things . In the World War the United States was caught short of some of these materials . The predicament would be greater in another emergency , because there would he no time for preparation . The old warmakers used to show third parties some consideration , sucn as warnings , ultimatums , war declarations , and so on . The process went on , in other words , according to Hoyle or the Marquis of Queensberry . But in these latter days everything about v  --  ar has been " outlawed , " except the foul thing itself . Warmakers strike first , and do n't bother to give other nations a chance to ward off any ill effects upon their industry Thus the effect upon the United States or one of these undeclared wars might be much worse than it was 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels would have to enter danger zones for supplies , and Uncle Sam would have to pay dearly in cash , too . A A As I argued some time ago , the commodities that the United States is buying and storing are the reverse of strategic . They are gold and silver . In the last war Mr. Lloyd George used to talk about " silver bullets , " but he did n't mean that seriously . He was allowing a Celtic fancy to denominate superiority of resources As a matter of fact , neither gold nor silver would be of the slightest use in place of the above list . And those who are grumbling about the acquisition of the " useless hoards " of the precious metals have a simple method of lessening the inflow by backing the acquisition of something more useful . Gold and silver are useful mainly for what they will buy . Putting in a stock pile is a wise idea for another reason . Fear is rampant in the United States no less than in less favored lands . Not so very long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic coast ran out of doors in their alarm ( even , I seem to recall , in their nightshirts ) when a radio skit enacted an invasion from Mars . Knowledge that America had created a stock of necessary imports would help assuage such fears . But $40.000,000 is altogether inadequate for a buying program , as the House must by this tune know when its turn comes to vote .
