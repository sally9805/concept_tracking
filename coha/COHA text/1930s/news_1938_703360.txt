txt Eventual unification of Canada 's two great transcontinental railway systems is inevitable in the national interest . Sir Edward Beatty , president of the Canadian Pacific Railway . declared yesterday in a statement to the Senate committee studying the railroad problem . Such a step would leave the Dominion with what for all practical purposes would amount to a single transportation system , including the privately owned and profitable Canadian Pacific and the government operated Canadian National whose perennial deficits constitute a heavy charge on the national treasury . " The only reason for accepting unification , " Sir Edward stated , " is that it is in the national interest and it is in the national interest because every measure which will reduce the cost of carrying on the vital task of transportation in Canada is in the national Interest . It is in the national interest because the public finances of this country need relief and unification will afford it . " Rail Labor Savings Discussing the labor problem created by unification . the railway executive pointed out that it had been estimated that total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17% . He explained that the annual turnover of labor on the C. P. R. system amounts to almost 5% . Assuming that the Canadian National experiences about the same rate of severence , Sir Edward pointed out that in the five years or more which it would take to bring about unification it would be possible to reduce staffs by more than the unification savings by following a policy of not replacing workers . Sir Edward emphasized that hopes the Government-owned Canadian National Railways could sustain themselves never had been fulfilled . In 1917 , the Drayton-Acworth commission had asserted the gross income of the lines which were amalgamated into the Canadian National Railway was $100,000,000 and with an additional $50,000,000 gross Income annually , the system should carry itself . Five years later , the C. P. R. president continued , gross income had more than doubled , but the deficit of the C. N R. had increased from $12,500,000 to $58,000,000 . There was a deficit of about $30.000.000 that year . Vital Unification Principles Optimists had continued in recent years to hope the Government-owned road would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always felt that the- problem should be dealt with on the basis of the actual existing situation . " A committee of C. P. R. officers had estimated $75,300,000 a year could be saved by unifications on the basis of 1930 as a normal year . Sir Edward said he had been prepared to accept substantial accuracy of this statement . having regard to the extent of unnecessary duplication of railway services . There were certain general principles , Sir Edward said , which were vital to a plan of railway unification . One was that the two railway companies should continue to own their present properties . There was no suggestion that the C N. R. should be transferred to C. P. R. ownership , or the C. P. R. to governmental ownership . The securities of the two companies would remain in their present ownerships and no question was involved to the value of the properties or of any new capital setup . No Stock Return Guaranty No guarantee should be given to the C. P. R. of a return on its stock or other capital issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. president said he did not see any necessity of giving shareholders any protection beyond a reasonable opportunity for the company to earn a reasonable profit Each group of owners should continue to receive under unification the net earnings which past experience indicated their company would have received as an independent institution and the additional net earnings made available by unification would be shared between them on an equitable basis . He said he assumed that the Government would receive directly at least half these sav-ingsAdequate provision should be made to prevent the unified company from neglecting Its duty as a. public utility and depriving any community of necessary railway services . This could be arranged by adding , if necessary , to the strength and powers of the Board of Railway Commissioners . The only alternative which had been offered to unification as a means of accomplishing economies , the railway president said , was cooperation for which a basis had been laid by legislation a few years ago . " In view of the comparatively small savings accomplished by cooperation , " he said . " I believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with the system , not with the execution , even though that has been disappointingly slow . " It is not surprising to me that this should be the case . Cooperation and competition scarcely seem suitable bedfellows . Cooperation and compulsion seem almost less suited for companionship . It is a fact that the two great railway systems are competing for business and . t is inevitable that in any attempt to unify their services piecemeal there will be certain difficulties . " Main advantages of unification were set out by Sir Edward as follows : ( 1 ) Considerable relief for the national Treasury . ( 2 ) Unification would permit the C. P. R. to earn a fair return on prudently invested capital . ( 3 ) The savings of unification would leave both railway companies in a better position to carry on the inevitable process of modernization and improvement . ( 4 ) Stabilization of the railway industry would remove the imminent danger of forced abandonment of light traffic lines to an increased extent . ( 5 ) Unification would permit stabilization of the employment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
