to dry ! I 'll go up and get you some things to change into ! " Mrs. Wright went upstairs . She went to her late husband 's wardrobe and got down a nice suit he had hardly worn . She picked up some underthings from a chest of drawers . Mrs. Wright was not the sort of widow who sells her late husband 's things the moment he dies . She is aware they may come in useful some day . She got a change for Tommie , too , and went downstairs , with a heap of clothes over each arm . She forgot to knock at the kitchen door . With such crowds of people laughing and crying and chattering all over the place , it was not to be wondered at that she forgot to knock at the door . She walked straight in . Both the men had removed all their clothes . Tommie lay on his back on the rag mat , crowing and kicking his feet up in the air . Benny stood over him , balanced on his shapely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a lout with his clothes on . That was his tailor 's fault , chiefly . And not even that ; for he had never worn a suit which was not reach me downs . Without his clothes he looked a bit of an Apollo . I I is head stood well on his neck . He had broad shoulders and a tine chest and narrow hips . The white skin stretched over the muscles was touched by the flickeringfire-light . For one moment Mrs. Wright stood and took in all there was to see , a very quiet and expert moment . Then , having strayed in upon a strange man in his nakedness , she shrieked , as in duty bound . She turned tail , blushing like a school-girl . " Oh ! Oh ! " she cried . Then she thrust the two heaps of clothes into Mr. F , mmanuel 's arms . " Take these !

She knew what she wanted .

Of course nothing can have been more winning to simple and decent people than the episode out of which it all arose  --  the saving of Tommie Wright by Benny Edelman . But it would not have been quite the same thing if it had been any other small boy and any other young man . First , Tommie was an orphan . It was n't at all certain that Mrs. Wright was quite as devoted a mother as she might be ; she had other hobbies . ( But nobody allowed himself to think such a thought during these weeks . ) Second , when people came to think of it , Benny was an orphan , too . In some ways he was worse off than an orphan , for , with all respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Mrs. Edelman for a parent . Tommie was a nice quiet lad . So was Benny . Now and again they just seemed about as old as each other . Everybody knew things had been going rather badly with Benny of late in this miserable cabinet-making business . But he had kept his end up somehow . There was always a pleasing grin on his face . It was also very touching to see the way Tommie just idolised Benny . He refused to be separated from him . People stood at their doorsteps and smiled with a tear in their eye to see Benny trudging up the street , with Tommie 's little hand in his big one . Even Mrs. Edelman was touched by the sight . She smiled down at the small boy . The first time that happened Tommie cried . But after that he realised she meant well , and he would go up to her and kiss her . She did n't quite know what to do about that ; after all he was male , and gentile . Mrs. Wright was extremely charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Jews . She had ob 101 viously forgotten it herself . She often had Benny in for a cup of tea , and some biscuits and iced cakes , specially brought in from Mrs. Poyser 's , so that he should have no qualms about them . It was all proper and respectable . People had n't been quite so sure about that once or twice previously , when Mrs. Wright entertainedsome of her men friends . But they were sure enough about it now . There was always a chaperone in the house when Benny came to tea . It might be Benny 's own younger brother , Norman . And if Norman came , as like as not Mrs. Wright would ask him to bring his best girl , Fanny . Sometimes it would be quite a tea-party , with Mrs. Carter coming in , too , and Mrs. Emmanuel or Mrs. Seipel . It was n't any strain upon Mrs. Wright . Her late husband had been an insurance agent of substance , and she had compounded the endowment policies he had left her into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up a small tobacconist business . in fact she had had her eye on one at the corner of Laburnum Street for some time . But she was in no hurry . " Tune enough for that , " she said , laughing , " When Mr. Right comes along . " Everybody laughed merrily at the pun . And then Mrs. Wright behaved so prettily towards old Mrs. Edelman . She used to bring her flowers . Mrs. Edelman was puzzled by them at first . She had a dim memory of flowers growing by the riverside in Russia when she was a girl , and between the stalks of corn . But she did n't quite know what you did with these pagan lumps of colour tied up in bundles . Then Fanny , her Norman 's best girl , told her . " Like this , " she said . " You cut the straw here . See , Mrs. Edelman ? Then you put them in vases , with water . What , you have no vases ? Of course , you have . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still Mrs. Edelman had qualms . Then she gave way . She lifted them to her nose awkwardly . " Thank you , " she said to the gentile lady . She made a dish of potato-cakes for Mrs. Wright . " Take ! " she commanded her . Mrs. Wright took , and dropped them into her slop-bucket . So the people on both pavements laughed and joked and investedeach other 's doorsteps . The gentiles found that the Jews were not so outlandish , after all . You certainly could n't say about them , as you had always been taught to believe , that they counted each penny as they spent it . They were just simple folk , 102 like themselves , some more pleasant , some less . The Jews made corresponding discoveries about the gentiles . But there was one element in their enthusiasm which was probably lacking from that of their friends across the road  --  a certain element of relief . It relieved them to feel , as they all felt now , that the rumour which had spread in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in it , almost certainly had nothing in it . They threw themselves with gusto into all the jolly fraternisings that went on during these weeks . They were proud of their hero . It was lovely to see how grateful the mother of the small boy was . It was all just a little like the Kingdom of Heaven. 2It was a grand time , those few weeks in Magnolia Street during June and early July , in 1910 . It has been said before that there were four institutions which might be called clubs , in Magnolia Street , two for the Jews and two for the gentiles . The doors of all four were cordially thrown open to both sides of the street during that period . The sense in which the portals of the synagogue were thrown open was , of course , only a moral one . It would acutely have embarrassed its usual denizens , if Mr. Briggs , the odd-job-man , or the brothers Durbin , the barbers , had marched in that Sabbath morning two days after the rescue , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messrs . Briggs and Durbin . They would have obeyed a natural instinct , this being a place of worship , to take their hats off . A moment later , they would have perceived that Rabbi Shulman , Reb Feivel and the others kept their silk-hats glued tight on their heads . Other features of the ceremonial might have seemed anomalous to them . No , they would not have been happy in the synagogue . Even the Jewish womenfolk were not quite at their ease there , excepting a few pious bodies , like Mrs. Edelman , to whom the thick odour of the synagogue was more than food and drink . But when Benny Edelman came in that morning , the whole synagogue got up and stared , as one man . 1Ie shambled in , blushing to the rims of his ears . He was not much the worse for his dangerous adventure , excepting for a light sniffle . The sniffle would have been much more formidable if Mrs. Wright103had not promptly tackled it the day before with a glass of hot whisky-cordial , several aspirins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . None of the small boys paid any attention to their prayers that morning , with the consequence that there was more nosetweakingand arm-pinching than usual on the part of parents anxious for their sons ' souls . But the parents themselves were almost as bad . During the part of the service when the weekly portion of the Pentateuch is read out from the unrolled scroll , Benny 's gallantry received , as it were , divine recognition . He was called up by name to the pulpit , there permitted to endow a charity with half-a-crown , and to stand and shake and blush for a few minutes in the hot glare of public acclamation . Benny rather felt that the experience was as unpleasant as dragging small boys from brick-ponds . The ceremony would have been really complete and official if it had been possible for Mrs. Wright to be present , too , on the further side of the women 's partition . But somehow , it had not occurred to anylxdy to have her there , and Mrs. Wright would have been too shy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Fnnnanuel , about a month later , to organise the really complete and official ceremony in celebration of the Wright-Edelmanrescue . But if Benny Edelman in the synagogue voted half-a-crown to the Ilonie for Aged Jews , Jessie Wright went to church next day and put half-a-crown in the plate for the Mission to the Chinese . That evened things up . There was quite a churchparadethat morning in Magnolia Street . A number of people who had n't seen the inside of St. Luke 's for some months joined Jessie Wright . The excursion was , in a sense , a thank-offering for the rescue of little Tommie . The vicar was delighted . He had not seen so strong a Magnolia Street contingent for a long time . He was beginning to despair of Magnolia Street . He wondered if the close vicinity of the Jews infected them with a virus of free thinking . Most of the Magnolia Street gentiles were members of the Established Church of England . They all contributed handsomelythat morning to the fund for the Mission to the Chinese , though , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery 104 missionary ambition to propagate the principles of their Church among Chinese or Jews or Catholics or anybody . They had been born like that and would die like that . St. Luke 's was at the top of Blenheim Road , where it ran into Begley Hill Road , a thoroughfare which at that stage of its existence completely lost its Jewish character . The spire of St. Luke 's cast no deep shadow over Magnolia Street . The vicar was a scholarly gentleman and something of an authority on Plotinus . Plotinus and his own six unmarried daughters between them took up most of his time ; so that the care of the souls of Myrtle Street , Acacia Stree , Magnolia Street and the other streets of the flowering shrubs , which made up the poorest section of his parish , devolved more and more into the hands of Mr. Tressider , his curate . Mr. Tressider was muscular and socialistic , but found it impossible to shed his Oxford-curn-Cuddesdon accent , to which his parishioners listened and refused flatly to believe that such sounds actually existed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not succeed , as he had hoped , in setting up St. Luke 's as a dangerous rival to the Crown and Anchor and the Lamb and Lion . Miss Tregunter , who was a patron of neither , never failed of a Sunday morning to go forth to St. Luke 's in her black bonnet and her black lace shawl , with her black red-edged prayerhookin one hand and her black recticule in the other . But you felt she undertook the journey not only because she desired to enter into communion with her Maker but because it was inestimablythe correct , the genteel , thing to do . She was present this Sunday morning , too . But she would have been present in any case ; so that her appearance was not to be construed as an endorsementof the shameless merrymakings that had been going on in Magnolia Street since Friday afternoon . Bill Carter and his wife , Sally , joined Mrs. Wright 's churchpartythat morning . Strictly speaking , Bill was a Baptist , but , so long as he remained a policeman , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and proper to him that a state servant should support the state religion . His presence , large as he was , and policeman as he was , did not seem , however , to add largely to the moral prestige of St. Luke 's . Since they had turned him out of the police force , he saw no alternative but to become a Dissenter again . And then Jessie Wright , with the105 small Tommie , went to offer up thanks that morning in the Anglican mode . So Bill went , too , with his wife , Sally . Mary Cooper did not go , but her young sister , Enid , went , with Dick beside her . Janey Seipel saw her go off , prayer-book in hand . How willingly , that morning , would she have accepted Jesus , if it meant she could kneel down by Enid 's side . There was a missionary to the Jews who lived in Magnolia Street , at the home of the Carters . He did not know how close opportunity was that morning . But opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tawnies were at church , and Nellie Tawnie , too . Mr. Derricks went , with his son , George . So did the 11riggses . The two barber Durbins went , though Albert was not sure that soci- ology and Christianity were quite compatible . Kate Ritchie , too , went to church . They could shut her out of everything else , from the Private Bar to the Christmas ( ' Tubs , because they did not approve of her husband . She tossed defiantly the lovely feather in the lovely hat her husband had bought her , when he came home after his last voyage . I lcr husband , too , like John Cooper , was a sailor , but of less exalted rank . The vicar and the curate smiled with pleasure , when they saw the large detachment front Magnolia Street enter the church that morning . Mr. Tressider came round afterwards to Mrs. Wright , and congratulated her , and pinched Tommie on the cheeks . Tom- retie did n't like that . Tommie kicked Mr. Tressider on the shin and shouted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't like that Uncle ! I want Uncle Benny ! " Miss Tregunter heard . She was horrified . But she said not a word . Grim and gaunt she turned her nose toward Magnolia Street and her window-boxes. 3If the synagogue , like the church , kept apart , the other clubs brought together . During these amiable weeks the gentile women often dropped in of a morning at the grocery-shop to be friendly , and to buy , perhaps , some non-committal item of food , like a tin of mustard or a packet of self-raising flour . It was not their habit ; for Mrs. Poyser 's shop was almost as specifically Jewish and ecclesiastical as the synagogue itself . The dairy foods were rigidly segregated from all others . There was not a particle of 106 food on sale which was not sacramentally wholesome . On Fridaysthe special bread sprinkled with poppy-seed for the Sabbath repast made its strict appearance . The foods or properties associated with each festival came round as regularly as the seasons , the three-cornered tarts for Ptirim , the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passover every vestige of the regular stock disappeared and a new stock loaded the shelves , from the large sacks of unleavened meal to the least grain of sugar . What soft of pious application could Mrs. Drew , who kept the nearest gentile grocery-shop over in Aubrey Street , show to comparewith this ? She sold some hot cross buns for Good Friday , ordered a few dozen chocolate eggs for Easter and laid in an extra case of real eggs for Pancake Tuesday . She sold crackers , too , for Christmas . But she did this , which was not much , withoutenthusiasm . Mrs. Poyser attended to the ritual aspect of her calling not merely with enthusiasm but with an inquisitorial fire . Mrs. Drew began to get a little nervous when she saw the way her customers started dropping in at Mrs. Poyser 's . It might be Mrs. Tawnie herself , from the Lamb and Lion , in her shawl and clogs like the old mill-lass she was ; and though it was rumoured of her she might wear cloth-of-gold dancing shoes all day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clogs were good enough for her Steve when he first saw her , and good enough for Steve they were now , or for the Pope of Rome , for that matter . Or it might be the rather meek and serious Mrs. Stanley who came over , the deutsche woman , wife of the shoemaker . She found it a real convenience to be able to drop in across the street and buy a few such delicacies as she had enjoyed of old time in some Feinkost establishment on the Lange Reihe in Hamburg , a few Bocklinge or a bismarck herring . She even went so far as to give a German party one evening . " For fun , " she exclaimed . It did n't mean she was one jot less English at heart . Her elder son , Otto , was there playing the guitar . He was a baker and never got the flour out of his eyebrows . Es war ein Mal ein treuer Husar , he sang . Mrs. Seipel wept , she found the tune so touching . She and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Mrs. Winberg was there , although she was so rich . She too ate a bismarck herring . The gentile guests drank beer and ate Bratwurst . It was a real German party. 107The Derrickses next door heard there was a German party afoot . The Derrickses look at each other uneasily . They did n't like the sound of it. 4It was in the Private Bar of the Lamb and Lion , however , the club specifically devoted to good cheer , that the rescue was most gaily celebrated . On the actual evening , Benny Edelman was n't there . With any other host than Steve Tawnie , the evening might have been a Hamlet without a Prince of Denmark ; but Steve could be relied on to see that it was n't . Steve could make you split your sides laughing at your own mother 's funeral , and this was no funeral , by any means . Benny Edelman was n't there , because NI rs . Wright had packed him off to bed . It was perfectly delight fill to see the way Mrs. Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him ; almost as if she wanted to keep him intact for her own use some time . But there was no lack of company in the Private Bar . The habitues from the gentile pavement , male and female , were there in full force , very nearly . And Steve stood outside the pub roping in the Jewish gentlemen , just as if he were Reb Beal , the beadle of the synagogue , scouting round for odd Jews to make up the quorum . There was no question about the Jewish ladies entering a public-house . It was as unthinkable as the sight of a lot of Moslem women in Mecca , without veils , holding a public meeting . Leah Winter , of course , did push her way into the Private Bar . She lived on the Jewish pavement , and was , in fact , Jewish . But what could you expect of Leah Winter ? Strange men slept in her house . It would be less painful to ignore Leah Winter for the time being . The young men who worked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , needed no roping in . Neither did Mr. Emmanuel and Mr. Seipel and a few others who lived on the Jewish pavement , whom we do not name , for their history is not part and parcel of the history of Magnolia Street during the twenty years in which it occupies our attention . Norman Edelman , Benny 's younger brother , was there by right patent . Mr. Poyser needed a little lassoing . He was not certain how his wife would take it , if he entered a public-house . But she was108quite pleasant about it . The spirit of camaraderie had got hold of her . The Jewish men did not really fit into the atmosphere of the Lamb and Lion . Liquor was to them not so much a nightly routine as a ceremonial occasion . And then it would be sweet wine from Palestine to bless the Sabbath board , drunk not out of a glass mug , but a silver beaker . Or it might be a glass of brandy , at an engagement or a wedding . Beer they did not drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor Mr. Seipel did ; with the consequence that he completely spoiled an overmantel at his cabinet-works next day , and had to begin it all over again . Mr. Emmanuel was walking on air , even before he had one with Mr. Tawnie , Mrs. Stanley , Mr. Briggs , Mr. Seipel , with almost everybody . He did not like the taste of the stuff , but he drank it in the spirit of one who endures much for the sake of a cause . He disliked the taste less as he went on drinking , and as he went on drinking , glorified the cause more . The cause was love . His eyes twinkled . He made speeches ; or they might all have been the same speech . Slight , except for his broad shoulders , pale and tall , with a big head poised insecurely on a high neck , Mr. Emmanuel stood swaying among the gentiles and the Jews who , at length , loved each other . Punctuating his periods with his pince-nez , he urged the complete elimination of races , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their entirety . He had not yet reached his peroration ; for indeed , he had never yet been known to reach a peroration , when his pale face became paler and a wild light flickered in his eyes . The gentle Mr. Briggs took him in hand and he was not seen again that night in the Lamb and Lion . One or two other Jewish gentlemen and Mr. Albert Durbin were counted out . The rest stayed on . It was a grand night . " And now we 'll sing : He 's a Jolly Good Fellow ! " thundered Steve , meaning the absent Benny , and also meaning that it was getting near closing-time . But no sooner had they sting Jolly Good Fellow , than somebody started off Rule , Britannia ! and God Bless the Prince of Wales . The Jewish guests thought it would balance things nicely if they sang the Jewish anthem , Hatikvah . But the whole company did not know it , not even all of themselves . The international note , however , was struck with : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to swing her up a little bit 109 higher , Obadiah , do . Then Steve Tawnie shouted " Time , gentlemen , please ! " and got hold of one or two gentlemen who did not agree with him , and laid them delicately down on the pavement . So the love-festival came to an end for that night , though there was a lot of chattering at front doors for still another hour or two. 5Benny never went into the Durbin barber-saloon , for the simplereason that the Jewish youths all seemed to find their way to Mr. Cohen 's saloon on Blenheim Road . But he often used to cast envious eyes on Mrs. Durbin 's shop . Chaps went in for a three-halfpenny shave and sat about for hours talking and joking and smoking cigarettes . It was a go-easy place . The morning after the Tommie Wright business , he got up without a trace of a cold , thanks to Mrs. Wright 's whisky-cordial . But he had by no means got all the clay out of his hair . It occurredto him it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . No doubt he slyly reckoned they would not be displeased to have him there . The more lie thought of the episode on the brick-croft , the more he realised what a shalt fellow he had been . But he certainly had no idea what fuss they were going to make of him . Ile sat in his chair , and blinked and gaped and the other Jewish youths from round about came in , and talked girls and sport , and the Durbins would not let him pay a penny for ( lays and days . They anointed his head with free oil , till his cup ran over . The satisfaction that Benny got as he leaned back in his chair while Mrs. Durbin lathered him , was akin to the satisfaction a schoolboy feels when he , too , is at last allowed to sit in the prefects ' room . It was not a matter of marble and plush , but of privilege . There was a horsehair sofa against the long wall that faced the shaving-chairs . This was for the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week and sometimes had a shampoo , even a friction with hair-singe . Small boys ( in the shell , as it were ) sat on a rickety wooden form , when they came to have their hair cut . They were not allowed to come at all on Saturdays , when there was far too much doing to get the young men nice and clean for the girls they were going to take out that evening. 110 Reflected in the mirror before him were two pictures that Benny contemplated with approval . They were one picture , to be exact , for they displayed precisely the same subject , namely the Bride of Abydos . The lady wore a red cap from which a blue veil fluttered against the nape of her white neck . Her shoulders were bare , and so was a great deal of her bosom . " I always smoke Gilligan 's Cigarettes , " the Bride of Abydos hinted . " Do you ? " She , or she and her twin sister , were the sole decoration of the room , unle'ss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeon-holes on the wall facing the door ought to be listed as a decoration . For certainly they were not used , though the numbers up to fifty , painted boldly on the face of the mugs , invited fifty fastidious gentlemen to reserve for their sole use their private brush and soap . The gentlemen of Magnolia Street were not so fastidious . Between the two large mirrors , on the wall facing the Bride of Abydos , hung a mysterious framed text , which announced simply : DR . GAEL 'S ELECTROLYTIC SCALP TREATMENT : ONE-AND-SIX . It hypnotised Benny . It hypnotised the other clients , and the Durbins themselves , probably . The time could not be rememberedwhen that text had not hung between the mirrors , or when the treatment it recommended had been tried . Who was Dr. Gael ? In what house of learning had they conferred their diploma on him ? And Electrolytic ? Why Electrolytic ? Yet obviously the word implied subtleties of dermatological research beyond the boundaries of the merely electric . In 1930 Benny once more sat on a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was still recommended to try Dr. Gael 's Electrolytic Treatment , though the place had ceased to be the Durbin 's Barber-Saloon , and had become Clausen 's Pompeian Rooms . No one in those intervening years had dared to give Dr. Gael his chance . The elcier Durbin , Albert by name , who shaved Benny Edelman that June morning in 1910 , still hung about the place in 1930 ; but if at last , after all these years , someoneshould have conceived the desire to have Albert Durbin and Dr. Gael collaborate in the electrolytical treatment of his scalp , it was now too late . Albert Durbin no longer wielded the razor 111 or clipped the clippers . A shell exploded near him in 1915 somewhere in Flanders and took out both his eyes . But in 1930 as in 1910 , he still prattled about sociology . He always had red hair and his eyes , before they were poked out by pieces of shrapnel , were a yellow-grey . He considered himself an intellectual . He was not a socialist , he was careful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended over the taut tendons of his neck . Socialism was unscientific . Fie was a sociologist . His pronunciation of the word was a little unsteady , and would have indicated to a scholar that his knowledge of the subject was unsteady , too . But it was less than that , to be honest . It was based on a section of a fortnightly encyclopaedia of human wisdom which he had once read in a lavatory . He had retained some of the simpler jargon , the Omnipotence of the State , the Law of Natural Selection . One or two names also adhered in his memory from that session , Locke , Comte , John Stuart M ill . " A little off the top ? " he asked Benny , but only because it seemed to him that John Stuart Mill saw eye to eye with the manoeuvre . I le expounded the principles of sociology with a sort of murky garrulity , and could go on permuting and combining his stock-phrases over the length of time required for four shaves , three haircuts and a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his talking made him utter words of sociological or economic wisdom without the least consciousness that some of the first thinkers of the day were arguing along precisely those lines . " Say what you like , " he insisted . Benny really had n't much chance of saying anything . " There ca n't be any war between nations any more . Sociology says so . Victory would be just as bad for the winners as for the losers . That 's sociology , that is ! " " I see ! " said Benny dimly . Really it was a high-class saloon when the barber talked like that at you . They never talked like that at Cohen 's . The other customers had heard it all before . They were n't taking much notice . It was hoped that Doomington City would do better next year with the new centre-forward they had bought just before the end of the season . A moment later young Charles Stanley came in . Albert Durbinwelcomed him with a tiny scream and an alarming sweep of the razor . Charles Stanley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hare lip , but a forehead of great beauty . He was in the Sixth at Doomington School , and read Aristotle , Spinoza , Hegel , in the original languages , and permitted himself to read Pindar and Catullus in his spare time . Albert assumed him to know even more sociology than he did himself . The son of an English father and a German mother , the youth seemed to Albert an incidental corroboration of his views , in so far as they touched upon a war between Germany and England , for instance . There could be no war between Germany and England . Sociology forbade it . Albert gave tone to the Durbins ' saloon . But nobody listened to him , not even himself . His younger brother , Arthur , a great expert on league football , was taken more seriously . He could tell you who had been top and bottom of the various divisions , and finalists in the Cup Finals , for years and years . He knew the names of all the Derby winners , their jockeys and their owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Benny made his first bow to the Bride of Abydos . He insisted shyly on buying Benny 's ticket for him , and Benny countered by buying one for little Tommie . Arthur had a light touch with his razor and was a more satisfactory barber than Albert , though he was one of the few people who respected Albert 's intellectual attainments . He did a little boxing , too , and could deliver a good straight left . He was , in fact , exactly the sort of young man for whom the wars which were so unthinkable were waiting . He had the proper gentleness and decency and bearing . He was not the sort of young man whom the wars would appoint to a nice safe coastbatteryor a wooden barrack in the cindery desolation of Le Havre . He was not even the sort of young man who would get a kick from a mule in the belly or a shell-splinter in the wrist , so that he might keep high and dry till the business was over . He was the sort of young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of bone . So , from season to season , Arthur estimated the chances of the Football Cup coming back to Doomington and Albert scraped a ghostly razor along the ghostly chins of Locke and Comte and John Stuart Mill . But the Durbin business was a flourishing one , and it is clear that neither Albert nor Arthur was the stuff out of which good business-men are made . The leading spirit of the business was their mother , a small black lady , Eliza by113name . She was wearing her cap , of course , as she bent over Benny , lathering him . The black head of her hatpin was as small and black as her eyes . She had a faint moustache on her upper lip . Her pipe was going pleasantly . The smoke struck rank against Benny 's nostrils , as she rubbed his chin with her hand . She was the firm 's lather-boy . She used the brush less than most members of her profession . She had a great belief in that rubbing of the chin with the palm of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept out of the chin of their own accord and slunk away . She did not bully the clients , but she let them know about it if they were allowing too big an interval to go by without shaving , or if the hair was beginning to grow untidy at the back of the neck . Blackheads were her especial enemy . She pounced upon them and the most inveterate gave up the ghost before her onslaught . You paid for her zeal sometimesby the sharp sting of a coal of tobacco falling from her pipe upon your check . I , ut you said nothing about it , lest she should so maul you with the edge of her palm that your jaw-bone ached for days . But her hand was unusually gentle with Benny that morning . She allowed no lu , t spark to fall on his fresh cheeks . Her black eyes beamed clown on hinm , but she said no word . Albert did all the talking necessary for one family . A fter business-hours Mrs. Durbin retired , as her custom was , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stout , as black as the head of her hatpin . The excitement had by no means died down . Benny Edelman had been brought in , and Mrs. Wright was there , of course . But Mrs. Durbin did not join in the conversation . She merely listened , tugging away at her pipe , and ramming the tobacco clown sometimes with her leathery thumb . At closing-time she went out into Blenheim Road and towards the freer country beyond St. Luke 's . She was already in her walking-out costume , for her cap and shawl never came off . She walked for miles and did not come back for hours . No-one knew where she went on these excursions . In an earlier age her neighbours would have said of her she went forth to ride upon broomsticks and to join her sister witches at their Sabbath . They would not , in the end , have burned or drowned her . She was not of the sort who would have sat down tamely while they tied a stone round her neck , to see if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill-pond . She would 114 have sent them packing pretty quickly , with a buzzing in their ears , for she had a sharp tongue , when she cared to use it . Her neighbours had the instinct that she was , eminently , a sensiblewoman . Otherwise it would have been impossible , even in an epoch so enlightened as the first decade of the twentieth century , for them to see her going off late at night and staying away so long without inventing odd explanations of her absences . The children were not so sure . They never got quite used to that pipe and that hatpin . And certain harassed mothers of Magnolia Street , on both pavements , were not slow to take advantage of the fear the children had of her . " Be quiet ! " they threatened . " Stop crying , or I 'll lock you up in the cellar with Mrs. Durbin ! " Mrs. Durbin was only ousted from the cellar ( luring the periods when a Dr. Crippen came into public prominence . So that , sometimes , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house and he found Mrs. Durbin bearing down upon him , he gave a loud yell , and took to his heels ; or stood still and frozen , awaiting what was to happen . But nothing happened . She merely went off into the night , no-one knowing where . She did no more than walk and walk , for in her small bony limbs flowed the sap of an unquenchable vitality . At a later stage in the development of the possibilities open to women of energy , she might have managed a firm or gone into Parliament ; now there was no more for her to do than to be her sons ' lather boy . The type of success open throughout all ages to women of charm was not open to her . She felt more of a man than most of the men she knew . Only one man in all her history had made her conscious that she was in truth a woman , with a weak woman 's mouth for a man 's to strengthen . But he died long ago , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathered by some other man , so unlike was he to that stocky fellow with a chest like an ape 's and hair tough and red as a basket of carrots . Albert 's hair was red , too , but it was a miserable apologetic red , that you might snuff out if you breathed on it . All other men since had seemed poor stuff to her , no more fit to lie with than a yard-broom . He died long ago . It may have been of him she thought as she trod the midnight streets , with the bowl of her pipe clutched in her left hand . Or she may have thought of nothing at all but the towels that were to be washed and the firm was running out of bay rum. 115iOn the night that followed Tommie Wright 's rescue , she was out later and fared further than usual . She got as far as the moors that heave darkly beyond Layton Park . It was a warm night with a moon that rose late and travelled slowly through banks of cloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make love to each other under sandy shelves and tussocks of gorse , and can not bring themselves to leave each other , it is so warm and the moon seems rather to hell than hinder their love-making . The moon came out of a thicket of cloud . Mrs. Durbin heard a voice . She had heard that voice in her saloon that morning , and again that evening , in the Lamb and Lion . She saw a face . She knew those rosy cheeks and those green eyes . But the cheeks , too , looked green in this light . Perhaps she was mistaken . She withdrew silently , being fairly sure that the young man and young woman had not been aware of her . She smiled . Once , long ago , she , too , had lain under these sandy ledges , and a man 's arms were about her . It had not been very comfortable , but fierce enough . That was the way Albert , her son , came about . Albert liked bloaters for his breakfast and she had none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tom-cat rubbed himself against her leg in an ecstasy . The tom-cats of Magnolia Street loved her , as if they deemed her as male and wild and lonely as themselves. 116 1S O IN one way and another , in one language and another , in the four clubs , in the private houses , Magnolia Street celebratedthe heroism of B. Edelman and the well-being of T. Wright . But there were certain individuals who , for several reasons , all very different from each other , remained outside the merry-making . Reb Aryeh , for instance who kept the Hebrew-school , was not propitious . He quoted the examples of Rehoboam and Jeroboam and the other wicked kings , and pinched the brachial muscles of his pupils till they were blue . The boys had competitions later , to see whose muscles were bluest . As for Rabbi Shulman , he lived so completely in a cloud of talmudic metaphysics that he might not have noticed it if his house had been burning about his ears and some creature , Jew or gentile , had carried out himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescues . Among his manifold duties was to decide whether a given fowl , whose interior had excited anxious suspicions , was ritually pure , or not . The problemwould so promptly and so passionately absorb the whole attention of Rabbi Shulman , that he would not have noticed whether it was a Jew who had posed it , or a blue-eyed Norwegian , or a pig-tailed Chinese . It was not to be wondered , therefore , that Rabbi Shulmn was not aware of all these doings in Magnolia Street when n:ht and day he was not aware of treading other pavements than those of Jabneh and Babylon and Tiberias , where the holy colleges had been . His wife gave birth to another male child three or four days after the rescue , and it was said he was hardly aware even of that . Mrs. Shulman was bitterly disappointed . Things always went against her . The Rabbi 's wife though she was , she would 117 have liked to be in at all this pleasantness , along with the other Jewish women . And then she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought on by the excitement of that famous Thurs- day afternoon . She should have been lying clown instead of walking in a procession . The baby was a good month before its time . And another boy at that . Mrs. Shulman was by nature a disappointed woman . Her first husband , a parchment-maker , had disappointed her by dying a year after the marriage . So she led Chaim Shulman under the canpoy , a rabbi whose learning and piety were a byword twenty- five years earlier in their Russian village . She had tried to console herself after her first husband died by setting up a small general store , but it ( lid not come up to expecta- tions . So she married the Rabbi and hoped the whole village would flock to her . It did ; but it went straight through the shop without pausing to look at her goods , and sought out the Rabbi , to consult him either on the state of their own liver or the liver of the chicken they had bought for the Sabbath . They had often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient than a dose from the doctor . And it was cheaper . If anyone ever thought of some quid  --  ro quo for his services , it was not the Rabbi . Ile did real harm to his wife 's business . In so holy a house it was considered almost blasphemous to think of buying common onions or handkerchiefs . So the shop failed . And the Rabbi and his wife came to England . Mrs. Shulman had a child by her first husband . It died , just to spite her . Years went by and Mrs. Shulman did not bear another child . It was as if the Rabbi , being so spiritual a person , had not got the knack of it . A perpetual querulousness settled ' on her face . There was shame as well as disappointment in her barrenness . Then it seemed that the Rabbi accidentally stumbled on the way of it . Mrs. Shulman gave birth to Rachel . It would be a girl , of course . Her chagrin was profound . She was certain there would be no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to say the Kaddish after them , the Prayer-for-the-Dead , when they lay in the cold ground . They would have to have bought mourners interceding for them at the seat of the Most High . She sighed wretchedly . But her grief was premature . Less than a year later , Solly 118 was born . Less than a year after that Benjamin was born . Less than a year after that Yossel was born . It was as if Rabbi Shulmanhad now lost the knack of not producing children , and sons , moreover . It would have been so nice for Rachel if she could have a little sister to keep her company . But there were n't any little sisters . Yankel followed Yossel , and Issy followed Yankel . Then came Mick . Now came another male child , just when Mrs. Poyser 's shop was humming all clay long like a happy beehive . Mrs. Shulman cried for disappointment . And where was the money to come from to feed so many mouths ? Rabbi Shulman had as much instinct for money as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes they did not . Sometimes a fat chicken would turn up from nowhere , dead or alive . Sometimes there would be nothing in the house for days on end but a few raw herrings . Sometimes the house , all of a sudden , was as full of clucking as a farmyard . There might even be a puzzled quacking at the scullery sink . It was all very strange and very disappointing . But Magnolia Street was delighted that Mrs. Shulman had another baby . The baby added the one touch that had been lacking . It was almost as if , in a very mystical way , Benny Edelman and Jessie Wright had had a baby . Magnolia Street saw to it there was a good deal more than raw herrings in the Shulman larder during Mrs. Shulman 's absence from their midst . Maggie Tawnie brought in with her own hands half a bottle of brandy . Mrs. Seipel contributed one of her famous egg-cakes . Jessie Wright , with her instinct for the delicate thing , sent a bunch of roses . Poor Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her hand behind the kitchen-sofa . " What can I have done with those roses ? " she asked herself wearily . She thrust oe. -k with her thumbs her lank black hair . " Oh , they 'll turn up somewhere ! " But the roses were pot pourri a long time before they turned up. 2Kate Ritchie , of number fourteen , did not join in the celebrations , either . It was not because she had a baby , but because she had a husband . He was away at sea now . " IIe should be back any day , " muttered Kate forlornly . She wiped a tear from her eye with the edge of her apron . " I 'm that lonely ! " she moaned , 119 " that lonely ! If it was only him getting off the tram and coming up the street and knocking at the door ! " What a knock that would be ! Enough to set her wonderful parlour candelabra jingling , with its gongs and crystals , that he had bought for her on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Last night she had intended to walk straight into the Private Bar without a with your leave or by your leave . She knew they would all be there gathered together nice and cosy sipping their pints , and talking about the Jew fellow who had saved Jessie Wright 's boy ; and what harm would it do them if she came in , too ? She could pay for herself , she asked nothing from nobody , and stand a pint to the next one , if she had a mind to . And the mess they had made of her scrubbed steps as they went tumbling up the street to Jessie Wright 's  --  enough to break your heart after scrubbing like that for a good hour and more . But at the last moment her courage failed her . So she took her jug under her shawl as usual and went into the Jug and Bottle Department , and would you believe it , it took minutes and minutes before anyone heard her knocking , there was such a noise going on . Songs and speech-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She heard the tall one , with the pince-nez , his name was Emnnmanuel , carrying on like the Private Bar was the Free Trade I I all . She had never felt lonelier in all her life before , than she felt in the ( lark lobby of the Jug and Bottle Department , knocking at the glass panel and no one hearing . At last she got her jug filled . Then she carried it away and sat by her white hearth . But she could not drink it . And when she tried her tears fell into the beer . She looked around her , trying to find solace where she so often had found it before , in the beauty and cleanliness of her home . It was , indeed , a model of a small house . She changed all her curtains each week , and the curtains in the back rooms were just as full and white and elaborate as the front-room curtains . Every morning she scrubbed her doorsteps with brown stone , giving their edges a fine artistic finish with a slab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down her steps that twice a week would have been quite ample . Before her parlour-window she had not merely one bamboo-table with an aspidistra in a plantpot , but three separate bamboo-tables , each with an aspidistra in a plant-pot . Above her mantelpieces she had mirrors flanked 120 with classical panels . Her kitchen-hearth was scrubbed like fine linen and a great fireguard hemmed it round . This was no precautionagainst injury to children . No children ever visited Kate Ritchie . Its purpose was to keep sparks away from the fluffy mat , compounded out of a thousand pieces of coloured rag , which lay in the centre of the polished linoleum . She occupied herself about the house all next day in the effort to forget how miserable she was . She polished the stair-rods , though she had done them all two days ago , did up the kitchen grate , put new paper frills on the shelves , whatever she could think of . She desperately wanted someone to come in and say how lovely it all was , particularly the astounding tapestry tableclothshe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were traced in gilt thread , a camel , Lord Kitchener , the Sphinx and a handful of pyramids . It was not the day for the " landlord , " unfortunately , the day when he called for his nine shillings , and she could ask him into the kitchen and would he like a cigarette ? ( There were always cigarettes about , in case he turned up suddenly , as he usually did . ) The postman came , but of course you could n't ask the postman in , and take him away from His Majesty 's service . The baker had not been very pleasant to her last time , so she did n't ask him in . But it was the dustman 's day , and although she 'd never done it before , she could n't help asking him would n't he like to look at her new aspidistra ; and had n't she done well with the new coat of whitewash she had given the scullery , and done it all with her own hands ? " Very fine indeed , mum ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She gave him threepence , as well as a packet of woodbines , for that . And then the dustman , too , left her ; left her to the kettle singingon the hob rather mournfu4 ; the tom-cat yowling on the hearth-mat rather grossly . Had sie not already given him a pint of milk to-day ? She went and filled his basin for him again . Later that evening she went out . She got her pint from the Jug and Bottle Department and brought it back into the kitchen and set it beside her feet . She sat back in the armchair and rocked to and fro . The tom-cat was away courting . She could n't bear a night like last night again . And then it was the idea came to her that it might be nice to go over and have a word or two with Mrs. Winter . She had n't seen a thing of her for a week or two  --  Mrs. Winter , who lived121on the other side of the street . Jews , of course , are Jews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do say about Mrs. Winter . . . . A knock at the door . Not a great uproarious knocking like a fire-engine ; a mild dubious knocking . That was Mrs. Winter . It could n't be anyone else . She went to the door . " Come in , Mrs. Winter ! Conte straight in ! " 3Strange men used to come and visit Leah Winter . Sometimes they stayed all night . That was what was wrong with Leah Winter . She kept lodgers . It was not to he expected that she should keep Jewish lodgers , being a lady whom strange men used to come and visit . Her lodgers were the fire-goyahs of that region of Longton , that is to say , the elderly gentile women who tended the fires and turned the gas on and out , on Friday evenings and Sabbaths , in the Jewish houses of those parts . Like Kate Ritchie , like Leah Winter , they were Outsiders . For though Magnolia Street was a small comnnunity -- or two small communities , to be exact  --  no community is small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hs did not belong to the odd pavement of the Jews , they had no place in the even pavement of the gentiles , excepting in the Public Bar of the Lamb and Lion . There was always an odd handful of fire-goyahs under Leah Winter 's roof , sleeping on the kitchen sofa , in odd passages and cupboards . They had an extreme devotion to Mrs. Winter . There was nothing they would not do for her . They admitted that strange men came and visited Mrs. Winter , but they swore fiercely there was nothing in it . Mrs. Winter and the strange men just spent the time together in the kitchen , chatting . Who should know , if they , the fire-goyahs , did n't ? They could come in and boil a kettle for themselves on the kitchen-fire whenever they wanted a. drop of tea . " Innocent , the poor dear , " they agreed , " as the babe unborn ! " But was it true , or was it not true , that the strange men sometimesstayed the whole night ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own innocence did not come into question . Certain of them had been what they had been , and many a marriedlady with gold rings and gold necklaces in Magnolia Street , 122may have been a good deal worse . Certain of them had always been frozen monuments of chastity . But by the time that ladies became fire-go yahs , all of them alike were further from the breath of suspicion than any chapter of nuns in a convent . It was true . The strange men sometimes spent the night . But always in the back bedroom . Mrs. Winter spent the night in the front bedroom with the key turned in the lock . It may have been true that Mrs. Winter 's relations with the strange men were strictly proper . But it was generally assumed that the shrill defence the fire-goyahs undertook of Mrs. Winter 's good name , had something to do with her slackness about the rent . She was slack about everything , down to her hair and her corsets . On the Friday afternoon following the golden Thursday , she sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , thinking nothing , just feeling miserable in a slack way . She had had a feeling , even before she did it , that it was a mistake to go into the Lamb and Lion last night . Everybody seemed so jolly , surely there could be no harm in her going in , too . Lots of Jewish men were there already . But that was different . She realised from the big eyes they made the moment they saw her , she had made a mistake . Apart from that , no one had taken anynotice of her . And then , as usual , she had gone in that morning to get her groceries from Mrs. Poyser . Mrs. Poyser always gave her what she asked for in the ordinary way of business ; though of course , she was not encouraged to stay on and chat , like the other customersand go behind the scenes to inspect the piano which Mrs. Poyser had just bought for her daughter , Becky . But for some time now Mrs. Poyser had realised that any intending son-in-law who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraged at the thought that any human female could look like that with the lapse of years , that it might make a bachelorout of him for life . Yet she did not like turning away good money , whether strange men did or did not leave it on the mantelpiece . And she went on serving Leah Winter . And then Leah Winter went into the public-house  --  a Jewish daughter . The other women were murmuring and complaining . How could they expect to go shopping in the same shop where aJewish woman is served who goes into public-houses ? So that Friday morning Mrs. Poyser spoke to Leah Winter . 123It had to be done . She informed her she must get her groceries elsewhere . Mrs. Winter was rather stupid . It took Mrs. Poyser quite a long time to convey her meaning . Then at length Leah understood . Her lips trembled just a little , a comb slid out of her back hair ; then she went off with her basket to another groceryshoplower down Blenheim Road . She sighed heavily as she clopped along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about on her doorstep so blankly that Friday afternoon . Then she suddenly remembered that she had not made her Friday evening dinner . She rushed back into her kitchen , with her hair streaming out of its combs and slides , of which she used about ten more than necessary , for once she started putting combs and slides into her hair , she forgot about it and kept on putting them in automatically . The combs and slides fell in showers about her as she moved . 1 fer progress was a welter of loose strings and slipping skirts . She seized her fishboardand her chopper and her fish , and returned to the doorstep and sat down and proceeded to chop up the stuff and roll it into balls and flavour it , as if number eleven Magnolia Street were a solitary hurt in the heart of the Gobi desert . And she had not yet plucked her Sabbath chicken ; so she sat down and plucked , till the air about her was a small snowstorm . And the other Jewish ladies going about their business on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortified that the gentiles should have so shameful a sight to see . And sure enough , Mrs. Derricks passed at that moment , and paused , and snorted and passed on . But nothing disturbed Mrs. Winter as she sat plucking her fowl or rolling her fish-balls . For the time being she had forgotten her mortifications . Shall not a Jewish woman prepare the board for the Sabbath ? For Mrs. Winter was a pious woman in her way , and never , on Sabbaths and holidays , failed from taking tip her place in the women 's section of the synagogue . For she knew that in the sight of the God of Israel she had as much right to her place there as Bella Winberg or Lady Rothschild . She knew also that in the same just sight , she and Miss Winberg and Lady Rothschild were so much dirt weighed in the balance with men , their masters , and she chanted with particular satisfaction the prayer : " Blessed art Thou , oh Lord our God , Who hast made me what I am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . None of the strange men came in to share it with her . Her lonelinesscame back to her . Strange men were all right in their way , but they could not be relied on . Sometimes no strange man came for weeks . And though her fire-goyahs were so staunchly attached to her , they were only fire-goyahs , after all . She yearned to exchange a word with someone nearer to her own social level . She wondered how Mrs. Ritchie might be this evening . Had he sent her a present lately , like that scarf worked with metal threads ? Or that tort with hammered brass plates in its shell , you never saw such a beautiful thing ? " Yes , " she muttered . " I 'll go over . Why not ? I 'll wash my hands and put my hair straight . And Mrs. Ritchie 's that particularabout her oilcloth , shall I put on my best pair of shoes ? " She washed and put on her new shoes . She crossed the gulf between the two pavements , where Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other feet than hers . She knocked . Kate Ritchie came to the door . " Come in , Mrs. Winter ! Come straight in ! " So Kate and Leah sat together chatting for an hour , two hours . It was a strange thing how much they had to talk about , one being a Jewish lady and the other a gentile . Or perhaps it was not so strange . And then the fire-goyahs began to drop in . Fortunately there was still just time to get in some beer from the Jug and Bottle . It was really quite a social evening . The fire-goyahs had dischargedtheir duties at the houses of their clients and , finding their landlady not at home , they knew there was only one place where she could be . So they dropped in , too . Mrs. Ritchie treated them very nicely ; there was a little of the grande dame in her manner , perhaps , but she was regular glad to have company that evening . A word or two must be said about these fire-goyahs , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , is incomplete without them . What they did all week was not quite clear . Some did a little charing , some received small money orders from time to time from the antipodes . it was not for the gentiles they did their charing . They had cut themselves off from their own world . But on Friday evenings they came into124 1 125their own . There was always a certain pride in their demeanour when they entered the Jewish houses to turn out the gas and leave the place dim and cosy in the last inch of candlelight . And they disintegrated the fire with real virtuosity , redeeming with their naked hands those lumps of coal which still had mischief in them , and placing them in a neat heap in the corner of the grate to be the foundation of the morning 's fire . Whether they carried their pride patent on their foreheads or concealed it beneath a mask of heartiness , there was no doubt they were aware of the privilege of their condition . They had not become Jews , of course ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes developed a type almost as duplex as the Christo-Mohammedanism of some Albanians or the Buddhistic Confucianism of some Chinese . There are Muslim Albanians who give each other eggs at F : , ister and pay pilgrimage to the eikons of Christian saints . " There are Confucian Chinese , who , among the memorial tablets of their Confucian ancestry , give obeisance also to Buddhists who have crossed their family . So certain of the fire-govnhs developed a punctiliousness with regard to the mixing of neat and milk foods ; there was a Roman Catholic fire-goyah who added without warrant from the Vatican the saints Abraham and Isaac to her litany ; and when once , on the feast of Passover , she saw Max Emmanuel , the little paintingboywho lived next door , nibbling leavened Eccles cake in completeoblivion of how wicked a thing that was in the Passover season , she nearly fainted with horror ; but not before she had boxed his ears and dropped the impious thing through the bars of a street-grid . The last fire-go yah to come in that evening was May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company to whom a name is given , because , while the others came and went , she stayed . She was there still in 1930 . It was odd that room could still be found for her in Kate Ritchie 's neat little kitchen . But she merely flowed into those parts of the room which were not already occupied . And as she flowed , she sang . It seemed hardly believable that such incoherentmasses of fire-go yah should be as instinct with song as Shelley or his sky-lark . Hour after hour she sat before the sooted window of her attic , looking out upon the backs of the Oleander Street houses , singing . She sang as she made her fires . She sang that evening in Kate Ritchie 's kitchen. 126 She sang no music-hall catches . Her themes were the iniquity of Mrs. Billig , who had tried to reduce her fire-go yah 's fee from twopence-halfpenny to two-pence in virtue of the cup of tea she had drunk ( and the water not even boiling ) ; or the glory of Isrol Poyser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mrs. Poyser was n't looking ; her acute doubt that Mrs. Poyser 's daughter , Becky , would ever achieve a husband , despite the new ' , piano and the singing lessons . She sang the glory with which some day Bella Winberg would come back to the house she was born in . She announced that Max Emmanuel would some day have traffic with ladies who wore tiaras , that old Billig was no good man , despite his bright blue eyes and his beard of white silk ; she foresaw the greatness that was to come to the small Mick Shulman , and much blood must flow from his snub-nose . . . . For May Agnes Hartley had powers , it seems impossible to doubt , though to have stated such a thing in Magnolia Street would have brought the whitewash in great flakes from the ceiling , it would have evoked such gales of laughter . And if there had been one to listen to her well , it may have been possible to write down in 1910 the whole history of Magnolia Street in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion , for the big war she sang of , that was to cloak the lands with blood , occupied no greater space in her descants than the red beard of Mrs. Edelman'snew lodger and Mrs. Seipel 's sewing-machine that had gone to be pawned . But it is remembered that on a few occasions , setting eyes on little David Emmanuel , she stopped as if she saw not him , but the doom that waited for him . For that death , and a few more , and a leg , and a pair of eyes , were the offerings required by the Great War from the small street . So she came over that evening into Kate Ritchie 's kitchen and sang of the Jews , but plaintively , in a minor key . Her songs were only of the Jews . No one listened to her . It was of Benny Edelman and Jessie Wright and Tommie , that Kate Ritchie and her guests spoke . " But wo n't you have just one more glass ? " insisted Kate Ritchie . " I do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was already swimming , but she knew that the fire-goyahs would help her across the road when it was time to go home . And drinking beer was no sin . Where did it say in the Bible that drinking beer was a sin ? 127 " I 'll have one with you ! " said Kate . Her hand was a little unsteady . She even spilled a little on the polished linoleum . That drew her up . She went and mopped it up sternly , a little too sternly , perhaps . And then May Agnes Hartley in her singing said she saw Benny Edelman putting a gold ring on a lady 's wedding-ring finger . She could not see whose face it was . The lady was no Jew . No one took any notice at all . " Another one for you , Maggie ? " " Yes , mum ! " said Maggie . Kate smiled . She liked the lower orders to be respectful . " Here you are , Maggie ! " It was really a very social evening. 4So it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pictures which affected them , as the fact that they were togetherand so happy , that crashing nigger from Trinidad and the neat little woman from Blackburn  --  or Bacup , as some said . And they walked home again to Magnolia Street , he holding in his hand a brown paper parcel containing her old hat , and she holding on her head a new hat , a very jaunty one , that Pete had just bought for her in Deansgate . And she tossed her chin in the air with a queer mixture of timidity and defiance , when she saw a knot of women gathered at Jessie Wright 's doorstep , very obviously discussing herself and her new hat and her big buck nigger . And that night , and all the five nights he was with her , they either went to a theatre or sat about , as large as life , in the PrivateBar . And , of course , nobody dared say a word , or they would soon have had Pete Ritchie 's fist smashing down on their skull . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such applepieorder while Pete was with her . She could n't clean the steps every morning and polish up the linoleum till it looked like old mahogany . But she could make him so many ginger suet-puddingsthat the whites of his eyes rolled in his head ; for he had always been a one for ginger suet-puddings . And then , on the sixth day , he had to go back to sea . And then , perhaps , in some ways , it was a good thing that the house had been a bit neglected . For it took your mind off things like , if you had to buckle down to the yard-flags , which needed a good scouring . And goodness gracious , if there was n't a worm somewhere eating at the roots of this new aspidistra , the way its leaves were all curling and growing yellow . She took the small trowel in hand with which she loosened the earth about the roots of her aspidistras , and found that worm . It glistened like a streak of mercury across the prism of the tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it you ! " she said fiercely . " I 'll give it you ! " 5Kate Ritchie and Leah Winter did not join in the **25;1356;TOOLONG , because they were not asked to . Eric ( ne Isaac ) Winberg , did not join in because he was not aware of them . He was not aware of anything that happened in MagnoliaAnd only next day Pete came ; Kate Ritchie 's husband , that is to say . A great shameless childish roaring nigger he was , with the arms of a gorilla and a mouthful of gold teeth . He hallooed greetings from pavement to pavement , and whether it was that people were a fraid to put any affront upon him , or whether his colossal vitality made them reply despite themselves , they nodded back and muttered " Good morning ! " and then hurried indoorsrather fearfully . She told him about Benny Edelman , how brave he had been He hurled himself across the road and slapped Benny 's back so heartily that Benny nearly bit off an inch of tongue . Benny was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spotting Tommie Wright immediately after , Pete threw him high in the air and caught him as if he were a threepenny ball . He also gave him a shilling . Tommie announced that he liked that uncle . Later in the day Kate and Pete went off to the Doomington Zoo , they went off somewhere every day . Naturally Kate did not devote anything like so much time to house matters , while Pete was with her . The next day they went to the Layton Park Gallery , where there was a picture of a baby afloat in its cradle in a flooded countryside . The baby lifted its chubby little fist and opened wide its blue eyes , and Pete and Kate both mopped their eyes before the picture , it so affected them . But there was an enormouscanvas of a landscape near it , consisting chiefly of cabbages and beehives ; and they mopped their eyes before that picture , too. 128 129Street .

Ile was not , of course , inside the Pytchley Hunt or Brooks 's Club ; but then he was only fifteen , and with a Winberg there was no saying what might not happen . Eric Winberg was svelte and elegant , with a smooth pale oval face and quiet dark eyes . You could not deduce from them how fantastic was the world he lived in . Ile was an aristocrat . His ancestors had crossed the Channel with William the Conqueror . He would some day inherit large lands . Ile was the darling of the West End . Peeress-mothers asked him to their parties to meet their little peeress-daughters. l le shot . He rode to hounds . He came in first in the most clashing point-to-point of the season . On Saturday morning when Benny Edelman went to the synagogue to receive the commendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders brushed the shoulders of Eric Winberg . But to Eric Winberg the hero might have been a fly or a lamp-post . He took no notice of him . He twirled his little cane . 1 le wore his top-hat at a slightly jaunty angle . His Eton suit was immaculately well-brushed . He , too , wore an Eton suit . Wilfred Derricks , the Longton Nightingale , was not the only dweller in Magnolia Street who wore an Eton suit . But the Nightingale wore it to let the world see he was the world 's Boy . Eric wore it in a sort of secret understanding with his Norman ancestors . The spirits had bewitched him . They had made him the son of Jews and to live in a mean street . But he would not let them down  --  the Fitzeustaces and the Fitzgeralds , who were his own people . He never nowadays uttered a word to any human being in Magnolia Street which betrayed the nature of his obsessions But there had been a time when he permitted himself one quee confidante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabbi 's daughter . He was aware she adored him then . Sh adored him still , but he had ceased to be aware of her . In th days before he attained his tenth year and she her eleventh , h would request her to come out walking with him to Baxter ' 130Moor , a region where , as he imagined , other members of the Norman aristocracy lived . He would say nothing at all to her for minutes at a stretch , while one member of the working-classes and another passed by . Then at length some lady or gentleman of the patrician kind approached them . Then he gave tongue . Bending towards Rachel 's ear , just loudly enough for the stranger to overhear him , he declared : " So when Lord Henry offered me the goblet , I simply could n't refuse . " I-le said no more than that . Rachel 's heart beat joyfully . She was aware that , literally , no Lord Henry , could have been offering Isaac Winberg any goblet . But in a deep , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , once more a stranger approached who seemed to the boy to have the patrician manner . Once more he leaned towards her . He twirled his little cane . " So when Lord Henry offered me the goblet , I simply could n't refuse . " It seemed to him that was the manner in which earls and the sons of earls conversed with each other . He had taken Rachel Shulman with him , because he knew she loved him . He knew that he could not impart the news about Lord Henry and the goblet to anyone else than her without unpleasantconsequences . Anyone else would think he was mad or joking . Rachel , who loved him , knew the truth . But when he attained his tenth year , he realised it was a grave error to be seen by the Normans in the company of such a slut . He did not speak to her again . A year later he went to DoomingtonSchool , where he became a notable athlete , despite his lean frame . He got his second-team colours for cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly respected private in the O.T.C. At his first O.T.C. camp the quartermaster-sergeant took such a fancy to the quiet and aristocratic youth that he arranged for him to mount the transport-horses whenever he was free . He rode as easily and instinctively as a cygnet takes to water . It was just about this period that he stopped attending Jewish prayers . He was duly observed by Mr. Furniss the Head Master , seated among the other boys of his form at the Christian prayers . But Mr. Furniss did not know how he could take ally action in the matter if the lad had a feeling for Jesus . Was it the duty of a Christian head master to remonstrate with a Jewish parent that his son showed a feeling for Jesus ? The matter puzzled and slightly distressed him for some days ; but seeing with what 131 decorum the boy sang the hymn of the Christian soldiers marchingas to war , he allowed the matter to drop from his mind . But Eric Winberg had heard no call from Golgotha . He had had no more traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived on the opposite pavement of Magnolia Street , than with Rabbi Shulman , who lived next door but one . Jesus was a more correct prophet than Moses . There was nothing more to it than that . You could count on the fingers of one hand the peers who made their protestations by Moses ; and most of those were mere German Jews , who had made money . The news found its way to Mr. Benjamin Stern that a Jewish lad from across the street sat among the redeemed singing the hymns of the Redeemer . It travelled by way of Charles Stanley , who was in the Sixth . He told his mother . She told Mrs. Carter , who was Mr. Stern 's landlady . Mr. Stern 's mission was to theJews . He had once lived several streets north of Magnolia Street , where no Jews lived . But when he saw that the half of Magnolia Street had become Jewish , he felt that nothing could serve him more usefully than to take up his place on the side of the street that faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all directions for some breach into the thicket of thorns which was opposed to him . Sometimes , in his despair , with his hands held before him and his head high , he walked full into the thicket , thinking , it may be , that the Lord would decree a miracle and he might walk straight through as through a veil of mist , and tell them on the other side of the peace passing all understandingthat he brought them . But the thicket was impenetrable . The thorns were like steel spikes . They stuck out all about his forehead , ringing it with a crown . And then , in the grace of Christ Jesus , it was given to a Jewish young man to save a Christian child from drowning . Another Jewish young man had saved all children from drowning , long ago , by being nailed up on a Cross . It seemed to Mr. Stern that there was a thinning in the darkness all about him , that the thicket of thorns would not always remain so deep and sharp . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing among his Christianbrothers , for Christ 's sake Who loved them all . His heart leaped within him . Upon the Sunday morning that followed he saw the youth in his best clothes walking up BlenheimRoad , clearly to attend service at St. Luke 's . He did not 132know how to refrain from going up to the youth , from giving him a word of welcome , a word of warning . The Way was steep . The steepness would not defeat him , if he kept firm hold of the one true Staff , which was also bread and wine for that long journey . " Excuse me , excuse me ! " He touched Eric 's shoulder . His touch was too light , his voice too low . He touched and spoke again . " Excuse me , excuse me ! " Eric Winberg turned round . He perceived that the missionary who lived opposite him , in Magnolia Street , had something to say to him . He looked with distaste on the missionary 's shabby broad-brimmed hat , his thick-lensed glasses , his bushy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gospels and pamphlets . The Jews said of him that he was an apostate Jew . They said he was receiving a large annual salary from the Society for the Conversion of the Jews , and that he would retire any day with some woman to enjoy his nest-egg . " I 've no time ! " said Eric curtly . " But  --  I beg of you . Only one moment . I believe the service does n't begin for " What service ? What do you want ? " " I wished to speak to you of Christ Jesus , my child . I have heard that only lately " The look that came into Eric 's eyewas not one of patrician hauteur . Mr. Stern knew that look too well  --  the loathing of the Jew for the Jew who has gone to Christ . " Rah ! " said Eric . " You filthy man , go away ! You make me sick ! " 6And finally there was Miss Tregunter , who lived in the Hubbardfirst-floor front-room . If anyone had nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all gaiety , she thought it unrefined . She had a lot to do with the refined reputation of the Hubbards . But if Miss Tregunter had occupied the first-floor front-room of the Borgia palace , the Borgias would have had a different reputation . Miss Tregunter was not an interfering old lady . She rarely descended from her upstairs room , for she had had the tiniest of kitchenettes installed on the landing , and she asked help from nobody . It would not , of course , have been genteel for Miss Tregunter to go out and do her own shopping . The tradesmen133were only too proud to deliver their wares to Miss Tregunter , and Dolly carried them upstairs with care , for Miss Tregunter liked everything just so . She ate very little , but all she ate was genteel . The grocer provided her with rashers as thin as tissuepaperand woe upon the green-grocer if there were any eyes in his potatoes . She ate asparagus in the season , about two or three stalks , and made herself a dish of strawberries dainty enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be imagined how icily she disapproved of the habit the gentile ladies formed at this time of dropping in to make a small purchase now and again at the Jewish grocery-shop . From her watch-tower window she saw Dolly creep in one morning , for poor Dolly did n't want her friends to think her high and mighty , and what was good enough for them was n't good enough for her , and what difference is there , after all , between Jewish candles and Christian candles ? Miss Tregunter spoke to Dolly quite briefly about her dreadful lapse . It did not occur again . Miss Tregunter hardly ever came downstairs , except to snip away a withered flower front the little beds in the front-garden or shave off a projecting leaf front the level surface of the box hedge . And yet she imposed her gentility on every corner of the house . A new wallpaper was not chosen till she was consulted . Walter paid for Dolly 's clothes , but Miss Tregunter saw they were quiet and proper . She appointed what flowers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter did the labouring . That was in the front-garden and in the neat borders she had got him to construct round the four sides of the tiny back-yard . But no soul but herself laid a finger on the flower-boxes on her own window-sills ; she and no other prepared the soil and enriched it with a little manure and watered the plants and tended their leaves and flowers . No wonder she shooed the little Jew boys away when they started playing ball or piggy-andstickwithin hurtful distance of her boxes . The wicked little Jew boys , to whom a lily and a turnip were alike vegetables , and they did not wipe their noses and their stockings came down over their boots. little Jew boys had the audacity to play directly under her windows . They included one or two of the lads who had lately been elected to scholarships at Doomington School and therefore thought themselves cock of the world . She motioned to them to go away at once . They , positively , did not go . She opened the window , and opened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her lower jaw fell and rose like that of a ventriloquist 's doll . " Go away ! Go away ! " she cried . " I know Mr. Furniss , the High Master . If you do n't go away I 'll tell him ! " The awe invoked was not enough . They did not go away . " Go away ! " she cried again . " I 'll tell the Chief Constable ! " A few days later she invoked the Bishop . For she was genteel and had genteel friends . Yet no-one knew where Miss Tregunter came from and from what sort of a family . She had come to live in Magnolia Street some years towards the end of the last century , while Walter 's mother was still alive and a long time before his sister got married . There had been no Jews for many streets south of MagnoliaStreet for some years after . When the old Mrs. Hubbard died , Walter and his sister would have liked to move into a smaller house , for he was still a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . But it was quite impossible to suggest to Miss Tregunter that the house was going to be given up and she must make arrangements to carry her window-boxeselsewhere . And besides , entirely of her own accord , M : 3s Tregunter offered to pay two shillings a week extra for her room . So they stayed on . And then Walter 's sister was going to get married . And then there seemed a very real danger of Miss Tregunter being forced to go , for , of course , she could not stay on in the house with only a young man about the place . And once more the danger was averted . Walter and Dolly met each other . And they got married . And Walter kept his sister in the house a full month after the marriage . So everything was very proper , and Miss Tregunter stayed on behind her window-boxes . The Coopers were , no doubt , the best-born family in Magnolia Street . But it is possible that Miss Tregunter had more exalted blood in her veins . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Tawnie , or Kate Ritchie , neither of whom was a lady in the ordinary sense of the word . But MissDuring this period , it must be confessed , the little Jew boys lost their sense of proportion completely . So did the little gentile boys . They played together on each other 's pavements as if Jews and gentiles were as good as each other . More than once the134 135Tregunter stood completely outside such categories of blood , lofty or base . It was only by a real exercise of the imagination you remembered that blood of any quality flowed in her veins at all . The sharpness of her features , the angularity of her movements , made her seem rather a marionette than a human being ; and that illusion was heightened by the faculty she had of sitting behind her curtains for many hours at a stretch , and looking down through her geraniums on to the street below . Such a person as she , might have been a duchess or a bargee 's bastard daughter . If the invincible demon of gentility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tradition and association , it would have made of her Miss Tregunter . Yes , she was genteel . It was a good thing for both Miss Tregunter and the Hubbards , that they lived in each other 's house . Their house was a credit to Magnolia Street and the whole neighbourhood . If it was not for that house there would n't have been a single gentile or a single garden left in Magnolia Street , or the whole region , perhaps . But the day was to come when the house of Walter Hubbard was not so genteel as all that . It was a very unrefined day and it was a good thing that Miss Tregunter did not outlive it. 136 CHAPTER X1KATE RITCHIE , Leah Winter , Rabbi Shulman , Eric Winberg  --  forone reason or another they did not join in the fun . Rachel , the Rabbi 's daughter did , and in a very special sense . In that sense she was herself the mistress of the ceremonies . She did n't have time to go to the ordinary parties . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a baby a few clays after the rescue ; and really , short of actually having it , it was on Rachel that all the trouble fell . And then she had all the looking after the boys to do . Her father mixed them all up . Her mother , even when she was up and about , left them to themselves , she was always so busy worrying about those of them that were not there . All the children looked exactly like each other . Rachel looked exactly like the boys , excepting that she was a girl and they were boys . Solly looked exactly like Benjamin , one year his junior , and Benjamin exactly like Yossel . The only way of giving them their right names was to see them all together and work downwardfrom the eldest or upward from the baby . Even now , a few days after he was born , Abey showed himself a Shulman of the Shulmans . Perhaps Mick , whd was three years old , was the least Shulman of them all . There was something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the ears lay up against the head , which was clearly not Shulman . But who , excepting the fire-goyah who had second sight , foresaw that it was Madison Square Garden ? Rachel was the only member of the household who could say their names straight off . Her own stockings were always falling down , she spent so much time lifting up the stockings of her brothers . She had a heart of gold . It is possible there was some beauty in her face , if you could ever have seen it clear through her hair . John Cooper , who lived almost opposite when he was 137in Doomington , was smart enough to realise there was something to the girl if she only got busy with herself . But she was too busy with her father and her mother and Solly and Benjamin and Yossel and all of them . And Eric Winberg . She loved Eric Winberg . He had not cast a single glance at her for five years , but she loved him . She would have laid down her neck in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benny Edelman rescued Tommie Wright and for some weeks reigned in glory , she fell in love with Benny Edelman and wanted him to be the guest of honour at her garden-party . At least she persuaded herself she was in love with Benny , as many another lady in Magnolia Street , young and old , did . It was really Eric she loved always , always , even later on , in the War , when he climbed high on to a white horse and fell off again , down , down . She wanted Benny to be the guest of honour at her gardenparty . Of course , she never gave a garden-party . She never even went to one . The fact was that it had happened once that the aristocratic Miss Winberg had come in from the aristocratic suburb of 1 ) idshnry , and she was all pink like a pink fat little rose-bud ; and she had a pink parasol ; and she did not smell so much of bath-salts , as she waddled down the street , as of petals falling from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word went about she had just come from a garden-party . Somehow , for Rachel Shulman , the word was less like a pink petal than a pink burr . It stuck . It stuck in her blouse , her hair , her soul . She too wanted to go to a garden-party . A gardenpartywould he so different from the kitchen of their house , with all her brothers sitting about everywhere , on the sofa , on the kitchen step , on the yard step , all with their noses buried in books , and her mother complaining that there was n't any boiled potatoes when she had n't bought any potatoes for a fortnight . She saw pink parasols all over a green lawn and there was music and tennis and ice-create which tall gentlemen with shining hair and princely manners offered languid ladies in pink deck-chairs . The daisies had pink edges to their whiteness and there was pink raspberry-pop and pink icing on the cakes . Oh what bliss it would be to go to a garden-party ! And then , when everybody was exerting themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her : not merely to go to a garden-party , but to give one ! To give one for Benny 's 138sake ! She would have Benny on her right-hand and Eric on her left . ( Even now she could not keep Eric quite out of it . ) Benny was wearing a top-hat and frock-coat , while Eric was wearing a top-hat and his Eton suit . Practically everybody was in top-hats . She herself wore a pale pink dress with a blue sash , and a large floppy straw-hat sheltering her face from the supernal sunshine . It was , indeed , Heaven ! The blaze and beauty were too much for her weak eyes . She turned round from Heaven . The pink ices melted in the strong sun because there was no-one to eat them . There were no pink ices for them to eat . There was no gardenparty . Her father was sitting in the corner bent nearly double over the great yellow volume on the table before him . Had he had anything to eat to-day ? Or yesterday ? She knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat for a fortnight . Or perhaps longer ; until his spirit slid gently out of his enfeebled and enormous body , still bowed over the page of Zohar in which he still read , with glazing eyes , of the light that shone in the Cave of Machpelah whilst Jacob dwelt in Canaan , but ceased when he went forth to Egypt , and did not shine again till his body was brought back to his own land . " Father ! " she cried . " Father ! Will you have something to eat now ? " He made no reply . " Solly ! Benjamin ! Yossel ! " she whimpered . They did not lift their faces from their books . They gestured at her vaguely . She knew that they had been induced to go off that night with the Briggs boys and the Poyser boys and George Derricks and some others to a roller-skating-rink . Benny himself had consented to accompany them . Her brothers wanted to get through as much work as possible before the others came . There was no time to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had come in from school two hours ago . She remembered she had n't even given them any food that morning to put in their pockets to eat at lunch-time , as they sat on the hot-water pipes in the school basement . Why , there they were , still on the table  --  the bagels that she had brought in for them from Mrs. Poyser 's that morning . Bagels are like large wooden curtain-rings to look at . They now were like curtain-rings to eat . She cut them and buttered them 139 and handed them over to the three boys . They reached their hands out but did not look at the stuff they were eating . They just lifted it into their mouths and nibbled at it and kept their eyes glued on the Via Latina and the Anabasis of Xenophon . They were not dreaming of pink pop and ices in celestial gardenparties . Rachel felt a sharp sense of guilt . She went into the scullery to wash up , and smashed three plates . The Shulman boys were going to a roller-skating-rink party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacchanalian the spirit was that had taken possession of Magnolia Street . Yossel Shulman was twelve . He had won a scholarship at Doomington School and had entered on his first term . Solly , the eldest , had won his two years ago , Benjamin last year . There was no reason to believe Yankel would not win one next year . None of the boys had inherited their father 's passion for holy learning , but all of them were studious to their finger-tips . They did not love scholarship for itsel f , but because it was the road to a professional career . Sully had gone on the Classical Side . He was going to be a doctor . Benjamin had gone on the Modern Side . He was going to be a research chemist . Yossel was going to be a solicitor . These determinations were crystal-clear on the clay they first crossed the threshold of the school as elected scholars . They announced them to Mr. Furniss , the headmaster , with a simplicity and directness that almost terrified him , accustomed as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of the Poet Laureateship to the naive modesty of becoming an engine-driver or a cowboy . In almost every important quality the young Shulmans were already the thing they had severally decided to be , a doctor , a solicitor , a chemist . There was still a certain amount of actual knowledge to acquire , but that was purely a matter of time . There was just one aspect in which the young Shulmans failed to look the professional man in the chrysalis stage . They were so busy acquiring Greek verbs , the rivers of South America and Henry the Eighth 's wives , that they did not remember to wash themselves . They did not even forget . They just did not wash themselves . They did not tie their shoe-laces . They forgot to put ties into their collars . At number five MagnoliaStreet they had not been trained in these arts . But Doomington School was taking them in hand . There wasan appreciable difference between the ears and neck of Solly and Benjamin , Benjamin and Yossel . It was not that the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff of which martyrs are made . They were merely ducked so frequently in the wash-basins in the school basement that they slowly acquired the habit of ducking themselves . There was practically no attitude or occupation which prevented them from acquiring another and still another morsel of that learning in virtue of which they would some day deliver babies , and present statistics about the by-products of coal , and help Messrs . Cohen &; Robinson draw up a contract of partnership . They had their noses in their books at they walked to school and from school ; it was only a ray from the halo of their mystic father that prevented them from being run over a hundred times as they crossed the road among a hurtle of lorries and trains , swallowing French irregular verbs with a slight motion at the throat , such as a frog makes swallowing flies . When they sat down they stayed down , till there were n't any more battles to learn off in the Wars of the Roses . They were never top of the form in school , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom his mother had brought back from Germany only two years ago . He was top of the Sixth . He had already contributed an essay on NeoPlatonismto the Hibbert Journal . The Shulman boys lacked his genius . But in their own forms they were never lower than the first five . Solly would make a good doctor some day . He would be married and he would never dream of going out to a patient without both of his shoe-laces being tied properly . There 'd be little about coal-gas Benjamin would not know . Yossel , Yankel , Issy , they would be good husbands and decent members of their professions . And no nonsenseabout pink ice-cream at garden-parties . . . . " Some tea ? " asked Rachel . " You 've had no tea all day ! " But nobody answered . There was no sound except the tap leaking in the scullery and the leaves of the text-books , turning , turning . An hour went by , an hour and a half . Then at last there was a loud knock at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poysers , George Derricks , Benny Edelman . Tommie Wright was with Benny Edelman . He refused to be separated from him . Nellie Tawnie was with him , too . She had given up the idea , for the time being , of marrying Dick Cooper . She was going to140 141marry Benny Edelman . Nellie Tawnie 's grandmother was away in Blackburn . So there was no way of persuading Nellie that this was purely a bachelor party . " All right ! " Benny had promised benignly . " I 'll look after her ! " " See she comes to no harm ! " roared Steve . " Right , Steve ! " said Benny . The party knocked loudly at the Shulmans ' door . " What 's that ? " cried Rachel . The boys kept their noses in the books . " Of course ! " cried Rachel . " You 're going to the skating-rink to-night , with all the boys ! Have you forgotten ? " The Shulmans lifted their studious eyes . Slowly awareness carne back into their faces . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh yes , of course ! " " And you 've not had a drop of tea since this morning , " she wailed . " Oh that does n't matter ! " they said . They picked up a handful of books each and stuffed them into their satchels . " So long ! " they said . " I hope you have a nice time ! " she ventured . She sighed . She would have liked to go with them but there was too much to do at home . So far as she was concerned , she would rather give a party herself by day , in a garden . There was so much dust flying about in roller-skating-rinks . There would be none on the soft grass , under the trees , with a band playing somewhere beyond the shrubbery , and pigeons cooing in the tree-tops , and Benny and Eric in their top-hats , and Bella in a wonderful creationfrom Paris . " Wo n't you have a little strawberry ice , Bella ? Do . I can personally recommend it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's right . And a little wafer to go with it ? " Her father made some slight movement in his corner . " It 's about time poor father had something ! " Rachel realised . " Really it is ! " " Rachel ! Rachel ! " her mother cried from upstairs . " Have you forgotten those napkins ? " " Coming ! Coming ! " shouted Rachel . They all had a lovely time at the roller-skating-rink . Frankie Briggs could skate quite nicely . He took Benny in hand . It was too funny watching Benny trying to learn to skate . He 142 tumbled about like a rhinoceros . At first Tommie was terribly alarmed and his yells punctuated the steady grind and thunder of the skates . Then he realised it was funny , and he insisted on learning to skate himself . The Poyser boys were looking their best . There were three of them , Joe , who was shortly leaving school , and twins , Harry and Jack , aged ten . The twins were great experts at piggy-andstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window once . It had been a dreadful time . An icy silence hung over MagnoliaStreet , like the silence that might hang over the synagogue if someone should drop the Scroll of the Law in the moment of extracting it from the Ark . They carried groceries in the morning before they went to school and in the evening after they returned and before and after their attendance at Reb Aryeh 's Hebrew school . So it was understandable that the young blood should rise in them occasionally and induce them to play piggyand-stickin the gutters . But nothing at all could be said for them in extenuation of the Miss Tregunter blasphemy . That was a bad day 's work . They behaved very decently at the skating-rink . You could tell which was Joe . He was bigger than the twins . As for the twins , one was wearing a big brown bow and the other was wearing a big blue bow . So you could tell which was Harry and which was Jack . All the boys tried to skate with varying degrees of success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shulman boys did not try to skate . They sat together on a form at the edge of the rink , with their books balanced on the padded railings . " Quadrupedanteputren sonitu quatit ungula campum , " murmured Solly . " Amo , auras , ainat , " murmured Yossel . Benjamin was muttering a chemical formula to himself over and over again . George Derricks did not spend all his time skating , though he skated quite creditably . He spent some of it seeing if the Shulmanboys had anything worth while in their pockets . All he found was a pocket-knife . It was not a good one , but he thought he might as well have it as not. 2Yes , George Derricks was present , too , at the roller-skatingrinkparty . He was present at all the parties , though he was the143only member of his family who was . He was always slipping in and out from one house to the other at this time . He produced a vague sense of discomfort whenever he appeared , but you really could not say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand where it should n't be . It was only later , when it all died down , that Mrs. Carter saw that her long silver pickle-fork was missing and Mr. Poyser could n't find his fountain-pen anywhere . Other things were missing , too . But the fact was that people were rather fatalistic about George . If he wanted a thing he got it ; if he did n't get it one day he got it the next day . So what was the good of regretting it ? What he did with the things he appropriated was a profound mystery . During the days that succeeded the triumph on the brick-croft , when both Mr. Emmanuel and Mr. Stanley lost their watches , you did not see him study the time on the dials of two watches , or of one , even . IIe did not cut his pencils with two separate knives , all equipped with cork-screws and nail-files and awls and tin-openers , or with one , even . It was never reported that he dived for pickles in his mother 's pickle-jar with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his demeanour and appearance George was a model . He was much the nicest-looking boy at the parties . His waterproof collar was always sponged quite clean , both its stud holes were in good condition . The way he raised his hat to Jessie Wright and old Mrs. Edelman indiscriminately was a treat . But he never looked better than at the great reception Mr. Emmanuel staged a couple of weeks later in Unity Hall . His hair was flawlessly parted in the middle . He had a flower in his button-hole . And when Becky Poyser sang Tosti 's Good-bye , he was seen to dab his eye with a handkerchief , for the sad sweet song had got the better of him . How little did George , or anyone else , suspect that treacherous piece of soap which lay in wait for him round the corner ? For the imp of the grotesque was too much for him . After so brief but brilliant a career , it would have been fitting if they had caught him on the point of successfully appropriating a grand piano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his undoing . As his hand dived down upon a tray of pieces of soap exposed outside a hardware shop in Blenheim Road , his own bootlace tripped him up , this being the first occasion for years that his 144 boots were not tied properly . It was , perhaps , rather the bootlace than the soap that undid him . So that George disappears from our tale quite soon after we make his acquaintance . They took him away to a Reformatory School for some time . He reappears for a brief moment in 1916 , in a blaze of glory and a Distinguished Conduct Medal . Yet people did n't blame George ; they blamed his mother . Virtuallyhe had no mother , she was so completely wrapped up in his brother , Wilfred . His father was like that , too ; he virtually had no wife . But the old man did not fall into evil ways . He went on with his fretwork . " Just unnatural , I call it ! " declared Mrs. Briggs at the Lamb and Lion , a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor boy 's fault at all , I do n't think ! " " And of course the poor father , what with his indigestion and that , never able to do nothing with him , neether ! " affirmed the slightly querulous voice of Sally Carter . " Father , indeed ! " snorted Mrs. Tawnie among her ivory beerhandles . " As much ' is father as I 'm Queen Alexandra ! " " You do n't say ! " murmured Mr. Briggs . Mrs. Tawnie suspended her pump-handle in its pumping for a brief moment , as if she was n't at all sure she was n't going to interpret Mr. Brigg 's remark as a contradiction. " 0 daw n't I , " she contented herself by saying , " daw n't I ! " And she shook her head till the great mass of her red hair tottered. 3Perhaps the Edelman  --  Wright merry-makings reached their peak on the second Sunday after that good Thursday . One or two independent streams of joy happened to be flowing , but they were all caught up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to everything else , there was a lot of unaccustomed money about . Mr. Stanley , the shoemaker , was responsible for that , but not , of course , in his shoemaking capacity . That was the strange thing about Mr. Stanley . He could sometimesput other people in the way of making an odd pound or two , but the more he studied , the more difficult he found it to make an odd pound or two for himself . He was a shoemaker , but his heart was n't in it . Perhaps , if he had only taken shoemakingseriously for just a few years , he might really have man-145aged to get away from it . But he did n't . He knocked the nails into the soles as if he hated them , and that is n't the way to knock them in straight . They often go in sideways and poke a hole into the socks of your customers and then they go elsewhere with their next pair of shoes . His heart was in racing and football ; but not in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavement were keen on those things . He never , or rarely , went to see the actual horses race in the Doomington Handicap , or to see a needle contest between Doomington United and Sheffield Wednesday , who had only a point between them , and if Huddersfield only got one point out of Everton , the winner at Old Trafford was sure of the League honours . He did not care for horses or footballers as flesh-and-blood propositions but as units in a game of possibilities . All in all , Mr. Stanley had been forced to spend a good many hours over his last , and there he had developed a peculiarly abstract type of mind . Perhaps he brought it with him to his shoemaking . But if you were to study any of the countless scraps of paper which foamed about his feet wherever he went , you would say that those hieroglyphicsrepresented the efforts of some modern necromancer to discover the Elixir of Life , or of some abstruse mathematician to plunge into a new dimension . You would hardly have guessed that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel 's Kiss in the two o'clock next Friday on Doncaster . But to judge from the decades that Mr. Stanley had been doomed , and was still doomed , to spend at his shoemaking , you would have concluded that there was not much to choose among these various occupations in the way of hopelessness . Now and again Mr. Stanley fell upon hours of deep gloom . His most infallible systems of divination seemed as fallible as all the others . It was in times like these that a demon of doubt assailed him . Perhaps there was no such thing as a system . Perhaps it was all a combination of chance and crookedness . His whole edifice of abstruse calculation tottered about him . With a sudden spasm of fury he lunged forward with his fist and sent it scattering . It did not occur to him at such a time to abandon his betting and apply himself with more zeal to his shoemaking . Had not Johnnie Grey , who now owned half a dozen theatres in London , started off his fortune at a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oldham trams ? He did not give up his betting . Instead , having trusted so vainly to his honourable , elaborate and ill-starred systems , he became the blindest devotee of Chance and Dreams . He would run after a scrap of paper caught in an eddy and allow his eye to catch a word upon it . If the two initial letters of the word were contained in the name of one of the day 's starters , he backed it . He slept with a pencil by his bedside to jot down some promising image that his dreams might present to him . Or he consulted his wife anxiously and shamefacedly to see if she had dreamed anything useful . Burt his wife was a stolid woman and she did not dream often , and when she dreamed , it was in German . She was not of much use . Normally speaking the Jews on the opposite pavement had no place at all in the universe of Mr. Stanley . He did not mend their shoes for them . They had no data to offer on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , away , against Aston Villa . They did not exist for him . Excepting only during those periods of totemism . Then , really , Mr. Stanley presented as edifying a spectacle as some equatorial savage , necklaced with cowrie-shells , all of a flutter with taboos and mutterings and eyeball-rollings . He became alertly conscious of the little Jewish boys with their brown eyes and their curly hair , playing on their own pavement . He became conscious of them as people do of the gypsies who congregate on the downs and meadows round race-tracks on big days . And somewhat in the same manner he approached them , feeling at once desperate and silly . He would give them pennies and bid them close their eyes and circle with a pin over the day 's list of probable starters . He could scarcely breathe with the suspense of it as the pin circled and then swooped , upon some fifty-to-one outsider , it may be . He sweated with excitement . Next day he put his shirt upon it , smiling to himself darkly . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shirts too . But they were sceptical . Sometimes the little Jew boys picked a winner for him . Much more frequently they did not . It was a difficult business . But it was all very different during the Edelman  --  Wright epoch . Somehow he could n't go wrong . He kept buzzing about from pavement to pavement , just giving tips , in the way Jessie Wright gave flowers and Mrs. Seipel gave egg-cakes . IIe emerged from the twilight of his laboratory into the easy sunlight . He con- 147suited no oracles . He gave tips , and they were lucky ones . He had given tips for ages in the Lamb and Lion , so they did n't do anything about it , most of them . But the Jews put five shillings on each way , just because it seemed unfriendly not to . And for a week or two outsider after outsider that Mr. Stanley had recommendedcame romping home . Mr. Stanley did n't say : " I told you so ! " Although he himself did not happen to back any winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one and the same time he decided that his success was the fine flower of his studies , and that absolutely all you had to do to succeed was to name the first horse that came into your head , before you had time to think of another one . Mr. Emmanuel , for instance , found himself ridiculously richer by five pounds ten , and all he remembered doing was to say yes , he would , when Mr. Stanley asked him would he . It had something to do with a two shilling piece , and he was certain he had not even handed it over to Mr. Stanley . He had been spending his winnings violently , yet he still had a lot left . He was Clerk to the Jewish Board of Guardians , who looked after the interests of the Jewish poor of Doomington ; and though he was not fated to he of much practical use to humanity in the millennial schemes he expounded from public platforms , from his swivel-chair in his office he performed countless acts of unrecorded benevolence . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the false from the true . The false had short shrift from him ; the true received the benefit of prolonged and devoted hours , spent either at his desk or tramping about the countryside among the houses of rich people . He often did not see eye to eye with the board over the merits of the applicants for their help . So when he won five pounds ten he bought Mrs. Levitsky a load of coal , for it was cheaper in the summer , and her bronchitis always came on that bad in the winter months . He also bought a chicken and two dozen eggs for Mrs. Braunstein , who had had a baby . He had recently sold his album of foreign stamps to keep Mr. Finestone in the country a week longer . Mr. Emmanuel was a keen collector of foreign stamps , it was such an international hobby . So now , having won five pounds ten , he started his collection again humbly , with cheap packets of Forty Assorted , Price One Shilling. 148But Mr. Emmanuel had not only won five pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just won a prize in an art competition organised by the Art Gallery authorities . A writer in a newspaperhad said : " That young man will go far . If he is really fifteen , he is a genius . If he is fifty , he is still a genius . " One or two old women , and a journalist or two , had already used this same word , " genius , " regarding young Max . To Max it was no more than if they had said " turnip " or " Saskatchewan . " He had n't any feeling for words . He just went on thrusting away with his paint-brushes or tracing a long curve with his charcoal , delicately , almost lewdly . Mr. Emmanuel did n't like the painting which won the Art Gallery prize . It represented a fat lady in blue tights sitting on a low flight of doorsteps . They were , in fact , the doorsteps of his own house in Magnolia Street , and the fat lady had a face suspiciously like Bella Winberg . Mr. Emmanuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too self-centred . Of course , he was not old-fashioned and stupid about it . He knew there was good money in certain forms of art , and that the artists who drew the frocks in the women 's magazines could earn ten pounds a week at it , and more . But the boy was not shaping that way at all . He had n't any interest in people . Above all , he had no interestin Love . Yet Mr. Emmanuel could n't pretend he was n't proud of his son for winning the prize , even if paintings of fat ladies in blue tights do n't help people to love each other . And there was still quite a lot of the five pounds ten left that Mr. Stanley 's wizardry had conjured out of the void for him . And he was happy , he was terribly happy . The reign of Love , as between the Jews and gentiles , was beginning . He did n't delude himself . Magnolia Street was only a small street and an obscure one . But it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of limeblossomfrom street to street , from district to district . From Doomington to Liverpool , from Liverpool to Birmingham . . . . He stopped . He found he was pacing up and down the parlour , delivering a speech . His wife , Slatta , looked on with adoring eyes . " Tell them , Slatta , " he bade her , " tell them all to come in on Sunday afternoon . We shall have a party . " " Yes , " she whispered , " of course I 'll tell them . Go on , " she urged him . " Yes ? From Liverpool to Birmingham . . . ? " 149 So the Emmanuels had a party that Sunday afternoon and nearly the whole street came in . It was a good thing that the party looked after itself . There was a lot to eat and drink and everybody knew everybody and there was a good deal of joking and even a little kissing and things went on merrily . The Emmanuels were not good hosts , really . It was the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening that was necessary . Mr. Emmanuel could not resist treating the party as a public meetingand addressing speeches at it . Max was rather surly . He sat behind a plant-pot , dabbing at his sketch-book  --  the curve of a nose , the way an eyebrow went . He sat there for quite a long time , not saying a word to anybody . He did not like to have Magnolia Street hang up against him . He did not notice the two small girls who came in , the one about twelve , small and dark and Jewish , the other , only a year or so older , but fair , tall , gentile . Ile was not aware of the adoration with which the eyes of the younger rested on the face , the not thrillingly beautiful face , of the elder girl . Only when the elder girl , finding something that the younger had said incrediblyfunny , threw hack her head and laughed , only then did Max Emmanuel lift his head from his sketch-book . It was not a noise that belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a clear pleasant tinkle , like spring water . It was not a face that belonged to these faces , with its fine hair , thin nose , its suspicion of a cleft in the chin . He knew who she was . She was Enid Cooper from across the street . The small girl was Jane Seipel . His pencil dropped from his hand . His sketch-book slid from his knee . It was very rarely indeed that his pencil and sketch-book behaved so . Enid Cooper stopped laughing . Max made no effort to retrieve his things , so she bent down for them . He bent too . Their hands met . She smiled . He smiled back , with a queer promptness , a sense of recognition . Jane Seipel noticed nothing . She would not have noticed it much if the wall had sagged a bit . Her hand lay warm in the cool hand of her adored . For this bliss , too , Benny Edelman was responsible . RedoubtableBenny ! Enid Cooper had come walking up to Jane at school , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal . " I live in your street , " she said . Jane blushed a peony-red. 150 " Is n't it fun , " Enid continued , " the way that great big clumsy fellow rescued the little boy ? " Janey 's eyes shone . It was true . It was true . The goddess had stepped out of a cloud . The goddess was addressing her with her own lips . " Yes , " whispered Jane , " is n't it fun ! " Then came Saturday , two days later . They spent the afternoon in Layton Park . Enid told her the names of flowers . Enid said : " We 'll take lunch together and buy a glass of milk when we get there . And ice-cream , " said Enid . And to-day it had occurred to Jane that Enid might like to come to the Emmanuel party . And it had occurred to Enid that this might be fun , too . So it was that Max Emmanuel met Enid Cooper , and did not for a long time meet her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not being bored . " " It 's perfectly lovely , " said Enid . Jane went on staring , round-eyed . " They 're good faces , " Enid continued . " You mean , " said Max excitedly , " good to draw ? They are . How clever you are ! " " You must do Jane 's some day , " she insisted . Both their faces turned round towards Jane . She had not moved . With the eye that was invisible to Jane , Enid winked . It was a tolerant goodhumouredwink . Max winked back . " I will ! " he said . " Shall I draw you some day , Jane ? " " No ! Do Enid ! " He looked at Enid . " I sha n't be able to , " he said slowly . " I do n't know why . " " I wonder , " Enid murmured . A small boy was offering her cakes . " This is your brother , is n't it ? " she asked . " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He 's a genius , " said David shyly . " The paper said so ! " " You go and look after mamma , " said Max . " She looks ; thirsty . " " Mamma , mamma ! " David tugged at her skirt . " Do have somethink , wo n't you , mamma ? " Jane sat on , holding Enid 's hand . Enid and Max talked , they did not quite know what about , but they talked easily , as if they had met often and talked much . Max 's mother listened  --  but it151twas to her husband she listened . Her husband had rehearsed his speeches before her for twenty years , so she had got the habit of listening . Whether she definitely bent her mind to them or not , it is certain that something of their general purport must have seeped in . She was a lady of two minds . She could never quite decide whether her first duty lay by humanity at large , or by her husband and their children . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . But then they were not married to Isaac Emmanuel . She was tremendously proud of him , and her pride was not abated by the fact that he hurt her feelings all the time by omitting her from his schemes and organisings . His family , somehow , did not seem to belong to that humanity which was to be welded together in a seccotine of universallove . Slatta was only his wife . Moisheh , Max , David , were only his children . But Slatta Emmanuel , also , had utopian and millennial leanings . How could she not , after being married so long to such a husband ? She did not think she could address a crowd as eloquently as Isaac . But she felt that Isaac ought to give her a chance . Did not Edith Zangwill accompany Israel Zangwill on platforms and hold her own very creditably indeed ? She had recently spoken just after her husband at the Doomington IIippodrome and had brought the house down . Slatta Emmanuel figured herself , too , in a picture hat , like Edith Zangwill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enchanting a multitude . Or she might at least be allowed to come on the platform , like the less eloquent wives of other public personages , and sit at Isaac 's right hand , and smile all the time , and nod pleasantly to an acquaintance from Magnolia Street occasionally , and show the world an example of what universal love did for you . But Isaac Emmanuel did not see it like that . Isaac knew best . She sat and listened and worshipped that evening at the party , while David went round quietly , asking people to have another slice of cake . It was David who found out that the Seipels had n't come yet . He plucked at his mother 's skirt again : " Mamma , mamma , " he whispered . " The Seipels ! They 've not come yet ! " " Yes , yes , " his mother murmured , but he knew she had not taken in what he said . She was unable to switch her mind away from his father 's eloquence , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he slipped off on his own accord 152 and went to the Seipels and asked them why they had not come . The whole party was held up waiting for them . So the Seipels came , and brought the Reczniks with them , and the Recznik gladnesswas incorporated in the Emmanuel gladness which was part and parcel of the Edelman  --  Wright gladness which made MagnoliaStreet sweeter than Eden during those early summer weeks in 1910 . Mrs. Recznik emerges only briefly out of the obscurity of Lavender Street , and disappears almost at once . She had been deserted by her temperamental husband about a week earlier . She was aware , like all unhappy wives in Longton , that number nineteen Magnolia Street was sanctuary , particularly for illtreatedor deserted wives . So she came , as by the operation of a law of nature , to number nineteen with her three children and occupied the parlour and the best bedroom . Then , this Sunday afternoon , Mr. Recznik returned , found out where his wife was , and came along weeping and wailing and strewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy at being reunited with his family , that he kissed Mrs. Recznik , the small Reczniks , Reb Feivel , Mr. and Mrs. Seipel , and Sam , Eli and Berel Seipel , with fury all over their faces . The fury was such that they were sore for days after . For Mr. Recznik had a beard like barbed wire and had not shaved all week , the lady from Babylon had kept him so busy . And then David Emmanuel came along with his message . So the Seipels went to the party and took the Reczniks with them . Mr. Recznik had by no means calmed down . He had hardly entered the Emmanuel 's parlour when he started the kissing all over again . He spared nobody . It was n't pleasant , but it certainlyhelped things to go with a swing . The girl Seipel , Janey , came in a little time later with a girl friend . And then Mr. Poyser the grocer was there , and his daughter , Becky . Mr. Poyser looked less secret and sepulchral than usual . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Poyser . IIe did not have much joy out of his wife . She was too much of an institution for that , like the Board of Shechita or Trial by Jury . But there were dark undeclared places where Mr. Poyser was a one . In those places other ones reckoned with him , he had attained Heaven knew what degree of cabalistic efficiency . He wore tiny badges in his lapel from which initiated eyes might learn what degree of efficiency it was . It was said of him that1531he was not only a Freemason and a member of the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith , but a Rechabite , a Buffalo , an Odd-Fellow and a Zionist . That must have been an exaggeration and an overlapping . He was certainly a member of the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith and a Zionist . In those clays people still spoke of Zionists as if they constituted a secret murder society . There were large photographs of Mr. Poyser on Mrs. Poyser 's walls , wearing sashes and chains and medals and other insignia . There were framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this or that society over so many years . Sometimes he went forth in strange headgear and strange garments , concealedunder an overcoat , to incredible conventions . Not ever Mrs. Poyser asked for information about these . She stood aside and watched him disappear into the night to fulfil those mysteriousassignations . He was not wearing any of his robes at the Emmanuel party , and he would have liked to . ' I'hcy would have made him look a little more imposing . But they could not have made him happier . Becky sat beside him , looking very happy , too . Each of them was still happier because the other one was happy . And the reason was not a monumental one . It was merely that Mrs. Poyser was not there . A cold in the nose kept her at home . Becky looked almost pretty . Perhaps it is too much to say that . With her pale grey eyes , her very red hair , her freckles , her big bones , she could never look that . But she knew she was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's love and tribulation . She was not of a type which appeals to the Jewish young man . She was already twenty-two , and there was no young man , not even a nibble of a young man . Mrs. Poyser felt it an implied criticism of herself that Becky had no young man . She wanted Becky to provide her with a race of grandchildren , so that when all her own children were married , and herself retired from the grocery-shop , she might still have an audience upon whom to lavish her intelligence and eloquence . But Becky was very shy , because her bones were so big and her hair so red . . . . She did n't dislike young men , but she was incapable of taking the initiative with them , and that seemed the only way in which she was likely to provide her mother with grandchildren . Mrs. Poyser put a piano into the living-room , though it was already so chock-full of sacks of sugar and flour that you would have thought it impossible to introduce a foot- 154 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scales and arpeggiosdid not tempt the passing young man to loiter . Becky Poyser had singing-lessons , but this produced no result either . So Becky turned to her father , and her father to Becky . They were more like lovers than father and daughter . And Mr. Poyser sat on Mr. Emmanuel 's sofa squeezing his daughter 's hand , and both gaped with happiness , because Mrs. Poyser was at home , and of late her eloquence had been almost too much to bear . Mr. Poyser did not care a damn if the line cast by all this pianoplayingand voice-training did not ever land a young man . He was selfish . He knew it . In the privacy of his own heart he stamped his foot defiantly . He wanted to keep his ( laughter all to himself for ever , to the last red hair on her head and her last freckle . He did n't do any foot-stamping at the Emmanuel party . Nor did Becky have to sing or play the piano . That was another reason for their being so happy . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one thing was quite definitelygoing on that afternoon . A young man , a gentile , was flirting , actually flirting , with Becky . He was a friend of the barber , Arthur Durbin . " Wo n't you try just this once ? " he kept on urging her . " It 's good for you ! " He thrust a glass of beer under her nose . " No ! " she said , of course . " I never take anything stronger than lemonade . " It was a reply , uttered in a tone , which would have numbed most young men . But it seemed to encourage Arthur Durbin 's friend . He kept on cracking nuts for her , and then , as bold as brass , he came and sat down on the sofa beside her , though there was really no room at all . His thigh lay plumb along hers . Undoubtedly Arthur Durbin 's friend was one reason why Becky was looking almost pretty that evening . But friendly is friendly , and when a gentile gentleman positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl can only squeeze her father 's hand tighter and turn her back on such impudence . But the way she turned her head once or twice , and threw a coy look over her shoulder , was like a play . You would hardly have thought Becky Poyser capable of it . Benny Edelman was in good form that evening . His jokes 155were simple but hearty . He removed chairs from under people just when they were going to sit down and poured lemonade down people 's backs . He was really just a great boy . As was only right and proper , he , too , had come in handsomely on the Stanley stakes . He had put five shillings on a couple of rank outsiders which brought off the most breath-taking double of the season . He was up a good eleven pounds . " And what , " asked Arthur Durbin , friendly like , " are you goingto do with all that money , Benny ? " Benny 's mind at the moment was somewhere else . He was trying to arrange for Albert Durbin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose it 'll have to go into the business ! " he replied , off-hand . " Business ? What business ? " asked a chorus of voices . No one till then had connected Benny with any opening-up of businesses . Benny suddenly realised he had said what he had no intention of saying . He blushed . " I was only joking ! " he said . It was said later by Mrs. Carter that she quite clearly saw Jessie Wright kick Benny hard under the table . Ihit that may have been just wisdom after the event . Further enquiries were drowned in the howl emitted by Albert Durbin as lie sat down on the drawing-pin prepared for him . The howl was drowned in roars of laughter . The roars of laughter were trebled when Arthur Durbin 's friend suddenly pounced forward in a practised manner and kissed Becky Poyser full on the cheek . The party went on from strength to strength . It went on late enough for both the Tawnies to come across from the Lamb and Lion after closing time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Derricks party . But for the Derricks hate it substituted the Emmanuel love . That was the keynote of it . Mr. Emmanuel was hoarse , he had done so much orating . His head tottered on his long neck , as if a sudden draught would snap it off . Yet it must be admitted that after the Hubbard episode , though the noise still went on , it was only noise , an automatic backwash of noise . The more Mr. Emmanuel reflected on that during the next few days , the clearer he saw it was so . Dolly Hubbard had come in to the party almost last of all . Her husband , Walter , the tram-conductor , did n't like her to go into other people 's houses , Jews or no Jews . It was n't that he was n't pleased with Benny Edelman for saving Tommie Wright . Hewas , like everyone else in Magnolia Street . He stood him more than one pint , several nights running in the Private Bar . But he did n't like Dolly to go to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to come into his own house . He did n't even like young women to come in , though all other women than Dolly were just shadows to him , not flesh and blood . He was relieved when they left . But young men , men of any age , never came at all ; not even the local secretary of the Y.M.C.A. , nor the lay preachers from the Primitive Methodist Chapel in Upper Longton , where the Hubbards regularly attended . If , by any chance , some man did come into the house  --  the gasman , for instance  --  the odd film did not come down over Hubbard 's eyes through which he saw women as shadows . A light seemed to spurt up behind his eyeballs . He saw them with a devastating clearness , not so much as men , but as creatures with questing hands and dangerous loins . He shuffled and twisted about on his chair , a faint dampness on his brow ; and then , when the visitor left , he raced over to Dolly with a beating heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and kissed her mouth so long that she was forced to break free for breath . To the neighbours it seemed that the Hubbards were the sweetestcouple for miles around . They knew that Walter was by way of being jealous , but quite a few of the wives would have liked their own husbands to be a lot more jealous . They envied Dolly that her husband loved her so fiercely after four years of married life , and no children either . And as a matter of fact , apart from this one embarrassing trait in Walter 's character , there was n't a man in all Doomington Dolly would rather have for a husband . It was a good thing to know that you meant more to a man than his food and drink ; lots of the women round about could n't say any such thing . She blushed happily to think how much he loved her ; she had rosy checks and they were like poppies now . You could n't deny it was nice to know that , wherever Walter went , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however tolled up it was , whatever sort of goo-goo eyes it made at him , could make him stop thinking of her for one single moment . He was always bringing her in little presents , and it was that rather more than any natural distaste that made him into a virtual teetotaller and a non-smoker . As a trolley-boy , to tell the truth , 156 157he had got into rather bad company . The trolley-boys of Longton were rather a fast lot and some of them drank and smoked like any full-blown inspector . He still had a bit of a craving for his pint and his packet of Woodbines , but you could n't spend money on such things often and bring in a pound-box of chocolates for Dolly on pay clay , or a pot of freesias , perhaps , or half a dozen little hankies , hemmed with lace . But the fact remained . He did not want her to go into houses where young men were . It so happened , however , that on this particular Emmanuel Sunday , Walter had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time lay very heavy on Dolly 's hands . So she thought she would slip over to the Emmanuels for a few minutes . What harm could it do ? All the street was there to look after her , anyway . She therefore waited till Miss Tregunter 's bed-time had come and gone a full half-hour , and then she went across . But she reckoned without Miss Tregunter . Even from her bed , like a ship 's captain on his bridge , she seemed to remain on guard over the decencies of the gentile pavement . Miss Tregunter knew she had gone to a house where Jews , young men , moreover , were . And certainly I ) ally stayed longer than she intended , it was such a nice break . A knock came at the door . David Emmanuel opened it and came back into the parlour looking rather scared . Before he had time to say anything , Walter Hubbard showed up in the door behind him . His face looked almost green . His eyes were staring out of his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it might have been a cat whimpering for all the notice Walter took of him . Dolly said not a word . In an instant her face became as green as her husband 's . She rose to her feet . He turned around . She followed him . The others tried to laugh it off , but it was not easy . Walter still said not a word to Dolly as they crossed the roadwayand entered the house . He was not angry . It was not anger that came upon him at these times . She busied herself with a kettle and tea things . Walter could always do with a strong cup of tea at night . He sat down at the table and opened his Bible . But the Bible said nothing to him to-night . He opened his photograph-album , for he was a talented photographer , but he paid little attention to his prints , either . He watched her out of 158 the corner of his eye , as if she might have smuggled a young man in with her as they opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was thoroughly absorbed , to slip up into the bedroom , and sink into his arms . No . The back of the Emmanuel party was broken after Walter Hubbard came and took Dolly off with him . The noise went on for a good hour perhaps . Then it subsided . The guests began to go . Albert Durbin was the last of them . He wanted to talk sociology to Mr. Emmanuel , and Mr. Emmanuel was far too gentle to tell him how tired he was . So they stood at least five minutes on the doorstep , while Albert went on about John Stuart Mill , on and on . Then Albert stopped at length , and said good night . And all this time Mr. Emmanuel was conscious of a figure standing in the darkness on the pavement opposite . l le made out the broad-brimmed hat , the bulging overcoat , the thick walkingstick , of Ben Stern , the missionary . A phantom ray of light twinkled on the thick lenses of his spectacles . He stood there , a few yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were broad as a sea , as a prairie . He stood there hesitating during all the long minutes that Albert Durbin went on sociologising . At last , when Albert left , he seemed to make up his mind to cross the road . His body lunged forward . A thrill of loathing crept up Mr. Emmanuel 's spine . Quickly he went into his own house and closed the door behind him. 159 11CHAPTER XI1MR . EMMANUEL stood upon his doorstep , the tip of his nose twitching slightly . A scent of soot drifted down upon his nostrils . A lustre was going out of the air , so palpably , it seemed to him , that if he lifted his hands and held hard , he might prevent it from going . From day to day the Edelman  --  Wright festivities continued , but the heart was going out of them . It was not only Walter Hubbard who , in his jealousy , had carried his wife away from a house where young men were . It was Miss Tregunter who had stretched forth a skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . It was the beginning of the end of Love , which had seemed likely out of this small seed to grow into a tree that would spread branches cool and far . Mr. Emmanuel was , like most idealists , a lonely man . If he was aware of his wife 's pathetic anxiety to identify herself with his causes , he was egotist enough to regard her with little more than good-humoured contempt . Or it may have been the atavistic contempt of the oriental for his female chattel . He had hoped for discipleship in one or the other of his three sons , but he had not found it . The eldest , Moisheh , was the pure essence of lout , so far as he could see . There was nothing to be hoped for from Moisheh . In Max , the painter , however , he was bitterly disappointed . He hardly expected in his own life-time to see masters and workmen kissing each other and the nations strewing each other with rose-petals . He had sometimes hoped that in Max a son was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying hand and jump on to the platform he had vacated , and in shriller , sweeter , more coherent language cry : " Love one another ! " But the boy was not like that . He was completely wrapped up in himself and his paint-box . Isaac Emmanuel sometimes felt 160so hostile towards him that he wanted to gather up his blocks and brushes and tubes and hurl them into the fire . But he did not , of course . He was too gentle for that . It was true he could behave disastrously when aroused , excepting with Moisheh , who intimidatedhim . But both the younger boys often bore for days a blue weal on the arm-muscle where their father had screwed it between finger and thumb in a sudden access of fury . These rages terrified him as much as they terrified them . But he could not manufacture them . He could not go up of set purpose to the boys ' room and destroy Max 's blocks and tubes , as he was often tempted to . There remained the small boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be able to mount platforms and proclaim the gospel . He had a religion , it was true . Mr. Emmanuel was the only person who was aware of David 's religion . Tts name was Max . It sometimes made Mr. Emmanuel white with anger to observe the deep and quiet adoration of the younger for the elder brother . The anger had a deal of jealousy in it . Nobody adored him in that dumb blind manner . Excepting his wife , of course ; but he did not count her . So , in a manner of speaking , Mr. Emmanuel was quite alone in his house in Magnolia Street . He was a busy man . He had a great deal to do at the Board of Guardians , and he imposed a great deal on himself outside of that . But it was only with the top of his brain he did that work . Lower down it was concerned with deeper problems . On platform after platform he stood swaying , expounding love to all men . He demanded that masters and workmen should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till a lock-out or a strike occurred , and his face flared up as if someone had struck it . He also proved , like Albert Durbin the barber , but on ethnical rather than sociological grounds , that wars were unthinkable , till the Great War broke out . Then his big head lunged and lolled about as loosely on his high neck as a child 's balloon on its string mooring . Throughout he saw Magnolia Street as an epitome , sharing with one other person in the same street the faculty of standing away from it , of seeing in it something greater than itself . That other person was Mary Cooper . It is to be confessed that their two names are a strange collocation ; but if they had had an opportunity to meet and talk together quietly for some hours , it would have been a precious thing for both of them. 161 Only once , only briefly , do they utter a few words to each other , and that is at the very end of our tale . These two saw in Magnolia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their quintessence . But whereas for her , impotent and embittered , there was nothing but melancholy in that spectacle , to him , impotent and sanguine , it was a perpetual excitement . He was aware , as she was , of the stability that reigned upon the gentile pavement and the unquiet heaving among the Jews . The stability that was to her stagnation , was to him a state of contentedness . These goyim lived in their own land , in the unconscious enjoyment of antique traditions and present pleasures . They streamed out upon Saturday afternoons to footballmatches , they streamed in upon Saturday evenings to publichouses . They so loved Vesta Tilley , that when they heard her announce that all the nice girls love a sailor , they seemed ready to eat her . When the cricket matches were played against their kinsmen in the antipodes , they could neither eat nor drink till they learned how the score stolid at the close of play . As for the Jews , every element in their confusion thrilled him . The elder ones did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked backward to Poland and Russia , they looked forward to America . But he saw the hearts of the younger Jews divided in another way . Not all of them wanted to " get on . " In these few years of their boyhood and girlhood they had become more impregnated with England than other foreigners might in two generations . He saw the small boys conforming to the type of the small boys opposite . They played football and cricket and studied the team-scores with , if anything , more passion . They became , or yearned to be , " sports " and " decent chaps . " Just as successfullythe little Jewish girls were becoming English " misses . " He was also aware of one more element in the heaving and seething . There was a type of Jew , both among the younger and the older folk , who had not known felicity in Russia , and would not in America , and were not at ease in England , though this was the gentlest of the lands . They looked forward to Zion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berusholcyim  --  Next Year in Jerusalem ! " To some it seemed a heartbreakingdream . Some said : " Let us only get down to it , acquiring a dunam here and a dunam there , whilst our politicians do what they can in the Chancelleries of Europe ! " None guessedhow amazingly , in how few years , something of their dream would be accomplished . But not these were the thoughts that eddied in the unlucid waters of Mr. Emmanuel 's mind as he came to his doorstep once and again and looked out upon the street , in the days that followed his party . His face had something of the expression of a child who has convinced himself that he is building a sand-castle in which he will really be able to live , and ask his friends to come and stay with him ; and then he sees that the tide has turned , and is coming closer minute by minute , and that the foundations of his house will soon be brown slush . The parties actually were still going on , though a little spectrally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregarded the fact that a cleft had been set down between the odd and even pavements . They were of the generation that a few years hence were to fight in the same trenches and be lousy with the same lice and mute with the same glory . So the lads went off again to Doomington Zoo and the roller-skating rink . And Jane Seipel still went out walking in Layton Park with her divinity , Enid Cooper . But that was hardly a party , of course . The gentile women still dropped in to Mrs. Poyser 's , but not so regularly . The Jewish youths for some reason felt themselves not quite at ease in the Durbin barber-saloon and resumed their patronage of Mr. Cohen , the Jewish barber in Blenheim Road . Mr. Emmanuel blamed himself partly . He had hardly been into the Private Bar since the first great night of the merrymaking . If he had kept on going in , Mr. Seipel and the others would doubtless have kept on going in , too . But the beer he had drunk that night really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own party , naturally , but he tried to keep his nose away from it . And then he had a lot of extra work to do lately , and his ordinary work had been disorganised by all these excitements . So he had not been in to the Private Bar for a number of days now . He stood on his doorstep feeling very dejected , a Canute biddingthe tide turn . But the tide kept on sliding forward . " No ! " he thought . " I wo n't have it ! It must n't all go to pieces ! Such a wonderful beginning ! It may not come again in my whole lifetime ! " His head swayed and swung . He wondered what he could do . What can I do ? What can I do ? 162 1 163 " Oh well ! " he sighed . " I 'll go in and have a pint with them anyhow , at the Lamb and Lion to-night ! " He knew it was not much . But he had a dim memory of a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy put his thumb into the hole which the sea made in a dyke and held the breach for hours and hours against the whole force of the sea , till it turned at length , defeated , and he saved Ifolland . He , too , would put his thumb into the hole . It might be given to him , too , to save Holland . So he went in that night to the Lamb and Lion . " Good evening , all ! " exclaimed Mr. Emmanuel as he entered the Private Bar , doing his best not to make it sound like " Mr. Chairman , Ladies and Gentlemen ! " " Well I never ! " exclaimed Maggie Tawnie heartily . " If it is n't Mr. Emmanuel ! What a stranger ! " Mr. Emmanuel winced . What a stranger ! He would rather have been greeted with any words than those . " What 's yours , Mr. Emmanuel ? " asked one or two voices . He would like to have answered a lemonade . " Oh thanks very much , Mr. Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on me ! You must n't forget that five pounds ten ! " " Do n't mention it ! But if you 'd backed Daffodil last Tuesday and put it all on Dragoman , same as I told Steve " " And did you back ' em yourself , Frank ? " " That 's got nothing to do with it ! What I say is this here  --  " he began rather shrilly . " Now quiet , quiet ! " requested his wife . She looked at her husband affectionately . His dark eyes , bright mouth , swinging hips , had all the enchantment for her which made her forswear her country nearly a score of years ago . " All right , Elsa old lady ! " He loved her , too , in the time he had to spare from his figures and scraps of paper . " A wonderful innings ! " Mr. Briggs was saying . Mr. Briggs was reviewing the week-end cricket . " He carried his bat right through . I never saw anything like it . How many sixes did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmanuel had not backed Daffodil last Tuesday and put it all on Dragoman . He did not know how many sixes he had knocked up , and who had knocked them up . They had already forgotten he was here , most of them . They were not hostile in 164the least , they were kindly people . They had merely forgotten he was here . He looked round for Benny Edelman . He , too , had stopped coming , apparently . He was not here . Neither was Jessie Wright . She would come soon , he thought . She did not come . He tried hard to think of a little billiards or cricket small talk . He had been reading of a big boxing match in Paris , but he could not remember the names . He could only think of one celebrity in the sport-world . " Talking'about Hackenschmidt  --  " he started uncertainly . But nobody had been talking about Hackenschmidt . They all stopped for a moment , politely . But Mr. Immanuel could not think of anything to say about Hackenschmidt , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh yes , " someone else muttered , " Very strong man ! " Then the conversation resumed its former courses . There was the usual traffic every now and again at the Jug and Bottle Department , and Kate Ritchie came and asked for her pint . One or two of Leah Winter 's fire-go yahs came and asked for theirs . So did a few other men and women strangers . Then came a rapping which everybody recognised , expect Mr. Emmanuel , who was no expert . It was a timid and defiant rapping  --  therapping of Henry Derricks , which had not been heard much the last two or three weeks . " Good evening , Henry ! " proclaimed Maggie Tawnie , as always , before she had slid the panel aside . " Good evening , all ! " said Henry . " Evening , Henry ! " He placed two enormous jugs on the ledge before him . " Have n't you got nothing bigger at home , Henry ? " " Only the bath-tub ! " replied Henry with spirit . " Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mind you do n't get tiddly , Henry ! " " Do n't cuddle the red-haired ones ! They 're the dangerous sort ! " Henry promised he would n't . " Thank you , Maggie ! " He blinked nervously all round . " Goodnight , all ! " " Goodnight , Henry ! " He withdrew . At the moment that he withdrew from the Jug and Bottle , Mr. Emmanuel withdrew from the Private Bar . t-Ie remembered he had a long journey to make to get some mone , out1651of a rich manufacturer for the baby-creche he was trying to get up in Longton , for gentile and Jewish babies . He was aware that no-one noticed his going . There was a taste of dust on his tongue and the rims of his eyelids were smarting , as if there had been pepper in the air. 2There had not been what you might call a party at the Derricksesfor some time , not since the beginning of the Edelman  --  Wright business , in fact . The Boys had dropped it i at Mother Derricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere propitious for the starting-up of a party . They were not a brave company . They felt their sort of party would n't be popular for the time being . So they waited . More discreet than brave , they were accurate judges of the psychological moment . They felt now , that if they had a party , they would not need to cramp their style . So they sent I lenry out with a couple of large jugs . Mrs. Derricks got busy with a great steaming dish of faggots . Henry brought iii the beer duly , but the Boys did not ask him to stay , nor did he want to . Ile knew that before the evening was over , all the photo-frames he had fretted , and the cigaretteboxes , and the menu-card-holders , would be smashed like eggshellsbetween the fingers of the Pocket Samson . He could n't bear the sight of that , or the smell of the beer , so he was much better up in his room , fret-working . It was really no tribute to the Pocket Samson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " novelties , " as they were called , any child could do it . But perhaps it was a good thing . It gave Henry something to set his mind on , while the high jinks went on downstairs . He turned himself assiduously to the manufacture of more menu-card-holders . It may have been his own secret and tender dream that some day someone would put menu-cards in those menu-card-holders . But the menu at Mrs. Derricks 's partiesdid not vary sufficiently to justify the use of them . There was beer and faggots , or tripe and beer , or beer and black puddings . Sometimes there were winkles , too , or pigs ' trotters , or cow-heels . In the meanwhile , downstairs , his son , the Nightingale , was sending forth his voice . It was as a Nightingale , a boy-singer , that Wilfred made his 166 appearance in all the shoddy little variety-theatres from Bradford to Runcorn . He had one or two engagements as the cheeky little boy in pantomime ; but they did not re-engage him . His joking sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortably , they felt so awkward . It was exactly so with his militaryaudiences at a later date . He returned , therefore , to sing songs of Araby and tales of fair Kashmir and to wish that those lips could only speak , those eyes could only see , those beautiful golden tresses were there in reality . It was a fairly pretty voice , though he had to twist his mouth grotesquely before he could use it . In order to fill even a small theatre hue had to pull his face into such frightful contortions , that you thought he must snap those delicate jaw-bones . Bridget Derricks was his mother and he was the apple of her eye . He stood to her in a double relationship . She petted him and coaxed him and kissed him as if he were truly the small boy he seemed at first glance to be . He was also her friend , her confidant , the mature son of thirty , almost everything a husband might have been . Also , she was afraid of him . If anything crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the day before he had gone to the tin trunk under her bed where she kept her new hat . Spitting like some small beast , he dug his even teeth into it , and tore it into shreds and danced on it . Some days earlier he had filled her shoes with treacle , and pulled the kitchen tablecloth from the table with its load of cups and plates . It was as if the wretched spirit inside him , which had kept growing from decade to decade within the monstrous little body which had not kept pace with it , at length found too much for it its accumulated exacerbation . It was always his mother he treated so , as if in some obscure manner it was she whom he blamed for his misfortune . If he did not ignore his father , he treated him kindly . He bought him some three-ply wood or a new fret-saw . That was another reason why both mother and son wanted to have a party . After destroying the new hat , he went off to bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eiderdownbeneath him in his misery and moaned for hours . Until , when Mrs. Derricks thought it safe , she crept up to him and , with extraordinary delicacy , seeing she was so robust a woman , she twined his hair about her fingers and breathed into his ear : " Never mind , duck ; never mind . I ' ated that ' at ! it looked Lair 167 sight on me , it did ! Like a bloody plant-pot ! ' Ad n't you better be gettin ' up , lad ? ' Ad n't we better ' ave t ' Boys along to-morrow evenin ' ? " She was an uproarious woman , though some of the uproar may have been due to her fear of Wilfred going off into one of his fits , and the idea that if she shouted loud enough , she might stave it off for both of them . But she would have been a cheery soul if Wilfred had been a placid coalheaver and not a queer little stunted Nightingale . Otherwise she would n't have been so popular with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Boys were variety artistes , like Wilfred , who did turns in the smaller theatres in the northern area . The Boys were usually males , though now and again they included a girl or two . But somehow the parties never went quite so well when there were girls about . That was partly because Mrs. Derricks hated not being the centre of attractionand if there was to he any prodding in the corsets and wicked nibblings at the lobe of the ear , she liked it to he her own ear and her own corsets . She must have turned the half-century , but she could still behave as skittishly as a twenty-year-old without lookingsilly . Wilfred , too , was n't keen on having girls around . They made his forehead prickly and his hands damp . He became smaller . He went inside himself . He heard his own voice , more pipe-like than usual , as if it came from some distance off . He glowered at them , his lower lip protruding sullenly . It was as if they made him conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so acute an intellectual realisation of them . But that night , as he sat among the Boys , he was a Boy , too , in another sense than that which was his livelihood and his tragedy . His hand looked absurdly tiny clasped round his beertumbler , but not one of the Boys had it filled more often than Wilfred . He could not get drunk . He merely twittered more and more excitedly , like a mouse in a cage over which a terrier stands with cocked head , looking down at it . There was no limit to the faggots he put away . He did not touch the black puddings . They were a little too gross for him . He had an astounding range of dirty stories ; but when the Ventriloquist told a new and good one , he greeted it with a series 168of short and sharp yelps of delight . Having one woman there , gave the telling of dirty stories a quality it could never achieve in unmixed male society . Quite early in the evening , Mrs. Derricks got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and being coy and girlish . Which only stimulated the Boys to more and more shocking tales and feats of daring . They smacked her behind and squeezed her bosom . She warded off the danger and had at them with a story which took the breath out of even such brassy lungs as theirs . All the favourite Boys were there that evening . One or two newcomers had been present last time , but they had not been asked again . The Nightingale had had no pleasure in them . There was in them a certain quality which reproached Wilfred for his shortcomings , a certain quiet but excessive maleness he could not bear . But the old gang was present in full force to-night . It was lucky that their bookings permitted them all to turn up . The Baritone was there , whose posters annou1-ced him to have come hot-foot from Covent Garden . Cynics declared that it was the Market , rather than the Opera House , which was indicated , for he did not sing well . But he sang often . The Prologue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six times over that evening , without seeming to be conscious he had already sung if four or five times . But there was so much noise the whole time it did n't matter if he sang it a seventh time . The Pocket Samson , was there , too , of course . He never slipped out of favour . He was small , but not like his host , abnormal . Not , at least , when his host was there , did he seem abnormal . He had a fine set of muscles and it was always expected of him at the parties that he should show them , the way the muscles about his shoulder-blades touched and all the unusual undulations and stiffenings he was capable of producing between the elbows and the wrists . He always wore a pair of slips around his loins , so when they asked him to show the muscles he kept about his legs and thighs , he slipped his clothes off and it was all very respectable . He agitated them without pride . He was modest and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samson . It was a strange profession for him to have adopted , because his mouth seemed to move even more feverishly when he snapped the jaws of his doll than when he talked in his own person . His con-169Jsonants were doubtful when he produced them from his mouth , but when he sought to lift them out of his belly , they became converted into a standard " nnyu " sound , which made you feel he kept his nose there . He was a bad ventriloquist , and his bookingsrarely prevented him from turning up in Magnolia Street . The Conjurer had managed to turn up , though he was booked up more often than the others . He did his famous trick of balancing a lighted lamp on a stair-rod during the course of the evening , but not so dexterously as usual , for he set fire to Mrs. Derricks 's hair . With great presence of mind the Baritone quenched it with the contents of the beer-jug . The company howled with laughter , except Wilfred , who looked on vigilantly , out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Mrs. Derricks look much more damp and dishevelled than she was before . She howled louder than the rest and gave the Conjurer a resounding kiss . After the accident , the party took its usual military turn . That came on , as a rule , just after closing time . The Boys did not look very military when they were sober , or even when they were drunk . But they were a very war-like crowd , none the less . It is not clear whether they were all born equally infected with a lust for war , or whether one of them infected the others . But it is certain they were all conscious of one element lacking from their parties which prevented them from being actual Heaven . There was no war on anywhere , no English war , at least . It was rather wretched for them to have to put up with the Boer War , which had been over a long time now . But as the party went on , it seemed to go back in time nearer and nearer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards it . The names of De Wet and Cronje arose amid a hissing and booing , and the relief of Ladysmith aroused such thunder that you might have thought it was relieved only last week . Good-bye , Dolly , I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go , the Baritone announced thickly . " We do n't want to fight , " threatened Mrs. Derricks , " but by jingo if we do . . . . " But it was clear she did want to fight . Her lip curled so that you could see two of her large upper teeth. 170 The Nightingale also bade farewell to his true love . Good-bye , my Bluebell , he sang , Farewell to you , One fond last look into Your eyes of blue . ' Mid camp-fires gleaming'Mid shot and shell I shall be dreaming Of my own Bluebell . His mouth gaped and twisted like a hole in an old boot . But to-night the Boers did n't seem quite enough . They itched for more excitement than the embers of spent wars offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a war with Germany . " This ' ere bloody kayser , " they muttered . The Baritone was inclined to a war with them Frenchies , despite the entent cordial , which he distrusted anyway . " But it 's pretty clear , any bloody old ' ow , " grumbled the Conjurer , " that the country 's lousy with spies . " Then he stopped suddenly . " ' Ush ! " he said . He put his finger to his mouth . " I should n't put it past that there Deutsche Frau , " he breathed darkly . " Tha knows , t'shoemaker 's wife next door . She 's probablylistenin ' to us this very moment with ' er ear clapped up against that wall ! " Everybody looked at everybody else anxiously . It was later remembered to the Conjurer 's undying glory that he had unmaskedMrs . Frank Stanley , as she called herself , four years before she came out in her true colours . It was a comfort , anyhow , that the Boys were keeping watch over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generals and the statesmen , the kayser 's tools to a man , held their eyes turned from the little black cloud on the edge of the North Sea . For the time being , however , there was n't anything doing in that line . Germans or Frenchies , or Dagoes generally . But there was always the enemy within the gate . Like one man , the whole party rose and made for the front-f 1711B EN STERN , the missionary , took his key out of his pocket and let himself into the house of Mr. Carter , the nightwatchman , where he lodged . He went straight into his own room , for he never troubled Mrs. Carter in any way , not even to boil a kettle . That was a good thing , too , for Sally was a delicate woman , and if Mr. Stern had required any attention at all , she would not have been able to have him . She herself had not been at all well since she had that baby  --  and then it went and died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was glad to get two of her rooms off her hands . A woman came in and scrubbed his floors and took away his washing , and the rest he did himself . He was very faint when he came in that Monday night of the Derricks party . So , very quietly , so as not to awake Sally , for he knew she was delicate , he prepared his spirit-stove and made himself some tea ; then he got a loaf out of a tin , and with his spectacles pushed up against his forehead , and his pale grey eyes close against the loaf , he proceeded to cut away at it with slow regular sawings . And then , in the middle of his cutting , he remembered that the exact wording of a passage in Daniel had eluded him all day long , so , forgetting all about his faintness , the knife still embedded in the loaf , he went across to his little table under the window , where his Bible always stood open . I-Iour after hour he sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a single word for thirty or forty minutes . To him there was no such thing as time . There was only the eternity of Jesus Christ . When Sally Carter came down next morning to let her husband in after his night-duty at the factory , Mr. Stern 's door was open . She caught sight of the knife embedded in the loaf and the cup 173 door ; except , of course , Wilfred . He always stayed behind to supervise the proceedings from behind the parlour curtains . They swarmed out to the pavement , and looked across to the houses of the Jews . Mrs. Derricks was the choir-leader . " Who killed Christ ? " she asked . The other followed , chanting . They booed louder and longer than usual that night ; for last time , the seaman , John Cooper , had come and knocked their heads together and stopped them booing . They knew that John Cooper was now away at sea . They booed as if Benny Edelman had not saved little Tommie Wright from drowning , as if Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poyser , as if Mrs. Berman had not stuffed with sweeties the pockets of Nellie Tawnie . Mr. Emmanuel heard the booing as he cone in late from his distant excursion in aid of the babies . I Ie heard it the moment he descended from the tram quite a distance away , in the main road . He felt his cheeks burn as if a hand had slapped them . He lost his footing and almost fell in the slushy roadway . He turned his steps towards Oleander Street so as to go round by way of Aubrey Street into Magnolia Street at its other end . It was not pleasant to rtm the gauntlet of that booing . But he thought better of it . I Iis heart was filled with bitterness as he walked down the street , past the booers . It seemed as if twilight was come while dawn was still flushing the heavens . his head tottered on his neck . " Something must be done ! " he muttered . " Something must be done ! " At that moment a thick-set figure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , walked as if a great weariness were upon him . He seemed hardly able to lift from the ground those queer elastic-sided boots . " Something must be done ! " this one muttered , too . " In the name of the Lord Jesus ! " he added. of tea untasted . Mr. Stern sat at the small table before the window , having fallen asleep with his cheek down against the sacred page . She wondered whether she ought to wake him , and give him a hot cup of tea out of the pot she was brewing for her husband . But it was the essence of the understanding between them that Mr. Stern was to be no nuisance , and if she started taking notice of his goings-on , a nuisance was exactly what he would be . Then she remembered the business of the pork chop , which had happenedonly last Thursday . He had had an attack of his rheumatismand Sally was aware that he had brought in no supplies for a day or two . She thought it might be nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was cooking some for Bill , so she brought one to him , where he lay on the sofa in the parlour with a rug over him . But when he saw what site had brought him , a sort of spasm came on his face , she could n't tell whether it was the rheumatism or the sight of the pork chop . " No , no , please ! " he implored her , in his guttural foreign voice . His Adam 's apple rose up and down , quivering . So she took it away again , none too pleased that she 'd gone to the trouble of preparing a special tray for him , and carrying it herself , too . It was odd how little he managed to exist on  --  tea , and fruit , and bread , and he would chew raw vegetables  --  for he was a big man , bigger than he seemed , the way his shoulders stooped and his head lay forward on his neck , as if the vertebrae there were weak . To the others the affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monotony , a comic excitement , an opportunity to increase the business . To him it was a finger of light fallen from Heaven . He saw the barriers crumbling between the people of Christ and the baptised of Christ . Again and again he had been disappointed and mocked and stabbed to the heart , as , not long ago , the youth , Winberg , had stabbed him . But now , surely , surely , the Dawn was coming . Ile looked through his window to the houses of the Jews opposite . Not one of them till now had allowed him to penetrate beyond the mezuzah , the little casket of holy script nailed up upon the lintel . Till now the humblest presser , the dullest slattern , earth of this poor earth , had been as remotefrom the agonised yearning of his finger-tips as Rabbi Shulman , who was like a column of flame as he moved , rotating upon the axis of his unspeakable assurance . There was , indeed , F 174much in common between these two men ; this most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so loosely in flesh , that a heat and a wind seemed to come out from the imperfect places of the fabric . The flesh of two creatures in spiritual essence so alike , could hardly have been more dissimilar . Benjamin Stern was loose and red and vaporous , with short fat fingers stubbed out upon chubby palms . His eyebrows , his beard , faded into a smoke , into nothing at all . The pupils of his eyes could not he distinguished from the whites they were set in . Rabbi Shulman was lean , tall , powerful , angular . His thick hair , his long beard , were black as the blue sheen of coal . His face was yellow , like a Mongol 's ; he had high cheek-bones . His huge nose was curved like a blade . His fingers were long and gnarled like the roots of olive-trees . Their joints cracked uninterruptedly like noises in the fire , as he turned the pages of the Commentaries . His eyes were dead-black as the fur of a black cat . The two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea . Benjamin Stern knew well that in the sight of those stricken eyes which , from their elevation upon a Cross , had besought him to go forth on the path he had chosen , all these lost Jewish souls were equal . The salvation of a shambling , handsome , good-humoured lout , like Benny Edelman , of so simple and unkempt a Magdalene as Leah Winter , was as great a thing as the salvation of any keen intellectual or moneyed prince . But it seemed to him that if once he might secure , in a silent place , for a day and a night , this tall Rabbi , a success as glorious might come to him in this late end of time as came to those poor men from Galilee who went forth with a message . Did they not speak the same language ? Did they not go a long way together along the same road , until it forked , and in his blindness , the Rabbi moved away into profitless undergrowth , starred by flowers so curious and desolate ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention was , perhaps , an instance of that madness which one or two kind Jews , and many of the gentiles , imputed to Benjamin Stern . But he did not entertain it often or long . Secure that man ? How shall you secure the wind walking or the flame soaring ? So , in the days of the fraternisation between the two pavements , he turned his mind towards less preposterous prizes . But the thicket was not less impenetrable than before . The ease , the175comradeship , were not for him . He was made to understand even in the gentile houses that they preferred him to keep away ; for when their guests , the Jewish men or women , entered and saw he was there , they turned back with hatred and nausea in their faces . He knew well why they hated him so , apart from the loathing they had , as all humble Jews have , for the perverts of their race . If they would but let him speak , he could have shown them that there , in the thing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they would not let him speak . It was the matter of one Eli , a carpenter . About fifteen years ago this Eli had come out of a village in Russia where there had been a pogrom , and Leah , his wife , with him . He had been a great scholar , though so young a man , and a carpenter . And a madness had come to him . He had become a Christian and preached at the street-corners . The Jews of the streets of the flowering shrubs blamed BenjaminStern for this , but he was not to blame . The young man , Eli , did not meet Benjamin Stern till some months before his death . He visited him in Magnolia Street two or three times , and he seemed already like a dead man walking , his cheeks were so grey and his eyes so hollow . And then , on the Day of Atonement , he had done a sacrilege which men could not speak of , having burst wild-eyed into the synagogue and held up the Cross before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandedher , his wife went to the room where her husband lived , and killed him , having loved him greatly . They had a small son , Reuben his name was ; the same night he disappeared , and no one knew what became of him . " At least , " Ben Stern said to himself , " I could tell the truth of it to the clerk to the Guardians . A man of a Christian heart , he would not treat me so . " For he had often been present at meetings addressed by Mr. Emmanuel to promulgate the doctrine of Love . And that was his own doctrine , though he gave Love a human shape and a divine substance . He determined more than once to cross the pavement and have a word with Mr. Emmanuel . Some nights ago , after the whole street had gathered in Mr. Emmanuel 's house and had gone away again , he saw the host left on his doorstep alone . He made forward as if to speak to him . But Mr. Emmanuel , like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a few nights later that the Derrickses and their friends assembled and came out upon the pavement , and stood blaspheming . " Who killed Christ ? " they asked . " You ! You , 0 my children ! " a voice tolled in the hollow heart of Benjamin Stern . " You hang him on a Cross , and pierce His hands and feet with nails and His side with a spear , again and again and again ! " The jeering went on loud and long . Two men walked slowly down the street . " Something must be done ! " they said , both of them , and tears were in their eyes . But what could Mr. Stern do ? He stood in his doorway , wondering . What could he do ? The spikes in the thicket were steel spikes . And then he remembered the little children , and how they should go to him . He smiled sadly into his beard . Into those eyes myopic with much study , came a glint of cunning . So he went forth into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuffed them into the back-pocket of his frock-coat , among the gospels and pamphlets . He waited till the evening came , and timidly stepped down into the cobbled roadway between the two pavements . He called the children to him , seeing the small Poysers and Seipels playing together . They came closer , hypnotised by the horror of this summons . He put his hand into his pocket and brought out a fistful of sweets and offered it to them . Whereat , as one animal , they fled from him , screaming , and kicked at the doors of their houses , as if a devil pursued them . Not one of them stopped howling for ten minutes . There was much dark and angry talk that evening among the women at the grocery-shop , and among the men in the synagogue , after the evening service . And when they asked Rabbi Shulman what he judged should be done , he swivelled his mind away with difficulty from the text he was studying , and said : " If it were fruit that a kind man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them remember to make the blessing , should it be a fruit they taste for the first time this year . But as for sweets bought from a gentile shop , who knows with what impurity they were put together ? Let them not eat such sweets ! " Then , at last , something broke in the heart of Ben Stern . He felt that his Cross was more than he could bear . As he went in and out of his house , the Jews muttered , the women called the 177 children to them and held their hands tight . It occurred to him that now he would leave this street . He had failed . And then No , he said to himself , No . It seemed to him it would be to abandon a last and solitary fortress . He stayed on in the house of Mr. Carter , and sat down to his food , cutting at the loaf with right and left sawings . It was poor food , but it sustained him . All bread to him was the flesh of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goings-on , though the two pavements took it differently . The Jews shrugged their shoulders fatalistically . As it had been , so it would be . How had the prophet Hosea said ? " It is iii my desire that I should chastise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them . " But the gentiles , notably the Carters and the Briggses , were furious . They wanted to do so ething about it , but they did not . They did not do anything at all spectacular , the Carters and the Briggses , during the whole span of their history with which we are concerned . ' hey were simple folk , like many millions of others , living in a poor street . Yet when the span of their history is considered as a single entity , something of grandeur emerges . And that must be , not because there was anything grand in any of them , but because they were human beings . The archangels , who are neither born , nor die , may be ready to admit more cordially than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth and growth , struggle and love , sickness and death , has a certain splendour . Sally Carter had not given a party , as most of her neighbours had done , and she determined she would have to do something about it , really she would , just to show them Derrickses , the tikes . She had not quite felt up to giving a party , she was that delicate . For she had had a baby , and it had died . It did not occur to her that that seemed to indicate that it was the baby who was delicate , rather than she . But she said she had never got over it . She was becoming a rather querulous woman as time went on , and doubtless it was because she had nothing to complain about . It is likely that if Bill had just taken hold of her by the shoulders and given her a good shaking , when she first started saying howr 1781delicate she was , she would have forgotten about it . And if only he could have induced himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out the toughest and happiest little woman in MagnoliaStreet . She needed , so to speak , something to get her teeth into , but she never got it , not for a long time . She was neither tough nor happy now . It was a good thing that Mr. Stern gave her so little trouble , or life would have been altogether too much for her . But this latest Derricks party , coming when it did , gave her a nasty shaking-up . " Really ! " she said . She went in and out between her kitchen and the scullery saying " Really ! " in a tone of great indignation . She forgot completely to nag old Bill , her husband . On the contrary , it made her realise , for a reason she could not guess , and in a way she was not accustomed to , just how large and sweet he was , sitting under the window there , wondering what it was all about . She forgot the pain in her side she 'd been complaining about . Or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound of tripe for his supper , or his breakfast , that is to say . One gets that mixed up with a husband who works by night and sleeps by day . He liked his tripe boiled in milk , with onions , but not too much pepper . ( Bill Carter would n't like pepper . ) She went into the scullery to get it ready for him . He sat on in his chair under the window , the vast pillars of his legs stretched out before him . He smiled like a small boy , who knows his mother is preparing something nice ; his thick thumbs revolved round each other steadily . His dog , Bucky , sat crouched with her face between her paws , looking up at him steadily , and adoring him . Bucky was predominantly a rough-haired terrier , though there was something of greyhound in her slim hips . She had brown and gentle eyes like a gazelle . She loved rats . The sight of a rat made her go clammy all over with playfulness and affection . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and turned them over with her paws and pushed them along humorously with her nose . They were paralysed with horror . But when they found that nothing serious was happening to them they swiftly unparalysed themselves . They fled with extreme speed , and on attaining a rat-hole , found it impossible not to turn round to see what sort of a strange dog it was that turned them over as if they were not rats , but clog-babies . They perceived the expression of pained surprise on Bucky'sface and realised they had misjudged her . They were still a little shy , but that wore off after a day or two . They and Bucky became great friends . When Bill Carter was still a policeman , he was rather like that with burglars . He did n't want to play with them quite so ear- nestly as Bucky wanted to play with rats , but they loved playing with him . On Bill Carter 's beat the burglars lolloped about like rabbits in a spinney . It was no wonder that one or two of the inspectors felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his profes- sional capacity . As a man no one disliked him . In fact everybody liked him , when they could remember he was about somewhere . He was the sort of person who was always left behind on police sprees , when the Force went off on holiday in big chars-a-bancs . It was not because he had had a drop too much . It was merely because it was possible to look at Bill Carter without seeing him . It was just like that when there was a round of cards on . It was said he often had an ace and ten at I'ontoon and gleaned no profit from it , merely because the next player to him forgot he was there , and just played on , as if he was n't . He was always just as invisible , even as a policeman . Wits used to say that if ever his professional duties brought him into the same room as a forger forging a bank-note , the forger would as likely as not get on with the job , without noticing he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning there was an unfriendly inspector or two at C Division Headquarters who wanted him out of the way . But he was guilty of absolutely no slackness in dress or duty for the most fastidious critic to put a finger on . The unfriendly inspectors did not unload him till 1909 and he did not get a job for many months , because a discharged policeman was a more uncomfortable object in some ways than a discharged convict . Then at last they took him on as a night- watchman in Rawlinson 's engine-works . As a youth he had been a miner in a Northumberland pit . He then enlisted in the Army , saw varied service in India and came home to enlist in the Police Force . Such a career might have provided a skeleton on which to build up an exciting personality . But Bill Carter was neither excited nor exciting . As a policeman he had been an early witness of not a few garish spectacles , including a murder or two . But his presence robbed them of all appearance of melodrama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head hanging on by one tendon , and Bill Carter was in the near neighbourhood , you just felt it was bound to be like that and you cleared your throat and wiped your nose . When he took his note-book out of his back-pocket , it was as if he were going to take down an order for a few pounds of potatoes . Bill Carter finished his dish of tripe . " Thank you , Sally ! " he said , wiping his mouth on his sleeve . " That was champion ! " He looked shyly at her . " You are looking pink and pretty to- night ! " he said . He said it in a voice that made her hair flush up . " All right , " she said , " you can , if you want to . " He wanted to , and did . " Not so wet , Bill , " she objected . " You are a caution ! " Bill went out into his little back garden with Bucky adoring at his heels . He pottered about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the flowers seemed to know it was only Bill Carter , so they were not particular . " Listen , Sal ! " he said . " Look here ! " His face was serious . She knew what was on his mind . She had told him about these Derrickses and the way they bade fair to break up the harmony which had grown up in Magnolia Street . It had upset him a lot . " Yes , Bill ? " " Do you think , if I asked Benny Edelman or Mr. Emmanuel or some of them Jew fellers if they 'd like a game of bowls , how ' do you think they 'd take it ? " Bill Carter played bowls quite well . He had once won a silver vase for bowls in a Police Tournament , and it stood in the middle of the kitchen mantelpiece . He was rather shy about it . " Bill , " she exclaimed a little mockingly , " you are a one ! The ideas you do get ! They 'd love it ! And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on going into all them houses and never asking no-one back again . So what I say is this here " But at that moment there was a knock at the front-door . They heard it quite plainly , for the intervening doors were open . " Who can that he ? " said Sally . " I 'll go ! " said Bill . " No ! " said Sally , for the first time since she had had a baby . " You 've got to go off soon ! You take it easy ! " She went and opened the front-door . " Oh , good evening , Mrs. Carter ! " said a small fair boy . " Gracious me ! If it is n't David ! Is n't that right ? " 181 " Yes , that 's right , " smiled the small boy . It was David , the youngest of the Emmanuels . Bill had come up out of the backgardenby this time . " Good evening , Mr. Carter ! - Hello , Bucky , good dog ! My father 's sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ? " He held a small pile of leaflets in his hand . They still smelt damp and inky , as if they had only just come off the press . " Why , what 's this ? " asked Mrs. Carter . At that moment BenjaminStern appeared at his door , with his hat and frock-coat and walking-stick , all ready to go out . He saw there was a visitor on the doorstep , and screwing up his eyes , he recognised who it was . He made a movement as if to return into his room , and then it occurred to him that it would look very cowardly in the eyes of Mr. and Mrs. Carter , if he turned tail and fled from a small boy , merely because he was a Jew . " Good night , Mr. Carter , Mrs. Carter ! " he said . He tried to pass through the doorway without brushing up against the boy , for he knew well how the Jews slhrank from contact with him , in a tram , a shop , wherever it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet pleasant voice of the small boy . " Oh , Mr. Stern , wo n't you take one ? You must come , too , wo n't you ? " Ile smiled up into the desolate eyes of the old man , as he handed over a leaflet to him . Never before , since he came to live in Magnolia Street , had any Jew smiled at him , man , woman or child . He felt he would faint with happiness . He had a wild impulse to lift the boy to his bosom and crush his face up against his beard and cover it with kisses . But he did no such thing . " Thank you ! " he said , gruffly , it seemed , but there was a lump in his throat ; it was as much as he could do to say even so little . The leaflet shook like an aspen-leaf between his fingers , as he stumbled back with it into his own room . " Well I never ! " Sally was exclaiming as she brandished the leaflet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goom ! " said Bill. 3Mr . Stern 's knees felt so weak he was not certain he would be able to reach a chair . His head was swimming . He pushed his 182 spectacles up against his forehead and brought the leaflet close to his eyes . But what he read impinged against only a small portion of his mind . . . great presentation ceremony . . . Unity Hall , Longton . . . entertainment by well-known theatrical stars . . . Wilfred Derricks , the Longton Nightingale . . . local talent . . . Miss Poyser . . . prizes for Great Raffle invited , in aid of the Longton Creche . . . Mr. Isaac Emmanuel in the chair . . . your co-operation and presence cordially invited . . . . Now one phrase , now another , detached itself . Now the phrases ran meaninglessly into each other . Now he could see nothing at all , for the leaflet fluttered so and a mist slid before his eyes . So something was to be done , after all . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none other than WilfredDerricks , to be chairman of the entertainment committee ! . . . He saw the friends and the mother of Wilfred Derricks standing on the pavement , flushed with drink . He heard them jeering . His heart skipped with joy like a foal . Assuredly the Lord was among them , not in might but in gentleness . " But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , long-suffering , gentleness , goodness , faith , " he chanted . The words were out of the new dispensation of Jesus , but the tone was the tone of the old men that sing in synagogues on the darkening Sabbath evenings . And the creche for children that the good man , Emmanuel , had at heart ; he had heard of this already . They were to be the Longton children , immaterial whether Jewish or Christian . He had more than once determined to speak to Mr. Emmanuel on the matter , but he had not dared , at the last moment . He could be of use . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Longton Creche some Sunday . . . . " And not for that one nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad . " Joy carolled in him like skylarks on a fresh morning . It came from the thought of the house in which the children of the Jews and the gentiles would be harboured together ; and from the thought of the gathering in which all these folks were soon to be assembled in love and charity . It seemed to him the hand of God was quite palpable in the knitting together of those ideas ; 183there was something even of miracle in the way in which the obstinate rancour of the Derrickses had been dispelled . But his joy chiefly arose out of the smile the little Jewish lad had given him . He thought that in that way the little Jewish lads , who were the friends of the boy Jesus , must have smiled when they splashed the water in the trough of Mary 's well in Nazareth . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a leaflet to him , too . David his name was . I low lovely and apt a name ! So small a boy would not have taken it on himself to ask him to come . How did he say it ? " Oh , Mr. Stern , wo n't you take one ? You must come , too , wo n't you ? " IIe held the syllables apart like beads of music and then allowed them to come together , tinkling sweetly . Why had he been of so little faith ? Ile should have spoken to the father long ago ; or the other night , at latest . So much of their dearest dreaming was identical . Must his faith remain weak of backbone to the end ? Contributions to the raffle were asked for , in aid of the Longton Creche . He took the heavy gold signet ring from his finger , which his father had given him . Ile had no earthly possession he cared for more . IIe fumbled about among his papers and found an envelope , dropped the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile was quite giddy . IIe heard the Carters discussing the new development in their kitchen . As he came down the doorsteps into the street , he saw that groups were gathered in front of many of the houses . The leaflet was in their hands . The air was full of pleasant excitement . He crossed over to the house where the Emmanuels lived and knocked at the door . It was Mr. Emmanuel himself who opened it . Mr. Stern 's heart beat so rapidly he was afraid he would not be able to speak . He remained silent a moment or two until his heart stilled a little . Then cold and incisive came the voice of Mr. Emmanuel . " I beg your pardon . What do you want here ? " Mr. Stern 's throat drew in a sharp gust of breath . " I have just got a copy of your leaflet , Mr. Emmanuel . I wanted to congratulate you . You ask for contributions . I 've come to say that anything in my power " 184 " Excuse me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so raw and harsh that Mr. Stern looked up with quick terror in his eyes . He well knew the expression that had invested them . He had seen it in the eyes of the youth , Winberg , not many weeks ago , when he spoke to him one Sunday morning in the road near St. Luke 's Church . The two men looked into each other 's eyes . Both were silent for some seconds . A spot of colour rose on Mr. Emmanuel 's cheek-bones and deepened and burned . With hideous clairvoyanceMr . Stern perceived the passions working behind Mr. Emmanuel'sskull , as a man sees the works of a clock through the glass walls of its case . He saw the detestation . He saw the intention arise to say whatsoever he could say of most damnable , however false it was , however false he knew it was . he saw the words like points of green light shoot from the brain to the vocal organs . " I do n't need your help , " said Mr. Emmanuel . " My name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His head fell further forward upon his chest . He turned round and shuffled away heavily . He did not see the points of fire dwindle and die upon Mr. Emmanuel 's cheek-bones . He did not see him bite down so fiercely on his lower lip that the blood started from it . He did not hear him call after him : " Oh Mr. Stern , please Mr. Stern heard and saw nothing . He went back to his own room. 185CHAPTER XIII1before him . He never took a larger breakfast than that . He drank tea in the Russian manner , out of a glass , sucking it through a cube of sugar . He drank up one tumbler and a second . He did not touch his cake . He wedged still another cube of sugar between his teeth . " More tea ! " he said . Then suddenly the cube of sugar dropped from between his teeth and rattled down on the plate in front of him . " I 've got it ! " he cried exultantly . " I 've got it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIe was ill , after all , as she had feared. - " Quick ! " he cried . " Give me my tie and collar ! " He ran over into the scullery , filled a basin with cold water and plunged his face in it . He passed a comb through the tangles of his hair . " Isaac , what is it ? " his wife cried . " My tie and collar ! " he threw at her . He clipped the studs into the collar and made a clumsy bulb out of his tie . Then he rushed to the front-door . Slatta ran after him . " You 've eaten no breakfast ! " she wailed . " You 've not touched a thing ! " But he was already racing down the street . He crossed the roadway . He knocked at a front-door ; of all the front-doors in all the world it was the Derricks 's front-door . " Gottenu ! " exclaimed Mrs. Emmanuel , throwing her hands into the air . " A madness has fallen on him ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered was it her duty to go and protect him from the harm that might befall him at that gross house . She remembered what had happened on one or two previous occasions when such an idea had occurred to her , so she held back . Mrs. Derricks came to the door . There was speech between Mrs. Derricks and Mr. Emmanuel . It lasted a minute , two minutes . Then Mr. Emmanuel passed out of sight through the gates of the enemy . Mrs. Emmanuel turned back into her kitchen , her heart a-twitter with apprehension. 2Mrs . Derricks got up that morning an hour or two after her husband and her younger son went off to work . They had done an hour or two 's work already . It always fell to them to clear up the place after there had been a party . Mrs. Derricks had a bad head . Her tongue was furry .

He would not have thought of so extreme a measure , if he were not feeling so wretchedly disappointed . And he was tired . IIe was aching to go off to sleep . IIe knew he was keeping Slatta awake , too . Poor woman , it was n't her fault , anyhow . " Sleep , Slatta ! " he whispered . He stroked the back of her neck with two fingers . She smiled and went to sleep instantly . Dawn was creeping round the blinds before he had himself dropped off . His head sloped backward down the receding slope of the pillow ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snore shook gustily in the caverns behind his Adam 's apple . It was music to Slatta Emmanuel . Silent as a ghost she rose up from beside him , and crept downstairs to make the fire and the breakfasts . It was ten o'clock before Isaac rose . He came down looking haggard , with dark circles round his eyes . He mumbled through his prayers as if it were the Lord 's fault that he had not slept . Then thrusting the phylacteries viciously into their bag , " Tea ! " he said . It was not a gracious voice . The kettle was havering on the hob . The teapot was warming on the fender . She made his tea for him swiftly , and put his breakfast cake on a plate186 187routine of the morning after a party . Wilfred , who , on the other hand , to keep himself young , never got up before noon , got up half an hour earlier than usual , carolling blithely . He was more skylark than nightingale this morning . Mrs. Derricks shuffled between kitchen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forehead . " Oh my poor ' ead . Oh my poor ' ead ! " " You naughty old woman ! " Wilfred teased her . " I told you you were taking too much ! Get on with those kippers now ! I feel I could do with ' em !

" " Bonny ! " she said , as he expected her to . " Oh my poor ' ead ! All rackin ' and achin ' There was a knock at the front door . " Who 's that ? " Wilfred said sharply . " Ah du n no !

It went very nicely with his gilded hair . Then he stepped back into his chair again , and absorbed himself in the Era . Mrs. Derricks staggered along to the door and fumbled about with the handle for a moment or two . Then it yielded . A tall gentleman was standing on the doorstep ; he was smiling so energeticallythat his head swung about and looked as if it might drop off . " Oh , good morning , Mrs. Derricks , " said the gentleman . Then he stuttered a little , as if he did not quite know what to say next . Then , " How are you ? " he said , and laughed nervously . Then Mrs. Derricks saw who it was  --  Mr. Emmanuel , his name was , one of the Jew-men from across the street . She remembered at the same time that he was something more than that . He had some sort of official position . Town Councillors had been known to call at his house . Her immediate instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of rudeness , but out of sheer fright . Tied up with Town Councillors as he was , he had come to arrest her , and Wilfred , too , and all of them . The neighbours had threatened to complain , 188 and they had gone and done it . Iier lower lips started quivering . She peered over Mr. Emmanuel 's shoulder , but there was no policeman there . And the way Mr. Emmanuel was grinning at her  --  no , it was clear he had not come to lock them all up . What ? Lock them up ? She planted her feet wide apart to steady herself , and folded her arms across her bosom . " Well ? " she asked truculently . " And what may you be wantin ' ? " " The fact is , " replied Mr. Emmanuel , " I 've come for your help . And your son 's . Sings beautifully , Mrs. Derricks . I 've never heard such a voice . I want " " What if you ' ave n't ?

" I take it you 've come to see me ? Wo n't you come this way ? " He opened the parlour door and showed Mr. Emmanuel in , like a tiny page-boy in a hotel . " Hummm ! " rumbled Mrs. Derricks . Jew-men in the parlour ! What would Wilfred be up to next ? " Thank you , Mr. Derricks . So kind of you , " said Mr. Emmanuel . " I 'm not disturbing you in any way ? " " No , no ! " insisted Wilfred . " Please ! Wo n't you sit down ? " They were bowing and scraping and nodding at each other with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pretender to the throne of France . Then before Mr. Emmanuel really quite knew that he was not still sucking tea through a cube of sugar in his own kitchen , he had started off . He got up almost immediately from his arm-chair . He strode up and down the floor . He stabbed the air with his pince-nez . " I would n't be troubling you like this , Mr. Derricks , but I want to feel I have not only the wealth but the genius of the street behind me . Yes , Mr. Derricks , I mean genius . And when I say wealth , I mean wealth . I have already been promised the support of the Winbergs in the matter . They are most enthusiastic . " He had , of course , been promised no support by anybody. 189 His whole scheme had only been in his head a minute or two . He was clarifying the details as he went along . " But , of course , money is not everything , as you and I well know , Mr. Derricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may have read in the newspaper , about my son , Max ? The Chronicle had a half-column interview , with a portrait . He won the Art Gallery prize a week or two ago . " He has promised to do a little lightning-sketch work on the night . That is to say , if you are agreeable . That side of the arrangements will be left entirely in your hands . " " Excuse me , Mr. Emmanuel . But I 'm afraid I have n't got the hang of the thing at all . On the night ? What night ? What arrangements ? " " Oh , how absurd of me , Mr. Derricks ; of course , of course ! It 's all about this young man , Edelman , you know . The way he saved Mrs. Wright 's small boy from drowning ! I thought it a capital piece of work . Did n't you ? And  --  I 'm sure you 'll agree with me  --  something ought to be done about it . " Wilfred did n't look quite so sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if you 'll excuse me , quite a lot has been done about it . " " Yes , yes , quite so , " Mr. Emmanuel caught up hurriedly . " Bravery is its own reward , too . But one or two of us have been thinking that if we could organise a presentation , if you know what 1 mean  --  well , would n't it ? " Wilfred looked a little confused . But before he had time to ask Mr. Emmanuel to straighten things out a bit , Mr. Emmanuel was plucking at the second string . " That would be very nice , of course . But then there 's this matter of the Longton Creche for Babies ! " " What ? What 's that ? " Mrs. Derricks enquired . " Babies ? " The conversation was evidently entering a province where she had a right to show up and have a word . " Ah ! " said Mr. Emmanuel , beaming , and opening wide his two arms . " A mother 's heart ! See how it opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He realised he had , perhaps , not paid enough attention to the old woman . It was as important , or very nearly , to win the mother over as the son . The Creche should settle her . " Indeed , my dear Mrs. Derricks . You have said it yourself many times . What we need in Longton here , ' you said , is a Creche for the babies . ' And I go further than you . I think we 190should have a playroom for the elder children , too . In that way the mothers will not only feel free to go out and do a day 's work , when they have to . They 'll feel free to go off with their husbands , or their friends , of an evening , to a park , or a music-hall . How often has a poor mother been prevented from going off to hear your son sing  --  and that is what I call singing  --  by the fact that she had n't anywhere to plant out her children ? " Mrs. Derricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , had harboured all these years . " Yes , " she agreed . " Them poor workin ' - women as ' ave n't got nowhere to put their poor children when they go out to ' ave a pint of an evenin ' ! It 's a cryin ' shame ! " She fumbled for her handkerchief , could n't find it , and dried her eyes with her sleeve . " But , please , Mrs. Derricks , I do n't want you to distress yourself . It 's not for that I 've come in this morning ! Oh no ! Oh ! no ! " He paused . He forgot for a moment what he had come in for . Then he went on : " Just think of it , a little white house , where all the children of this neighbourhood , irrespective whether  --  " hastily he drew the words back in time . It would be extremely tactless , he realised , under these special circumstances , to stress the interracial hospitality of the projected Longton Creche . The mistake he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . " The babies , " he dithered , " think of them , Mrs. Derricks , counting their little toes , one , two , three four " Wilfred broke in . It was lucky , perhaps . For Mr. Emmanuel was stumped , and might have gone on counting to eleven . " What has all that to do with me , Mr. Emmanuel ? " he asked shortly . " Oh , my dear sir , that 's exactly what I was coming to . I want to feel that the drive is coming from Magnolia Street . In my official capacity , I have contacts with influential people . Perhaps you know that ? Well then . I felt that this presentation ceremonyto young Edelman will give us just the opportunity we want . He will receive the present . The whole street will subscribeto it . People from neighbouring streets will ask to subscribe , too . But we will not let them . This is our affair , Mr. Derricks . They will be able to subscribe to the raffle in aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , Edelman will come on the platform to receive the present . The child whom he rescuedwill be led on by his mother at the same moment . The notability  --  we must decide later who to invite  --  will hand the present over to the child . The child will hand it over to the man 191 who saved him . There will be applause . There will not be a dry eye in the place . " And then  --  and then  --  the lesson will be read , the moral will be pointed out . What was the child doing on the croft all alone ? Why was there no little play-room for the child to go and play in ? Toy trains and teddy-bears and " And bunny-rabbits , " suggested Mrs. Derricks enthusiastically . " Of course . Bunny-rabbits . But Mr. Derricks , where do you come in ? This is where you come in ! We want the people of the neighbourhood to subscribe heavily . We want to ask some rich people along , to see what we can get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . We want to put them all in a good humour , so that they dip their hands iii their pockets as deep as they 'll go . We want to give them an entertainment worthy of the Doomington Palace itself . And you can do it , Mr. Derricks . You 're the man we need . We ca n't move a foot without you ! I appeal to you ! " Wilfred 's fingers were drumming restlessly on the table before him . Mr. Enunanuel 's excitement had at last communicated itself to him . His eyes were scurrying about hurriedly . He tried to keep his voice from going up into his shrillest treble . " Who d' you think you 'll be having down to see the show , Mr. Emmanuel ? " " I have people on my books who have more money than they know what to do with . " " People in the theatre-line ? Managers ? " shrilled Wilfred . " Managers ? " said Mr. Emmanuel lightly . " I was asked to dinner last week in Didsbury and the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he says to me , It 's my belief that London 's played out . There 's no morevariety talent in London . We 've got to go to the Provinces forvariety talent these days . In fact , do n't let it get about , that 's what I 'm here for . ' " Mr. Emmanuel heard himself lying with astonishment . It was not that he was lying , exactly , as that he was lying so serenely , so masterfully . Wilfred Derricks was yelping with excitement . " I think it 's a wonderful idea , Mr. Emmanuel . I congratulate you . It 's a pity we have n't met earlier . I should have loved the chance to have a word with you . I 've got an engagement in Bury for three nights and Saturday matinee , at the end of the192week . Wo n't you let me give you a couple of tickets ? Perhaps you could bring your friend along with you ? " " What ? " said Mr. Emmanuel . " When did you say ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emmanuel and the Manager in the centre of the third row of the stalls . They were smoking large cigars . Of course , they only put in an appearance for his turn , and immediatelyit was over , drove off in a large motor-car . Mr. Emmanuelwas keeping time to his song with his pince-nez . The manager took out a little note-book and made a little note .. . " Thursday , Friday , Saturday , " he said . " Of course it 's not much of a theatre . They can only put up three nights and a matinee . Still , if you can make it convenientMr . Emmanuel 's eyes were far away . Ile was wondering if it was possible to do without Wilfred Derricks , after all . Ile had got the idea into his head that the presentation ceremony must take place on Saturday night of this same week , at the latest . He wanted it to take place to-morrow night , to-night . But that , he realised , was impossible . Exactly in the same way he wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next October . His impatience frustrated a good many of his schemes . " We must have the presentation next Saturday night at latest , " he said to himself . But he said it aloud . Then Wilfred stopped twittering . He showed his teeth like a little rat . " Oh must we ? " he said . " Must we , Mr. Emmanuel ? " It was a grim tone , a tone of warning . It pitched-forked the ludicrous idea that had taken possession of Mr. Emmanuel out of his skull . " Oh , " he said , chastened . " When do you think it would be convenient , Mr. Derricks ? As early as possible , do n't you think ? I 'm sure it should be as early as possible . " " It 's got to be a Saturday night ! " Wilfred decided . " Yes . I suppose it has . Of course it has . " " Then , a week come Saturday night ! Saturday , July the ninth ! How 's that ? " " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the synagogueserviceis well over ! " " But of course ! " cooed Wilfred , his voice as smooth as honey . " And there 's something else I 'd like to tell you , while we 're about it . We want this to be a regular slap-up show , real professional talent . Oh yes , I quite agree with you , a little amateur talent193wo n't do any harm . On the contrary it 'll show the other stuff up all the better . I have a number of friends in the profession , naturally . They 're devoted to me and to mother . Are n't they , mother ? There 's Bob Gatling , for instance . He 's a Baritone . Straight from Covent Garden . I 'll see if I ca n't get him to give a turn . I 'm sure he will , to oblige us ! " " Of course ' e will ! " Mrs. Derricks confirmed . " That would be excellent ! " agreed Mr. Emmanuel , with a slight sinking of the heart . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the Nightingale without the Baritone , and the Baritone without the Ventriloquist . But they were professionals , anyhow , however disgracefully they behaved when they got drunk . Their names would look well on the leaflets . The leaflets . . . . " Mr. Derricks , " he started off again impetuously , " I 'm going to get the leaflets out this very day . I ca n't tell you how delighted I am we 're in this together ! " " I wo n't have anyone 's name in bigger type than mine , Mr. Emmanuel ! " " I would n't dream of it . " Mr. Emmanuel was dancing with impatience . " I must be going at once . Oh good-bye , Mrs. Derricks ! and you , Mr. Derricks ! " He pumped energetically away at their hands . " I 'll be in again this afternoon ! " " Mother , wo n't you ask Mr. Emmanuel would he like a cup of tea ? " " No , thanks , really not ! I have n't a moment to spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare . He hurried out of the Derricks 's house as if he had just learned his own house was on fire . Then he stopped short at the garden-gate . What was the next thing to do ? What ? The leaflets ? That really seemed a bit precipitate . Mr. Emmanuel hurrying out of the Derricks 's front door was the phenomenon that first drew the attention of Magnolia Street to the fact that momentous things were afoot . They were buzzing the news to each other a few moments later at Mrs. Poyser 's shop . The beards wagged at the synagogue . Then Mr. Emmanuel caught sight of an errand-boy leaving 194the Winberg factory with an object a little like a corpse hanging limply over his arm . The Winbergs ! Ah , of course ! They had promised him their help . He had best see about that . The Winbergsmeant Bella . He hoped she would be down already . She was . Mr. Emmanuel was forgetting the day was getting on . She was lying on the red plush sofa in a silk peignoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she disposed on the sofa and the peignoir on her . There was a little Moroccan inlaid table beside her , with a cup of coffee on it and a plate . of Turkish Delight . " Mr. Emmanuel , " her buttery voice gurgled . " How delighted I am to see you ! " She held forth her white arm . He took the finger-tips and kissed them . He did n't know what had come over him this morning , the way he was strutting and cavaliering all over the place . The Cause , he remembered , the Cause ! He told her of the idea , or of the twofold idea , that he had given birth to this morning . He told her of the ineffable ideal upon which it was based . He forgot where he was , who he was talking to , what he was talking about . " Wo n't you sit down , please , Mr. Emmanuel ? " came the voice of Bella Winberg , quite firmly . It was odd to find that padded voice had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp . " It will make it much easier , " said Bella , " if you sit down . Exactly where are we now ? " He told her . He related his signal diplomatic triumph over the Derricks contingent . She smiled her approval . But she requested him to perceive that it was only a negative victory . He had assured the cessation of their hostility . That was all , and only for the time being . She talked good common sense . He was astonished , and delighted . Now and again she varied her tactics , as if to show that she was a female , too , not merely a person of intelligence . She smiled , showing her pretty teeth . She dropped her handkerchief , revealedher ankle . She revolved her charms , as it were , as a cook rotates a grill on a spit . Then she became the sensible woman again . " And by the way , " she wanted to know , " what are you going to present Benny Edelman with ? " He had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of ivory fish-servers , " he said , haphazard . The rich houses he went to in Didsbury all had ivory fish-servers . He had longed for some himself , for years , vainly. 195Her delicious laughter tinkled among the pampas grass tufts as if the throat of one of the stuffed humming birds had started vibrating suddenly . " No , no ! " she said . " Can you see the Lord Mayor handing a set of fish-servers to Tommie Wright and Tommie Wright handing them to Benny Edelman ? It ca n't be fish-servers ! No , it must be a gold watch , with a nice little inscription ! " Mr. Emmanuel glowed . " But of course . What else could it possibly be ? " " And who 's going to do the presenting ? Ilave you made up your mind ? " " I had an idea , " he said , " that if we asked the Chief Rabbi  --  " " No ! " she said . " Nor the Bishop ! Do n't you see the complicationsit would lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are quite right ! " His jaw dropped . He did not seem to lie going the proper way about things at all . He was making a fool of himself before this girl . One would think that it was she who had had the idea in the first place , not himself . I le pouted , he tapped the floor with his foot a little sulkily . Through her lowered eye-lashes she saw phase succeed phase transparently round the edges of Mr. Emmanuel 's boyish mouth . " Iblr . Emmanuel , " she said , " have I given you any idea how proud l am you 've come to me first with this beautiful , beautiful scheme of yours ? " Her voice was like maroon velvet . " I count myself first , because the other thing . . . it was mere diplomacy , was n't it , Mr. Emmanuel ? You and I between us , we 'll get things done ! " His bosom heaved . He did n't know whether he was going to cry or not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more than a shilling per house . But we must get that shilling . And then  --  of course , we 'll be a long way from being able to buy a handsome gold watch . You 'll let my father make up the rest ? I know he will . I can guarantee that . We 'll be so proud , " she whispered , " so proud . Do you know , I 've sometimes felt that you 've rather neglected us , " she reproved him with melancholy delicacy . " Do you think we were n't as proud as the rest of you that Benny was such a brave , brave boy ? Why did nobody ask us to come and join in , while all the rest of you got together in this house and that house , and were so friendly and jolly ? I love parties , Mr.Emmanuel . Just because my poor father is making a little money . . . Oh , it 's hard , hard ! " The suspicion of a tear glistened in her eye . Mr. Emmanuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his own two hands . " I had no idea you were so interested , Bella . " He had not called her Bella for some years . " I 'm so happy I 've got your help , happier than I can say . You must certainly sit on the Creche Committee . And there 's a new vacancy on the Hospitals Collection Fund Committee . I must sec at once about getting you nominated . Then She changed the subject . " So we 'll get out the leaflets to-day ? " " Yes , I think that if we get down to it at once " " Have you got a pen on you ? Get me that writing-block , please . We 'll draw it up at once . " The rich black flowing hair caressed the sparse pale broken hair . The fountain-pen scratched away industriously. 4Mr . Emmanuel was well in with the printers . One way and another he gave them a lot of work . Within a few hours the leaflet was set up , printed and delivered . Mr. Emmanuel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains . Then the boy came , trundling his hand-cart . Mr. Emmanueluttered a glad cry and sprang from his chair . He did not need more than a few dozen leaflets , but printers do not set leaflets up in few dozens . The boy came staggering up the path with a large bundle . Mr. Emmanuel grabbed it out of his arms and retired jubilantly to the parlour . " Slatta ! " he called , " Slatta ! " She would n't understand much about it , but he was so excited , he could not resist dragging her into it . " Yes , Isaac , yes ? " She came running out of the scullery , with an egg-beater in her hand . Her husband was slashing away at the coarse rope that bound the bundle . He savaged his way through the packing . Then he saw them , green ones and pink ones and yellow ones , the lovely leaflets . " Listen , Slatta ! " he bade her . He read out the concoction which Bella and he had composed only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremulous with joy and anxiety . He read out the leaflet again in a voice given up to pure appreciation . " What do you think of that now , Slatta ? " " It 's like a Psalm ! " she said . At that moment Max passed by the open door . " Max ! " his father shouted suddenly . " One moment , before you go upstairs ! " The boy came in . " Yes , father ? " His flat fringe lay over his eyes . He flung it out of the way . His servant , David , stood behind him . " Max , listen here ! " He started to read his masterpiece , went on for a heading or two , then stopped suspiciously . He knew the way Max 's attention wandered . It fastened like a fly on your nostril and stayed there . " Are you listening ? " " Are n't I just ! " said Max . There was no doubt of the sincerityof that tone . " What do you think of that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a jolly good time ! " " What do you mean , a good time ? Oh , of course , of course ! Naturally we 'll have a good time ! Now , Max , do you see what it says here about local talent ? " " Yes , father , " said Max , just a trifle acidly . " That means the people who are not like . . . like Mr. Derricksand his friends , professional , local talent . You see ? " " I see ! " " I 've already been in to Mrs. Poyser . You know her daughter , Becky , she 's been taking piano and singing lessons for a long time . She should be able to put up a good show by now . " " Well ? You got her to play and sing ? " " I did . She did n't want to . That girl 's too shy . She 'll never come to anything if she stays so shy . I think it 's her father 's fault . He makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think better of it ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Emmanuel curtly . " But I 'm sure you 're not going to be shy and silly , Max . " A note of wheedling came into his voice . " Why , father ? " The voice was very innocent now . " It was only thinking it would be so nice and interesting if you 'd do a bit of lightning-sketching on the Night . " ( He already talked of it with a capital N and a slight upturning of the eyes . ) " You 're so quick with that charcoal-pencil , are n't you , Max ? " he explained. 198 " Oh , yes , " said Max sweetly . " I 'd love to do a little lightningsketchingon the Night . " He imitated the slight upturning of his father 's eyes . The voice was far too sweet to be true . " On my own conditions , " he added . " What do you mean , your own conditions ? " " I 'm interested in behinds . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll only let me do behinds Mr. Emmanuel 's face was livid with anger . " Get out of here , you apostate ! " he yelled . " Get out or I 'll " He rose . Histhumb and finger twitched venomously towards Max 's arm . Max got out of there . Mr. Emmanuel looked the other way . David remained unobtrusivelyon the threshold . The others allowed two or three minutes to pass while Mr. Emmanuel 's flame of anger flickered down . Then  --  " Father , " said David gently . Mr. Emmanuel could not yet trust himself to speak . David waited another minute . Then , once more , " Father ! " he said . " Yes , David ? " Mr. Emmanuel answered , without looking at him . " As soon as you 'd like anyone to go round with the leaflets , shall I ? " " You 're a good boy , David , " his father said heavily . He wasfeeling a little helpless . " Shall he take them now or later , Slatta ? " Slatta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Isaac  --  " " Yes , what did you want to say ? " " Would n't it be a good thing if you went in to see Benny Edelman , first ? Just to make sure . He ought to know as soon as anyone , ought n't he ? " There was silence for a little . Of course . The woman was right . After all , Benny had a lot to do with the whole thing , and it had not yet occurred to him to have a word with the hero . He rose from his chair . The sight of the great bundle of virginal leaflets , so many seeds , as it were , to be sown in the furrows of his own ploughing , brought back something of his enthusiasm . " I 'll go at once , Slatta  --  I wo n't be long . Do n't go till I come back , David . As for him "  --  his thumb pointed up to the attic and Max  --  " I forbid you to go near him again this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , really , Mr. Emmanuel , " he insisted . " No , I ca n't have that now ! 199
