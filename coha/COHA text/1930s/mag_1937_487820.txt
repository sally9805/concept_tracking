WALL STREET combines somehow the characteristic features of all the places where men have to chart their chances against fate : it has the atmosphere at once of the sickroom , the gambling-house , the battlefield . And so when the fever chart of Wall Street , usually a matter of only intramural concern , showed a panicky drop last week , the rest of us felt a concern far beyond our own stake in it It was not only that some twenty-five billions in paper equities were destroyed and thousands of small accounts completely wiped out . What happened on Wall Street was more than a collapse of paper values . It was another of the periodic crises in the history of our capitalism . The dip was so sharp , the charts proved so frightening , that for two days at least Wall Street ran amuck . I speak of the market break in the past tense , not to propitiate the future , but because  --  whatever fluctuations may still be in store  --  the market 's record from early August to late October is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-headed business men are not interested in history that the causes they advance for the market break sound thin and strained . One gets from them an impression of bewilderment seeking refuge in aggressive assertion . I have heard blame laid variously on organized bear raiders , the President , the SEC , the Federal Reserve Board , anti-New Deal feeling , margin requirements , the capital-gains tax , the corporate-surplus tax , John L. Lewis , and the trade unions . I have listened while one man proved that the state of the market was an index of general business conditions , and another argued as cogently that the market was an entity in itself unrelated to the real world of business . One man states that because of government policies the sources of saving and therefore of capital investment have been dried up , and another man complains that because of the same policies there has been a lot of idle money lying about . I have heard the element of fear minimized and maximized . I have heard that a big factor was Japanese selling by order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy . Many of the people I talked to were so close to the market that they needed perspective ; for them the lights of the world went out when stock prices zoomed down . But there was one , a nationally known economist , whose comment had a startlingly Olympian ring . " To us , of course , " he said , and he seemed thousands of light-years away , " such things are merely secondary epiphenomena . " On the whole , you can range the explanations in four groups . There are the theories of deliberate conspiracy . There are the theories that run primarily in economic terms . There are the theories that look to government and politics for the real causes . And finally , there are the psychological theories , which stress fear and hysteria . Youmay be a one-theory man ; if so , you may have your pick . I happen not to be , and I find it interesting to look back at this bit of history and construct out of it something of a mosaic . It is hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinister figures in them are the manipulators or government functionaries . I can not believe that Mr. Morgenthau , Mr. Douglas , and Mr. Eccles are conspiring to destroy the exchanges ; I do n't hold bears like Ben Smith or Matt Brush responsible ; nor can I believe that Mr. Gay and Mr. Aldrich , the head of the Stock Exchange and the chairman of Chase National , are suicidal wreckers , bent on going to their own doom if thereby they can prove Mr. Roosevelt wrong . One may salvage from this whole approach a single item , which relates to the perversely different attitude of the business community toward this stock break , as compared with the 1929 break . Take the case of Charles R. Gay . Here is a mediocre man , blundering but well-intentioned , placed at the head of an immense gambling establishment that happens to be integral to American business . His August 17 statement took the form of sharp criticism of government regulation of the market , yet actually it made Wall Street examine itself critically . Evidently the figure in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a stock drop ; and though James Landis answered it vigorously in his farewell statement as chairman of the SEC ? a statement , incidentally , that cost him the editorial plaudits that he would otherwise have received on retirement  --  the damage was done . Or take the case of Winthrop W. Aldrich . President of our biggest bank , brother-in-law of John D. Rockefeller , formerly a New Deal supporter , such a man obviously speaks with deliberation . His speech , too , was an attack on government regulation , and contained , in addition , a demoralizing analysis of the weakness and thinness of the market . Again , on October 14 as on August 4 , there was a drop , but this time sharper and more panicky . The interesting thing is that in the Coolidge and Hoover administrations men like Mr. Gay and Mr. Aldrich were talking not defeatism but optimism . These two men were not conspirators , but , given slight market disturbances , they used them consciously or unconsciously to frighten the Administration and extract concessions from Mr. Roosevelt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue , along the lines of tax alleviation and changes in the SEC . It is best not to emphasize the personal element . It is only a phase of the larger perspective . And that perspective must be viewed in terms of the basic business conditions . Nothing that the business leaders said and very little that the government did would have much effect October 30 , 1937 if it were not for the framework of business discouragement . It should be seen , I think , in terms of a failure of hopes and not of a definite business recession . There were few signs of actual recession , and even now the combined business indices show a sharp drop after rather than before the stock decline . What was wrong , briefly , was that Wall Street had been experiencing a stock boom in anticipation of an industrial boom that failed to come off . When it became abundantly clear that the industrial boom would not materialize and that the future looked dreary , the stock boom collapsed , and in its collapse ? pushed on by anti-Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into a panic . The curious thing is that , however much Wall Street and the Administration differ on other matters , they join forces in insisting that there is not much connection between the stock collapse and industrial conditions . Yet the evidence would indicate , as the English New Statesman pointed out last week , that the wheels of capitalism are again slowing down , not only in America but in England and France as well . As far as America is concerned , judged by previous depressions , the process of recovery has been curiously long and slow . The stock crash came in 1929 ; the low point industrially was reached in March , 1933 . There was a sensational spurt of business recovery in the summer of 1933 , due largely to the stocking up of inventories in an attempt to beat the NRA , followed by a sharp recession . Another spurt was made in 1935 , which in turn slowed down . Economists and business men had been looking for a third spurt this fall . There were ample supplies of cheap money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this depression has been the continuance of low interest rates into a far later stage of the recovery than usual . There was also a good consumer demand , stimulated by reemployment , by wage increases following a successful labor-organizing campaign , and by government outlays for relief and public works . The stage was set for a boom in the durable ( or capital ) goods industries , including construction , railways , and the utilities . New housing especially was hoped for , and there were good prospects of a demand from business and industry for replacement of equipment that had been long deferred . None of these expectations have been realized . The housing boom , for complex reasons , has not come through . New equipment and replacements have not been ordered . The reason is that easy money available at low interest rates is not being taken advantage of . How much this is due , again , to fear and hatred of the Administration , how much of it is due to the hostility of business to the corporate-surplus tax and the capital-gains tax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor costs are questions beyond the scope of this article . A drive will undoubtedly be made to fix the blame on taxes and labor costs . But I find the best economic opinion convinced that these factors are by no means primary . The important fact is that investments in the stock market have been booming , and stock prices rising fantastically to a point where they have been469 twenty-five or thirty or even forty times the net earnings . That has meant an inflated market , and the wind had somehow to be taken out . The question of the government 's role in the market break is a vexed one . I am convinced it is by no means as clear as either side makes it out to be . The Administrations feels itself blameless , and attributes the whole thing to Wall Street 's hostility and its case of jitters . The Street on the other hand accuses the Administration of meddling and persecution . Its indictment may , I think , be put under two heads . One relates to the regulatory agencies . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite confidently that the case against the regulatory agencies is almost wholly baseless . The agencies principally involved are the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC . The Reserve Board is attacked from the left for not lowering the reserve requirements when it spotted danger , and thus moving back toward inflation ; but the argument seems to ignore the fact that there was no lack of money for investment , but rather a lack of desire to use it The SEC is attacked from the right for tying the market up with petty regulations , reducing its volume of operations and making it " thin " by unreasonable restrictions , and in general entangling it in a bureaucratic net . As far as bureaucracy is concerned , there can be no doubt that it takes a huge staff operating under detailed rules to regulate a crowd as slippery and intransigent as the stock-market crowd . That drastic regulation was needed is no longer arguable . The interesting thing about the recent stock break is that it was not primarily the result of a speculative frenzy , as was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investors ' market , thanks largely to the SEC regulations . It is true that the thinness of the market made it more vulnerable to the impact of bearish factors and forced liquidations . But if it had been a larger and more speculative market , and if the margin requirements had been lower , many feel that the crash would have been even more severe . What Wall Street will not recognize in all its criticism of the SEC is that the stock market as we know it is a relic left over from a past Golden Age . The Exchange still lives in the memory of its vanished splendor of the 1920 's and it maintains in million-share days the proportions it had in the five- and seven-million-share days . There is literally not enough business to go around among the 1,500 members . The brokers , many of them rich men 's sons for whom there was no other career , have fallen on lean days . They ca n't make enough on stock commissions , they are hemmed about in their attempts to speculate on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they can reduce their numbers and shrink the business to profitable proportions . They have become fretful and embittered , and spend their energy making a butt of the nearest object  --  the SEC . Far more serious is the indictment that may be made of general Administration policy . I am not referring to the tax policies , which , compared with the English , are anything but excessive . What is more in point is the indecision of the Administration as to where it is going and what methods it will employ in getting there . I sympathized with one banker when he said that he could understaad a capitalist regime and he could understand a collectivist regime , but he was baffled by this mixture of the two . He was , of course , regarding it from the right and I from the left , but we both recognized the same fact . Compromises in scope and aim must always be made in a real world , but it seems part of the Roosevelt policy to achieve its compromises through vacillations between groups of advisers whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I refer in this connection to the recent deflationary moves of the President in seeking to balance the budget by cutting down relief and construction funds rather than by seeking new tax sources . Business had , to be sure , been calling for budget balancing and reduction of expenses ; yet Roosevelt 's moves in this direction came at a time when the anticipated business pick-up was not materializing , when it was becoming clear that stock prices were too high . Thus even for business the result of such moves was disastrous . The President chose exactly the wrong time to return to a more primitive capitalism . If these are roughly the factors that brought about the stock break , there still remains the question of how it gained enough acceleration on the way down to produce for two days a frenzied panic . Empirical conditions , either in industry or in government policy , will not explain the swiftness and extent of the decline . For that we must turn to the psychological  --  to fear , and how it has battened on the tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be remembered that what we are pleased to call the business community can become under extreme pressure a chaotic and irresponsible mob . A man who witnessed the trading on the morning of " Black Tuesday " told me that it gave him the feeling of a trampling mob in a theater fire . There were stretches of time when blocks of " blue chip " securities , offered at almost nothing , could not get a bid . The truth is that Wall Street men , like other organisms highly specialized for predatory pursuits , have not been able to accommodate themselves to the conditions of change . They have been battered for years by forces they can not understand , and they are riddled with the most irrational fears . The Wall Street jungle of today is filled with Emperor Joneses . What we have regarded as the toughest and most viable of all capitalisms is at the same time as subject to panic as a frightened savage caught in a jungle at night  --  a jungle of his own fears , superstitions , and racial memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
