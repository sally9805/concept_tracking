James Aloysius Farley last week transferred his base of operations from Washington to Manhattan , his job from part-time Postmaster General to full-time chairman of the Democratic National Committee ( TIME , July 20 ) . Three days before making this ectoplasmic shift for the duration of the campaign , he announced the appointment of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's great &; good friend Frank Comerford Walker , onetime head of the dormant National Emergency Council and Democratic National Treasurer in 1932 , as active chairman of the Democratic National Finance Committee . <P> The nominal head of that committee is Woodrow Wilson 's Ambassador to Germany , James Watson Gerard , who was relegated to an honorary chairmanship . <P> Since Mr. Gerard was already vacationing in Europe , this was not unexpected , but the news which followed indicated that Democrats might well have considered Mr. Gerard lacking in shrewdness to handle their finances in any but an honorary capacity . <P> As he went aboard the Rex , Mr. Gerard undertook to give President Roosevelt a parting boost by declaring that he had $20,000 to bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no takers ( TIME , July 27 ) . If he thought that his offer would be safe because he was at sea , he was mistaken . Robert B. Greene , a Wall Street betting commissioner , in a radiogram to the Rex , took half the Democratic financier 's bet for a client . Next a Republican who voted for Roosevelt in 1932 , Le Grand Bouton Cannon of Tuxedo Park , N. Y. , hastened to claim the other half of the Gerard bet on behalf of a syndicate of friends . <P> All was in readiness to clinch the wagers when Spotswood D. Bowers , Mr. Gerard 's law partner , suddenly recalled a New York law which denies felons , bribe-takers and those who bet on elections the right to vote . Obvious to all was the embarrassing probability that Democrat Gerard would , if he publicly bet his $20,000 , be challenged at the polls on Nov. 3 . <P> On the morning when Messrs . Greene and Cannon went to Mr. Gerard 's Manhattan office-Mr . Cannon wearing a large Republican sunflower in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash-Mr . Bowers was there to receive them with new instructions : Mr. Gerard had called his bets off . Said Partner Bowers : " You know how it is . A man in the heat of enthusiasm will often say something- well-er-ill-advised . Mr. Gerard undoubtedly feels as always about Roosevelt and would have made the bet , but he ca n't afford to lose his vote . As a lawyer he should n't have forgotten the law , but the human mind is fallible . " Far from downcast were Messrs . Greene and Cannon as they signed statements releasing Mr. Gerard from his bet , in return for $1,700 each of Mr. Gerard 's money by way of indemnity . Betting Commissioner Greene pocketed his profits , kept mum . Mr. Cannon presented his profits to the Republican campaign fund as he beamed : " This amounts to getting something for nothing and you ca n't kick at that . " Asked whether he would place his bet against Roosevelt elsewhere , he emphatically repudiated the idea : " I would n't sell my vote this year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years for my revenge . "
