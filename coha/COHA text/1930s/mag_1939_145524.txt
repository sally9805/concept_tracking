Favorite subject of many jokes which circulate surreptitiously in Germany are ersatz ( substitute ) materials which Nazis have developed to take the place of imported raw materials . Last week many a German enjoyed a quiet chuckle when he found in his mailbox a fake bill from an industrious gagster who " demanded " payment for a suit of clothes made of wood fabric instead of wool . <P> The bill read : From : Woodman &; Co. , 205 Forest Avenue <P> To : Theophilus Bleat <P> Suit material chopped down 50 marks <P> Branches trimmed off 10 marks <P> Jacket sawed and nailed 35 marks <P> Lapels screwed on and hinged 25 marks <P> Buttonholes bored 10 marks <P> Pockets chiseled out 10 marks <P> Reforestation 10% extra : If suit sprouts in spring please cut off shoots and keep them for patches .
