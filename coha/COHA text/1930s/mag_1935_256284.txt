The Whole Town 's Talking ( Columbia ) is the story of a cringing little bookkeeper whose one remarkable characteristic is a facial resemblance to an escaped murderer whose picture is on all the front pages . The nightmare train of events into which this circumstance plunges Bookkeeper Jones starts when police arrest him , smilingly dismiss his apologetic explanations as the wily alibis of a desperate criminal . It continues when Jones , released with a safe-conduct to prevent his being arrested again , returns to his dingy room and finds Murderer Mannion waiting to steal the safe-conduct and use Jones as a decoy . It ends when Jones finally lives up to his brave exterior by helping to kill Mannion , collecting $25,000 reward , marrying the stenographer whom he has always bashfully adored . <P> As is likely to be the case with cinema stories which are genuinely suited to their medium , no recapitulation of the plot of The Whole Town 's Talking can begin to convey its superlative qualities as entertainment . Equipped with material which they could have used as the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Robert Riskin and Director John Ford contrived to do both without giving their work at any point the appearance of a tour de force . A network of subsidiary plots-the sad misadventure of Jones 's maiden aunt when she meets Killer Mannion ; Mannion 's astute revenge on a rival gangster who mistakes him for Jones-are brilliantly used to make the doings of little Jones the more strange , heroic , touching and preposterous . In his dual rle , as Jones and Mannion , Edward G. Robinson gives his best performance since Little Caesar . Good shot : the mean , mysterious little man ( Donald Meek ) who first tells the police to arrest Jones , trying to collect the reward for capturing Mannion . <P> The Little Colonel ( Fox ) . Annie Fellows Johnston's* story about the curly-headed tomboy who reconciles two warring factions of a Southern family has been thumbed religiously by nice little girls since 1895 . " The Little Colonel " was full grown and on the road to matrimony before Mrs. Johnston was through with her . Shirley Temple is not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this picture , she steps into a rle cut down to her size with all the assurance of the capable actress she is . She reviews a regiment which has made her honorary colonel ; tap dances with Bill Robinson ; plays soldier with Lionel Barrymore ; is the comfort of her mother 's lonely life ( Evelyn Venable ) and even dresses up in Civil War hoopskirts to render " Love 's Young Dream " on the harp . <P> Lionel Barrymore contributes the chief touch of originality by refusing to use a Southern accent . He is a patriarch who disowns his daughter for marrying a Yankee ( John Lodge ) and who later , won over by Shirley , turns up with a horse pistol just in time to save the Yankee 's life and property . The only thing in the show which did not come out of the Ark is Negro Bill Robinson 's dancing . He does his celebrated " Climb-the-Stairs " routine and contributes the finest butler 's walk that ever reached the screen .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
