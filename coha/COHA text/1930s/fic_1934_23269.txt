A SPECIAL OCCASION A STORY BY FREDERICK FAUST C AMPBELL sat in the locker room after squash and watched the loose flesh over his heart quivering like a jelly . Richards had beaten him . Richards always beat him now , and Cullen would no longer play with him because he was fifty-five and his backhand was no damned good . It never was more than a sort of poke , but it used to connect . He crossed his feet to take the shudder out of his knees and looked down at the folds in his stomach and the delicate rills of sweat in the wrinkles . His windpipe burned down the middle of him . One of these days he would cut out the cigarettes . Richards , already back from the showers , was at his locker , putting on a pair of glasses with a thin black ribbon hanging down from them . The spectacles dressed up Richards almost more than a suit of clothes and kept one 's attention on his tight-lipped mouth . Richards was sixty , but he still played squash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been a footballer back there in the nineties , and a big fold of muscle hung above each knee . " l 'm giving you a drink to-night , " said Richards . " Thanks , " said Campbell . " I 'm not drinking . It 's a special occasion . My girl comes home . The wife has been up watching her graduate from school . " Richards took out a bottle . " I 'm giving you a drink , " he said . " This is a special occasion . It 's always a special occasion when you get a chance at Bushmill 's Black Label . " " I 've heard of the stuff , " said Campbell , " but I 'm not taking it . Nothing to-night . In a house full of women , you know how it is . They hate to see the father with an edge . That 's the trouble with women . They do n't understand . " He made a back-handed gesture and looked round the room at the lounging naked men . He breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . How many tons of flesh , in the course of a year , dissolved here in fumes and sweating ? Sensible men kept their bodies in a state of flux , building , dissolving . That was nature 's plan . Look at the universe of stars , melting into radiation ; and somewhere the radiation was regathered to form matter . The astronomers would find that out one day . Richards uncorked the bottle and gave it to him . " Give your nose a chance anyway , " said Richards . Campbell inhaled the fragrance . The alcohol thirst took him hard , just beneath the Adam's-apple . He thought of a big trundling automobile like his own , of night , and lights , and a woman . He could always turn off other thoughts and conceive the sort of a woman he wanted , smiling at him . " It smells weak and too sweet , " he said . " There 's no sick of bath-tub gin in it , and it 's not your Jamaica rum , " said Richards . " Rum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , expounding his doctrine : " There 's something honest about rum . Made out of good molasses . It puts it on you gradually . Like putting varnish on a car , all over , coat by coat . " " Oh , all right , " said Richards . " I know why you drink rum . We all know why . " He laughed and poured two fingers and a half into two tall glasses . " You melt some of this in your mouth and try to form good habits . Virtue can be learned . " When a man is sixty you have to be polite to him . Campbell was at least silent , but he sneered as he breathed of the whiskey . He tasted it . " It 's too sweet , " he said . He tasted it again and his anger and his words loosened in his throat . " It 's like a good cognac , " he said . " It 's like a hundredyear-old brandy , by Godl It 's like Napoleon . Where did you get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cuban up for murder ? You ought to read the papers , Campbell , and you 'd find out a lot of good things about me . I took that case to the jury , let in all their damned evidence , and then made a speech about justifiable homicide . " " You justified murder ? " said Campbell dreamily . " It went over , " said Richards . " The Cuban paid my fee and felt he owed me something more , so he dug up a case of this Bushmill 's . There 's a white label too , but this black label spends twenty years in the wood getting older and wiser . You ca n't buy it unless you know where . It 's the finest thing that comes out of Ireland . " " Barring Irish hunters , " said Campbell . " I ran into a streak of bad luckdu ee or four years ago and started falling all the time . So I gave it up . " Richards put back his head and looked at him through half-closed eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said he . " Have some ice and soda in that . " " Do n't bother me , " said Campbell . He began to drink slowly , steadily , in small swallows . He kept on drinking until the last of the whiskey was down . Then he lighted a cigarette and considered . The whiskey was somewhere in the top of his brain , in his heart , pumping out inexhaustible joy through his arteries . " You do n't understand , " said Campbell . He went over to the bottle and poured a stiff slug into his glass again . Richards lifted a hand and turned a little , hastily , but then he settled back in his chair . Campbell pretended not to notice . " What do n't I understand ? About whiskey straight ? " asked Richards . " I 'm going to tell you something , " said Campbell . " It 's a kind of religion with me . You go back to Rabelais to get the start of the idea . About hearty people . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman too ? " Afterward he knew that he had been talking a good deal . His lips were a little stiff , his eyes felt larger . Richards had the tight face of a judge , and there was not much whiskey left in the bottle . Richards had been dressing ; he was ready for the street and now he rose . " Wait a minute , " said Campbell . " What 's the matter ? I finished most of that stuff . Look here . I want to pay you for the bottle . What I mean is , it 's damn good stuff . " Richards jerked round quickly . He checked the first words that parted his lips . " Well , good-night , " he said , and went out suddenly . Campbell brooded while he was taking his shower and dressing , but the familiar happiness began to grow up and brighten that world which a man sees best when his eyes are fixed on nothingness . Going down in the elevator , a number of younger members of the club were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " The old boy 's already on his way . " A soft chuckle answered that remark . Campbell turned with a smile . " You 've had a drink yourself , my lad , " he said . " Whiskey is the staff of the truth-tellerl " He saw the eyes of the boy widen a little . " I beg your pardon , Mr. Campbell , " said the lad . And Campbell said , " My dear fellow , not at alll " He looked at his watch when he got into his car , and was shocked . His wife had said that it was a special occasion . Two days before , when she left , she had taken him by the lapels of his coat . Her hands were tight and strong . " It 's going to be a special occasion , Jerry , " she had said . " You will remember , dear , wo n't you ? " " Drive like hell , " he said to his chauffeur . They drove like hell , as soon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . The steady flicker of cars going past him wearied his eyes , so he closed them . Later he discovered with a start that he had been asleep . As he opened his eyes he had a feeling that they were shooting down hill , through flame , but he found that they were merely wheeling softly past the intersection of highways at White Forest . They would soon be home . It was sunset . This uptilt of the world to the flat once more irritated him as though he had wakened from a happy dream . Fingertips pressed steadily against his head above the cars , it seemed ; the unfamiliar taste on the back of his tongue he presently located as Bushmill 's Black Label . That made him remember the way Richards had left him at the club , and he reached under the flap of the side pocket of the car to the flask of Jamaica . People hate the truth , he decided . That was why Richards had been hating him with all the color pressed out of his tight lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; women ought to he heartier too . You find the truth back in old Rabelais . " Drink . " That was what the voice of the oracle of the holy bottle had meant . Be yourself , even the nakedness that alcohol exposes ; and if the world does n't approve , that 's because the world does n't understand ? Rabelais , and a lot of other important things . He took a short pull at the flask , then he took a long one . He took another drink in the way he had learned only a short three years ago , little swallows , rapidly taken , holding the breath . He kept the flask in his hand for comfort and felt the rum work as rum always will , honestly , steadily  --  no casual flicker but a good strong blaze that warms the farthest corners of the heart . Then he saw the triangle of lights that announced the house of Cerise Mayberry , over there on the edge of the hills . He tapped automatically on the glass . " The Mayberry house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him a tenth of a second longer than he should have dared . Jordan knew too much ; but all chauffeurs know too much . That 's the way they are . They left the sticky black of the highway and the big , soft tires went crunching over the gravel of the drive . The dark trees were kindly forms on either side , sweeping him on . A man 's home is where his heart is , he felt . Cerise Mayberry . He called her " Cherry . " Cerise is a silly name . " Cherry " Mayberry was a nice name ; there was really something nice about it because it fitted her . It had a sort of rhyme to it . More than a rhyme . Some men have poetry in them . Some have n't . That 's all there is to it . The car stopped in front of the wooden low veranda , with its three steps up . He got out . He remembered that the flask was in his hand and put it back into the side pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , it was foolish for Jordan to step so far back into his manners and look at vacancy as he said , " We 're not being late for home  --  and Miss Louise ? " " I 'm only staying a minute , " said Campbell . Jordan was crazy about Louise . The cook was crazy about Louise . The wife was crazy about Louise . She was all right . She might even turn out to be hearty if the wife would keep her hands off now and then . What a girl needs is the molding influence of a man , the impress of the wider , the bigger life . Campbell went up the steps and rang the bell . He got out a cigarette and lighted it . Cerise opened the door and backed up before him into the safe obscurity of the hall before she kissed him . She came right into his arms , bending hack her head while she lay there for a moment , with her lips still half-formed after the kiss . Her eyes were loving him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook himself free . A man ought never to permit flapperisms . The trouble with Cerise was not that she had been married a couple of times but that she had grown up to womanhood in the post-war period , and one could still find in her vocabulary tokens of the days when nothing mattered . " Do n't be cross , " said Cerise , and went hastily before him through the door into the living room , slinking a little , looking back over her shoulder , pretending fright . He followed her with a firm step . " I Want to talk to you Cherry , " he said . " About Rabelais ? " she asked . He realized that she had only been pretending fear . But one of these days she would know him better . " One of these days you 're gunna know me better , Cherry , " he said . " Better Cherry ? " said the girl . " There are n't any better cherries . You know that , papa . " " I do n't like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it straight , " said Cerise . " You ought to have lemon juice and things with it . Shall I make you a cocktail ? " " Aw , well . Shake one up , " said Campbell . He sank into a soft chair and tapped his cigarette ashes on . the floor . The great thing about Cherry was that she understood . The worst thing about her was that she did n't understand enough . But you ca n't ask for the world with a fence round it . Everything has to have a beginning . After a while he would be able to teach her . For one thing , a woman ought not to be so damned expensive . A lot of the clothes they buy are name and nothing else . Cerise came in again with the cocktail shaker . She went at her work heartily ; her whole body shook with the vibration ; there was even a tremor in her cheeks , and her fluffy sleeves spread into a pink cloud . Pink was her color . She could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; therefore , except for the eyes and the smiling , her face was rather dim , and one had to look into it closely to see faults . Campbell preferred not to see the faults . She brought two little vase-shaped cups of silver , filled with cracked ice so that the cups would frost like the shaker . Then she emptied the ice and poured the drink . It was pink  --  her color . That was the stain of orange juice in the rum cocktail . He tasted the first one and then he drank three ; quickly . If cocktails are to be taken they ought to be drunk before the melting ice has qualified the liquor too much . Cerise had only one ; he had taught her never to take more than one because liquor makes the eyes of a woman more unclean than sleep . She sat on the arm of a chair at a little distance because she knew just how to lend herself enchantment . The platinum chain about her throat was merely a line of light ; the big emerald of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Her head was tilted back to just the right angle . He liked the consciousness of an art that so perfectly expressed Cerise . He had been enjoying her silently , like thought , when a football pounced on the little side porch , a door jerked open with force that sent a vibration through the old house and made the two silver cups chime softly together . " Cerise ! " called the voice of young Bob Wilson . " Oh , Cerise , darling ! " She had got to the door almost in time to stop the last words , but not quite . She opened the door a bit and called over her shoulder : " Wait a minute , Bob . " Then she faced Campbell . All he could see was the quick , high lifting of her breast and the green of the emerald , with a price mark tagged on it in his mind . He wanted to kill her , but a man has to take things in his stride , and a good actor improvises to fill a blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stayed so long , " he said . " Goodnight , Cherry . And good-by . " He could see the malice cheapen and tighten her face . What she had to say stiffened her lips . " Maybe I ought to tell you that a lady rang up a while ago and asked if you were here . I think it was your wife . " He turned slowly from a room he would never see again though hewould keep its corners of laughter and breathless silence always in his mind . He knew bitterly that he could never wash himself clean of this yesterday . There was a shadowy half of his thought that told him the uncleanness had spread over others , and if Margaret really had telephoned to inquire for him it meant that she had known about this affair long enough to lose her most vital strength , which was her pride . He was at the door of the hall before the girl said , " Ah , to hell with youl " Campbell got out into his car as quickly as possible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take bigger breaths of the cool evening air . As the car turned out cautiously into the highway he had a feeling that thousands of doors were shutting behind him ; but in spite of that he knew that he would have to find another road to town so that he might never again see the white , pointed forehead of that house by day or its triangle of lights at night . The automobile , gathering speed , lurched long and high over a swell in the road ; a wave of nausea came up through Campbell and left a cold tingling in his lips . He settled his troubled stomach with another pull at the rum flask . The familiar burn of it put his body at ease before the car turned into his driveway ; the trouble in his mind would have to be put at rest in another way . As for Cerise , he thought , a man ca n't get something for nothing , and he had been a fool to think that he could go to Cerise and relax like a tired body in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him because he had chosen to be off guard . Merely to be known , merely to be understood is what most of us desire , as though a divine ray will surely dazzle every true observer , as though , in fact , clear understanding would not bring a harvest of sneers and laughter . But the end of all is that one must work and never let the mind be still . He had dodged that truth and lost his happiness with his wife by the evasion . He had wished for gaiety and forgotten that the serious souls are apt to be the gentle ones also , and though he had known that there was gold to be found in her , he had shrunk from the labor . Now he had come home to her " special occasion " drunk or half drunk . He spoke the words softly and then tried to rub the thick numbness out of his upper lip . What he would say to Margaret began to enter his throat and his hands . The car stopped . He got out and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines in which the wind kept up a gently rushing sound , like that of water . He looked higher still to where the brow of the building should have risen according to those old plans which he and Margaret had dreamed out together ; but through the ghost of the lost idea he saw now the dark tips of trees and the stars . In the old days , before he had learned how much money can be made out of large contracts and two-family houses , as a young fool of an architect his thoughts had dealt with marble and with noble space . Perhaps he had been young , but not such a fool . Something in the past was worth taking up where he had left it if only he could find the lost way . When he entered the house he bumped his shoulders on each side of the doorway . That was a bad sign . In the still air his face began to burn . Well , Margaret would give him one of her long , quiet looks . On a chair he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a collar of soft gray fur . He could remember when Louise had first appeared in it and how it had covered the tall stalk of her body and madehim see only her face , like a flower . He went on down the hall until he saw his wife in the dining room doing something with the flowers on the table . The sight of the glasses , each with its thin highlight , and the frosty white of the silver made him feel that his hands were huge , witless things . He would sit silently through dinner , breathing hard ; the food would have no taste ; it would be something difficult , like pigeons ; the women would never look at him ; they would keep talking lightly . He frowned and walked boldly into the room . " I 'm sorry I 'm Iate , Margaret , " he said . He walked up to the table and dropped the knuckles of one hand on the cold , sleek wood . " Were you telephoning for me ? " He had made up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened from the flowers , without haste . It was always as if one sound or a glance had told her everything . Now she stood through a long moment considering him . She was in the rosy shadow of the center lamp , and it made her so young and so lovely that he was moved . He had to start peering before he could reassure himself about the wrinkles round her eyes . " Yes , I telephoned , " she said . " Was my voice recognized ? l 'm sorry for that but 1 thought that I had to risk something . It 's a special occasion in a way , and Louise is still quite fond of you . " " All right , " said Campbell , nodding as he took it . " All right . But leaving the girl out of it for a minute " ? he moved the thought of her away with a slow sweep of his hand ? " leaying her out , what about you ? You 've known a good many things for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers of which she was a master , and he felt that she was troubled not by what had been happening in the past but about the way he would accept her knowledge . " You know that I 'm not a radical , my dear , " she said . " I 'm a conservative and I believe that we should carry on with the old things  --  like households , I mean , " she added quickly . " All right , " he said . " I know what you mean , and that the rest is a bust . " But when he had finished saying this she merely continued watching him in an anxious way , and he knew that she was hoping that he also would want to be a " conservative . " Something was going out of him  --  the old years  --  like the swift , dear breath from his body . " Well , where 's Louise ? " he asked . He would carry on for the moment and afterward he would confront that blank night , the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " She wanted to see Bachelor and Steadfast . " " I 'll go out and find her , " said Campbell , turning gladly . " Wait a moment . Do n't you want a cup of strong coffee ? " she asked . He saw the sense of that . " Yes , " he said , facing about . " Some strong coffee . And put something in it , will you ? " That meant morphine . At least he could thank God that Margaret had enough brains not to be horrified by the thought of the drug . She had known , during these last years , that he used morphine after he had been drinking ; it helped to take the jitters out of the nerves . But now she kept on in one of her silences for quite a time . He had not been very sure of his " S 's " in that last sentence , and perhaps she was going to be disgusted . He could not be sure , because he could not see her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another drink . The silence went on for two or three great seconds . " Now , look here , " he said , " I 'm not going to have you up-stage with me . " He gripped his hands . The tips of his fingers slipped on the wet of the palms . Anger rushed and thundered in him . " None of this damn ' pale martyr stuff . I wo n't have it . A man takes a drink  --  why , hell , I wo n't have you being the offended saint and all that damn ' business . Get  --  get me that coffee ! " She actually waited for another moment . " All right , " she said . " I 'll bring it to you . " She went through the swing-door to the pantry , opening it slowly , letting it close so slowly behind her that it made no swishing back and forth . This deliberation made him catch in a deep breath of anger and stir a little so that he saw himself suddenly in the wide mirror above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright images of the silver . His hand went up quickly to the bald spot to cover the sheen of it . He pulled his fingers down over the soft puffing of his cheeks . He turned his head until he saw the hanging fold of flesh beneath the chin . Even if he got rid of his belly , there was nothing to be done about the face ; if he thinned it , there would be more repulsive flabbiness of skin to hang about the eyes and the smile . Margaret came in with her eyes down on the coffee cup . She had a way of giving a religious solemnity , a processional beauty to her smallest movements . He took the cup . The phial lay on the saucer beside it . The little bottle was still sealed , and that meant there was a lot of power within the pinch of a thumb and forefinger , a lot of sleep . He kept on looking at Margaret and stealing toward the truth through darkness until he came into the light of full comprehension . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A SPECIAL OCCASION 327 was the fellow , also , who rode Crucible in the point-to-point . He shrank from that and found himself launched into the future , while his heart sickened . He was not even making money ; there , too , he was only a parasite that lived on the past . As for the time to come  --  well , already he wanted another drink . So he opened the little bottle and poured it in , to the last drop . Then he raised the cup with a strong temptation to pour it all down his throat at a single gulp , covering the irrevocable distance at a stride ; but then it came to him that he , who had posed as a connoisseur , ought to proceed with a more civilized deliberation now that he was tasting death . So he only took a good swallow and then lowered the cup gently into its saucer . The taste was very strong , the bitterness working into the roots of his tongue . The beauty of the thing was that only Meg would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had understood for a long time that Campbell took morphine and had warned him repeatedly about an overdose . A soft , warm rushing began in his head , which was proof that even in the single swallow he had taken as much of the drug as made up his ordinary dose . When he took the rest the end would come quickly . He had expected a last-moment panic which might make him break off with the act unaccomplished , but there was no fear at all . He wanted to run to the window and call in Margaret and Louise . He wanted to tell them that he was about to die but that he was unafraid . This , however , would spoil everything ; the best was that Louise should find him smiling . As for Margaret , he ought to leave her a note to tell her what a happiness this was ; but still the nature of a woman can be sweetened by some regret . The telephone rang across the hall , not loudly . Coming at this moment , the call made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstepped even the reach of electricity , and even light leaping forward through millions of years could never overtake him . The bell was ringing , fading , pausing , ringing , fading , pausing , ringing . In this modern world we supply ourselves with mechanical bodies , with electric nerves that reach round the earth , and it is for that reason that we never can be alone . Someone was calling up to ask them for bridge or a cocktail party , someone inert , unexpectant of anything beyond roast chicken and ice cream and highballs through the evening , someone who could not dream that his telephone call was tapping insistently at the door of death . This fancy charmed Campbell ; suppose that he could open the door wide enough , suddenly , to draw that unknown with him into the empty darkness ! Then it occurred to him that the noise of the bell might bring Margaret or Louise suddenly back to the house before the coffee was finished , or at least before the morphine had done its work . So he put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke into the receiver , the voice of Cherry Mayberry sprang out to answer him , like music and a light pouring into his brain . " I prayed that you 'd be the one to answer . Otherwise I could n't have talked . I would have had to ring off . " He said , " I 'm busy , Cherry . " Yet he wanted to stand there and listen . " I know you 're busy , but I 'll only take thirty seconds . Will you listen , darling ? Will you please listen ? " Does one say of a Stradivarius , This is a good or an evil instrument ? Well , concerning women also many a wise man has cast away the standards of moral judgment and let the beauty , good or evil , flow into the soul . She was lying ; she was panting from the fullness of her lie , never to understand how a/I-knowing death was now helping him to smile . The sweetness and the breaking of her voice plucked at strings near his heart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he had said . " I sent him away , " cried Cherry . " I could n't stand his silly young face . It just made the house more empty . I sent him away . I 'm not trying to tell you anything . I 'm only saying something . Darling , darling , I 'm bad . I 've always been bad . Maybe I always will be bad . Just tell me that you 'll see me once more . I do n't care why  --  just come and damn rne  --  just ? " " Steady ! " said Campbell . " I 'm an old man , Cherry . I 'm a soft , flabby pulp of an old man , and you know it . " " I do know it , " said Cherry . " I know you 're soggy with booze a lot of the time too . I do n't know why I love you . I do n't want to love you . But , oh God , the house is so empty , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Campbell . " Do n't be excited . " " Do you mean it ? " she pleaded . " Do you mean I 'm not to be excited ? " " Come , come , " said Campbell . " This is all nonsense . We 'll see about things later on . I have to ring off . " " Do n't ring off . Give me ten seconds more to tell you that ? " Firmly , like one delivering a blow with an edged weapon , he struck thereceiver back on the hook and stood a moment half smiling and half frowning . Of course she had been lying and yet not altogether lying either . For if you think of a girl like Cherry Mayberry for a moment , you understand that you are considering a tiger that easily will be urged to strike , as she had struck at him this evening . As for young Bob , well it was true that there was a certain emptiness about his face , and a girl of experience might prefer more maturity . She cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of Cherry . She had said she knew he was old and soft ; she had said that he was soggy with drink a lot of the time too . That was honesty . Between thieves also there is honesty . And perhaps he had become a habit , insidious and surprising to her , an obsession whose force she could not realize until he had walked out of her house quietly without reviling her , in the calmness of strength . Well , he had her back , and after a break the knot is the strongest place in the cord . The door of the library , dimly lighted , opened before him the straight road to the end of things . Suddenly he clicked his teeth and turned his shoulder to it . The voice of Louise was coming in laughter toward the front door . It was a young voice as thin and clean as rays of starlight and there was an upward springing in it , as life should be at the beginning .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
