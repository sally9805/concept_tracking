ARMY &; NAVY <P> Cinemactor Reginald Denny last week sold to the U. S. War Department six radio-controlled airplanes , to be used as targets for anti-aircraft gunners and pursuit pilots . First developed in California as a Denny hobby , the miniature ( 8 ft. by 12 ft. ) , gasoline-driven robots need no pilots , can fly at 7,000 to 8,000 feet for 30 minutes . Until the planes are delivered next summer , practicing gunners must continue to get along with colored streamers towed behind full-sized craft .
