Bonwit Teller ( department store ) has earned a reputation for having Manhattan 's screwiest window displays ( TIME , Dec. 5 ) . Fortnight ago , Bonwit 's smartly hired the world 's No. 1 surrealist , Salvador Dali , to create two more screwy windows . Last week Dali gave Bonwit Teller more than it bargained for , all on the hackneyed subject of " Night " and " Day . " <P> For " Day , " the dapper , delirious Catalonian placed in one window an old-fashioned bathtub lined with black Persian lamb and filled with water , from which three wax arms arose holding mirrors . Pensive before the tub stood a wax mannequin clothed in green feathers , with long , bright red hair . On the walls , upholstered in purple , small mirrors were fixed here and there , and narcissism was further indicated by narcissuses floating in the tub . <P> For " Night , " Dali showed in another window a mannequin lying on a bed of glowing coals under a stuffed trophy , which the artist described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great somnambulist buffalo extenuated by a thousand years of sleep . " Working all one night with Bonwit 's regular window crew , Surrealissimo Dali finished in time for the store 's opening at 9:30 a. m . Then he retired to his hotel . <P> Came real but prosaic day and Bonwit Teller resumed its ladies garment business . Among its customers appeared ladies who thought the Dali windows " extreme , " told the management so . By noon Salvador Dali 's sleeping mannequin had been replaced by a seated figure , his bather replaced by a glamor dummy in a tailored suit . No one cared , until late in the afternoon Artist Dali strolled by and saw the havoc that had been made of his havoc-making Freudian designs . <P> Into the store to the company lawyer rocketed Salvador Dali , sizzling in Spanish and French . Next thing Bonwit 's knew the Surrealissimo was in the window with the bathtub . " Oomph " went the tub as he jerked it from the moorings . " Crash " went Bonwit Teller 's beautiful plate-glass window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and lit " bang " on the sidewalk . <P> Said Magistrate Louis B. Brodsky in night court later , freeing the artist with a suspended sentence : " These are some of the privileges that an artist with temperament seems to enjoy . "
