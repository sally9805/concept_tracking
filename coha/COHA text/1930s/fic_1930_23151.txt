MOUNTAIN MEADOWS A STORY BY ESSE HAMOT I DO N'T know just when the idea of visiting Mary Sheldon first came to me . It was not when my house burned down . It was later , when sharp sense impressions  --  the acrid smell of " water on flaming wood , the howl of icy wind , the sight of the charred remains of a family home , old and mellow , filled a short time before with choice things : heirlooms , new beauty brought back that autumn from a visit to Europe , now all reduced to ashes  --  when these had dulled a little . When my own self-pity had dulled a little , too , and I had begun to plan for the rest of the winter . When I think of Mary Sheldon 's shining life and remember my first feeling of soreness and abuse at my material losses I am shamed to the core . I had that spring taken a year 's leave of absence from my college in the Middle West and gone abroad for six months . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my acquisitions and begun some statistical writing that would take the rest of the school year . With house and writing notes completely destroyed and my position temporarily filled , I decided to accept the invitation of a friend to spend the remainder of the winter in California . It was then that I realized I could see Mary Sheldon on my way West . I had n't seen her since she was nineteen , a lovely , eager slip of a girl in one of the classes at the normal school where I was then teaching . You who have taught know how certain pupils standout in a roomful of boys and girls . Even on the first cluttered day some are more colorful , more alive than others . One part of you may see the vivid scarlet sweater of the girl in the back row , but another part of you sees the vivid , seeking mind of the girl in gray next to her . Mary Sheldon was one of the girls in gray . ( She did wear gray much of the time . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cleft in her square chin , a clear complexion without color , a straight nose , a straight look under the heavy yellow hair that was braided round her head . She was a beautiful girl who did not know her beauty any more than she knew how to dress or dance or win the attentions of boys . She was a country girl with a keen , untrained mind and the rarest powers of concentration I have ever known . She had already had two years of normal training and taught in a country school when I met her ; she was planning to fit herself for a better teaching position . I have never had a pupil with a finer combination of gifts , a soul more evenly developed than Mary Sheldon 's . Every study was a joyous experience to her . When we had grown to know each other and I had learned something about her home life I understood her love of natural science  --  that was fostered by her fanner father  --  her love of methods , psychology , of literature , languages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While other girls were having buggy rides , playing tennis , getting up spreads , she was adventuring in the world of So I planned for a few days ' stop-over at Denver , with a run out from there to the little town which was Mary 's post office . When I climbed the incline into the big Denver station friends were on handto take me home with them for the two hours until I was to continue my journey at nine . But soon I was in the dusty day-coach of the branch line , bumping along toward Mary Foster 's . The country was flat as a plate , and I saw with disappointment that the railroad folder marked no mountains anywhere near Mary 's town . I closed my eyes to shut out the sight of the cold , wind-swept fields , the shivering farmhouses , and huddled villages . I found myself wondering about life in those lonely places ; it could be stark , stripped of every vestige of beauty , I felt . " The next stop is yours . About fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little red-painted house which bore the name of the station . This house , a water-tank , a few trees , a worn hitching-post  --  these made up the town . An enclosed car stood by the track , and a man in the doorway of the house . He was a pleasant-looking , smiling man of fifty , and he came to meet me . " Miss MeAtee ? I 've got my auto here . " He took my hag and helped me into the car . The back seat was piled high with supplies . I noticed groceries , a gunny-sack full of something , a child 's broom . Probably there was something for the other little girl , too . Mr. Foster looked like a fine man . I was glad for Mary . " How are Mary and the children ? " " All as usual . Mary 's always well . " That was good . She had kept that wonderful health of hers . We jolted along silently . Mr. Foster was not much of a talker , it seemed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need there at the station , or do you have to order things ? " I asked . The man 's eyes twinkled . " Jake Murphey eats up any groceries around there . He 's the agent . Nothin ' much to do but eat . I get my stuff over at Nicholson , the other way . I stocked up there before I drove over to meet you . " " Oh , I 'm sorry you had to make an extra trip . Is Nicholson far ? " " Twenty miles . No trip at all . Besides , I 'd do anything I could for Mary . " Of course . But . . . " Clarence could n't get away to-day . He went to an auction . " Clarence ? Oh . then this pleasant-faced man was n't Mary 's husband . " You are one of the neighbors ? Mary said someone would meet me if Mr. Foster could n't . I do appreciate it . It is so cold , and the roads are bad . " At length we came to rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See those trees over there ? " ? The man pointed to a clump of trees to the west ? " That 's my farm . The Foster place is on beyond . " His farm had good buildings , looked prosperous and well-kept even in its winter brownness . The Foster place was on higher ground and had a wind-bitten look . But down the frozen road that led to the Foster house were running two little girls in blue , about six and eight years old , I judged . And behind them , hurrying with the vital step I had not seen for so many years , was Mary . I should have known her walk anywhere . The man beside me stopped the ear to take in the children . " Hop in , Blue-jays , " he said . The two little girls shook hands with me , one smilingly , one gravely . Then they climbed in over the supplies in the back . There was a squeal over the broom , over a ten-cent rolling-pin the man unearthed . Then quiet for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick , golden hair , braided in two braids for the older , tied back in short curls for the younger . I had brought them some little gifts , among them bob-combs , but these had evidently been ill-chosen . " How 're the Blue-jays this fine day ? " the man was asking , just as we reached Mary  --  Mary , with the same cleft in her square chin , the same light in her eyes , but with lines in her face and all thebrightness gone from her beautiful hair . Even with her arms around me , I had a sick feeling at thought of her hair . It was white , completely white , and she was only thirty-eight . But it was foolish to expect time to be toll-less . I thought how I must look to her after nearly twenty years . " Come in and have a cup of coffee , Mr. Smith , " Mary urged her neighbor , " and I 've fresh coffee-cake for you , your kind ! " But he would not . " Chore-time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for supplies he had brought her , then we hurried into the house , the children dancing ahead of us , Mary 's arm pressed close to me and holding my hand . " I put my plant in your room , Miss McAtee , " the older child called back to me . " It 's a pink geranium and it 's got two buds on it ! " " If you drop crumbs on the floor , I 'll sweep them up for you , " sang the other . They opened the door , and we went through a small , cold hall into the earn-fort of a big dining room with a stove in it , plants in the windows , rocking-chairs with afghan pads , worn books on shelves . An open , homemade cupboard held the children 's toys . Warm and homey and plain the room was , with an atmosphere of peace . I felt suddenly relaxed , relieved , too , in some strange way . I put my wraps in the bedroom , admired the geranium , and came out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , it 's so good to see you ! " she cried . " I 've thought of nothing else since your first letter came . Please begin right away to tell me things , things about yourself first , then about the normal school  --  I hope it 's still there , used , and growing !  - -  - and then about the world , how it is changing . I 'm hungry to know . I 've missed so much for so long . " Her voice was not envious , only eager . " I 'd rather talk about you first , my dear . What beautiful children you have ! " ? I could hear them in what was probably the kitchen , on the other side of the partly open door behind me , talking to someone , their father , perhaps ? " and what a homey-looking house ! " " The girls are dears , are n't they ? And I 'm glad you like this room . We live in it most of the time , all the time in winter . Excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She hurried through a door on the opposite side of the room . In a few minutes she called me . " Mother wants you to come in , Miss McAtee . She ca n't wait any longer , " and Mary laughed her rich laugh . I went in to find a pale woman in a bed beside a narrow window , a woman who did not look at all like Mary in either features or expression . She smiled a drawn , one-sided smile , and reached across to offer me her left hand . " Mother is paralyzed , " Mary explained , " so your visit means almost as much to her as it does to me . She sees so few people . " I noticed the little stove , with wood in a box and coal in a hod behind it , the order and cleanliness and bareness of the room , the colored print and calendar on the wall . The sun was setting , peeping through a slit in the gray clouds . I was glad Mrs. Sheldon had that to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiths are good to run in , but seven years is a long time , and it 's nice to see someone else . Mebbe you can read to me , " the woman on the bed was saying . " Mary ai n't much time , with all she has to do . " " I will indeed . I have some new magazines and books with me . " Seven years in bed ! On a bleak farm ! But my thoughts went to Mary . Mary , with her children , husband , house , outside farm-work , had her mother to care for besides . One of the little girls came running in . " Victor 's cutting the surprise , mother ! He wo n't stop ! " " All right , Jeany . I 'll attend to him . " Mary went out . Jenny came and stood beside me . I felt the warmth of her little body against my knee . " I like you , Miss McAtee . You do n't look like a nole-maid . " She inspected inc closely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeany ? Shame on you . Who . . . " " Father said he had n't time to go to meet a nole-maid , somebody else 'd have to do it . I heard him tell the postman when he came yesterday . 1 asked him what a nole-maid was , and he would n't tell me . " Mary came back into the room . I hoped she had not heard . Could she have a husband who . . . Of course not . Mary was speaking to her mother . " Is n't it going to be fun to have someone with us for a while ? We ca n't have a picnic outdoors , but we 'll have a picnic every single clay in the house ! " " 0-oh ! With ice-cream ? " This was Jeany . " Well , perhaps not that kind of a picnic . It 's a little cool for ice-cream , " Mary laughed . Her cheeks were flushed . I knew she had heard what Jenny said . Just then the older little girl , Joyce , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low voice , " you 'd better look after Victor . He 's . . . She beckoned with a small forefinger , and Mary went out again . We talked until Mary came back with a lighted lamp . She said to get my coat if I wished to go with her while she fed the chickens . While I was putting it on I heard the same voice I had heard before when the dining room door was partly open . On account of the cold  --  and the house seemed very chilly to me , even the central room  --  doors were usually closed immediately , I noticed . But now both mine and the one leading to the kitchen were open a little , and the other voice could he heard as an undercurrent to the clear voices of the little girls . It was an odd voice , not distinct . ? " Come out through the kitchen , Miss McAtee , " I heard Mary call . I went through the dining room into the same hall I had entered when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and into the kitchen . In a low chair beside the kitchen range , a big white cat curled at his feet as he bent over the last of a piece of chocolate cake , was a boy with a great round head that nodded and slipped , pale , vacant eyes , an open , drooling mouth . Cake crumbs and icing were over his face , hands , and clothing . Mary came from the sink with a towel wet in water . " That 's all now , Victor . Let mother wipe your hands . " She deftly removed the stickiness from the plump , inert fingers , from the loose mouth . " Victor , this is Miss McAtee , an old friend and teacher of mother 's . Can you shake hands ? " She helped him rise , helped him offer me one hand , a hand I took with pity in my heart . This hulking mass of flesh  --  could this be Mary Sheldon 's child , her only son ? Perhaps not ; perhaps it was her husband 's child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he had golden hair , thick and beautiful like that of the two little girls . Joyce spoke . She was the serious one of the two little girls . The only time I had seen her face light up was when she told me of her pink geranium . Her voice now was scarcely regretful ; she seemed merely to be stating a fact . " Victor 's not like other boys on the outside , " she said softly . " But he 's just like them on the inside , deep , where it does n't show . " We went to the barn , my mind a maze of painful thoughts . We fed the chickens , gathered eggs , saw the workhorses , the corn-crib , the cows , a little Jersey calf . " She 's mine ! " Joyce cried , her face suddenly shining . " The little calf is mine , and the big prize rooster is Jean 's , and Methuselah is Victor 's ! We all have things alive ! " Methuselah was the big white she-cat I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal rating of the pets . " Victor is completely satisfied though . He loves the cat more than anything on the farm ! " " Except you , mother , " Joyce put in , earnestly . " He loves you more than the whole world . " " Yes , dear , I know he does , " Mary answered smiling . I heard this with outer ears ; with inner ones I still heard the mumbling of the boy in the kitchen . He was nearly six feet tail ; he must be sixteen or seventeen years old . Mary Sheldon with a child like that ! A paralyzed mother and a defective son ! " Father 's gone to a nauction , " Jean said to inc . " He 'll have to hurry to get the chores done . " He came just after we got back  --  a tall man about forty , with a heavy pompadour of iron-gray hair , brilliant dark eyes . We were all hugging the kitchen stove when lie came in . " Clarence , this is my dear Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , bowed across the overalls he was taking down from a nail on the door . " How d ' do ? " he said . The little girls did not run to him , I noticed , although Jeany babbled happily about me , a double-yolked egg she had found , her new broom . She ran to get the broom to show her father . He made no comment upon it . Joyce said nothing about her rolling-pin . And although I felt I must be mistaken , I thought for an instant that the boy Victor had expression in his vacant face  --  not fear exactly , but perhaps dislike ; something more than blankness , at least . And I could not blame him . Even if Jeany had not innocently divulged her father 's decision to let someone else meet the " old maid , " I knew I should still not have liked this man  --  this handsome , hard , dark man who was Mary Foster 's husband . Supper was not until late because of the chores . Mary mended shirts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited . The children , as a treat , were to stay up and eat with us . Usually , Mary said , they had their supper at six and went to bed at seven . I was glad of that ; I knew it meant many things , among them , that the children did not have fried potatoes , pork , and pie every day , as so many farm children do . I brought out my little gifts . For Victor , not knowing , I had bought a Boy Scout knife . I showed it to Mary regretfully . " I had better not give it to him , I suppose . " Mary tried the blades , the tools . The springs were stiff . " He will love to play with it , Miss McAtee . He ca n't open it . Yes , indeed ; give it to him . " My throat was tight . " To play with it ! " A sixteen-year-old boy ! I gave it to him , and he held it in one lax hand , dropping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . For the girls I had some rather nice strings of beads , aluminum doll-dishes , a book apiece , and the colored bob-combs , both blue but of different shades . They were so happy over things that I felt a thrill myself at their joy . Strangely enough , they both liked the cheap little combs as well as their beads ; they tried them first on their own hair and each other 's , then on their dolls ' . They had never seen any bob-combs before and thought they were " little combs " especially made for small girls . " We 're so glad they 're blue , Miss McAtee . Did you know before you eRme that we were Blue-jays ? " " I heard Mr. Smith call you that . What did he mean ? " " Why , our names both begin with J , and we always wear blue ! He always calls us that . He made it up . And then mother made a little story about us , " Joyce said . " We sing it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Two little Blue-jays are always on the go , They chirp and they chatter and they skip to and fro ; They sing and they shout and they work and they play , But they never cry a single tear the livelong day ! " I saw the most beautiful look in Mary Foster 's face as they sang . She was turning the chicken frying on the stove and preparing her mother 's supper-tray . But she was thinking about her girls , I knew . I had waited to see her before deciding upon any gift more substantial than the scarf I had brought . I wanted to give her subscriptions to some magazines she did not take or get her books she wanted . We talked it over . She wanted books ; her eyes lighted up at mention of them . But she decided upon two magazines , both of them of the household type . spend whole days reading and cutting out things . I have n't put the girls in school yet . We are clear at the edge of this district , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor one . I teach them myself . " ( This , besides all the rest ! ) She took her mother 's supper in to her . Then I heard her attending to the dining room fire , talking to Methuselah as she pulled up chairs to the table . I went in with some mending . I confess it was hard for me to sit where I could see Victor . Mr. Foster came hi with the milk . I could hear the rumble of his voice in the kitchen , the happy tones of the girls as they showed him their gifts . Soon Joyce came in to me , carrying her book . I asked her if she wanted me to read to her . " I can read it myself . But I 'd like to have you . " We read , Jeany joining us , until supper was on the table . It was a delicious supper , and we had a happy time . But it was not as happy a time as it had been before Mr. Foster came . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he answered her questions about the auction in monosyllables . T had sat with silent farmers before and felt no slightest criticism of them or their brusqueness . But Clarence Foster gave me a strange feeling . Behind his good looks I sensed a hardness . It might be only a crust , and yet . . . After supper when he stepped on Jeany 's comb , which had fallen against the metal stove-mat when she went to the kitchen for something , I felt sure I was not mistaken . " Oh , mother , mother ! He 's broken it , he 's broken it all to pieces ! " the child wailed , picking up the bits and running to her mother . " Keep your things off the floor . You 've too much stuff around , " Mr. Foster said sharply as he went out . Mary was holding Jean 's hands in hers . " Remember our little song , dear ? Help us sing it , Joyce . " Joyce 's face had puckered over her sister 's loss , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they work and they play , But they never cry a single tear the livelong day ! " By the time the last line came , Jeany was adding her voice , faint and tearful , to the two others . I explained that would send her another comb from Denver . I washed the dishes while Mary attended to Victor 's bedtime wants , took him to his room , saw the girls to bed . Victor had a small table and ate in the kitchen . " It is the only way I can manage , " Mary said . " So many things are spilled and so many dishes broken , besides , of course , the looks . It bothers Clarence , too . " I followed her lead , spoke in a matter-of-fact voice . " Are you going to keep him here much longer ? Have you thought of schools ? " " Clarence persuaded me to send him to one of the state schools , but he was so unhappy there I ca n't bear to take him again . He does n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1 mean no special affection , for their mothers . But Victor has ; he 's so gentle and loving . ( I had noticed how demonstrative he was to Mary . ) Of course if he were like some of them , I could n't keep him at home . But I ca n't see that it is bad for the girls . Indeed , I think it teaches them kindness and understanding . What do you think ? " We talked at length while Mary set bread sponge and knit on a sweater she was making for her mother . 1 felt she was wrong to keep Victor at home , not because it deprived him of anything ( he could never be taught a craft , find happiness through the use of his hands ) but because it added an almost intolerable burden to her already burdened shoulders . But I was not willing to give definite advice . For a few years more it might be all right . And I was not a mother . The next day was Saturday . Mary was up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , before their father had gone to the barns . I had heard her in the night , too  --  up with either her mother or Victor . She was doing a washing before breakfast  --  she said there must be washing every day  --  kneading her bread , baking another cake . I smelled pumpkin when I came out , saw the shells for three pies waiting on the table . I read to Mrs. Sheldon , tried various methods to interest Victor , told stories to the girls . The morning flew . After Mary 's baking was done she went to the smokehouse for ham , brought in a lame chicken and doctored it , ironed the clothes she had washed . After dinner , when the dishes were washed and Mr. Foster , silent to taciturnity , had gone out , Mary said to me , " Now , we 'll separate for an hour , Miss MeAtee . . rest , sleep , do whatever we like . Victor will sleep in the kitchen on his couch , Jeany in her own room . Joyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can be near mother . I 'll see you about three . Stay here by the fire if you like . " I decided to rest in my own room . It was cold , but I should lie under thr. coverings . As I left the dining room I saw Joyce getting out her patchwork . I thought I had seldom seen so lovely a child as this fair , grave little girl with the two golden braids . " I 'm glad your mother is going to have some rest , " I said . I felt that Joyce would be glad , too , for I had noticed how unusually thoughtful she was . Joyce looked at me with that light I had twice seen in her gray eyes . " She 's going to the mountain meadows . " I had closed the door before what she said really entered my consciousness . I decided I must have misunderstood her . There were no mountains within two hundred miles . I slept after my recent busy days . It was after four when I woke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily as he petted the cat with one wide , soft hand . In the other he held his new knife , and Mary , busy at sewing , was saying , " Victor 's knife , Victor 's knife , " trying to teach him the words . The girls were having a party with their new dishes , the door open to their grandmother 's room and her bed pulled close so that she could see . Mary had changed her dress to a becoming jersey suit , ordered , I knew , from a catalogue for eight dollars or so . I could see the faint crease where the hem had been let down to meet her heavy , high shoes . How little she had changed in figure , I thought . Still slight in build , strong , vital . There in her cheap dress , her ill-fitting shoes , with her white hair wound round her head in the old way , she sat as at the center of things , powerfully still . " Blue-jays , would you like to put on your coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The girls were on their way to the kitchen door , where their coats hung , before the words were finished . Mary explained to me . " I put my mail out Saturday , and when the Smiths pass on their way to town Sunday to have dinner with their daughter , they take it . We have no daily rural service here . " I looked closely at Mary when the girls had gone . " You look rested . Did you sleep ? " " No ; I never sleep in the daytime . went to my mountain meadows . " Again those words . Mary Foster smiled . " Of course you wonder . Plains , range country , rolling brown stretches . But mountain meadows are anywhere . " " But I do n't understand , " said I. " Wo n't you tell me about them ? " Mrs. Sheldon was snoring now , gone into sleep in the quick way of the old . Victor was drooling and plucking at Mary 's skirts . Mary began cutting out paper dolls for the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares . I could not go on without help . . . strength , something to quicken me . The great ones of earth  --  Jesus , Laotse , the Buddha , the saints  --  always went apart . ' There 's some principle there , something basic . I believe for many people prayer is the rebuilding agency , especially when it is not petition but praise . For others , like Tagorc , it 's meditation . For me , it 's beauty . Under a walnut tree down the draw I have a folding-chair , and I go there every day . " " But there is so little beauty now , " I put in stupidly , ray eyes on the frozen fields . " It need n't be outer beauty , Miss McAtee . Let me tell you . . . . You know what the constant seeing of ugliness does , how it acts as a speck of rut , spreading so that the fruit of the soul is spoiled ? With me , the ugliness was . . Victor . " Before this fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment there was no sound in the chimney , no sound from the boy , the cat . " It came to me in those first years of my marriage , when mother was with her people in Iowa , and 1 was a stranger , without a friend or even a neighbor near , only Victor all day , that ugliness is dangerous . Outer ugliness is bad , but it is nothing to seeing with your inner eyes , your mind , what is ugly . That 's the way crime is made . Not that I ever meditated any crimes , " Mary smiled , " but I 'm trying to show you how I got my start at thinking . " I saw one day that ugliness is unnatural , and that thinking it , picturing it , creates more of it . And then I began to see the opposite . Doctors , teachers , psychologists , advertisers all see it a little  --  the power of definite suggestion upon the child , the sick person , the public . But most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , we do n't use what we see . " With her eyes glowing she hurried on , " If one can meditate upon evil and ' grow ' evil , ca n't one meditate upon good and ' grow ' good ? " What she meant began to dawn upon me . " So you . . . " " Yes . I will to see beauty , the flowers of a mountain meadow . Any kind of beauty will do if one sees it often enough , clearly enough . It seems to me that beauty is the mind of God expressing perfectly . When we see it , touch it in our minds , we see and touch God for that moment , and power comes to us . " I pondered this . " You chose flowers because . . " Because they are beautiful in so many different ways . They challenge the imagination , make one use it . That is necessary , I think . . not the same pictures every day , but new ones all the time . " " Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " I 'll try to , Miss McAtee . . . . Always I have thrilled at the thought of mountains . When I was a little girl , instead of mud pies , I made ranges of mountains , with pebbles stuck in for the boulders . This was in Kansas . Later , in Iowa , I read about them , saw pictures of them . It was at a lecture by Frank Roberson that I first saw stereopticon views , in color , of mountains and mountain flowers . When I was married and knew I was to live in Colorado I tingled all over at the idea of seeing mountainsat last . But we did n't come by way of Denver ; there was n't even a glimpse of them . And after Victor came I could never leave . . . . Do n't look so hurt , Miss McAtee . At first I did resent it . I thought I just must get to them . . sec the sweep of them , climb them , hear their healing stillness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in imagination . . . to climb the rocky trail , to hear the wind in the lodgepole pines , to go on and on , resting and climbing and breathing deep breaths of the clean , high air . And at last to come upon a wide , green mountain-slope covered with tall grass and bright flowers , waiting there in the sun for me ! Or the mist . Or the moonlight . I can choose , you see . But I keep one mood at a time , so that my picture is still . It is the stillness as much as the beauty that gives me strength . Since I have read a little of what mystics call The Silence , I can understand that , but I discovered it for myself . " Gradually I bring the view close , so that I can see the separate blossoms , watch them open , touch them . Oh , Miss McAtee , imagination can do anything if we just give it patient training ! It 's a power a thousand times more marvelous than electricity ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . no , not courage , just the power to go on ; I find my body renewed , actual aches and pains gone . My hair is white , but I 'm younger than I was ten years ago . " She was glowing , magnetic as beauty itself , I thought as I watched her . After a moment she went on , " The girls understand . They help me take the time , each day after dinner . They look after mother and Victor . " Victor was hungry . There was time for only one more question . " I 've tried to have flowers in the yard , but the wind blows so and the soil on the house-slope is so poor they will not grow . My mind is my garden . I get books from the state university , and gradually I 'm learning the flowers of the world . I know over two thousand kinds now , and the girls several hundred . " She smiled at me , then down at the boy mumbling beside her . " Yes , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rose and carried her lighted face to the kitchen . I heard the sound of dishes , and soon after Mr. Foster coming in after the milking-pails . The wind sang in the chimney , Methuselah stretched luxuriously . I experienced powerfully that feeling of home , of something centering , firm . We were all watching the sunset from the back porch when Joyce 's scream pierced us  --  a shrill , high , child-scream of terror that twisted the heart in an icy grip . I stood rooted immovably , my feet grown to the floor , my hand to the pillar beside me . Mary sprang over the side of the porch , ran like a deer down the frozen path . " Victor ! Victor ! " One moment before I had seen a picture of pastoral simplicity and beauty : against the bare dun ground and the blue winter sky Mary 's husband , moving toward us in a shaft of amber light from the setting sun , his milkpails flashing , and Methuselah gleaming white as she ran ahead at his feet . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden hair of the great boy lunging down the wind-swept slope , and the open blade of the knife he held gripped in his right hand . Muttering sounds pushed up from the boy 's throat , sounds without words , yet clear as the stream of sunlight , evident as the sudden control of the flabby muscles , the fearful strength in the body that had been until now like a sick child 's . " Victor ! Victor ! " Mary was almost there . I shut my eyes . When I opened them I had a confused sense impression of the three people massed , Mary in her green dress the middle one . Then the mass separated , and I saw them all distinctly  --  Mary , with a great gash down cheek and neck and blood pouring over her dress , Clarence Foster with his arm around her and his face even at that distance a strange , grayish color , and Victor , his hands across his face and his head shuttling back and forth , back and forth , as he knelt moaning between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get towels , pull the teakettle to the front of the stove , Joyce lay in a little heap on the couch below the window , her screams now a convulsive sobbing awful in its restraint . I had just time to lay my hand on her shaking little shoulder before Mr. Foster brought Mary in . Mary would not be carried . Through the blood I saw the smile on her lips , and her voice was like a chord of quiet in a great din . " I 'm all right , Clarence . Go on with your chores . Please , dear . And do n't say a word to Victor ; he 's so frightened . Joyce , will you run and tell Victor that mother 's all right . . . to come and see ? " Mary took the wet cloth from me and began wiping away the blood . The cut on her cheek at the jawbone was deep , but the knife had glanced off , and the rest of the long red line was really only a line . Mary showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a little scratch ! " Then she gave all her mind to the white boy in the doorway , retching with sobs and still moaning , " Mother , mother , mother , mother ! " She held the towel to her cheek to cut off the flow of blood while she tried to get Victor to look at the scratch below . " See , darling ! Mother 's all right . We 'll wash off the blood and put on some medicine , and to-morrow the cut will be healing fast ! " The boy moaned on , " Mother , mother , mother , mother , " his lips only half open , his eyes closed , his body limp . From the couch where he huddled he clung weakly to the back of Mary 's skirt , his breath coming in choking gasps . Clarence Foster had not said a word . He had got the antiseptic for me , a roll of gauze ; he tried awkwardly to help as I bathed and cared for the wound . But as soon as the bandages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want any supper ; do n't wait for me , " he said . Mary did not hear . Victor 's sobs had changed to nausea , and she was busy with him . I was standing near the kitchen window when Mr. Foster went out . I saw him stoop and pick up the Boy Scout knife , close it , and fling it far into the winter dusk , then hurry down the slope to the barns . Mary cared for Victor and got him to bed while I prepared supper and took in Mrs. Sheldon 's tray . She sent the girls after their father when I told her what he had said , then sat a moment on the kitchen couch , very white and strange-looking in her swathing bandages  --  nunlike , I remember thinking . " I know you are feeling conscience-stricken because the knife was your gift , Miss McAtee . But do n't feel so . Tonight has taught us a lot of things . Clarence kicked Methuselah , you see . She was around his feet and she made him stumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how he loves the cat . How he got the knife open is a mystery , but I am glad of it all  --  everything . Victor and his father ... Well , I 've been afraid sometimes . There is a feeling between them , not a happy feeling . But now , you see , because when he tried to hurt his father he hurt me instead , it is all over . Victor does care more for me than for anything in the world , as Joyce said just to-night . And the bleeding helped so much : he is always sickened at the sight of blood . He 'll never be tempted to handle a knife again . " It was the next morning , an hour before Mr. Smith was to call for me and take me to the train , that I had my last glimpse into Mary Foster 's soul . It was a relief to me that I did not need to have the long drive with Clarence Foster . Mr. Smith had driven over the evening before to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in some new duds for the trip to the daughter 's at Nicholson . Mary and I had finished the most necessary duties of the morning and , wrapped in shawls , were walking down the frozen path toward Mary 's tree . I was feeling very humble about this privilege , and thankful , too , for the chance to talk to Mary alone . There was something I had to say to her . I had been thinking about it all night . Before we reached the folding-chair , I spoke . I could n't wait . I plunged in , bunglingly . " Mary , your husband hates Victor : I saw it in his face last night . He does n't even care for the girls as other fathers care for their children . And you  --  I do n't believe you love him , Mary . Come and live with me and prepare yourself to teach . My new house will be ready by August , big enough for you and your mother and the girls . The state school is only fifteen miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day or two . " As I spoke Mary 's face flared into life , bloomed into a new kind of beauty -- a beauty so eager it was like a rainbow after storm , strong sunlight after hours of silver grayness . I hurried on : " It 's a dream I 've had for years  --  to have a place where some of the students could stay , unusual girls , like you at twenty . I 'm glad my house burned down ; it took just that to jog me into action . Better than young teachers will be you and your children . You can get your degree , you can teach . I 'll make a place for you in my department . And for my reward I can have the selfish satisfaction of my pride in you , and of helping educate those girls of yours . " Mary was silent . She was pale , the strange light gone from her face . Her gaze was on the frozen fields when she spoke . " May I have a little time , here , alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . " When I came back , Mary was still pale but she was smiling . I knew her decision before she spoke . " No , I do not love Clarence in the way wives are expected to love their husbands , " she said quietly , with that immense honesty of hers . " But there is another sort of love , larger , perhaps ; farther-seeing -- -and I think it has begun to grow in me . . . . He is n't all hard . He cares for one thing  --  the earth , the soil . He never saves himself . From the first , when he was visiting our neighbors that spring my father died , he has worked tirelessly . He came over to help me that year , when I was twenty and trying to run the farm alone . I had never known a man , a young , virile man . We fell in love , were married and came to this Colorado farm we bought with mother 's money . We 've had a hard time . Our soil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our land and the Smiths ' . But Clarence would n't sell , even if there were any market for a poor dry-farm . He is experimenting with fertilizers as fast as he can afford them . And he does n't hate Victor , Miss Atee . It is just that he was proud and happy before he was born , and afterward , when . . . I had a fall , down the cellar steps ; perhaps it was that ; we do n't know . . . . He does n't hate him . He hates his aversion and does n't know how to meet it . And last night he was afraid Victor had killed me , severed the jugular vein . " Perhaps she was right . She must be . From my window that morning I had seen Clarence Foster stoop and softly call Methuselah until she came , then feel of her carefully as though examining her for possible injury , and at last , re-lieved , pet her and give her a piece of meat . No , he was n't all hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on : " What would he do without us ? He is so alone ; so few people like him . It is his own fault , but that does n't help , does it ? He 's the turned-in kind ; he always shows his worst side . He has been very self-conscious since you came , too , because lie went to school so little . His one chance of changing , growing , is through the girls , I think . They are nice children , are n't they ? " she asked me quizzically , hungrily . I nodded , a little grim . " And after last night . . Do n't you see what he has done  --  to himself ? He stumbles on , as we all do . He ca n't say he is sorry he lost his temper  --  not even to me . But he will be a stronger man because of this . Victor found a bloody rag this morning , one we had not burned , and when he began vomiting again Clarence was so gentle with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to thank you for your offer . But I ca n't accept it . " She stopped in the path to press my arm , slip her hand into mine . " Come , let 's get back in time to crack some black walnuts . I want you to have a box of the meats . " On the train I thought of myself for almost the first time since I had come . How little the losses I had bewailed - things , bits of beauty that would have died in a few years anyway . Mary Foster , in an ugly farmhouse on a bleak farm , with an invalid mother , an afflicted son , a husband with little grace , had splendor all about her , eternal wonder and beauty .
