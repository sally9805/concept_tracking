The stench of sizzling human flesh filled the furnaces of German crematoriums last week as they worked overtime on the bullet-riddled remains of men and women who died fortnight ago in Adolf Hitler 's " blood purge " ( TIME , July 9 ) . No respect was paid to the fact that cremation is against Catholic tenets . Into the flames , despite the protests of grieving relatives , went the corpse of Dr. Erich Klausener , beloved leader of the Fatherland 's Catholic Action Society . What Dr. Klausener had done to deserve death the State had not yet officially said , merely classed him with " other traitors .

Other Secret Police chased mourners away from the empty graves . For 48 hours the von Schleicher family knew not what had become of their dead . Then more Secret Police arrived . <P> " You are forbidden to give out any information , " they ordered . " Here are two urns . They contain the ashes .

German jurists assumed that no subsequent non-Hitlerite Government would consider this decree valid , pointed out the value , to Nazi killers , of burning up by cremation the major evidence of their deeds .
