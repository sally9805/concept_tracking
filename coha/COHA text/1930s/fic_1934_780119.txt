 | neath the blow , and snatched the gold-mounted crop from my grasp . If he meant robbery , that were a different matter to handle . I let go my hold of the horse , trusting he would stand for the moment , twisted in the gillie 's grasp , and getting a perfect head-hold , hurled him sprawling . He did not fall like a wrestler . Rather , he fell like a great sack of meal , all spread and spent upon the floor of the bridge . Just what had happened to him he evidently had not the least idea . I walked over , picked up my whip where it had fallen , remounted Valentine , and sat dusting off my hands before he had sufficiently gathered his ideas to stand again on his feet . His face was a study : sullen of lip , frightened of eye , not certain whether to run or advance . " My friend , " said I , kindly , " do not , in the future , carelessly attack a stranger who means you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He did not answer directly , but he wriggled himself all over , just like the hound might have done ; and his various members responding , apparently without alarming symptoms , all seemed well . " Good bye to you , " said I , saluting him with the recovered whip , and I was turning Val toward the Hunting Horn , when " Hold ! " he cried once more . I paused . " Hold , master . Would you see me whipped ! "  | There was a fear , and an appeal in his tone . I hesitated . What could he mean by being whipped ; and what had I to do with that ? " My good fellow ? " " You 'll come with me , sir ? " he pleaded . " But why should I ? " " She said she would have me whipped , an I failed her , sir . " " What ! " I cried ; and'was off of Val , and had the fellow by the arm so suddenly that he attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the river . " Speak ! " said I , shaking him in a flurry . " Who is this she who will have you whipped ? " " She will ! She will ! " he cried , tremulously . " Ever else was she tender ; but now she has turned cruel . I was not to sleep , but to watch . If I slept she would have me whipped . And I slept but little , master , as you know . Now you are here , but you will not come with me . Come with me , sir , I pray you , and I will be rewarded . " " My good fellow , " said I , after digesting his woeful words . " As I understand , you were placed here to watch for some one ; and you think that I am he . Is that so ? " " Yes . And you are him , for sure . " " But why do you think that ? It was a strange time , and from a strange person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said he , " you are so comely , and so ? so lordlike . " I was young , remember , and I fell into the trap . " What is your name , my man ? " 1 " Robin , " quoth he . " Robin , " I repeated , thoughtfully . Somehow the appellation did not suit his great hulk at all . " Robin , eh ? Robin what ? " " Nothing , " he responded . " Robin Nothing ? " ri " No ; just Robin . Robin the Shepherd . " " Oh ! Well , Robin the Shepherd , lead me on to her , and I shall follow . " So , mounting again , I kicked a stirrup toward him , which he took in his huge bungling hand ; and we crossed the rustic bridge , the great dog frisking along I i before us , and turned over the mead beyond .  | Chapter VI AN UNLOOKEDFOR WELCOME Now AS WE ADVANCED into the meadows , leaving that small enchanted forest behind us , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back , and I thought that I caught the glint of morning light upon a woman 's skirt of Lincoln green at the woodland 's edge . But so the color blent with the leafage and the bosk , I could not be confident . And I having hope that the woman Robin spoke about was really the only one I sought , I took but little heed of that , and we pressed forward . This shepherd sped along beside me right featly , clinging to the gear of my saddle , and soon we moved up a fine roadway , where there was now noble trees and rich shade , or again , rolling pasture land where plump cattle browsed . Still further we met with flatter lands where sheep nibbled short the grass , and here the great dog left us to take up his evident duties ' round the flock . And last , a spreading copse of age-old oaks , finely hedged about with new-set growths of lesser trees , showing , yet concealing a low , long , rambling house . Before the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to note that it was appointed in a manner which left little doubt as to the wealth and standing of its owners , when forth came a flunky to hold Valentine ,  | and we two stepped within the main entrance . Now this large doorway let us in to a large , long hall , from each side of which various chambers opened . And at the rear a stair wound up to higher apartments . It would be useless for me to hint that my heart beat at its usual pace when I saw , with no doubt at all this time , the flash of a woman 's graceful figure as she sped from view up these steps . I got but a glimpse , of course , but it seemed impossible that so light a tread and so fair a form could be other than her whom I worshiped . Therefore I addressed my attention to my apparel once more , seeing that all was as it should be ; and regretting the silken cloak I had left at home , I reset my dagger that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my belt , and bade Robin do with me as he would . With the most evident delight that he had succeeded in bringing me hither , the shepherd led me further , to a wide door upon our left , which was closed . On this he rapped with his large red knuckles , and we were instantly admitted , and the door shut as promptly after us . The room in which I found myself was long and low , with some white sand sprinkled upon the floor . At the side opposite the main entrance there stood a great fireplace , now yawning black and cold in the summer 's warmth . Large windows with small knobs of glass set in leaden frames gave sufficient light , but prevented a view from either within or without , except that several  | now stood open . The morning sunlight shining through these made the apartment seem cheerful despite its sparse furnishings . A few highbacked chairs were clustered in the center of the floor , all facing in one direction , and some rude benches were placed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few of which were occupied at the moment , was a flat tabledesk , on which lay pens , ink , paper , sand , seals , and a great naked sword with a dull steel hilt . Behind this desk sat a greyhaired man with a small , thin , drooping moustache and a pointed grey beard . His head was bare , and around his neck he wore a linen band so wide that , although it may not have been starched , it still stood out so flat that it gave the impression that his head was resting on a white plate . A long jagged scar seamed this man 's cheek from eye to jowl , and I noted , as I watched him , that his habit was to sit with his cupped hand hiding this blemish . He was doing so now , while his tired blue eyes looked out from beneath bushy brows at a coarsely dressed man who was standing with his wife and gangling son , talking excitedly , but with due deference , regarding some evident grievance , judging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retainer , and two others lounged at a distant window . Save for two men on the chairs , an old crone sitting on the form at our side , and the pleading family at the desk , no one else was present .  | Certainly the maid I had hoped to see was not there . Resting on the bench , I kicked my heels and wondered what in the name of reason I had been brought here for . Trespass after all , evidently . Well , a small fine would be met , but I had no intention of lingering my morning away here . I even considered getting up and leaving , but there was a certain atmosphere of dignity about the room which held me still ; also the man at the door carried a ready halberd . I tried to hear what the pleader was saying , but his back was toward me and nothing was evident but his monotonous voice . Suddenly the elderly man at the desk spoke , and his tone was such that the words cracked out like a whiplash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried , rapping his ringed hand upon the table before him with each repetition . " We will have no such thing here , mark me well ! I care not what the child thinks . Go clean out your stables if your kine are sick . More good labor , and less gossip and tattle , would bring you your desire . No ! We will harbor no mummery of the witchfinders ' at Parleigh ; and you and your wife will hold your tongues on the matter among the neighbors , or this sword will clip your ears amain . Now go ; and no more child 's tales , lest I lose my temper on it ! " As I listened to this charge , I noted that a door behind the speaker opened a little way , and a girlish figure , dimly seen , motioned nervously , yet with decision , as  | though to attract someone in our direction . For an instant I thought she was making some signal to the group receiving the magistrate 's admonition ? for a landholder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away , and the maid still continued her gesticulations . Apparently a draft struck the shoulders of the gentleman'at the desk , probably from the door the girl was holding ajar , and he settled a cloak more closely about him , at which she closed the portal . But as he continued to remain engrossed in some papers before him , she again dared the effort ; and now I could see her quite plainly : a small , golden-haired miss in a shellcolored gown , who wrung her hands in evident excitement or fear , and kept pointing to ? yes ! ? to my dull companion . Immediately I pulled his arm , at which he turned with a grunt . I watched his eyes , but they were focused on nothing particular , and I thought to jar his somnolent mind with a whispered word . " Look at the door ! " I hissed beneath my , breath . Of course the dolt twisted about to catch a view of the large main entrance where the halberdier stood ; and in his effort to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he almost fell off the . bench , and kicked my sword in his recovery until it rattled like a drum on the pavement . Instantly the man at the desk looked up ; and spying us sitting there , said :  | " Well , Robin , my man ! " in a voice which brought the gillie to his feet instanter . " Sir , " he stammered . " Sir ; I have brought the man , sir , with me . " And as he indicated me , the door at which the girl stood closed softly , and I heard the latch click home . " And who may this gentleman be ; and why is he brought to me ? " enquired the man with the scar , rising slowly and leaning on his desk , with half a bow to me . " I know not , " said Robin , with a fatuous grin . " I be only told ? " " Sir , " I interrupted , for though of no great wit myself , I felt I could plead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . " Sir , I was riding your beautiful estate , admiring its delightful prospects , when I ? I fell into conversation with this good fellow , who guided me hither very willingly . " I there paused , and looked at Robin , who evinced corroboration ; so I continued . " My name , sir , is Richard Scot ; son of Sir Philip Scot , of Overmead , Suffolk . I and ? " " Not , " interrupted the gentleman addressed , " Sir Philip Scot , who married Elizabeth Wyrrall , of the Kethley Wyrralls ? " " The same , sir ; and evidently known to you . I say , I was riding by ? " " And I say you will ride no further for many a day , an ' you will have it so ! " he cried , coming from behind his desk and grasping my hand in both of his . " My  | dear lad , that I am delighted to welcome you , be assured . Robin , a good turn you have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Begone now , and take these tenants with you . Come , Richard ? Richard , after your grandfather , Richard Wyrrall , I doubt not ? come with me to my room . You are not alone , you say ? " " My cousin , Jenkyn Wyrrall , rides with me , sir . But he has gone on to the Hunting Horn , a few leagues further . " " That can soon be mended , " said my host , ushering me across the hall into a second large apartment , lined with books and pictures , while the windows were covered by dark rich hangings . " Come into my living chamber , and lay by your gear , and sit . This is the one place in the house which I may call my very own . My old heart is troubling me , so that I climb no stairs to bed , but sleep here , as the couch suggests . Wait ! " And he rang a bell to bring a servant hurrying . " Some wine and biscuits . Bustle ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear lad , I can see something of your mother in your eyes and hair , although you have your good father 's breadth of shoulder . He and I , you know , were together in Scotland . Warm work it was , while it lasted . Slashed doublets are not in the fashion now , but slashed cheeks still reign in my appearance . Well , well ! " And he rose again , to wring me by the hand .  | Now things might have been much worse than this , but they might also have been better . At least I was receiving a royal welcome , but , from whom ? And it would be hard to ask now , because this talkative old gentleman evidently thought I had come expressly to pay him a visit . Well , I must soon learn , thought I , while he asked of my parents , and of my journey , speaking of all matters most courteously . And soon the door opened , and in came the lackey with the refreshment ; to be soon followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shepherd from the partly closed door . This young woman , who was undeniably pretty ? dainty and sweet , with curling light hair , and a form as plump as a partridge ? curtsied to the floor as her father presented me . He called her name as Tamzin ; Tamzin what , I did not know . Probably even Tamzin was wrong , and she was Thomasine actually . I made her my best bow , and was not at all amazed when she put her finger to her red lips in token of silence , and shook her head vigorously at me when her parent was looking elsewhere . " You must prepare a room for our guest , my dear , " said my host ; " and a second for his companion . And to-night we will have a dinner fit for a king . It is not often , now , since my wife died , that we have the honor of a visit from the child of an old friend . Unhappily , the young people nowadays care little for old friends ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were jour neying with your companion ? " " Why , to visit the tomb of my grandsire . " " Now that , sir , is goodly telling . It shows a respect for those who have gone before , and does you an honor while honoring that worthy man . Ah , the pilgrimage to a resting place of our ancestry , if more frequently considered by the young , might better bring home the value of their lives , and make this restless generation of less importance in their own eyes . Now , let me see . Your cousin , if I recall , is at the Hunting Horn . Very good ! I will send for him post haste , and he can join us comfortably for our evening meal . His name again ? Memory dwindles as age increases . " " jenkyn Wyrrall , sir . But if I might make a suggestion ? " " Certainly , certainly , certainly ! What you will . " " When I rode forth this morning from there , I had no thought other than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear is at the Hunting Horn ; and an unpaid score which only I understand . If I could return there myself , and arrange our departure , I think it would be better . " " Yes , I understand . The thought is wise . But you will have , then , a tiring ride of several miles on top of what you already have endured . " " Such a ride is but a jaunt to me . And on such a day , and with your kind welcome to speed my return ,  | it will be more of a pleasure than a trial . " " Ah , youth ! Youth ! " said the older man , smiling , " Your years and impetuosity knows no fatigue ! Well ; as you will . But that means that you must drink down this wine and leave at once . Tamzin , my dear , we must not reveal that we are a trifle rusty at entertaining youthful visitors . My time is mostly spent in greeting old and broken veterans of the wars , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I will be impatient for your return , Richard Scot ; and to learn further of your good father and mother . Ring , Tamzin , for our friend 's mount to be brought . Good speed attend you , sir . "  | Chapter VII A VIEW FROM THE INN WINDOW I RODE from that door with the kind wishes for an early return ringing blithely in my ears . I had hoped that my enthusiastic and voluble host might allow me , by some hook or crook , a few moments alone with his demure and crafty young daughter , but he was too solicitous to leave me unattended for an instant . Who the kindly gentleman might be I had not the faintest idea ; but that would be simple of discovery , so I troubled not at all as to that . What I did not understand was the manner in which I had been brought into his presence . And ? alack ! ? the absence of that very presence which had drawn me to the rustic bridge that day . It passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , I might hunt about for Robin , the shepherd ; but , on second thought , I realized that his dog could probably tell me about as much as he , although the poor fellow certainly held some clue to my introduction to this household . No doubt , had I not seen that brown-haired siren in the clumsy boat , I would have returned to this house in all eagerness for closer association with the mysterious and charming Tamzin ; but actually I rode toward the Hunting Horn in something of gloomy medi-  | tation , wondering if I should ever know , and speak with that bewitching gatherer of water-lilies . Jenkyn was bowling on the green before the inn , but broke off his winning game to hear of my adventure . Of course he was surprised at the result my visit to the bridge had brought about ; but when he found that the maid of this great house , while unquestionably winsome , was not the one whom I sought , I thought he perked up a good bit , and warned me anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it had had a far more fortunate termination than I had a right to expect . " And what , " asked he , " are we about to do now ? " " Why , go back and spend a day or two at this hospitable house , of course . " " It would have been wiser of you , and more becoming to your mother 's wish , Richard , if you had promised to make this visit on your return from your grandsire 's tomb , rather than now . However , we are in for it , I see , so that can not be helped . I will pack and prepare then , and you do likewise , although we have ample time to spend until we leave , to reach there by their dinner hour . " It took us but a few minutes , aided by the inn servants , to prepare for immediate departure ; and also to learn that our prospective host was Sir Thomas Warren , of Parleigh , a gentleman of the highest standing in the district . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , and Jenkyn was certain he had  | heard him mentioned with great respect on several occasions in Bury St. Edmunds . Seated , then , over a light repast of bread , ale and cheese , in Jenkyn 's room in the Hunting Horn which overlooked the village green , we were arrested in our speculative conversation by a great shouting and running toward the commons . And on looking out to ascertain the cause of the uproar , we found that a crowd had gathered there to witness the putting of some alleged witches to the question . The population of the district surrounding this hostelry was inconsiderable , so it was evident that many had come from a distance to witness this sight , which seemed to be regarded more in the light of a jollification , or . a sport , than as the serious business of life and death . On one side of a deep round pool of sluggish water , from which the townspeople drew water for washing , was placed a long table , at which were shortly seated several none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew Hopkins , of Manningtree . At his side stood the ever-smiling Jonathan Sterne ? yes ! and seated close at hand was that girl with the dark hood only partly covering her orange-red hair . We watched them a while , pompous Hopkins and grimacing Sterne always in evidence ; and then , with a great to-do of shouting , cat-calls and merriment , a procession was seen coming over the hill from the gaol . It was headed by an under sheriff and his party , and  | contained ? rigged out as a sort of mistress of ceremony ? that older woman who had formed part of the group at the forge a few days previous at Overmead . This dame had scarcely attracted any attention from me at that time , but still I knew her again ; a stout , grey-haired matron , with cold eyes , a grim mouth , and the general appearance of a skull . These , and the crowd , were escorting four persons ; three women and a man , who were all wrapped about in long black cloaks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , and they walked wearily , as though bruised from the stones of the road . The man , who walked last , had had his thumbs torn off by the screw , to make him confess , no doubt , and the stumps  - -  which he held wide from his cloak as though fearing to stain it ? dripped blood as he shuffled along . One of these women was young , with long , blue-black hair streaming . down her back , its rich sheen making the cloak she wore dingy in contrast . One was middleaged . The third , who was carried astraddle upon a sort of wooden horse , was apparently very old , yet she waved her shrunken arms about her with much vehemence , and showed her toothless gums in a leering grin , shouting unintelligible gibberish to the accompanying throng . Frequently her gyrations upon her perch were such that she would have fallen to the dust , except for the support of the hard-faced matron at her side . Every indication pointed to this old person as being demented .  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his trial  --  if such it could be called ? was brutally brief , although he had already confessed . The noise and commotion among the close-packed throng was so great that it was not possible for us ( or even for the prisoner , I would think , ) to know just what the charges against him were ; but at all events he was condemned to be hanged that same afternoon , and was led aside to await those who would accompany him , and share his gallows . The middle-aged woman was the next to be considered , and she put up a most vigorous defense . Her husband and son pushed through the mob to stand at her side , and give favorable testimony also . She had been searched for the devil 's teat , the grey-haired accomplice of Hopkins told the self-styled court , and none had been found . Some of the gathering sided with her , and some opposed her ; and it was soon evident that the verdict here would depend greatly on popularity . After much shouting and excitement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other judges , this woman was led away to be weighed against the Church Bible . As I felt certain she would have far more poundage than the copy of the Holy Writ , her freedom seemed assured . The virtual liberation of this prisoner seemed to have a most exasperating effect upon the old hag , whose own trial would have been held to the last except for her now violent arraignment of the judges . I  | could not understand just what it was she said , although her shrill , cracked voice rose to me loud enough over the laughter of the people ; but she poured such a torrent of vituperation and curses upon the group before her that they could do little else than condemn her off-hand for such a breach of etiquette ; which was summarily done . At the verdict that she must hang on the gallows within the hour she showed such insane relish that her screams , chortles , and mouthings of delight , coupled with the yelling and jeering of the crowd , turned the entire proceeding into a Bedlam for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue with the gruesome performance , the last remaining victim , the young woman of perhaps nineteen or twenty years , was brought to the improvised bar ; and the jostle held its breath in expectation , for this promised something of interest . Her accusers were several young girls , one of her own age , and several younger ? and , of course , the old crone already marked for the noose . The incriminated maid stood straight and resolute before her adjudicators , her long hanging hair waving lustrously in the light summer breeze . Below her waist it fell , like a shorter , richer sable cloak than that her accusation bade her wear ; and as she looked about the throng , as though in search of some friendly face or kindly eye , she threw back this hanging mane with  | her hands that she might better see . Each time she did so , two of the smaller of her prosecutors rolled upon the ground with shrill cries , and in apparent pain , declaring that they could see small imps clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ! The water ! Try her by water ! " shrieked the crowd . But the judges demurred . Sterne seemed particularly anxious that this should not be done ; and although I loathed the man for some reason ? and would have , even had I not seen him a party to this outrage ? I felt a grudging regard for his holding out against this ordeal . Little did I realize the alternative . Little could I read that smiling , crafty , lecherous face . " Has she been searched for the third teat ? " asked Hopkins . The witchfmders ' grey-haired woman accomplice said that the prisoner had been searched , but without result . " But she has it ! She has it ! " screamed the old hag , shaking a claw-like hand at the girl . " She is cunning and cute , and the devil liked her well , and sucked her blood till he smacked his lips ! Search her well , for she is tender ; and the devil likes them tender ! Search her well , for she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Search her well , for  --  " " Hold your noise ! " cried Hopkins , pursing up his lips , and puffing out his cheeks in a rage . " Do you  | wish to be burned quick , that you raise such a riot ? Your hand over her mouth , guard ! She has no teeth to bite you . Now , dame ; you say this wench has been looked over , and with no success . " " Yes , " minced Jonathan Sterne , who wrote gentleman ' after his name . " Yes . And well you know , Master Judges , that if the devil 's mark be not found and pierced , she will float like a cork in the water , and never confess a word . " Matthew Hopkins , Witchfinder General by the Grace of God and the Power of Parliament , thought for a moment ; and the mob , sensing what might be the outcome , screamed and shouted , men , women and children alike : " Search for the teat ! Find it ! Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baited . Probably unaware of what would happen , the prisoner stood firm before her tormentors . Even if she did realize the outcome , there was naught that she might do . No , nothing ! The grey-haired woman had taken from her pocket , in anticipation , a packet which she opened upon the Judges ' table , and extracted therefrom a thin steel needle , as long as my hand is broad . Turning to the accused , she grasped her suddenly and adroitly by the hair , and at the same instant Jonathan Sterne reached , and tore from the alleged witch the black cloak about her . Stark naked the maid stood , the centre of a tense circle of cruel , ruthless , bestial eyes . The glory of  | the summer sun lay on her ivory flesh like a rosy benediction . Erect for an instant was that flushed symmetry of her , like a chaste pale flame in a sordid ring of putrefaction . Then a great wave of shame instinctively drove her hand before her burning face . But the long needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the victim writhed in agonizing postures as her flesh was speared , now here , now there , while the mob yelled its loathsome delight , and only the judges seemed unaffected : Hopkins suggesting and directing the impalement ; Jonathan Sterne looking on entranced , his frozen smile slitting his face and his tongue licking his thin lips in appreciation . If that long needle had gone into my own body I could not have experienced more poignant pain than I did as it seared the prisoner 's wracked flesh . The casement was open before me , and I measured the distance to the earth below , for a leap to her rescue was the sole content of my mind . But , suddenly , the shutter of the window was slammed closed , and the next instant I was hurled to the floor , and Jenkyn , having read my thoughts , was holding me down , and struggling and gasping in the effort . How long we grappled there I do not know . I could have won free of him , after the surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of my strength to do so ; but always as I strove to rise , his  | voice ? calm in tone , although gasping for breath ? bade me not to interfere , lest I also would be sacrificed to the blood-lust of the fiend-inspired , fear-driven people . At length we rested , spent ; and I noted that the cries and trampling of many feet were gradually receding in the distance . Rising from the edge of the couch , ' where we both had been resting , I walked to my own room across the hallway , my cousin anxiously following beside me . The window there was open also , but it looked out at the opposite side of the inn ; upon a tranquil scene of rolling fields , verdant coppices , small cottages nestling in shaded nooks , and a herd of peaceful kine , chewing their cud or dipping their white noses in a flurried and impatient brook . Down I sat , and drank me in that peaceful scene . And good Jenkyn , too , with ever and anon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillized his mind as well . And eventually I reached forth and grasped his great brown fist , and expressed to him as well as I might my gratitude . For his prompt act had prevented me , in my uncontrollable rage , from harming us both , while doing no good to those I had sought to save . After another wait , we rose , and called for the landlord , that we might settle our account , and begone . He came , a fat , smiling fellow , elated at the success of the witch hunt , that had , he assured me , not only  | cleared some malignant souls from the neighborhood , but had allowed him to dispense to the gathering much good ale and liquor . We paid and departed , under a running fire of comments from our temporary host , in which we learned that the poor man , who was likely at the moment being hanged as a wizard , had ridden over twenty miles to denounce another to Matthew Hopkins , and had been , with that witchfinder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected himself , and put to such torture that he was forced to confess . With the firm conviction that our inn-keeping friend had greater regard for the sale of his stimulants than the eradication of evil characters , particularly as the throng would shortly return to make merry there for the rest of the day , we rode away from the block toward Parleigh . The village green , where Jenkyn had bowled that day , was deserted now , save for a lone woman who was weeping over the body of her daughter at the pool 's edge . The poor thing had sunk in the water , proving she was no witch ; and when the crowd had gone , the girl 's lover had raised her body with a stick , aided by the old woman who moaned by the sheet-shrouded form . We sat our horses , looking down on the still , covered body , and on the thick wet hair which escaped the sheet , and lay in jetty strands upon the trampled grass . We asked the mother if there was aught we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " no . " A son in the next village had been sent for , and he would soon come with the betrothed of the poor creature now wedded to eternity . Then they would bear her home . We remained at the stricken mother 's side until she pointed out the two men hurrying over the fields . Then placing a gold piece in her hand , which we begged her to accept as a token of our sympathy , we went upon our way .  | Chapter VIII PARLEIGH OUR RECEPTION at Parleigh was as hearty , and as clamorous , as any welcome I have ever received anywhere , before or since . I think that we had our friend Robin the Shepherd to thank for much of that , for he had evidently told the story of my tossing him upon the bridge , with as much exaggeration as his slow wits could gather together . The result was , that every man on the property , and most of the women , were anxious to behold the giant who could thus handle one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the path toward the house entrance , we were saluted on every hand by a host of servants and tenantry , who , hat in hand , bowed and curtseyed , until we might have been royalty itself . Robin stood at the horse block in a new , or at least , a different and better , coat ? a special envoy to receive Valentine ; and I thought it well to wring him by the hand , at which the assembled throng set up a cheer . Sir Thomas Warren was in the entrance , and there were more biscuits and wine ; the latter of a rare vintage , doubtless , although my palate was scarcely educated to do it justice . We were shown at once to our  | respective rooms , and I know that I prepared a toilet to do honor to the warmth of our welcome . In fact , so long was I in selecting and donning my dress for the dinner , that when I eventually arrived in Sir Thomas ' room on the ground floor my cousin Jenkyn had preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My host met me with another handshake , and then excused himself for a moment to see to some arrangements , which left Jenkyn and me alone for just a short minute . It was long enough for him to impart to me the astounding and exalted news , however . " My dear fellow , " he whispered in my ear . " She is here ! I have just had speech with her . And she is more delightful , I believe , than at first I thought when I saw her . " I was surprised at this for two reasons : First ; because fortune had been so gentle to me , that this lovely lady should actually be a member of the Parleigh household ; and second ; because I had never thought of Jenkyn Wyrrall as a possible rival ? in fact , I had never thought of him as being interested in any phase of love at all . And suddenly , for just an instant , I saw him as a potential enemy ? his dark , unusual yet handsome face , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? because his tone and manner had shown me instantly that his interest was intense . Then , I am happy to say truthfully , my attitude toward his evident subjugation changed . If he , also , was  | smitten with this same girl , let us each strive manfully and fairly ; and might she choose ? not the most worthy , for then I would surely lose , but him who would make her most happy . Now all these thoughts had flown through my mind in that twinkling of time which lay between his whispered words , and the opening of the room door again ; and a graceful girlish form dropped me a curtsey and rose again with a welcoming smile , as Jenkyn 's hand took hers to lead her forward to be presented . Her face held a glow which it had not worn at our previous meeting ; and my kinsman 's voice fairly trembled as he said : " Dear Mistress Warren , may I present to you my beloved cousin , and traveling companion , Richard Scot ? And may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the effrontery to do ? " " We have already met , " said she , with an enticing pout of her rosebud mouth . " And you may each call me Tamzin , if you so wish . But I will allow no one to call me Tommy ; so do not offend me , sirs . " " Heaven defend us , who would dare ! " said Jenkyn , smiling into her eyes . " It was merely a warning , " she explained . " And now , will you please to come to the dining room with me ? " I held the door open for this delightful daughter of Parleigh , when a serving woman , kind-faced and stout ,  | beckoned her aside for a word . " The management of a home compels me to keep you waiting for just an instant , " she murmured . " Your pardon , gentlemen , " and she left us alone . The pause gave Jenkyn time to whisper : " Why did you not tell me ? " " Tell you what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " Why , Tamzin is not the girl of the boat . " " She certainly is ! " he hissed in my ear . " She looked right up at me , and ? " " No , Jenkyn . You 're wrong . She was darker , and taller . I ? " " Not so ! Would I be mistaken ? She was holding the pole in her hand as she turned , and I saw her clearly . " " The one I referred to was pulling the lilies . " " Oh ! " he said . " I did n't notice her . " I would have answered , but a light footfall sounded in the entry , and my cousin would not have heard me then , if I had shouted that a lion was crouching behind him to spring . She took his arm , and I trailed into the dining hall absolutely alone , and entirely forgotten by both . Sir Thomas Warren set a stately and hospitable table . I sat upon his right hand , and Jenkyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and one also beside him ; and after some slight confusion , and , I  | thought , a blush on Tamzin 's cheek , she took the seat beside my cousin . Of course I instantly understood the role I was to play . While she and my kinsman dined alone together I was to hold her good father in close conversation ; and I went promptly to the task . Sir Thomas was a judge of good living , but he enjoyed his own conversation more . I lent , I trust , a ready ear , and we touched on a multitude of subjects ; he lengthy and voluble , I assuming intense interest or deep concern , as the occasion seemed to warrant . I do not wish to imply by this that the master of Parleigh was a person easy to hoodwink , or that he was of a type anyone would desire to cozen ; but he was far in age for his years , being little older than my own stalwart father , yet somewhat decrepit in body and groping senescent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth , and little he grasped of living incidents . Naturally , with that hideous witchhunting mockery still in my mind , I spoke to him of the words I had heard him utter to his tenant with the sick kine that morning . " Ah , yes , " he said . " Now that is a case which needs careful handling . Of course , I know that there are witches , just as I know there are robbers . But there are few or none of either at Parleigh ; and for that I thank God . In Spain , in ' r9 , I have been in towns where witches and warlocks were as thick as bees in  | a hive . The trouble is , here , that if a careless man loses his purse , he shouts Robbers , ' and comes to me for redress . And I must judge the case , and send him about his business , hoping next time he will be more careful . This man that you heard this morning has come to me time and time again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a son , whom I think too glib to be truthful ; and this lad has had some experiences which are astounding , if true . But just the same , his cattle are ill housed , and he is too lazy to right the condition . Of course I am too experienced a man to feel his suspicion is without foundation , but I will make my own investigation in my own way . If I placed credence , or showed him interest , in all that he tells me , the cry of Witch ' would ring through the district , and Parleigh would be in a ferment . " " I saw some witchfinding methods to-day , at the Hunting Horn , which fairly sickened me , sir . " " Just so . Exactly so . Such matters must be handled with justice and common sense , or more trouble will result than ever the witches could do . And yet , to be too lax is as dangerous as to be too severe . Tell me , how does your good father straighten such consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful deliberation on all judicial matters brought before him ; and of his firm dispensation of impartial judgment when all the truth was digested . " He is very decided , " I replied . " He will not allow a witch trial to be held in his  | domain . Only a few days ago two old people were burned at Toothill , near Overmead , and never have I seen my father more incensed . They were both old tenants of his , and better people never lived , he said . " " There you are ! The innocent suffer , and the guilty go free . It 's the devil 's doing , and difficult to right . But the fact that they were known to him once does not bear upon their guilt . The better a person was once , the finer a victory for the devil if he signs them . I have always said that if my own son ( I have none , but no matter , ) if my own son was found to be a warlock , I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . Now , that may seem harsh to the young , but older folks know that right is right , and we must not temporize with our feelings . Regardless of the standing of the culprit , positive proof , I say ; and then let naught interfere with the punishment . Now , Richard , tell me , if you will , of this trial that you saw to-day . " " Nay , " I pleaded . " It is so fresh in my memory , and so horrible , that I dare not let my mind dwell upon it , lest I turn bitter , even at this goodly board . " " You are right . The world is full of suffering ? as we of an older generation know full well ? and there are times when we must witness it . But when we have an opportunity to enjoy life , free of such miseries , let us also take advantage of it to the full . Forget all , then , for we must have no shadow at our little feast ; eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , " said that gentleman  | addressed , having no more idea of what we had been talking than had the Lord Mayor of London . And then he enquired tenderly of Mistress Tamzin if she did not wholly agree with her father in this matter ; and that young person , very pink of cheek and wide of blue eye , hazarded that her dear father was usually right in everything ; and they fell to whispering again , and quite forgot there was anyone else present within three seconds ' time . Sir Thomas and I , therefore , continued to discuss cattle , and crops ; wars and peace ; religion and politics ; this and that ; while fleet , well-trained servers sped from the kitchen to our side with everything a person could desire , and more of it than a wise landlord might have served during those parlous times . And when the wine was brought , and the glasses and tumblers placed before us , the day had grown late , and actual darkness was not far away . My host and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daemonologia , " when he suddenly raised his hand for silence . Of course neither Tamzin or Jenkyn saw this action ; but I did , and remained still . " What ! What ! " said Sir Thomas . " I thought that I heard a call . Hark , Tamzin , if you will ? . Yes . No . Wait ! " The two lackeys at the buffet stood like statues ; and the pretty girl across the board gave my kinsman a look of gentle reproof , and both subsided with that  | guilty expression of people being caught whispering in church . Of course I listened , although I did not know just what I was expected to hear ? or why . We all listened , I suppose ; and then I thought I heard a faint , far-off " Yoo-hoo ! " sound on the evening air . And , yes ! That was what our host had detected , or the clatter of a cantering horse , which grew louder each second . Sir Thomas Warren 's ears were remarkably keen still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just this . The serving men looked at each other , and smiled . Then I heard hurried step in the hall , and the opening of the great door , simultaneously with a " Yoo-hoo ! " directly beneath the window ; and the clatter of a restless horse reined in before the block . We all looked expectantly at the dining room door . I think , too , that we all must have risen . I know that later I found myself upon my feet , so I must have gotten off my chair . There was a quick , firm step in the entry ; the dining room door flew back ; and Sir Thomas held out his hand to a vision in Lincoln green , saying : " Gentlemen ; my younger daughter , Sylvia . " And ? It was she !  | Chapter IX SYLVIA IT WAS , of course , Sir Thomas Warren who had said : " My younger daughter , Sylvia . " It was he , because no one else there could have made such an introduction ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and about the same subject ; and I could not deny that he , having completed the presentation with a flourish , reseated himself , filled my glass again , and continued on the subject of the " Dxrnonologia . " As a matter of fact , he probably did just this ; but his words simply drifted lazily up to the clouds on which I seemed to be sailing ; and if I dropped him an answer it was done without consciousness . When I beheld her I know I became gently vacuous . When I took her hand , my heart turned somersaults . When I heard her voice , I felt that my ears were doing what Val 's ears do when he becomes playful , and stampedes hostlers . When she said that she would not sit down at the table , but would dine later , I thought a bitter wind had blown the candles out . And when her father persuaded her to take off her hat and join us as she was , and she at length agreed , the sun climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She sat beside me , and talked ; and while I perfectly  | understood what she said , and answered with a certain amount of intelligence , a thousand thoughts to which I dare not give tongue flew through my brain and made me fear to open my lips . When she told me that she had been , since early morning , visiting a relative , Master Roland Warren , who lived a short ride away , I asked if she had enjoyed the day . Actually , in my heart , I begged that she might let me humbly adore her ; but she did not know that . Then she went on to say that , having a strange presentiment that she should return to Parleigh , she had hurried home , although she had been expected to remain for the night at her cousin 's ; I answered that it was a most fortunate premonition for us . What I really asked was if , providing I never spoke to any other woman as long as I lived , I might in some dim future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward me , and a sweet brown curl fell from its binding to caress her cheek , she asked my pardon for not being better groomed to welcome our arrival . Had I been the sole owner of Worcester at the moment , I would gladly have given her the entire shire to be allowed to tenderly replace that tumbled tress , which she thrust back among its fellows with a thoughtless band . And further , I would have considered I had made a remarkable bargain . Mistress Sylvia Warren , being an extremely healthy , outdoor sort of person , and having just returned from an invigorating canter of some miles , revealed a hearty  | appetite , and we all remained about the table to keep her company . Her father , naturally , continued to converse with me , but I had already done my good part for Jenkyn , and now he must do as much in turn for me . And nobly he rose to the occasion . I have already said , I think , that my kinsman had a talent for delineation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gentleman hanging on each successive word . One of these he told evidently had a humorous twist , for I heard Tamzin laughing ; and the old knight became absolutely apoplectic , and tweaked me by the sleeve to better vent his mirth . I joined with them all in the heartiest amusement I could muster , but they might have been laughing at me , for all I knew to the contrary . In fact , there was likely nothing ever at that table one half as worthy of mirth as was I. And I had just been imploring this fair creature at my side to let me die for her in some heroic pose . But only spoken to my inmost soul , of course ; for , openly , I talked of dogs , of dancing , summer games , and song . Just once I came to earth enough to answer , the question being put direct to me , of some affairs at Overmead regarding which poor Jenkyn would not dare commit himself . We three men , then , conversed for a moment or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , my eyes were still held prisoner ; and I clearly saw Tamzin , by her cherry lips and highraised brows , dispatch a silent message of great im-  | portance to Sylvia , who palpably returned an answering glance . When we had risen from the table , we went upon a stone piazza under the southern wall . There seats were brought , and the dusk having gathered , Long Jenkyn strummed a borrowed lute , and sang , much to our joint delight . A bright moon lifted beyond far wooded hills , and night birds trilled a mellow obligato ; crickets chirped to the rhythm of his melodies , and the scent of flowers blended with his voice . Sylvia left me , to change her green habit , and after what seemed a century , returned in a clinging gown of silver sheen whose low-cut bodice let the moon 's wan beams nestle in tender lustre on her satin skin . We sat together , wrapped in the calm of night . I drank her presence in , thrilled with the cadence of her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breathed deep the perfume of her shadowed hair . Oh , subtle witchery of youth , and love , and tinted dusk ! Here 's necromancy all clean hearts should foster ! Sir Thomas , in his comfortable chair , snored blissfully after his too hearty meal . Jenkyn , his lute now laid aside , whispered with Tamzin under an arched trellis of nodding mossrose blooms . A gravel path , edged with box and ivy , drew Sylvia and me to pace the dainty garden , her arm in mine lest in the dark she stumble . We talked . Of what , I do not know . And all too soon , although some hours had flown , the  | voice of her father was heard calling us back . Then my cousin and I were forced to say " Good night " to these siren sisters ; and after many sighs , depart ourselves for rest . Upon the morning of our second day at Parleigh , the dawn promised fair , and Sylvia and I went for a ride after breaking our fast . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode ; peasants doffing their hats to us in smiling salutation , and laborers in the fields waving their forks and hoes , shouted a greeting as we cantered by . Everywhere Sylvia was recognized and welcomed with devotion . Better known over the region than her sister Tamzin , who was less of an equestrienne and more of a homebody , she represented to the eyes and the hearts of all Parleigh everything good and kind at the Manor House . Over the lanes and meadows we sped , she in her Lincoln green riding gown , and brave with a golden buckle and feather . I in the best I could gather , though finer mounted than any man within many leagues , with Valentine between my knees . Finally , by some odd chance , we found ourselves ringing hollow over that little rustic bridge where first her glance had touched on mine ; so we drew rein , and she looked about at the beauties of the verdant wood and the wavering mirror of the flowing stream below . As for me , such charms were but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant close to my side .  | The spot had such kindly recollection for me , and , I hoped , for Sylvia , that we were loath to go . I tried to make her look into my eyes , as on the first time I had seen her here , and thus convey to her the feelings which were welling in my heart . But , though she did not avoid , she did not encourage me ; and I was in too much awe of her sweetness , and too abashed by my own temerity in aspiring to anyone so adorable , to otherwise admit my love . Just as we were about to ride on , however , she confided in me that she , together with her sister , shared a secret . It was , she explained , of many years ' standing , and dealt with a little cottage hid in the enchanting woods there , now long forgot by all but they alone . Asking if I would be interested in seeing the place , I of course agreed , and we pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high for the horses to tread easily . There we tied them , and making our way over a scarcely apparent path , not without difficulty , and some scratches from clinging vines and boscage , came finally to a tiny dell , twilit even at this hour of morn with interlacing trees which grew upon the surrounding slopes . Down a mossy bank we slid , hand in hand , and along beside a tumbling rill ; to find a one-roomed cottage , straw-thatched , nestling by the water . Stone were the walls , and stanch its oaken door . A key for the well-oiled lock was found , concealed beneath the overhanging thatch . I turned the bolt , and must needs stoop my head to go beneath the lintel of the door . Sylvia followed , and we stood in the neatest and smallest home that ever was devised for human habitation . One window , but the size of a single pane , gave shadowed lumination to the room . A chimney place , which occupied the entire side of the apartment , gave promise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little cupboard held a mug or two , some plates , and other gear for hungry diners . While a rustic cot and a single stool invited rest . My love , with a proprietary air , opened a candlebox , and produced a tallow dip . With some effort I struck a flint for a flame ; and from that to some sticks on the hearth we kindled a cheery glow . Then Sylvia took an apple from the windowledge , thrust it through with a stick , and bidding me hold it carefully until she was prepared to officiate , she removed her hat , tucked up her long riding habit , and went out to the brook to wash her hands . I watched her from the door as she bent above the singing waters , and could have sung with delight myself at the near , dear presence of her . And then the summer clouds , jealous doubtless that she should twine her white fingers in that plashing rill , sent forth a sharp shower , which made her hurry back into the cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat upon the low stool before the great fireplace , in the front of which was dancing the little fire ; and  |  | holding the apple by its pine spit near the flame , she roasted it thoroughly ? too thoroughly , doubtless , although anything she did I thought was perfection itself ? while we talked . I sat beside her on the floor , drinking in the perfume of her presence ; drawing closer to her side as she talked ; guiltily moving away again , lest she notice , and object . When I rose to do her bidding , which was not often , I managed to touch her dress with reverent fingers ; and more than once , as I bent over her , an immoderate longing came to me to stoop , and press my yearning lips among her thick brown curls . The delirious ecstasy of such a delectable contact made my cheeks burn redder than the apple she was roasting , if only in contemplation ; and I hastily reseated myself at her side , and bade my heart subside . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England than sat by my Sylvia 's side that morning ; but there was not a more ardent one , I am certain ; and no fairer or more worthy subject for adoration than was she . Of all my placid life up to that time , this , then , was my most thrilling hour ; and the memory of it lingers ' round me like exquisite music , and the mingled redolence of rose-leaves and of rain . Sylvia told me of the tiny cottage , and of how she and Tamzin had become its sole possessors . It seemed that it had once , a long time ago , belonged to an aged crone who took great pride in it , keeping it neat and clean . There , often , hunting parties from the Manor  | House would ride along this dell with hawk and spear ; for in those far-off days a road wound through the forest by this brook . One day , so it seems , the then Master of Parleigh ? whose name Sylvia had forgotten ? rode by this cot with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud dame whom he trusted shortly to take to wife . With his riding crop the great lord beat upon the lowly door , and in imperious note ordered that cool water should be brought , that his ladylove might quench her thirst . At this the old dame came forth , trembling , with a clean pewter cup ; and dipping it in the sparkling stream , bore it to my lady . Now the aged owner of the little nest feared greatly the Master of Parleigh for his cruel heart , as did all men ; so , as she reached the vessel up to the haughty dame upon her Spanish genet , the withered hand shook and the beaker was upset , the water falling on my lady 's gown . In a rage , the Master of Parleigh struck the old crone across the face with his whip ; and she , emboldened by the lash , swore that no wedding or ring would bind these two whilst the dancing rill splashed by her humble door . What she said was true ; for the lady was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked passion ; and she put him off with words for many days , and finally would see him no more . Then he remembered the old woman 's prophecy , and had her  | hanged for a witch . And later he came alone , at night , with a torch in his hand , and set flame to the oaken door , that the curse the dead woman had uttered would be lifted . But so Sylvia told me , that when he put the blaze to the ancient wood the dancing rill rose like great torrent about him , drowning out the fire he had set , and near drowning the Master of Parleigh as well . And as often as he strove to reduce the cottage , or dam the stream , just so often was he worsted ; until he died , an unwed , childless man ? and the little rill laughed loud and long on its journey through the dell . Now the people about feared this cottage , lest they too might meet the spirit of the old witch , or be snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road was forsaken , and finally overgrown with weeds and brambles until it disappeared . But Sylvia and Tamzin had found it ; and being little children , with no knowledge of the witch and her curse , had followed its devious windings until , unafraid , they had come to the cottage and claimed it ever after for their own . And they had held their knowledge of it secret , yet used it often as a rendezvous ; and none other had ever , to their knowing , come before this door . The rain had ceased , yet still we lingered . The fire had smouldered to a tiny ash , and three burnt apples I had eaten , and thought them most delectable because her hands had touched them . Close by her side I rested ,  | and once when she stooped toward me in the telling of the tale , I felt her perfumed breath upon my cheek . And when we finally rose , and locked that charred , en- / chanted door again , I felt perhaps there was an actual fairyland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinge , could open to me all my heart 's desire .  | Chapter X SYLVIA ! SYLVIA ! SYLVIA ! rx THOMAS was a good landlord in many ways , but he as of that nature often found among men who had served and suffered in the army of the King : querulous and domineering ; short and curt in speech with inferiors ; and his duties as a magistrate were not always settled to the satisfaction of all parties . This came home to me decisively as I sat at his hearings one morning . I had heard many cases pleaded at Overmead , where my own father seemed to possess that rare faculty of placing himself entirely in the position of the petitioner , the defendant , or even the criminal ; and after weighing the case from their prospective , could then rise firmly to the judgment , having ? as it were ? read their hearts . At times I could see that Sir Thomas doubted his own discrimination , thus giving rise to doubts in others . Sir Philip Scot was slow to decide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his word was law indeed , and none dare question it . The result at Parleigh was what one might expect under these conditions . Many cases in the neighborhood were disposed of in short , too short , order ; and then returned again and again for reconsideration and adjustment ; until there was an unending line of pe-  | titions to scan and ponder . At Overmead , time was taken over each solicitation ; and the matter was settled to the satisfaction of all , and heard of no more . A case which made me increase my respect for my f father ? if such were possible ? had arisen not long before this journey ; and was later paralleled during my stay at Parleigh . At the former hearing , a man , the renter of a small farm , was apprehended in the act of stealing some fruit from the . adjoining husbandman ; and the latter had him before my father for theft . The man who stole he had been caught in the act ? admitted the pilfering , but pleaded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his own orchard had not borne sufficient crop . The matter seemed a simple one ; but my father , after some thought , asked the wronged man to place a value on what was taken . On his mentioning a sum , the two were told to step aside , and await decision . Immediate investigation was made by an overseer , and within an hour both men were called for judgment . First , my father reached into his pouch , and handed the complainant the amount of silver at which he had placed his loss . Then he demanded that the defendant should , for two hours each sunrise , aid the robbed man in his orchard . But he also demanded that the complainant should go , for the same length of time , and assist the defendant with his crop . This should continue for three months . And at the end of one year , the man who  | ! stole should bring to the Great House the exact amount from his orchard that he had taken , and present it to my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one meal a day from the Great House servants ' table . Doubtless he who had stolen was satisfied , for he was sure of enough food , and was given time to pay for his peculation . But the man who had been robbed , and brought the charge , was slow in seeing the justice of the decision . He therefore made bold to ask why he should work in the orchard of a man who had stolen from him . My father 's explanation was immediate , and concise . " A man who has a neighbor in need of food , and knows  --  or heeds ? it not , is at fault . A landlord who has a tenant in such need , and knows it not , is more at fault . Therefore , I paid you from my own purse for my dereliction . And you are the gainer ? thereby , for you asked more than the stolen fruit was worth . , Two hours each day will this man work for you ; thus you will lose nothing by the hours you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a good farmer ; his do not , therefore he needs instruction in his methods . These you will supply . If he can learn within three months , good ! You and I have made a husbandman of him , to our credit , and his profit . If he can not grasp your teaching , then I will lease his lands to another , and find him labor for which he is fitted . You have been overpaid for your loss . I will remember that if you come to me again . He , on the other hand , must repay me within a year . To your instruction I look for the fruit he brings to be as fine as that you raise . For this payment of debt I demand of him , and he had best set to it at once , for there I am firm . Now , what have either of you to criticise ? " The men went their way satisfied . If there was enmity between them over the suit , they must heal it , for work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but within a month the defendant 's orchard had improved in yield so that the servants ' table knew his family no more . Thus was Overmead enriched by a fine farm , and the little it cost to keep those needy for a few weeks was well repaid . A somewhat similar claim was made at Parleigh while I was there . I did not hear the particulars because practically none were asked . The man had stolen because he was lazy , Sir Thomas said , and should be whipped and set in the stocks . The thief 's wife , however , begged him off from punishment on the promise that the offense would not be repeated . The result was , that the complainant was not reimbursed or satisfied ; the defendant was in no way punished or helped ; and the land of Parleigh had no benefit . It was thus that the high-strung , peevish , well-meant master of Parleigh sat so often in judgment ; cloaked against draughts in the hottest days , warming his weak blood with heavy wines , and overfeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet little time enough I remained in his company when I could steal away with his youngest daughter for a ride across the fields , or a heavenly hour in some secluded corner in the Manor , where I could sit and talk with her , or merely gaze and dream . And never in the entire chronicle of Eros could have been found person more enslaved than I , or one who revealed it more , or was less conscious of the fact . From the first moment that Sylvia appeared in the early morning , until our last lingering good-night whispers on the stair , I do not think I was ever more than four feet behind her , trailing as though she led me by a leash . I have n't the faintest idea of what we talked , and I do n't believe that I made two sensible remarks in a day . She talked to me quite a little . She must have , because , after I had left Parleigh , bits and scraps of her conversation came back to me , to tighter bind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my subjugation , and amused ; but I ignored it in everybody except one : Tamzin . And that young person teased me close to exasperation . Mistress Thomasine Warren , of Parleigh Manor , was one of those diminutive blonde persons who could always manage to look perfectly innocent , slightly amazed , and demurely apologetic , all at the same time . She also had a sense of humor which seemed to have centred entirely on me , and I suffered under it until I could have smacked her soundly , and with pleasure . She and Long Jenkyn were as thick as thieves , and  | thicker . But that did not prevent her from being highly diverted and astonished at my infatuation for her sister . " Poor Dickie 1 " she used to say to me , soothingly , meeting me in the hallway . " Were you looking for Sylvia , Dickie ? " Now , as her sister was not more than a yard away from her , this was both ridiculous and embarrassing ; and I resented it . I tried to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would arch her brows in thoughtful amazement , and seemed uncertain who I might mean by Jenkyn . Then she would suddenly take my hand , gently , and stroke it , and say : " Never mind , Dickie dear . You 'll be all right after a time . " Which I neither understood nor thought maidenly . Once , as she came down the stair to dinner , I saw she had dressed her hair in , to me , a very exotic fashion . And thinking I might disconcert her , I said : " Tommy , are you gotten up so , that Jenkyn may love you ? " " Yes , Dickie , " she answered , in a half-frightened , half-confidential whisper , taking my hand in both of hers . " Yes . I want him to love me . I want you to love me . I want all men , and women , and children to love me . Dickie , I want horses and dogs , and animals and birds , and everything to love me . Ever since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me ? ex-  | cept snakes . Will you please love me , Dickie ? Plee ; uze do , Dickie ! And she arched her brows , and pouted , and looked so innocent and cute that I could have spanked her . Just then Jenkyn Wyrrall came striding along , and she called to him . " Oh , Jenkyn ! Dickie is going to try to love me . Will you try too , Jenkyn ? Plee  --  uze do ! " And my kinsman said he would take the matter under consideration ; and they walked away , arm in arm . I never could get anywhere with Tamzin . But then , I only wanted to get somewhere with Sylvia , and I did n't seem any too successful . I was so terribly jealous , too . If she had taken Jenkyn 's hand , like Tamzin took mine , he would have had to fight me to the death . And sometimes , although not often , she spoke of other men , whom , of course , I did not know : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced with ; or met at her Cousin Roland Warren 's home . And if my wish had carried the power of complete and instant dissolution , there would have been frightful mortality among a widely separated group of young gentlemen who were only some casually mentioned names to me . But Sylvia never talked thus to pain me . Indeed she was always kindly , and friendly . Never coy or cold ; but invariably gently reserved , and with a tiny smile of wistful amusement when my ardor grew pronounced .  | She , too , resented her sister 's teasing mockery ; and more than once I saw her blush beneath the golden tint of sunburn , and drop her deep blue eyes , when Tamzin laughed at her across the table . One , two , three , four days , Jenkyn and I lingered here ; and late that night , when all but he and I were asleep , he came tapping at my door , and entered for a private word . " Are you enjoying your stay at Parleigh , Richard ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can not go on forever . We should have gone after the first day . Now it is too late to visit your grandsire 's tomb ; for if we do not hurry back to Overmead , your mother will begin to worry over our delay . " " We could dispatch a messenger . " " We could , but we wo n't . We will carry our own tale back to Suffolk . It would be an ill thing for us to wear out our welcome , Richard . So to-morrow we must say Adieu , ' and leave not later than the dawn of the following day . Do you agree ? " " I must admit I think you right ; but it will be hard parting for me . " " And I , too , would gladly stay on ; but it can not be . I will tell Sir Thomas in the morning , then . " Everyone at Parleigh was kind enough to express deep regret at our coming departure ; although their combined dejection was but a rushlight to the sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must part from Sylvia . That evening , the last I was to spend at Parleigh , Tamzin and Jenkyn sat again beneath the rose arbor , while my love and I strolled the hedged garden ; resting for a moment or two upon one of the stone benches , then restlessly moving on between beds of summer flowers that made the starlit night gorgeous with multifarious fragrance . We did not talk , but merely murmured little broken sentences , in which no word of love was said , yet in my heart no other word was heeded . Love ! It bound me to her like a golden chain , each strand of which wrapped ' round my soul in memory , each link of which was forged by some dear charm . The perfume of her sun-kissed flesh , the empyrean azure of her languorous eyes ; the sweet inducement of her generous mouth , the heavy curtain of her chestnut hair ; each curl a provocation ; the lithesome beauty of her pliant body curved in adorable promise . The gentle lightness of her disposition ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in inherence rather than through ignorance ; and that superlative yet indescribable attribute which , when she had bound me to her with unshatterable ties , still held me from the sacred circle of her arms , because I was not worthy . We stood in the star-strewn dusk to say farewell ' ; and the soft night wind wrapped the gloom about us , like a sable cloak . In actual words I did not tell to  | Sylvia that I loved her more than anything on earth . Perhaps she knew . Perhaps she heard the melody that my heart was singing . It may have been the fragrance of the flowers , the mocking sweetness of a night-bird 's call . It may have been the rising moon shed on me some fair phase of lunacy ; or was it merely youth ? untamed and irresistible ? which spurred me with a goad of Cupid 's making . But suddenly my arms were ' round my love . Her breath like redolent wine was on my mouth . Her tempting body , crushed in my great strength , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that wealth of honeyed hair ? upon her brow , her tight-closed eyelids , mantled cheeks and cool pale throat I pressed my lips . And while time ceased , and the whirling worlds paused in their flight to sigh with envy and with jealous longing , I stood with Sylvia clasped in close embrace . How long , I do not know . Love held back Time , warding aside the scythe which severs blissful moments . My love made no resistance , nor concurrence either . Passive she stood , bruised by my vehemence , breathless in embrace ; her head thrown back , her burning face perforce upraised , her tangled curls dripping between my avid fingers like an incensed shower . Upon her rigid lips my mouth was crushed . Inflexible beneath caress she seemed , a marble mask of sweet , unyielding firmness . And then , beneath my kiss I felt a thrilled awakening ; a melting of her lips , as of a rose-  | bud , bidden by the passion of the passing sun to blossom into chaste anbrosial flower . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and was gone ; leaving to me the happiness of memory , and of hope . And on the following dawn , Jenkyn and I rode from Parleigh , heading our mounts toward the Suffolk line .  | Chapter XI TO MY GRANDSIRE 'S TOMB AGAIN THREE MORE DAYS it took us , on two of which it poured in torrents , ere we saw the high chimneys of Overmead again . As soon as we had changed to dry apparel we met , my father and mother , Jenkyn Wyrrall and I , in my father 's study ; and there we were forced to explain , much to my mother 's disappointment and my father 's chagrin , that we had never reached Kethley and the tomb of my grandsire , at all . Had I been compelled to face out the matter alone , I think my father would have given his wrath full sway , for he had a very steadfast opinion that nothing should interfere with a purpose at hand even though it might not seem vitally important . But , fortunately , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firmness on the affair which did much to bolster my rather dampened spirits . He began by telling of our expedition with great clarity and truth : of the roads we had taken , and the various places visited . When he came to the witch-hunt at the Hunting Horn he spared them no horror nor atrocity ; and even told how I was kept from interference only by forceful measures . Through this detail my father shook his head mournfully , and my  | mother held my hand in hers and shuddered . Then he spoke of our seeing the girls in the boat , and of my accidentally , while riding alone one morning , learning of their identity . Of my call upon Sir Thomas Warren ? at the mention of whose name both my parents exclaimed with interest . He told of our cordial welcome ; of the kind regard in which the Master of Parleigh held all at Overmead ; of the beauty and charm of Sir Thomas ' two daughters ( at which I know I blushed ! ) ; and of our delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' disappointment regarding the Kethley visit was forgotten in their interest to learn all of this old friend whom years had almost effaced from their recollection . My mother had much to say regarding the charm and beauty of his long-dead wife ; and my father recalled some of their adventuring together in the wars . And then my kinsman , with a solemn wink at me , made the attractive suggestion that , if my mother and father were agreeable , we two would , in a few weeks , start out again ? possibly even accompanied by my father ? and after a short stop at Parleigh on the way ( leaving the Master of Overmead there to renew old memories , if he would decide to accompany us ) , continue to Kethley and the tomb of that grandsire which now seemed to beckon me with irresistible interest . The entire recital and proposal was a bold one , I  | felt ; for I was bashful before my parents , and reticent regarding my new-found happiness ; but now , as always , the truth were best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . Meantime Jenkyn was to remain with us ? with a short dash down to his place at Bury St. Edmunds , to see that all was well ? so that he could be on hand if the excursion eventually seemed wise to all concerned . After a visit to Jim Pruden , still bound up as to arm but growing overfat at our servants ' table , I fell back into my former routine , even to my Latin exercises . A week went by , or possibly two , and nothing yet decided regarding our return to Essex ? or , in fact , said about the entire jaunt . And then , one morning my father called me into his study , where my mother waited , and closed the door against interruption . " Richard , " said he , firmly , although he seemed to cast about in his mind for the expressions he wished to use , " I have had a talk with your cousin Jenkyn of , I may say , the frankest nature . Therefore , I believe that I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love . " I felt myself blushing to the roots of my hair , and beyond , but I had sense enough to nod my head very vigorously , and say : " Yes , sir . " " Now that is very natural , for you are a man grown ; and while your application to your books has not been everything we desired , you have come through the  | university with some credit , and have been a good and thoughtful son to your mother and me . " My mother thereupon rose from her chair briskly , and coming to me , kissed me , and then returned to her seat , wiping her eyes , all of which gave my father an opportunity to gather his ideas in order . " I do not need to tell you that you are heir to what I have , Richard ; and also to what moneys your mother possesses . The combined amount is not inconsiderable , but conditions in England are confused and restless . What the outcome will be is difficult to foresee . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ? and on mine , as long as I am spared ? to hold what we have , and guide a careful course through political intrigue . In short : you are rich to-day , and may be as poor as a church mouse to-morrow . All depends on my discernment now , and yours later . I have fought for our King , as you know . I now believe ? behind closed doors , you understand ! ? that he has gone too far , and is in the wrong . An old man may sometimes steer a middle course ; whereas a young man is generally partisan . Do you know why I mention this now ? " " No , sir . Not exactly . " " For this reason . When I married your mother she brought me little enough of sense in trading lands and bartering harvests ; but she came to Overmead with a personality which endeared my tenants to her ; which made my home happy and comfortable ; and that at-  | tracted those in high places who visited me here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is ? looms great . You have her disposition , which is well . You are much liked , and have proved yourself a man of strength and action . Mature judgment will come in time , if the right wife is chosen for your union . Now , you , of course , will tell me that this maid you have already selected has every attribute desired . That is natural , but it is not necessarily true . I know only good of Sir Thomas Warren , but over thirty years have gone since we campaigned together . A man may change much in that time . Thus , I have , with your mother , come to a decision in this affair . " " But ? " said I. " Just a moment , " continued my father , while my mother tapped my hand gently to take heed . " We have talked the matter through . Jenkyn Wyrrall 's thought that I visit Parleigh has some merit , but not enough . Your mother is the one to judge the maid , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught by a pretty face , indeed ! Therefore , be prepared in two weeks ' time to ride again with Jenkyn to Essex ; stop for a day or two ? not longer ! ? with Sir Thomas , and give him our most pressing invitation to make us here a fortnight 's visit with his two daughters . Then go on to Kethley ; and on your return from your grandsire 's resting place , stop at Parleigh and escort the family hither for a stay . Does this plan meet with your approval ? "  | " Yes , in every way .. And when you meet Sylvia , and you and mother know her , you will agree with me that ? " My father raised his hand in protest . " Spare me , " he said , with a smile . " I have listened to the heretofore calm and unemotional Jenkyn rave upon his Thomasine . Do not , I beg you , prejudice our minds against Sylvia with lengthy eulogies ere we may meet and form an unbiased opinion . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well . " " Except for one thing , " said I , blushing again . " While I ? I love this girl very deeply and sincerely , I have not mentioned the fact to her , or to her father ; and it occurs to me that it might seem strange that , without that knowledge ? " " Richard , " said my father , cutting me short again ; " Jenkyn Wyrrall knew that you were so far gone in love that you were well nigh helpless . Your mother knew it after a two-minute conversation with you , on your return . I knew it , and I am less susceptible to such impressions than most . I will wager that Val knew it , and stands chuckling in his stall . Now , Sir Thomas Warren is not so stupid that , with two daughters being hounded by you and Jenkyn , he would not recognize your evident symptoms . As for the maid herself , if she is still in doubt as to your desires , she should be placed either in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning for two hours , with a withered rose clasped in your hands , and although  | Nathan Knapp four times called you to have a bout of foils , you never heard a word , nor moved , except to sigh . Nathan knows it too , no doubt . " " I do n't care , " said I , " if the whole world knows it ! " " Quite right , " said my mother . " Providing she is worthy of such love . " " She is . " I answered . " She ? " " We will judge , " said my father . And the interview ended . That afternoon , sitting in the shade of the willows by the river , Jenkyn and I had a lengthy conversation . He was entirely in accord with my parents , and thought that their plan was splendid . " Jenkyn , " I asked , thoughtfully , after we had talked a while , " do you think that Sylvia could ever come to love me ? " " Why , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . And I am sure that Tommy does ; and I would say , off hand , that you are really a very lovable fellow altogether . " " Yes ; but you only say that to tease me . " " No , not at all . Listen ! Who was it that set Robin to bring you to Parleigh , think you ? " " Why , I really never thought . " " Well , I did . And I hoped it was Tommy , but it was n't . It was Sylvia . Tommy said so . " " Why did she do it ? "  | " Why ? Because you must have some devilish attraction for women ; for Tommy said that ? " " Tommy ? " " Tamzin . She likes me to call her Tommy . Well , Tommy said that just the one glimpse Sylvia had of you on the bridge made her thrill all over . And she knew , Tommy said , that you would be back again ? because you told her with your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " You could hardly expect that , Dick . " " N ? o . But , maybe she did n't do it at all . Maybe Tamzin did it , because she liked you . How do you know that ? " " I tell you that I hoped that was the case , and I asked her . But , no . I evidently lack your glamorous charm , somehow . It was Sylvia . And she sat in that boat from dawn on that morning , waiting for you . She told her father that she was going to visit her cousin , Roland Warren , so he would n't suspect she had gone mad . " " But she was n't there when I got to the bridge . " " Yes she was . She saw you riding toward her , over the meadows , and she got panicstricken , I suppose . Anyway , she hailed Robin the Shepherd , who was coming by , and told him to take you to the house , to Tommy . Sylvia knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She only had a second to explain to Robin , naturally , and he  | was too stupid to understand anything except that he was to take you , dead or alive . Tommy knew she was waiting there ; and when she saw Robin bringing you in to her father , she nearly died right there . And Sylvia , who is a terrible plotter , got frightened herself , and rode at top speed to Roland Warren 's home ; and then was afraid to come back . " " Well , I 'm glad she did come , eventually . " " Yes ; but think of Tommy 's feelings when she heard her sister yoo-hooing ' in the driveway , and you and I calmly sitting at the table , and no chance to let Sylvia know what had happened . She told me that if she lived a million years , that will be the most exciting meal she ever sat down to . " " And you really ? now , honestly , Jenkyn ? think I have a chance with Sylvia ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait a moment ! I am not asking you what Tommy thinks . I am asking you if you think I ? " " It is n't the least use , my son . I only think what Tommy thinks , now . From the first instant I saw her I merely became a dim reflection of Mistress Thomasine Warren , of Parleigh Hall , Essex . Jenkyn Wyrrall , of Bury St. Edmunds , Suffolk , Gentleman , has simply been absorbed . " " But you do n't think , " I asked , after some thought , " that it was wise of Sylvia to do what she did ; about Robin and me , I mean ? Do you think it was just ? just well bred , Jenkyn ? "  | " Tommy says ? " my cousin began ; and then suddenly clapped both hands over his mouth , and looked at me in awe . Shaking his head in rueful astonishment , he eventually began again . " Jenkyn Wyrrall thinks that it was simple for Sylvia to act so . No ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigiously silly . Just as silly as for you to think that her eyes had spoken to yours . Just as silly as your return to the bridge . It was silly of us to go to Parleigh at all . Silly to even notice the girls in the boat . And the silliest thing is , that I , Jenkyn Wyrrall , kissed Tommy 's hands as we sat beneath the rose arbor the night before we left ; and that when she cried ? for some silly reason which I could n't understand ? I kissed her tears away , and promised to come back soon , to do the same silly thing again . " " Did you really kiss her , Jenkyn ? " " Yes , really . Silly , was n't it ? The silliest , and the dearest , and the most heavenly beautiful thing I ever did in my life , Dick . And silly little Tommy let me do it . Hark ! I am absolutely through with wisdom . You may plan your life , and prepare for your future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet the whole structure topples and blows away , with you left in the ruins . Dick , for a while at least , I am going to stick to being silly . I have ordered four new doublets , a half score cambric shirts , and some bright-colored silken hose . Silly I call it ! I 've ordered my house over at Bury cleaned , and dressed , and deco-  | rated in the most idiotic style . I have ordered some foolish new furnishings for the rooms ; and crazy curtains , and nonsensical tapestries ; and my man is looking for two new brainless horses to add to those I already own . And all of this demented action is due entirely to the silly fact that we return to Essex in two weeks ' time . " " Jenkyn ! " I cried , in excitement . " You 're going back to Parleigh to get Tommy  --  and marry her ! " My cousin drew himself up with a frown , and replied with dignity . " Richard ; I am returning to Essex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomb of my grandsire ! "  | Chapter XII THE GIRL WITH THE ORANGE-RED HAIR To JENKYN 'S FOUR NEW DOUBLETS , I ordered me six ; and against his bright-colored hose , I bought brighter . Also shirts , and waistcoats , and chains and bands , and none of them suited me for two minutes together , and I would have thrown all away and purchased others , except my father put his foot down , and claimed I was tricked out finer than he had ever been in his life , and better than my station , and his means , might warrant . Well , years having gone and ages passed away , finally the two weeks of waiting were over , and we were ready for the road again . Everything was new about me , save Valentine ; and his coat was curried and his hooves oiled until he became insufferable with pride , and needed the switch with regularity . Jenkyn had a different mount , a few hands higher than the one he had ridden before ; and black , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , probably , he was named Hope . Also , our retinue consisted of two body servants ; Jim Pruden , with his arm still bound ; and Nathan Knapp , garrulous , but a good man in a pinch with steel or dag . The domestic servants must have gathered from our preparations the nature of the business on foot , and were out in force to give us a rousing cheer at departure . A little miss of four , with long curls and a frightened lisp , presented me with a bunch of orange blossoms , and a worn shoe was tossed after Jenkyn for luck . The fact that the throwing of this propitious symbol so scared Jenkyn 's new horse that he almost jumped over a six-foot hedge in no way dampened the enthusiasm of the group , and we certainly departed amid high hopes and with the best of good wishes . We were naturally anxious to reach Parleigh promptly , and spared our cattle little ; thus , early on the third day we expected to greet the objects of our respective adoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed our better judgment to be swayed by Nathan Knapp , to whom all roads about Parleigh were , according to him , an open book . At a fork , where we would have turned to the left , he scoffed at our direction , and insisted that the right road would cut a good league from our journey . Now I knew that the left lane would eventually take us to that enchanting wood with the rustic bridge , but a summer storm was pending , and , after all , the Manor itself was the place where we wished to arrive . So we followed his advice ; and having ridden twice as far as would have taken us to that lazy stream among the trees , suddenly , and without warning , we were dumped down at the door of the Hunting Horn Inn . Of course Nathan Knapp had ten reasons why this  |  | had happened , including one or two that were almost plausible ; but as it was now close to the hour of noon , we decided it were better to dine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we both knew well . So we sent the two servants into the ordinary , where we could hear them immediately calling for beer , and ordered our own dinner to be served on a small covered porch at the north end of the building , where it was shaded by great oaks and elms . The fare being good , and our appetites congenial , we were soon doing justice to the viands ; and the fact that we did not occupy this rather sequestered porch alone , but that a lady sat at a table at the other end of the lattice , made no impression on me , particularly with my back toward her . In fact , it came as a complete surprise when , after we had satisfied our hunger , and were quaffing the last of our ale , I felt a small hand upon my sleeve , and heard a woman 's voice in my ear . Jenkyn , however , had noticed her approach , and was already on his feet with a bow . Naturally he did not recognize her ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust back the hood of her cloak and revealed herself as the orange-haired girl who had accompanied the witchfinders ' band . " Master Richard Scot ? " she inquired . Her voice was deep and husky , and the same perfume that I remembered from the day when she combed back my tangled hair at the smithy , cloyed about me like a voluptuous miasma .  | " I am he , " said I , rising slowly . " May I speak with you alone ? " She smiled as she said this , with no show of mirth or good feeling , but simply as a facial gesture with which it was her custum to approach all men ; and as her wide , well-shaped mouth opened it revealed her thirty-two even , glistening-white teeth , just as a friendly dog does ? or a vicious wolf . I must confess that there was something about this woman which held a sort of evil fascination , and an unholy fear , for me ; and I had no desire ? in fact I had a strong disinclination ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long in making reply , that she asked the favor again : " May I speak with you alone ? " " I have no secret , " I answered , slowly , " from my traveling companion . In fact , I would prefer he would be present at any interview  --  madam . " She bowed , showing no expression of any kind at my refusal , and seated herself at our table ; at which I also sat , and motioned my cousin to do likewise , which , after a slight embarrassment , he did . " You know that my name is Richard Scot ; and that I am from Overmead . May I know your name , please ; and then your purpose ? " " My name is Mattison . Sibyl Mattison ; and I am of Wenham . You remember me , I see . " " Yes . You were of Hopkins ' , the witchfinder 's , party . What may I do for you ? "  | " It is possible , " she replied , " that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say that she actually asked a question , but at least she implied that I answer " yes , " or " no . " I decided to do neither , and looked her firmly in the eyes as I asked , " Where ? " " Parleigh Manor , " she repeated ; and looked back at me with a steadiness that nothing would make flinch . " Why do you ask that ? " " Because , " she responded , with the same mirthless smile , " because I wished to know . " " I fail to see what possible difference my destination might mean to you , regardless of where I go . " She laughed now , with an attractive husky catch in the sound . " It does n't ! " she said . " It makes no difference to me if you go there , or elsewhere , or nowhere . But it makes a vast difference to you . " " To me ? " " Yes . To you ? and any who go there with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I ask you a question , Mistress Mattison ? " said my kinsman in his calm , deep , courteous voice . " You may ask , " she responded , and flashed her vulpine smile at him . " Do you imply that there is danger for either my friend or myself waiting at Parleigh ? " " Yes , " she nodded . " Great danger . " " For us ? "  | " Yes . " " And for the Master of Parleigh and his family , too ? " " It was only of you I was speaking . Of Master Richard , here , and any who went with him . As for the people of Parleigh , it is too late to warn them , now . " " The witchfinders are already there ? " I asked , rising . " For several days past . The time for haste is over . Be warned . Stay away . " I reseated myself , and for a long moment we looked at each other ; the orange-haired girl apparently studying first my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me this ? " I blurted suddenly . " I saw you wrestle at Overmead . You are a strong , fearless , boyish fellow . I liked you then . I like you now . I would not see you come to harm . That 's all . " " And you warn me against your own friends ? " " Friendships , even of long standing and close association , may be broken , " she replied ; with some bitterness , I thought . " You are no longer an intimate of Matthew Hopkins , I then ? " said Jenkyn . " I never was , " she answered , with some heat . " Hopkins is a fool , and can burn , for me ! " " Still , you are not far behind them , " he said . " No , " she said , picking at the tablecloth , as though , somehow , the implication did not please her . " No ;  | I am not far away . Within call , you see . And they will call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their game , and win it . But he will call for me ere all 's done . We 'll see ! " " And meantime , you warn us to remain away from Parleigh ? " " Aye " " For our own safety 's sake ? " " For naught else . " " And did you think that I would heed your warning ? " I asked , indignantly . She laughed her soft , barklike laugh again . " I can only warn . I can not make you heed your risk . " " Hah ! " ejaculated I. " Have you done , madam ? " " It is evidently useless to say further . " " If , with the household at Parleigh in danger , you expect me to run back to Overmead , madam , you have misguessed me sadly . If that is all ? ? " And I rose . " Yes ; that is all . God save you , Master Scot . " She bowed to Jenkyn , replaced her hood , took a few steps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Richard , " she said , with that wolfish smile , " it is possible you will find me here . " " And why should I want you , madam ? " " Well , " she answered , while her smile deepened , " I am not unattractive . " And with that she entered the Hunting Horn .  | Chapter XIII I PART WITH JENKYN WYRRALL I ENTERED the Hunting Horn , and with some bustle , and the aid of Nathan Knapp , gathered my traveling gear promptly together . Then I sent him to the stable for Val , and told him to be ready to leave at once . Both Jim and Nathan had made a hearty meal , and probably would have relished an hour 's sleep in the shade ; but we must be off at the earliest moment , if only to spite that Sibyl Mattison , and her threat of danger . When all was in readiness , I looked about for Jenkyn ; and for five and forty long minutes I searched , to eventually find him seated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green where we had seen the witch trial a few weeks before . Just the memory of that horrible travesty made my blood boil ; and when I thought that these same fiends were at Parleigh , and that even Sylvia might be subject to their hideous orgies of bestiality , I was in a frenzy to rush to her ; and my kinsman 's seeming indifference was like a thrust at love itself . " We must go ! " I said , angrily . " I have looked for you everywhere , Jenkyn . " " Not everywhere , " he answered , easily , " or surely ,  | you would have found me . Now , where do we go in such a bother ? " " Go ? To Parleigh Manor , of course . We should have been there by noon ; and now that is a good two hours gone . " " Let us first sit down , and consider . " " What ! " I cried . " Consider , when Sir Thomas , and his two daughters are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one consideration : how quickly I may reach their side ! " " The war cry of the Scots is Avarit , ' is it not ? " " It is . You know that well . " " That of the Wyrralls is on their bearings : Fortitudine et Prudentia , ' " he said thoughtfully . " I am not at all certain that rushing post haste to the Manor is the best thing we can do . " " Why ? " " I am not yet certain ; which is why I desire time to consider . It will be unquestionably dangerous , for one thing , if we attempt to interfere with Hopkins and his party . " " Or in other words : the Prudentia ' of your motto has overcome its Fortitudine . ' " " It is always wise to be prudent , Dick . The greater the cause the greater the required discretion . You , I am afraid , do not realize the power of these witchfinders . In the first place , they have the authority of our Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they have the influence to raise and sway the people through the terrible medium of fear ; and we have but the power of reason to combat their efforts , and we are not dealing , in the main , with reasonable people . " " Have the Warrens of Parleigh lost their reason ? I had not heard . " " You know I do not mean the ruling house , Dick . But the tenantry and serfs are of a low mental grade ; more so than at Overmead ; and they are not ruled with either the strength or the justice with which you are familiar at home . " " All the more reason we should go to their aid . " " Yes ; at the proper time , and with the paramount authority . " " Where can you receive greater authority than that of the Parliament ? " " I do n't know . That is why I must consider . " " Well , I know , " said I. " And I do n't have to sit and dream about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I , and Nathan Knapp could send them all packing , if we showed a front . " " Supposing that you did best them , as far as the Manor was concerned ; they might bring a charge of witchcraft against you . What then ? " " They would not dare ! " " Oh , yes they would dare . Eleanor , Duchess of Gloucester , was so charged ; Lord Hastings , and many  | others . Who are you , that they should be afraid ? " " But those things were years ago . They do n't happen to-day . " " The ignorance of the masses has not decreased since then ; and the cruelty of the mobs is as great . You may be playing into their hands if you go . " " How ? " " I do n't know , Dick ; but there is no doubt that this orange-haired Sibyl wants you to go quickly . How do you know she was not left by Hopkins to hurry you on to Parleigh ? " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me away . " " Yes , surely . And by so doing she sent you off in haste . Think a moment , Dick . This woman saw you wrestle at Overmead . She knows that you are strong , fearless and impetuous . She claims that she is an enemy of Hopkins , although the only time you have previously seen her , they were good friends . The answer to me is obvious ; that she wants you to go to Parleigh with all speed . Now , do not pester me with queries as to why this should be , because I can not answer . I have a dog at home , Dick , and he comes of a fighting breed . He will chase another dog a mile , merely for a battle ; and if the other cur is belligerent , so much more does my dog love the fray . If I saw two other dogs fighting in the field , and I did not want my hound to join the combat , do you think I would lead  | him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bother with their quarrel ? Certainly not ! This girl has seen in you the fighting spirit . She is no fool at reading the minds of men . Am I not wise in this , at least ? " " You told me some days since , that you were through with wisdom . " " The habits of a lifetime are hard to overcome , " he responded , with a smile . " Then you remain here at the Hunting Horn ? " " At least , I will not run to Parleigh , and perhaps stick my head in a noose . " " I do think , however , that Tamzin is worth the risk . " " I do not know that she is in any danger . " " If you remain here , will you ever know ? " " I think I may learn in good time . Meantime , let us put our heads together how we may bring authority to bear upon Hopkins . " " My authority hangs here on my hip . Do you remember how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that green ? No , Jenkyn ! In three minutes I leave for Parleigh . Do you come ? " " N ? o , " said my kinsman , reflectively . " No , Dick . Here I stay for the nonce . " " You are afraid ! " I cried . " Yes , " he repeated , slowly . " I am afraid . " " Good day to you , " I responded ; and made for the door .  | " Good bye , Dick . God bless you ! " said Jenkyn , holding out his hand . " You take Nathan Knapp with you , and leave Jim Pruden with me . " " Good bye , " I answered , shaking my cousin 's hand in a sort of daze . And in less than three minutes Nathan and I were on the road to Parleigh.  | Chapter XIV I MEET MASTER HOPKINS AND MASTER STERNE WHEN AGAIN I saw the gables of Parleigh Manor glowing in the afternoon sun among the ancient oak trees , a strange feeling of foreboding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on assailed me ? of skirting the place , and never allowing my presence to be known . This I overcame only with difficulty ; but the silhouette of Nathan Knapp 's broad back , and the firm hilt of my own rapier , gave me sufficient courage to alight at the block and rap for admission . A servant in livery responded , and our mounts were taken to the stables , while we were ushered into a lower room and asked to await Sir Thomas . It might be that I am considered slow in receiving impressions which more sensitive persons respond to instantly , but from the moment the great door admitted me to Parleigh I felt myself , and the entire household , under a pall . It was as though a death had just occurred there . The shutters were drawn , the servants trod with cautious foot , and an air of gloom pervaded the mansion which I swear it had not worn a month before . The waiting was short , however , and I was bidden  | to come to Sir Thomas Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants ' quarters below . I found the Master of Parleigh in a great chair , swathed about in his heavy black cloak although the heat of the sun had made me mop my brow upon the journey hither . To my eyes he seemed to have shrunk and grown more grey , since last we met , and the scar across his cheek was like a livid flame against his pale , tired face . Yet his manner was at least as hearty for the moment as I could well expect . " Welcome , welcome , welcome ! " he cried ; not rising , but extending a cold yet eager hand . " A blessing on the day , sir , that brings you here . And never a more opportune moment was had for a visit , for a weighty question confronts us at Parleigh , and you may aid us in the best solution . Ho ! Wine and biscuits , sirrah ! Haste ! " " I trust that you and your family are in health ? " I asked , apprehensively . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely . And then , with a pathetic smile which reached no further than his blue lips ; " one can not expect too much in health from an old man , eh ? " " You surely do not refer to yourself , sir ? " " Eh , what ? ? Ah , yes . But here is wine , at last . Pour , sirrah , and serve to my guest . Well , this will warm the heart as naught else , by our Lady ! Now tell me , Robert ? "  | " Richard , sir . " " Yes , Richard . Richard , after old Richard Wyrrall , of Kethley ; and well I recall him , too . But tell me , how does your good father , and his handsome spouse ? Sprightly , I trust ; although he ages too , I doubt not . " " I came to bring to you a letter of his writing , Sir Thomas , " I said , producing my parents ' invitation for him and his daughters to Overmead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by upon the table for the nonce . So you are back at Parleigh with us once again , my bully rook . It has been a time since I saw you here before . And then , if I mind , you had a companion with you . " " Yes , " said I , " Jenkyn Wyrall , of Bury St. Edmunds ; my kinsman . " " Ah , yes . I once , in my youth , knew a certain Jenkyn Wyrall ; or perhaps it was James , not Jenkyn . No , Jenkyn it was , I am sure ; but perhaps not Wyrrall . Well , it can make no matter now , for he must be long dead . Your friend is well in health , I trust ? " " Very well , I believe . " " Ah , I wish we could say the same of Parleigh , sir . Things go sadly here . " " Your daughters are in health ? " I inquired , anxiously . Instead of making reply , he sat , fingering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was necessary to repeat the query before he roused himself to a reply .  | " Yes , " he said , finally . " My daughter Tamzin is well . It was of her that you inquired , was it not ? " " Of her , yes ; and of Mistress Sylvia . " " Yes , they are well , and dutiful . You may see them anon . But they keep much to their apartment , owing to our trouble . " " What trouble , Sir Thomas ? " With an effort he shook his lethargy from him , and laid a frail hand upon my sleeve to hold attention . " You have come , sir , in the very nick of time ; for I am beset , it seems , with a very serious menace ! " " What ? " I asked , anxiously . " Witches ! " he gasped , looking about him askance . " Witches , and warlocks , and all imps of evil ! Oh ! I thought , in my vanity , that Parleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin with which I was surrounded . I heard of- bewitchment elsewhere , and I shook my head , and said  --  like a fool  --  too bad ! Too bad ! But , thank heavens , there are none such here . Little I knew , Richard ; little I knew ! " " And you have found some in the village ? " " In the village ; in my home . Everywhere ! They spring up like the tares among the corn . They surge upon us like the waves of the sea . They are as unnumbered as the leaves of summer grass , or the sand grains of the shore ! " " Witches ? " " Aye , witches ! And I know not whom I may trust ;  | nor whom I must condemn . " The poor knight paused , as though in his consternation he had said too much to even me ; and then he sank back weakly in his chair , and essayed to draw closer his dark mantle over his shrinking form . I was a young man then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow in the wake of superannuation and anxiety , and I sat appalled at the mental and physical decrepitude of this man I had left in comparative health but a few weeks earlier . His weakness of body was piteous enough , but the groping uncertainty of his intellect was so terrifying to me that I could have wept for him . And terrible as it was for poor Sir Thomas Warren , himself , it reflected imperilment even more sinister for his dependents . For long he sat brooding , his thin hand winding through his straggling beard ; and had I not recalled my presence to him with a word I think he would have erased me from his thoughts . " And who , may I ask , do you particularly suspect of witchcraft , Sir Thomas ? " He stirred sharply at my voice , and stared as though my coming was forgotten . Then he glanced cautiously about the room , which was dim with heavy curtained casements , and answered , in all but a whisper : " Everybody ! " " You suspect everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ? "  | " Only one , so far . But that one holds my life itself in his hands . " " Who ? " " Robin . Robin the Shepherd ! " " What ! Clumsy , stupid Robin , a witch . That seems foolish to me . " " Ah , you little know the workings of Satan , Robert ! " " Richard ! Richard , sir , of Overmead . But still , I question Robin 's guilt . And he was such a slave to Mistress Sylvia , too . " " He was . That poor , misguided child had ever sympathy for such unfortunates . And now , see you , what it has brought her to ! " " What mean you ? " " When his confession was shown her , here , in my presence , she laughed ; mocked at its import , disputed its value ; denied even ? good God ! ? that there were witches ; and charged the avowal was dragged from him through fraud ! " " Do you not think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have on this business now . This Robin confessed of his own will , voluntarily ; and would any do such evil , think you , facing for it the gallows or the stake ! No ! His guilt is not disputable . Listen ! " He turned , and fumbled among some scattered papers on a table at his elbow ; selected that which  | he wished , and read me as follows : " I , Robin the Shepherd , of Parleigh , in the shire of Essex , do make this statement of my own will , before Matthew Hopkins and Jonathan Sterne , all of Essex likewise . " And I state that the devil came to me in the form of a small black dog ; and twice in the shape of a sheep dog . This was in the night time , except once , in the morning . And again he came to me in the form of a handsome man on a horse . And he and I wrestled , and he threw me down , and I went with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it , and it went like a bird , and flew over the trees to the Edgesand church . All this was on a Friday at sundown . And we sat there ; and when it was dark we went into the church where there was a goodly company of people , some of whom I knew . And their names I shall remember , and make a tale of to Matthew Hopkins and Jonathan Sterne when they so will . " And the devil took me into the church where he blew upon the candles , which were instantly lit , until the darkness was made like day and brighter . Then we all kissed the devil 's rump over the pulpit , and promised to obey him . And his imps came and bit the legs of some , but not my legs . And he did suck my blood , and spat some of it on his hand and threw it on my head , and baptised me in the name of Hell . And we sang and danced all night .  | " Also I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a long time ago . And I have seen many people there and elsewhere . And I and they together did make certain cattle dry , and some certain persons ill and twitching , one being the son of Thomas Summers , whose kine we bewitched . " Given over my true mark this day and date , before the above mentioned . his Robin ( ) Shepherd " mark " And Robin wrote that ? " I asked , when he had finished reading . " Yes . At least , perhaps he can not read or write ; but that is his confession , taken in the gaol by Master Hopkins . " " With the aid of the thumb-screw and boot , doubtless . " " Nay , with nothing but prayer , and good Master Hopkins and his friend wresting with Satan . And the shepherd 's familiars tried to tear up the paper , but it was saved by Master Sterne . " " Of which they told you , of course . " " Of course . No one else would know , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a confession was known , this man would be torn from the gaol , and beaten to death by those he has wronged . " " How long have these men been here at Parleigh ,  | working among the tenants ? " " They came at my invitation just ten days ago . They are very powerful against the influence of evil . They are living here in the Manor . Their servants , perhaps a half score or more , are either here , or at the inn at the village . " " You pay them ? " " A trifle , but they do not work for hire , but for the country 's benefit . All they receive from me is their lodging , and twenty shillings ; and in case of proved witches , twenty shillings for each one who is convicted . " " Have you paid them anything as yet ? " Sir Thomas Warren hesitated , and shook his head . " I do not remember . Perhaps I have ; perhaps not . This matter is not to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less , must not stop me in ridding the district of this unholy menace . " He lapsed into silence again , and I saw that even the exertion of this conversation had taken much of his strength . I allowed him to rest while I thought the matter out ; and , oh how bitterly I longed for the good counsel of the laggard , Jenkyn . But I must do the best I could without him , and there was one sting in the affair which stood out like a great rock in the course of escape from this folly . " Sir Thomas ! " I called , sharply . " Eh ! What ? " Again , I believe he had forgotten my presence .  | " Sir Thomas , I beg you to answer me straightway of this : do you fear that Robin 's list of witches which he saw at the sabbath will contain the name of your daughter , Sylvia ; or that of Tamzin ? " " Good God ! " cried the bewildered and frightened knight . " Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears I have . And if such is the case , even the love that my tenants bear to all here will not save them from the ordeal , and possible death ! Witchcraft is a terrible thing ; and to deny such is to oppose Holy Writ . Yet my child , Sylvia , has in her anger at Robin 's imprisonment , done this , to my knowledge and sorrow ! " " And I doubt not that both Master Hopkins and Master Sterne are stirring up these same tenants to a pitch that nothing short of bloodletting may allay ? " " Naturally these poor people , who have suffered illness and trouble through the witches ' practice , are aroused . Can any other result be expected ? And I , myself , see no way out of the tangle with safety to both body and soul . " " Unless you can drive these witchfinders from your door , " I answered grimly . " You may be fooled , my good sir ; and you may be pinched in a cleft stick ; but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be driven back to hell itself ! " As the words burst from me I saw , on the face of my unhappy host , a change of expression for which , for  | a moment , I could not account . And then a man spoke from behind my chair , and I turned quickly toward the entrance of the apartment . " Good evening to you , gentlemen , " said an oily voice . And there , in the open doorway , stood the smiling Master Jonathan Sterne , and the pompous and puffy Master Matthew Hopkins .  | Chapter XV I TALK WITH SYLVIA AGAIN OF COURSE the two in the doorway had heard my denunciation ; and little I cared , except for its possible result to the broken man to whom I had spoken . Hopkins and his accomplice faced me : the former in apoplectic astonishment ; Sterne with a grinning mask of fulmination . Like all tyrants who domineer by dread , they were seldom in a position to hear truth spoken , and the verity of my statement stung them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " blustered the Witchfinder General , puffing and spluttering in wrath . " Are you an accessory of evil , that you defame me , sir ? " " I named you , not defamed you , " I retorted , sharply . " My purpose here is to attend this worthy gentleman against your combined persecution . " " Hell 's advocate , " sneered Sterne ; " to aid the witches of Parleigh . " " I demand an explanation , Sir Thomas , of this language ! " said Hopkins , pointing a stubby finger at the huddled figure in the chair . " I demand that you show this witch 's spawn the door , sir ! " " Call me a witch , " said I , furiously , " and I 'll splash this sword in your belly and rip you up like a bag of rotten meal ! "  | " A devilish threat ! " cried Sterne , while Matthew Hopkins retreated toward the door with pusillanimous haste . " Gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! " gasped the Master of Parleigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongues . Young man ? whatever your name is ; you mean me well , I remember . Master Hopkins , and ? and you ? you ? " He was either unable to recall who Sterne might be , or was incapable of proper articulation ; but he made a motion of reconciliation , a gesture for them to advance ; and then suddenly crumpled forward , and collapsed into complete unconsciousness . While the two others stood hesitantly by , I lifted him quickly from the great chair and laid him gently upon his bed . Fortunately I knew where , beside a window curtain , there hung a cord which communicated with a bell in the servants ' quarters . I jerked it rapidly , and a lackey came running , whom I dispatched for Sir Thomas ' daughters ; and also bade him send a horseman at a gallop for the village leech . " Get out ! " I said sharply to the two witchfinders . " Get out of this room ! " " I deny your right ? " began Hopkins ; but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hall . I slammed the door , and went down on one knee by the side of the stricken man . He was breathing noisily and his hands felt cold to my touch . Whether he was  | actually dying I was not certain , but every indication which I knew pointed to a serious seizure . I ran my hands quickly over his shrunken form , to be sure that nothing bound him tightly ; loosened his white neckband , and , moistening a cloth with wine , laid it upon his brow . I did not know what to do more , and stood uncertain , when the door opened , and Tamzin entered . " Ill ? " she asked in a whisper , accepting my presence there as though I was a permanent guest . " Yes . Senseless for the time , I believe . He collapsed in his chair . " " I 'll send for the doctor ? " " I ordered the servant to send a horseman for him before he summoned you . " She was leaning over the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she recognized me with a spot of color in each cheek . " Do n't be frightened , Sylvia , " I said , as she reached her left hand to me , her right suddenly pressed against her heart . " Your father is ill . It may not be serious . " She crossed to the opposite side of the bed , and leaning over him , said softly : " Father ! Father ! " The Master of Parleigh made no response to her word ; but his breathing seemed less labored than in the first few moments . Tamzin rang the servant 's bell , and the lackey assured her the message for the doctor was well on its way . She closed the door softly and  | leaned against the table . Sylvia meantime had seated herself on the side of the bed beside her father , and held his hand . " How did it happen ? " asked Tamzin . " An altercation between Hopkins , Sterne , and me . I think it frightened him , and he tried to pacify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble ? " " I told him these witchfinders were thieves and murderers ; and they were eavesdropping , and heard me . " Sylvia dropped her face in her hands with a frightened sob , but Tamzin squared her shoulders manfully . " They heard the truth then , did they ? Humph ! You 're a bold man , Dickie ; but we did not send for you for that . " " Send for me ? " I asked . " Yes , " answered Sylvia . " We sent a messenger for you to hurry to us . You got the summons ? " " No , " I said . " No word came to me . " " Where 's Jenkyn Wyrrall ? " asked Tamzin . I hesitated . It was impossible to say that he had held back from coming to them through too much caution . I tried not to stammer , as I answered : " Did you send for him , too ? " " Of course ! " " He will be along then , shortly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense parley ; and the doctor , a frequent caller at the Manor the past few months , tapped at the door . " Now , Mistress ; let me get to him there , if you please . Open that window , and pull back the curtains from the others , that I may see . Ah ! Hum-m-m . My assistant is in the entry , young man . Call him , please . Now I think , do n't you , that it would be better if I was left alone with the patient for the time ? " " We will remain over here by the window , and will in no way disturb you . Give all your attention to Sir Thomas , if you please ; and we will only intrude if called upon . " I dragged a small bench so that its back was toward the bed , seated the two girls on it , and took a chair facing them . " Tell me , in a few words , " I said , " just what the situation is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering her voice so that it reached our small circle alone , " these witchfinders are here to rob Parleigh . They began by stirring up the tenantry to a ferment . Then they came to the house , and are living here , and ordering everyone about , as though they were masters . " " And your father has not resented this ? " " He invited them , to begin with . Robin 's confession , and Sylvia 's condemnation of that , have given the two a whip over father . He fears the result now , but can not do anything to thwart them . "  | " Yet there must be something which can be done . " " Richard , " asked Sylvia , her hand upon my sleeve ; " did father know you when you arrived to-day ? Do not hesitate to say , no matter how painful to us . " " Yes , he knew me . At moments there was a certain vagueness ? but I would say , without doubt , that he recognized me . Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before this final break . There were times when I doubted if he actually knew Tamzin and me . " " For some days he has been calling me Katherine , " said Tamzin . " That , you know , was my mother 's name . And he has several times ordered the servants out of the room , and questioned me as to who they were . His illness is mental as well as physical . That is why we sent for you and Jenkyn . " " Do you think that either Hopkins or Sterne realize this confusion of mind ? " " I do n't know . It would seem likely , however . At least , they are the cause of it . And there is another , and more serious feature of their striving , evidently . " " Yes ? What is that ? " Both girls looked at each other , in seeming hesitation . Then Tamzin said : " You are rather a rash boy , Dickie , and I would have preferred to talk to Jenkyn on the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you must check your temper , and endeavor to act with quiet judgment ,  | if we tell you . Both of these men are showing marked partiality to Sylvia and me . The serious Master Hopkins seems to feel that I , together with my portion of the Parleigh estate , would suit him very much indeed as a matrimonial prospect ? " " What ! That beast , and ? you ! " " Now , I told you you must be careful and calm , Richard . Otherwise you will be no use to us at all . Listen ! You had not been in the house an hour when you quarrel with these men . I do n't know what the result may mean to you , but the result to my father is evident enough ; and you must let it sink deeply into your mind that both Sylvia and I may be hanged for witches ; and my father , too , for aught I know ; unless we agree to become the Mistresses Hopkins and Sterne , respectively . " " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Dickie . It is perfectly terrible , I admit ; but it is not perfectly impossible . We might be forced , through threats on my father 's life , to make sacrifices which ordinarily we would choose death ourselves to shun . That is why we sent for you and Jenkyn to aid us in our dilemma , after Roland Warren had refused his assistance . " " Roland Warren , your cousin ? " " Yes . We sent a message to him , but he ignored it . Still , no letter reached you , and it is possible that our appeal to him was never received either . "  | I made to the two a sign of silence , as I saw the doctor had left the bedside , and was advancing to speak with us . We all rose at his approach . " How is Sir Thomas ? " I asked . " Speak freely . It is best we should all know the worst . " " He is a desperately ill man , sir . The ultimate outcome of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible he may recover ; recover , that is , to a degree of health that was his before this last attack ; but even that will be more than I can definitely state at the moment . I ? " " My sister and I would prefer to learn the truth , " said Sylvia , softly . " If I knew the truth in this case , " said the doctor , gently , " I would feel it a kindness to tell you , mistress . He may recover , both in health and mind ; he may come from this coma capable of partially regaining his strength , but with his brain clouded and distraught . I think the outlook for his ever leaving the bed on which he now lies extremely poor ; but in the past he has proven himself a man of remarkable will . Time alone will answer your natural and melancholy query . Rest , and absolute freedom from exciting influences , are all that can be done ; together with the careful administration of restoratives , some of which I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will remain with him ? " " I can not at this time . But my assistant , Master  | Dodge , who is most able , will remain and instruct you as to his treatment . I will be with you , with your permission , in the morning . " We thanked this physician , who seemed most capable and sympathetic , and he departed . As we were speaking in a low tone to his colleague , Master Dodge , the patient stirred upon the bed , and we all turned instinctively toward him , with the medical assistant immediately at his side . " Katherine ! " said Sir Thomas Warren in a weak voice . " Katherine ! " Tamzin dropped on her knees at his side , and laid her golden head close to his grey face on the pillow . " Yes , " she answered ; " yes , my dear . " " I have been ill , " he said , slowly . " Yes ? I am ill . But I have been troubled by terrible dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamzin and Sylvia mean you ? " " Our little daughters ; they are safe and well ? " " Yes , perfectly safe , my dear . You have been dreaming . Do not fret of them . " " A sip of this cooling draught ? " asked the physician , leaning from the opposite side of the bed , and raising with practiced hand the sick man 's head , that he might drink . " Who is this ? " asked Sir Thomas , recoiling for an instant . " Ah , a physician ! Some evil-tasting specific , doubtless , but it may be for the best . I will drink , sir . "  | " It is not unpleasant , sir ; and will cool your parched mouth . There ! Now , rest again , and dream of more cheerful matters . " " Dreams come not to order , " said he weakly , as he sank back . " Katherine , remain , I beg of you , for a time . And who , " he asked , as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? " " Do you not know me ? " his youngest daughter asked , falling on her knees beside her sister . " Your pardon , " he answered , thickly . " But you are my dear wife 's friend . You are welcome , indeed . " Sylvia , with a stifled sob , reached out and grasped my hand , bringing me close to her side at the couch . " And do you remember this man , who is with us ? " she asked . The aged knight looked at me for some seconds with lack-luster eyes ; and then a flame kindled under his concentrated brows , and he suddenly sat erect on the bed , a white and trembling hand thrust out in my direction . " Away ! " he cried , in a powerful voice . " Go hence , despoiler of my peace , and ravager of my home ! Quit my fireside , scoundrel , ere my kinsmen slay you , as they should . Begone ! " He sank back , a baleful gleam in his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to leave the room . I turned , followed by Sir Thomas Warren 's angry glare , and walked into the hall , closing the door behind me.  | Chapter XVI I OVERHEAR A CONVERSATION THE ENTRY outside of the sickroom was empty , and I remained standing there because I hesitated to either go , or return . In a few minutes Sylvia emerged , and , finger on lip to invite silence , motioned me to follow her up the stairs . Cautiously we went , to the landing above , and down the hall to her apartment . At the door she hesitated for a moment ; then thrust a key in the lock , opened the door , and beckoned me to enter . It was a large apartment , on the south side of the building , overlooking the garden which held so many happy recollections of my former visit . Closing and bolting the door , she turned to me with a tear-stained face . " I might be criticised for bringing you here , Richard ; but there is no other place I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I would keep my voice low . Will you please take that chair there by the wall ? Do not go near the windows , or you may be seen from without . " " This , " said I , taking the indicated seat , " is most unfortunate regarding your father 's health ; but I do not doubt his rugged constitution may overcome even this seizure . Did he rest more quietly after my departure ? " " Yes . Master Dodge has given him a sleeping draught , and its effect is beginning to be apparent . Lately he has been under a terrifying strain , and I fear his mind will not quickly recover . I believe that he mistook you for one of the witchfinders . It is pathetic , but you will forgive him , under the circumstances ? " " My dear girl ! This is not a question for forgiveness ; but one for me to judge what he would have me do were he in his senses . What is your advice ? " " Remain here at Parleigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have been frightened enough with father to protect me ; and poor Tamzin and I have sat wringing our hands here , behind this bolted door , wondering why you and Jenkyn ? yes , and our Cousin Roland , delayed . It is most evident now that our letters were not delivered . " " You must remember that Hopkins demanded your father show me the door . " " What Hopkins demands is of no moment to me or Tamzin . It is true that my poor father , out of fear for the outcome , might have followed their instructions ; but if you have the courage to remain ? and I know that you have without asking ? do so , for my sake , and for Tamzin 's . " " Tell me , if you can , just what advances have been made to you ? " " It is difficult to tell you , Richard , because attitudes  |  | are puzzling to put into words ; and it has been more the conduct of these men toward us than any actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sterne has been smiling and cat-like . Purring , with a desire to touch me , whisper to me ? fawning , yet dominant . He possesses that hideous complacency of a disgusting sort of man who feels he is irresistible to women ; and he is always at my heels . If I ride , he overtakes me at the first cross-road ; if I step into the garden , he is there . I have not been able to spend five minutes alone with my father , for he would always intrude ; and insults pour off of him like water from a duck . To the servants he is haughty and insulting ? which reveals his nature ; but to me he is servile and groveling ? but always with his tongue in his cheek . He thinks that all women are fools , to be coaxed into his net at his will . And his power , coming to him through his supposed witchfinding successes , may well make him suspect that people whom he meets are , generally speaking , simpletons . " " Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct , or serious ? " " He has told me of how lonely his life is ; and yet how thrilling for any woman who would become his wife . He has dwelt on his authority and sway , which he says is greater , and less exacting , than that of the King , himself . He has also told me of the wealth he has amassed in his activities , although I question that . And he went so far as to say that he , who could  | wed any heiress in the Kingdom at a snap of his finger , thought me closer to his ideal than any he had ever met . " " No threats , I suppose ? " " Not yet . Now that you appear , they probably will come forth . " " And Tamzin ? " " Ever able to take care of such a situation better than I , Tamzin is more happily situated in being sought by Hopkins , because there is nothing insinuating about that boor . I desire to settle down , ' he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' When she diplomatically answered , But I scarcely know you , sir , ' he responded , easily , No ; nor I , you . But we will both learn in time . Meanwhile , give the matter thought , lest harm befall those you respect , mistress . ' " " If Jenkyn Wyrrall knew that he would wring his fat neck ! " " No , Richard . He would scheme to get him out and away from Parleigh , with the least harm to those here . His vengeance would wait upon his guile ; and so must yours . A strong arm is a comfort to us , and none would either of us have in place of yours ; so stay . But remember ! We three are fighting against the power invested by Parliament ; the superstitious fears of an entire district , roused to the highest pitch ; and two wretches who have cozened the people of England for several years , and laid the plans for this campaign  | long before you and I ever even met . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I will not leave you , at least . Do you think it better I remain openly ; or in secret ? " " Wait ! That is Tamzin 's step ! " And she unbolted the door to her sister , who entered after gazing hastily about the hall for eavesdroppers . " How is father ? " " Sleeping . The draught took effect almost immediately after you left . " " You stayed with him , then ? " " Yes ; but to have some further words with Master Dodge . He is a man I believe we may trust . He is frank , and does not believe that father 's mind will ever be clear again . I thought it were better to know , for if we must take all responsibility on our own shoulders , let us do so at once . It is unfortunate that Hopkins and Sterne know of his collapse , but that can not be prevented now . At least , they must not learn that he is mentally incompetent . " " Perhaps , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might ? " " Pity ! In those men ! Impossible ! And , remember , both of you , that this sudden breakdown will be attributed , by them , to witchcraft in a malignant form . It throws the game heavily into their hands , from that standpoint ; yet they may scarcely press certain other matters while he hangs between life and death . Hop-  | kins came to the room door a few moments ago , to enquire how he was . This man Dodge spoke to him and , after his conversation with me , was most circumspect . Hopkins had a paper which he wanted my father to sign , but Dodge said he was sleeping , and must not be disturbed to-day . " " What was the paper ? " I asked . " An order for ten shillings to be paid the village inn , for service to his men , so he said . He would not allow it to be seen . " " It might have been anything , " said Sylvia . " Are you sure , Tamzin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I believe so . At least , he says that this witchcraft scare is nonsense ; and that the witchfinders should be drummed out of town . He has promised to stay the night with father , and we must put faith in somebody . The servants are all too fearful of the witch talk to be dependable . " " I believe with you , Tamzin , that Dodge is to be trusted . You girls can not be with your father all the time ; and I can not help , as he , in his delirium , dreads my presence . What of my staying here at Parleigh , Tamzin ? Should I remain openly , think you ? " " Yes . Take father 's old room at the front of the house , and always be within call . Go to the table freely . If these two do not accept your presence gracefully it will not affect your appetite ; and by listening to  | them you may learn something . Did you come alone ? " " No , I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does he know how matters stand ? " " No . But he will . I think , if you let me have that room I am to occupy at once , I will have him up for a word . Is there any chance of being overheard while talking there ? " " I do n't believe so . And it is situated directly over the front entrance , so you can see who comes and goes , which may prove an advantage . You two have sat here so long in the dark that you did not , realize how late it has grown . Kindle a candle , Sylvia , and take Dickie over . He can see you back again . " Sylvia took me to the apartment , which was large , comfortably furnished , and , as her sister had said , directly over the entrance . A bell cord was revealed , which summoned a servant ; and while she ordered supper for me and Nathan sent to this room , I asked for Knapp to attend me instantly . Then I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own door . Nathan , who probably never sat to a better meal , listened long to my explanation ; and as I feared , and readily discovered , he was more of a swordsman than a strategist . " Thrust ' em through , and have done with ' em , " was his advice . " But , do n't you see , man ! We would have all of Parleigh down on us as witches . They would burn the building ! " " Let ' em , " he responded , cheerfully . " Our two mounts could outrun anything they have in their stable , easily . " At length he departed , promising he would do nothing , or say nothing , without my express permission ; and prepared to remain awake for that night , at least , within ready call . I sighed ; opened the window against the night without , blew out the taper which had illuminated the great room dimly , and sat thinking matters over , and praying that Jenkyn might trot up the path at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow from lighted windows , which touch the swaying foliage with faint illumination , faded here and there as time progressed , and the faint footsteps I could at first hear throughout the Manor gradually died and ceased . I listened for the village chime , as though I had a definite rendezvous ; and it might have been fortunate that I had not , for the sound of the village bell did not reach me clearly enough to distinguish the hour . In a while , I thought of Sir Thomas , lying there below ; and I rose and opened the door softly , and descended to the door of his room . Master Dodge was there alone , Sylvia having left him a short time before . The sick man still slept , restlessly at times , but never completely out of his trance ; and the physician thought there was  |  | no immediate danger of his death ? at least , not that night . I told him where I lodged , and he promised to send for me if there was any service I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stair , the house was perfectly silent , but I heard the clatter of a running horse , evidently approaching the Manor . At first I thought I would go , myself , to the entrance ; and then , on second thought , I returned hastily to my room , and took my watch at the window again . It was past midnight , so Dodge had told me , and the messenger must be one of importance to gallop so late . So still was the night , and so sharp had anxiety made my hearing , that I was forced to remain almost a minute at the opened casement before the rider actually reached the door . The horse must have been a good half mile from the house when I first noted his clatter . I was unable to see much , but it was evident that the horseman did not dismount , but merely reached up and struck the door a resounding blow with his whip . A few more such assaults brought a fearful response from an upper window ; and a voice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkins at the door . After considerable delay , Master Hopkins being doubtless immersed in blissful sleep , his pompous tones demanded the reason for this summons ; and though the rider replied curtly that he must come down at  | once , and hold parley , his ears were not as keen as mine , evidently , for he asked who spoke . The rider said , shortly : " Sibyl . " After a delay of five minutes , while the evidently tired horse stomped , and shook its head , and jingled its harness , the door beneath me opened , and Hopkins ' voice was heard addressing the girl . " What is the meaning of this unseemly ? " " Listen ! Did you send for Justice Johnstone to take charge of the trials here , at Parleigh ? " " Yes . Sir Thomas Warren is the sitting magistrate , but he is ill ? and there were other reasons as well . Why ? " " He is on his way . And he will bring in his train a witchfinder from London who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself ! " " What ! " said Hopkins ; and he moved down close to Sibyl Mattison , and continued the conversation in a voice so low I could not catch the words . " I know nothing of that ! " she answered , sharply . He mumbled further , and she again took him up with a short reply . " He came to the Hunting Horn . The landlord told him that I was of your party . He told me he was to meet Johnstone here . " Then , in answer to another question : " Yes ; quite familiar with the matter , I would say . He certainly did not tell me everything he knew ; but  | he said enough . I told him nothing ! Why should I ? If Johnstone joins him not to-morrow morning , he will come on alone . I thought you might be interested . Good night ! " " Wait just a moment , " he cried . And he walked forward , along the drive in the direction she was heading toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sprang from the window to the door of my room ; opened it softly , and was down the steps as noiselessly as I could make it , and out through a rear entrance toward the stables . Nathan was on the watch , and heard my rapid footsteps . Together we had a saddle on Valentine in a trice , and I was away as fast as he could take me toward the Hunting Horn .  | Chapter XVII I HOLD UP A RIDER ON THE KING 'S HIGH WAY I KEPT VAL to a good speed until I had covered at least half the distance to the Hunting Horn Inn , and then I abruptly drew rein , and turning the horse 's head , began to saunter back again toward Parleigh . So far I had overtaken no one on the way , and I certainly would have outdistanced any casual rider , so my quarry was evidently behind me . The jaunt back gave me an opportunity to wonder if anything would occur at the Manor which would necessitate my presence ; or if Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I could not be in two places at the same time , and this seemed , on the instant , the best move ? and there was no drawing back now , anyway . Then down in a lonely hollow , shaded by age-old trees , I heard the easy approach of a horse , and I pulled in under some overhanging branches , and awaited its arrival . I was not certain if this were Mistress Mattison , or no ; nor was I sure of the best method of approaching her , in this place , and at this time of night . But little enough time I had to study  | the matter , for in a moment or two the horse and muffled rider were before me . Out from the shade of the trees dashed Val , ever eager for a brush with a likely runner , and as I called ? in a voice I trusted was gentleness itself ? for the rider to pull up for a moment , for just a word with ? Crack ! And a pistol ball went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same instant my horseman gave spur , and dashed at the hill before him , as though he would fly to the top without touching earth . Instantly , without giving the matter a moment 's thought , I was after him at an even greater pace . If it was Sibyl , I would catch her well short of the inn , and make her talk to me for a minute at least ; and if it proved to be somebody who was not Sibyl ? well , he had shown poor judgment and poorer aim , and we could make a conversation out of that . So I rode at a breakneck speed , to Valentine 's intense delight ; and toward the top of the rise I was close enough to call to the rider to pull up ; which had the effect of making him increase his speed , if possible . On we tore for a quarter of a mile , I suppose ; and though the animal ahead was fleet of foot , my mount was on his mettle , and we were whittling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleeing horse back with an invisible rope . I could hear the rider 's breath , now ; and soon Val 's nose was reaching  | past the flank of the mare in front ? when the rider turned , and seeing it impossible to further escape me , cried out : " Take it then , and a curse be upon you ! " And threw something at my head , apparently , at which I reined in . Clink ! went the purse tossed into the roadway . And the voice was that of a man . No doubt about that at all . Well , here was a pretty pass ! The fellow had mistaken me for a highwayman , which seemed stupid ? well , no , on second thought , it seemed not stupid , but the most natural thing in the world ! I had dashed out upon him from the hedge of trees , and even after he had fired on me , continued the pursuit . Now , what else could he have taken me for but a highwayman ? And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had escaped with his life ? and on the roadway lay his purse . Should I dismount and pick it up ? In any event I was likely to hang at Tyburn , if I was caught ; and a posse might be sent back from the Hunting Horn , or where ever his destination might be . No , better let it lie . And yet , if his name was placed therein , I might be able to salve my conscience by returning it to him , with , perhaps , a word of explanation . Yes ; I had better secure it , and then leave the spot as quickly as Val would make retreat possible .  | I dismounted , therefore , and began to make a search where I thought I had heard the purse fall . It was certainly one of the morning , and cloudy . Valentine I could see against the line of sky , but at my feet the path was as black as a pocket . I felt around in the dust , and was about as successful as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought were possible on a well-traveled highway , and some rather rare specimens of floraculture , including some with thorns ? but no purse . I searched , and I searched ; and had just about come to the conclusion that he had secured it with a cord , and whipped it back to himself again ( which was something of a thought , in case you are placed in a similar predicament with a highwayman , ) when I stumbled over it on going back for Val , having abandoned the hunt . I thereupon mounted , and trotted back toward Parleigh , carrying the thing in my hand ; and when well by that clump of old trees which had concealed me before , I saw a tiny light approaching from the direction which I faced , and advanced toward it in clear and open manner , whistling as I came . For the time being I was absolutely through with surprises . It was a horse and rider coming slowly , the latter bearing a small lantern on the saddle ; and the instant her voice reached me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat waiting . " Well , what do you ride about at night for , I won-  | der , " she said , reining up at my side . " Over to the Hunting Horn , I suppose , to see me . " " No . I saw you but now , at Parleigh . " " Indeed ! And where were you ? " " At the window of my bedroom , above the entrance . Let me ask you something , Mistress Mattison . The last time we spoke together you warned me I would be in danger if I went to Parleigh ? " " Which warning still holds good , " she responded , easily . " Possibly . And you also told me , if I remember correctly , that Matthew Hopkins might ? let me see , what was your expression ? " " If I said that he might burn in hell for all of me , it was what I thought then , and feel now . " " Very good . He probably will , regardless of what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight to carry a warning to him , to keep him from harm . " " Why , yes , " she drawled , pensively , " I did hurry to warn him ; but you must remember that he is not alone at the Manor . There are others of his band there . Close to a dozen of them , mayhap ; and there is one I would save , though I must save Hopkins with him . " " Jonathan Sterne ? " I asked . She made no answer for a moment , and then she asked : " You are in love with one of the daughters of  | the house there , are you not ? " " And if I am ? " " The answer to me is not , And if I am ? ' It is either yes , ' or no . ' Then you may learn what you followed me here for . " " Yes , then . " " Mistress Sylvia ? " " Yes . " " Why do you think I sent you there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Why , " she repeated , waving aside my remark , " why do you think I sent you there ? " " Well , because  --  Hark ! You can tell me better than I can guess . Why , then ? " " Because Jonathan Sterne is infatuated with the same girl , and with something else which you , in your innocence and position , never thought about : her money . You can save her from him , if you have wit and cunning and courage ; but that does not interest me particularly . What does interest me is , that you will save him , for me . Is that clear to you ? " " Must I understand from this that you , madam , love this man ? " " That , I suppose , is hard for you to understand ? " " Do you wonder ? " " No . I sometimes wonder at myself . Nevertheless , there is some truth in it . You , Richard , will probably never be able to quite grasp what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and her soul , and her body , to a man . It is n't just an incident in her life ; it is the great event which lies between the two poles of her birth and death . That is the romantic goal of her entire existence ; the hour of her triumph , of her victory ? and of her capitulation . No matter how unworthy the man may eventually prove , he has measured to her conception of the ideal for that hour , and always he will bear in her eyes some reflection of the faultless being she thought him , then . " " And Jonathan Sterne was ? " " Yes . Over four years ago now . " " Is he your ? are you  --  married ? " " No , " she answered frankly , " that mummery , as he called it , was put over to a convenient time . It has not arrived yet , although I have followed him , up hill and down dale . I 'm not even going to tell you that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive , and morals are lax among such as we witchfinders ; and a girl must eat and drink  --  and pay for his eating and drinking with her earnings , too . But he wo n't walk away with your ladylove , and leave me to starve by the roadside while he rides by in his carriage and four ; and I 'll fight for that , and you 'll fight by my side , Richard . " " I will , " said I , grimly . " Now , you probably heard me say to-night that a third witchfinder is on his way to Parleigh . He is ,  | and he knows the situation . His aim is to discover witches , not build a soft nest because his dirty game is about played out , and he stands in danger of a nasty death in almost every shire in this part of England . And that , of course you know , is why Hopkins and Sterne are at Parleigh . If they can settle there , and marry into money , they may lie safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick for good . " " But they make a great deal from the ignorant , do n't they ? " " Yes ; and they heretofore have spent faster than they made . It 's only two years , or three at the most , since these two joined forces , and made such a success . Sterne had money once , but I spent it for him ; and other women , too , likely . And now he is to marry riches , and live like a gentleman again ! We 'll see . I shivered behind the hedge with him when he had nothing ; and he 'll come back , and shiver with me , if needs be . But time goes . Enough of that , now . What you want to know is , will this new witchfinder interfere with their sport at Parleigh . He may , for he is forceful , and believes in himself . He may proclaim them imposters , and have them hanged out of hand . I do n't want that ; but I want him to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans ? " " No . And when you meet this man who will arrive there to-morrow you will know that he is n't the kind of person you make plans with . Hopkins does not know him , except possibly by reputation , but he was frightened when he knew he was on the way . I could see that . You may find that they are already on their way from the Manor when you arrive . I hope so . That is all I can tell you now . " " No ; you can tell me of Jenkyn Wyrrall ? " " Of who ? " " Jenkyn Wyrrall , the man with whom I traveled to the Hunting Horn . " " Is he not with you at Parleigh ? " " No . He stayed behind , owing to your warning . " " I know now . The tall , dark man . He is n't at the inn ; or if he is , I have n't seen him . If I do , is there any message ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamzin ? no , Tommy , sent him word to come to her rescue . You will remember ? " " Tommy ? Yes , I 'll remember . " " And , well , I just had a queer adventure of a sort . I followed a horseman I thought was you , and he threw me his purse , and fled in a fright . I have it here . If you are going to the Hunting Horn you might take charge of it , and return it to him , with some sort of explanation . " " Rather a hard thing to explain . What 's in it ? " " Money , evidently . Hold the light . Hum ? .  |  | Eleven shillings , four pence ; and a paper . Perhaps this will give a clue to the owner . Hold the purse and money while I read it . Hah ! A note ! To Master Tooms , at the Hunting Horn Inn . ' Well , that should make the money easy to return . It reads : Sir . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication with a dissolute woman , one Sibyl Mattison , who claims herself a connection of our efforts . She has no standing with us , and you had best beware of her , and her information . Make haste , therefore , directly to Parleigh Manor , where we are now engaged , and add your good offices to ours for the routing of evil . If you can be with us by to-morrow evening , it may mean a goodly sum to your credit ; say fifty guineas , or thereabout . With respect ; Matthew Hopkins , Witch-finder General . ' Hum ? . " " A dissolute woman , eh , Master Witchfinder General , " Sibyl Mattison murmured in her husky voice . " Well , she should be a match for a dissolute man . So you robbed the gentleman 's messenger , Richard ? Intentionally , or otherwise , it was right featly done . It would scarcely do , however , for me to return the purse now . Let us divide the spoils . You keep the note , which may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . What say you ? " " Agreed , " said I. " And if Master Tooms come to Parleigh I will attempt to take his measure , too . " " Keep out of his way , " she said , and the sound of her voice was a greater warning than the words she uttered . Evidently she was in mortal terror of the man . " I know the weak breed you have now to contend with ; but this man is different . He would not blanche at the devil himself . Well , good luck to you . " " And to you , Mistress Sibyl . There is nothing I can do for you , in return ? " " Yes . But it will be the most difficult thing you ever did for any one , Richard . " " I promise to try . What is it ? " " When you get Jonathan Sterne with his throat at the point of your sword ? think of me , and do not thrust it home ! " " I will ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode back the way that I had come .  |  | Chapter XVIII MASTER TOOMS IT WAS CLOSE to the dawn when I got back to Parleigh Manor , and if ever a man was dog tired , I was ; but the house was locked up , and I did not wish to call any of the servants , as all would then know I had spent the night away . When I discovered the condition , I returned to the stable , where I had just left Val with Nathan Knapp , and talked matters over with him . Notwithstanding that he had assured me early in the evening that he would not close an eye , I had had a difficult time in getting him awake on my recent call there ; but he now came to sufficiently to search for the head groom , who he felt certain had a key to the rear entrance . This proving true , he opened for me , and I took Nathan to my room . " You have had some sleep to-night , " said I , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to ask about Sir Thomas , and then I will rest a while , and you shall keep wide awake , and watch . " He did not seem to care for the allotment particularly , and claimed he had really not rested during the night at all ; but I cut him short , and went to the chamber door of the Master of Parleigh . Master Dodge was still on  | guard , although he told me he had gotten some sleep while Mistress Sylvia had taken a turn with her father , shortly after midnight . The patient had stirred some during the dark hours , and his mind was in no way improved , although his heart action was , if anything , stronger . Dodge was to remain until noon , when he would return to the village , secure more sleep and a change of clothing , and return again to stay the following night . I did not believe I had been summoned for any purpose during my absence , which was well . I slipped off some of my garments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was early in the afternoon when he leaned over the bed , and said there was one at the door asking for me . I dressed hastily , and found Tamzin in the entry . She told me they would be found in their room when I had secured something to eat ; and I splashed about in some cold water Nathan brought , and went to the dining hall . The witchfinders had evidently lunched earlier , and the server brought me a meal which served for both breakfast and dinner . Doing justice to the repast , I went up to the designated apartment , with an eye open to see that none followed or spied . " Here he is ! " said Tamzin , opening the door . " Well , we certainly have waited a long time for you to report to-day . " " I was out all night , " I answered briefly .  | " Well , an honest confession lessens the crime , " she retorted , briskly , and much , I thought , in her old manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , there was . " " Dickie ! Do n't let 's get too frank . Still , when two supposed ladies invite a so-called gentleman to meet them in their bedroom , I suppose ? " " Tamzin ! " said Sylvia , sitting up on the edge of the bed where she had been resting . " Of course you understand , Richard , that we have you here because there is absolutely no other place in the house where we may freely talk . I was with father from one o'clock until almost dawn ; and my sister stayed from then until Master Dodge got back . Tamzin should sleep , but she wants to talk to you first . " " Yes . To tell you of the latest visitor . Thank heavens , you were asleep , Dickie , or you would have been fighting all over the house . Listen ! He arrived about eleven o'clock , very quietly , with only a servant or two , and asked for Hopkins . Sterne joined them , and they went into the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not know he had come at first ; and when the doortender told me , I went to that little back entrance and tried to listen to what was going on . I did n't have to put my ear to the door to hear him . He does n't say much , but he never lowers his voice . Why did you not get this signed ? ' I heard him demand . The man is too sick , ' says Hopkins . No  | man is too ill to do my bidding ! ' says the newcomer . Where does he lie ? ' Well , up he got , and goes to my father 's door . Dodge refuses him admission , and he pushes him aside as though he was not there , and strides up to the bed . My father lay there , unconscious ; so he examines him a moment , and then demands to see the person who has authority in the Manor . Dodge sent for me , and I had my interview in the great hall . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he called me a brand for the burning and a conniving wench ; and expressed his opinion that Sylvia was a contumacious gill . He asked very particularly why you were here , and what you represented . He ordered you down to interview , but I thought , as you had not appeared , that you were away for the time ; so you are to wait upon him at the village inn , at his convenience . " " I am to  --  what ? " " Go to the inn when he sends for you . And I advise you to do it , Richard . I had thought that Hopkins and Sterne were overbearing and domineering ; but this man Tooms would frighten anybody . And he certainly has placed both of our former adversaries under his thumb ; for , listen ! He was here scarcely more than an hour , and then left for the village inn , where he evidently means to stop . About an hour later , while both Sterne and Hopkins were still closeted in the great hall together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breakneck pace , and orders them to follow him at once to see Tooms . And , so far , they have not returned . " " I am not certain , " said Sylvia , wearily , " whether we are in a better , or a worse , position since his arrival . At least , he is not likely to make any overtures to us , which is a blessing . What were you doing last night , Richard ? " I told them everything , including my robbery of the man with the letter . Then I went down , at their suggestion , and had an interview with Dodge . He more than confirmed what Tamzin had told me regarding this man , Tooms . In reference to Sir Thomas Warren 's condition , he seemed doubtful ; and finally admitted that certain symptoms were in evidence which gave him considerable concern . " To-night , " he said , " I am going back to the village , if one of the ladies can stay with their father , and ask the physician to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm his family unduly , but I am not sanguine of his condition . And that in the face of his daughters ' evident belief that he is some improved . " " Has his mind cleared at all ? " " No . If it were so , I would beg you to take my place this evening , and thus give them no anxiety until I was certain it was necessary . " " Their spirits are better than yesterday , " I said , thoughtfully ; " and as far as I can see , there will be  | nothing to do this evening , while you are away , but simply sit by . Could I not sit here in the dusk ? You will be gone scarcely more than an hour ; and he will never know . Or again , if he does recognize me , he might hail me as his friend . What say you ? " " It might be possible , " he said , although I saw he hesitated . " You see , the physician may be at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be elsewhere , and I must await his return . I could readily do the trip in an hour , if he is prepared to come with me at once . But , wait ! You have a servant with you , have you not ? " " Yes . Nathan Knapp . " " Why not let him sit with you ? If Sir Thomas should want for anything , he could administer it , under your direction ; and it is unlikely the sick man would have , in his delirium , a feeling against this fellow of yours . " " Let us arrange it so , then . And if there is any difficulty , I will tell Mistress Tamzin that you were called away on a most important case , and will return shortly . Then she , or her sister , can take charge until your return . Leave it to me , Master Dodge , and I will arrange it somehow . When did you think of going ? " " As soon after sundown as I may . It is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Be content in your mind , sir . "  | I returned to the two girls , and told them , as I thought best , that their father was actually no worse ; but that Dodge gave no hope , at present , for his ultimate recovery . They had hoped for a better word , I think , and were downcast ; although had it been my own parent , I would rather have seen him pass quietly away than have him lie , physically and mentally broken , and waste his last days in suffering and distraction . Some time later I returned to my room , fearing that my presence with them in their apartment might be criticised by Hopkins and Sterne , if they discovered it . To my surprise I found there Jim Pruden , with a message to me from Jenkyn . I tore off the cover , and read as follows : DEAR KINSMAN : S. M. sought me this morning , and told me of Parleigh . I was already in a mind to ride to Overmead , as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , a standing at the Court , which might make the King intercede in the affair . Had you not best talk the matter over with Sir Thomas Warren , and let me know at once at the Hunting Horn ? James Pruden will await your reply . As always , your affectionate J. W.  | I read this missive with a great amount of annoyance . It is true that I had not dwelt particularly upon Sir Thomas Warren 's critical condition when speaking with Sibyl Mattison ; but this word proved that he had but a slight grasp of the situation to be faced , and I condemned him heartily for not being here at my side . It was all very well to send word to my father , but Jim Pruden , or Nathan Knapp , could have done that as well as my cousin ; and by the time he got him to London , and had an interview with the proper persons , we might all be hanged for witches . At least , it showed me where I could reach him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain would burn Jenkyn Wyrrall 's ears . Just before dusk , when the evening meal was served , I went to the dining hall , and found both Master Hopkins and his associate present , but neither of the girls . I gave them a distant bow , which Sterne returned in kind , and Hopkins ignored , and fell to eating in silence . Finishing , I decided not to be the first to leave the board , and had my wine cup refilled , sitting back to enjoy its contents . I thought the two witchfinders ill at ease ; and they were both silent , whether on account of my presence , or because of a difference between them , I was not sure . The sun sank as I sipped ; and soon after a servant came to inform me , quietly , that Master Dodge was ready to depart . I thanked the messenger , rose , and  | went to my room for Nathan . He was awaiting me there with an anxious mien . It appeared that Sylvia had come to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her as soon as I returned from the hall . She seemed , he told me , agitated ; and had but a short moment before made a second visit , to the same purpose . I sent Nathan down at once to take my place beside the sick man . He was unarmed , so I handed him my dagger , and hurried to Sylvia 's apartment . She was alone , and highly distraught . " I thought you would never come , " she said , " and I have but a moment to explain . Jonathan Sterne sent me word that he would wait upon me here , in my room , within a few moments . He claimed that the interview must be secret ; and that it was of the most vital consequence to me . I sent back word that I would see him to-morrow , in the great hall . He responded that , if I was coy with my consent , I might find myself removed to the village gaol in the morning . " " Good ! I will receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard . If you do we will be no more the wiser , and all be more endangered . I have thought of a plan ? not a good one , but better than yours . I will see him , as he demands . You , however , will be in that closet yonder . You can hear what passes ; and protect me , if necessary . But one thing I insist upon .  | No dramatic entry in the midst of our parley . Stay there ! Come only if I should call . Will you obey me ? " " If you insist . But he will look in the closet , likely . " " I doubt it . It is roomy enough for you to conceal yourself anyway , behind the clothes hanging there . Go in , and see . " I stepped in the deep storage space , thickly hung with various garments . And Sylvia promptly closed the door , and shot the bolt on the opposite side . " Stay there , " she whispered , " and make no noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bolt . Hark ! Here is Sterne at the door ! "  | Chapter XIX THE VOICE OF JONATHAN STERNE " GOOD EVENING , Mistress Warren . I trust that I do not intrude . " " You do intrude . You have forced this intrusion upon me . Therefore it were better to come to the meat of your desire at once , and begone . " " I had hoped , where you were concerned , that my presence would never be an intrusion . " " Was it to tell me so that you did intrude ? " " In a sense , yes . " " I fail to understand you . " " Would you play coy with me , mistress ? " " I would be rid of you , sir . Free from you , and your boorish friend , for good and all . " " You do Master Hopkins less than justice , ma'am ; although he has not the nicety of manner his friends could wish for him under all occasion . I believe , however , that your wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned . " " That much is well . I sincerely trust that , when he departs , you will in no way deprive him of your companionship . " " You have a tongue , miss , which likes me not . " " I have a heart which likes you less . "  | " I believe that you lack a lesson in courtesy and respect . Do you not realize that it is my interest alone which prevents your lying in the gaol , under charge of witchcraft ? " " That is nonsense . There is no proof against me . " " All in the world that I care to divulge . " " Or that you care to manufacture , sir . " " I see that you prefer to play the shrew with me , rather than tender the thanks you owe my efforts . Have it so , an you will . We can both be blunt , if it better suits your humor . " " If bluntness would more quickly get us to your departure , by all means , bluntness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view your position at Parleigh with the alarm which it might raise in one more versed in worldly matters . The village is in a torment over the ills that witches have wrought . We were sent for to discover and eliminate the breed . The first confession we receive is from your servant , Robin . " " He is not my servant . He is merely a tender of the Manor sheep . " " But he does this the more readily because of you , mistress . And for it , you admit , you have shown him some kindness . " " Then I am to be condemned for my kindness ? " " Yes ; if the truth of your relation to him is known . For , in Parleigh Manor , he was but a serf of the field ; but in the witches ' sabbath , you two were equal in  | your due to Satan . Raise not your hand in protest , madam ! The man has confessed . Both Hopkins and I are aware of your complicity ; and but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the heart rather than from my sense of duty ) you would even now be upon your trial . " " I think the trial would be the better , sir . " " There can be but one outcome to such a charge , and such evidence as can ? nay , must ! ? be brought to bear upon you . The testimony of this single witness is not all ; yet it suffices . Much you are known to ride abroad , going from house to house ; cheering the sick , aiding those in need , spreading wide the good will of Parleigh Manor . Your sister bides at home , and tends the house . You , in your father 's place , see to the tenantry . " " Well ? " " Yea , ' t is well ? if that be all . But could it not be told that you , yourself , with your witcheries and spells , first brought the suffering which you later feign to alleviate ? Jane Struthers ' child had no illness upon her until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxwell , the leather worker , was a hale man two years agone . He is fast to his stool to-day . You called there frequently . Often , in the autumn season , your horse trod Lodge 's fields . His crop has failed ; his swine reveal their ribs . And Tom Summers ' son has seen you , I 'll be bound , gazing on his father 's kine ; and now the herd is dry . Beshrew me with your tongue ,  | mistress ; but the people of Parleigh will see you hang for such behavior , even if Robin should recant to save your hide . " " And think you there is no defense to all of this ? " " Defense ? Yes . But not what you believe . Who weighs the evidence , and gives the verdict out ? Who brings the accusation , oversees the trial , and sorts the guilty from the innocent ? Who ? Why , Master Matthew Hopkins , of Manningtree , forsooth ! And who stands at his side , with better manner , keener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Consider , mistress , before you take a step you ca n't retrace . Consider ! " " There is , in what you tell me , nothing to consider . You lay my case before me with a veiled alternative . My name , you tell me , is mentioned in the list of witches Robin has accused . You can bring further charges , which will turn the tenantry against me . Even without this evidence , false though it be , you have the power to deal with me as you wish . What answer am I then to make to that ? " " You have set the matter forth full well ; and yet you fail to realize even a jot of the power my position carries . Free of restraint , answerable to none , earning large fees and living of the best ; traveling here and there , as my desires lead ; looked up to , bowed down to ; potent , yet without the irksome ties which bind in usual cases those who know command . What more aspired lot could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could any offer ? " " Perhaps it is I 'm stupid , sir . But , even yet , I see no clear alternative . " " Mistress , I see you claim a maiden 's right ; and would be wooed before you give consent . And no more pleasure could I find in life than to pay suit to you ; indeed , and so I will . But passion such as mine brooks not delay ; and matters have arisen which make my danger in thus guarding you of double consequence . Another judge has come to take a hand . You 've seen him ? " " No . " " A man of iron will ; relentless , fell . If he could read that avowal of the shepherd , quick 1 in the flames you 'd wither . And yet he is a man of such a type , that had I joined with him instead of this frail Hopkins , I could to-day have told my wealth in many thousands . I talked with him this noon . Well he thinks of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had done with ponderous Matthew Hopkins . Henceforth I mean to cast my lot with him , and let this pursy Witchfinder General seek his own salvation . " " Then the offensive overtures he has made to my sister may be discounted , I take it ? " " Hopkins is considering other plans , I would think , ma'am . Master Timothy Tooms has taken that matter 1 In most cases , in England , where condemned witches were burned , they were strangled by a short rope in the hands of the executioner just before the torch was applied to the pyre . To be burned quick , however , was to suffer without this humane office .  | up with your sister already , I believe . " " What ? Why she has said nothing to me of that . " " You have not seen her within the last hour , I believe ? " " She is at my father 's side . " " On the contrary , she is with Master Tooms , at his solicitation . When he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will capitulate . " " That can not be so . She would wait upon no man without an escort ; and she would have informed me of his invitation . " " Invitation ? Mistress , you surely are in jest . This witchfinder Tooms does not invite ; he orders . And unless you wish to come beneath his sway you had best take heed to my advice . " " Which is ? ? " " To accept my solicitation for your hand , and go with me instanter to some nearby place of concealment . Later , if your good father survives this illness , which seems doubtful , we can return in state to your home again . If he should die , we can then dispose of our share of Parleigh , and be free to roam where we will . " " And this , if I understand you correctly , is the long and short of your offer : either to bring me to trial for witchcraft before this same Master Tooms , and see to it that I burn for your false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest by me ? Do not reply , I beg of you ! Because I have clearly set the matter forth ;  | and any further words that you might utter will only tend to crowd the insult home . I have let you run on , Master Sterne , because I wished to plumb the depths of such a mind as yours ; and because I would not have you say that I jumped to conclusions rather than hark to all the tale . As you then claim you are a man , answer in one brief word if what I say is true . Say , Yes , ' or No . ' And you will have your answer in a trice . " " It is natural , mistress , that I should resent the way you set the matter forth ; and it is also true that any lover ? " " Lover ! But , yes ! There is the value of the Parleigh estate ; and you love gold . Continue ! " " It is natural , I say , that any man will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to press his entreaty . Suitors are not rare with you , mistress . Have any come in tatters , giving a thousand reasons why they should be overlooked ? Oh , no ! Brave they have bedecked themselves ; honeyed their tongue ; happy their future ; if you could believe them . If you walked in your garden with an certain one , and a rose drooped toward him on its stem , he would pluck it , hand it to you with a well-turned speech ; and feel he acted in accord with fortune that the bloom was there . Thus , so it is with me . The chance to befriend you ? save your life , in fact ? lies at my hand . You should not blame me for my use of circumstance . " " Master Sterne , I will not dignify your protests with  | an argument . Evidently you wish my answer ; and I am happy to give it to you . I would rather burn a thousand times than stoop to your suggestion . And , furthermore , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter , attempt to carry away the Parleigh estate by making me weaken by threats against Sir Thomas Warren . And that , you unscrupulous cur , will be no more efficacious . Now that we understand each other thoroughly , let this interview end . " " No ! I have been easy with you so far , because I thought you might have a heart in your breast , and a brain in your head ; but now I see it were best to exercise the authority which is mine . Wait ! Hopkins ! Master Hopkins ! A minute , if you please , sir . Here , man , down the hall , in my lady 's bedroom . Now , Master Hopkins , this contumacious witch has admitted her guilt to me . You have the authority to pack her off to gaol ; and the right to do so after what she has acknowledged . Call your men , Witchfinder General , and see that the laws of England are not set at defiance . " " If either of you place your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A silence . And then a gasp ! And there spoke a voice which I recognized , even as I struggled impotently with the bolted closet door . " What means this , sirrah ! Come ! What 's this to-do ? "  | Chapter XX THE VOICE OF THE MASTER OF PARLEIGH No , THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE ! The last voice I had heard was that of the supposedly dying Sir Thomas Warren ! " What means this , sirrah ! " An exclamation , a question , and a command in one ; no court of justice , no field of battle , ever rang with a more resolute challenge . There was no answer . No audible reply . Two rascally knaves , two frighteners of women , stood aghast before the grim , battle-scarred old warrior swathed in his sleeping raiments , and had no words to say . " What means this , sirrah ! " What ? What , indeed ! What , but scurrilous ruffianism , robbery and foul murder , if the truth were told ! " How come you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ! To wield above their unprotected heads the lewd intimidation of your ill-got power . But , no ! Ill have I been , and clouded in my mind , till now . But , God be praised , I am awake in time ! Out of this room , you rotting fruit of a corrupt and vicious tree ; out of this house , and take you from this district ! Enough ! We 've had enough of witchery ,  | and the filth that follows in its nauseous wake . Go ! And before another sun has set upon Parleigh , a message will be sent to the Throne itself , to plead that you be stripped of your authority , and brought to book for your crimes . Go ! " From my place of concealment I heard the two witchfinders shuffle from the room ; followed , it would seem , by the Master of Parleigh . I heard Sylvia say , in a tone of entreaty : " Father ! " But he evidently turned to her , saying : " I will escort these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them were down the entry . I waited a moment ; heard Sylvia cast herself upon the couch ; and then I tapped upon the closet door . She screamed in affright ; then remembered , and shot the bolt to let me emerge . " You heard ? " " Everything . It was as I thought . But your father ? How did he come here ? " " Was he not heroic ! He was just as I remember him when I was a little child . We both thought that he was better , but I was surprised when I saw hits enter . I wonder that Tamzin allowed him to rise . " " Tamzin was not with him . Do n't you remember that Sterne said she went to speak with this fellow Tooms , at the village inn ? " " Yes , he said so ; but I did not believe it . "  | " Well , at least , she was not with your father , for that was to have been my place for the evening , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know . We talked that over ; and it was decided I would simply remain in the dark room with him . The time was to have been short . But when you sent for me , I ordered my man , Nathan Knapp , to take my place until I returned . I only expected to be a moment at your side . Well , had I not best go and see how he does now ? " " Perhaps . Or , better still , I will go to him , and you might ride to Parleigh Village , if you think it safe to do so , and find something regarding Tamzin . I am much alarmed over her absence , now that the mask is off that sneering face of Sterne . " " Let us both go down now , and his condition will point the next best move . " At the door of her father 's room we came face to face with Nathan Knapp . " And why , " I asked , " did you allow the sick man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Dick , what else could I do ? i was seated in his room , with him so silent that I could not even hear him breathe . Then there was a light rustle , and I said to myself , Some one is in the hall without . ' But , just then , the room door opened , and out Sir Thomas walked ! When I got over my sur-  | prise , I ran to the hall , and saw him mounting the stairs . I could have called him to come back , but he will not run at my beck , so I let him go . Had he spoken to me of his intention , I would have bade him wait . But up he got , without so much as a creak of the bed . What could I do , Master Dick ? " " Nothing , I suppose . Has he returned ? " " Yes . Just now . He came in , ordered me to light a candle , and aid him to retire . I helped him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child . " " All right , Nathan . Do you still think I had better go back for Tamzin , Sylvia ? " " It is n't late ; and if you are not too tired ? I am dreadfully worried over her . Let Nathan get Val for you . Then he can rest at the stable for the night . I will stay here until you return . " " Very well , Nathan , if you will . " And when he had gone for the horse , Sylvia said : " Do you suppose the two witchfinders have gone ? " " They have some things to pack , doubtless ; but they will be away within the hour or I am much mistaken . I do not mean by that that Parleigh has seen the last of them , but they seemed to fear your father , did they not ? " " Fear him ! The faces of both were as white as snow . With father in his right mind , you here , and Jenkyn Wyrrall on the way , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! I received a message from  | Jenkyn to-day , and I am looking for him any time now . " " I 'm glad , for Tamzin 's sake . And when you go to the village , Richard , what will you do ? " " Ask at the inn for this fellow , Tooms . If Tamzin is with him I 'll bring her home . If he knows anything about her , I 'll shake it out of him . That 's all . " " Well , be careful . I tell you to , but I know that you wo n't . But please remember , with both you and my sister away , I have double the worry . Now , hurry , and fare well . " As I mounted Valentine at the door I wondered if everything would be safe during my absence . I was worried about Tamzin , myself , however ; and if I left going to the village until later the inn might be closed . " Try to keep awake , " I said to Nathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from his bed just now . " " Not so , Master Dick ! " he responded , hotly . " Why , Master Dodge , the doctor 's apprentice , was with me until a few moments before . " " Why , he was to leave long ago ! " " Yes , but he waited , hoping you would be back , until he could wait no more . You might have ridden on with him had you been but a shade sooner . " " Well , I will be back betime . And if Jenkyn Wyrrail should arrive in my absence , take him to Mistress Sylvia in her father 's room . " I rode along slowly , liking my errand none too much , and being pulled two ways at once ; until it got in my head that the quicker I got the business over the quicker I would be back again ; and then I gave Val the spur . The inn was noisy with a group of arguing tenants , some strangers and wayfarers , and the usual commonplace crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , without causing any more attention than I could avoid , and asked to speak with the landlord . He was a pleasant enough fellow , and said that Master Timothy Tooms was up in his room , for all he knew , and I might go up . I hesitated at that , and decided I would take a high hand with the fellow before he could take a high hand with me . And so I told my man to inform the witchfinder that I was there to see him , and bade him come down to me . I think the landlord rather raised his eyebrows , but at all events he went upon his commission , and returned shortly to say that Master Tooms had indeed gone out , although he had been there but a short time before . " Gone out , eh ? " said I , and wondered what I should do now . " Yes . I did n't see him go , but I 've had a mort of business here to-night . His servant told me . Master Tooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing and another . He had a lady here for some time  |  | this evening , over in that small room by the ordinary . She came in quiet , and asked for him ; and down he runs in a jiffy when I told him . " " What kind of a looking lady was she ? " " That 's one thing I never take no notice of , sir ; what kind of looking ladies they be , " he responded , affably . " Somewhere I have heard , " I said , thoughtfully , reaching into my pouch and pulling forth a silver piece , " that if a man holds a bit of cold metal in his palm it will quicken his memory for faces ? particularly ladies ' faces . Try it ! " He tried , and it seemed , in this case , to have a remarkable result . " Let me see , now . You are a stranger here , I take it ? " " Yes , and no . My home is far away , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , would you know who I meant by Sir Thomas Warren , of Parleigh Manor , for instance ? " " Yes ; both by name and by sight . " " Good ! Well , would you happen to know who I meant by his eldest daughter , for instance ? " " Yes . " " Well , this lady looked enough , in the glimpse I got of her , to be her , if it was n't her . " " Ah , I see . Thank you . And I will not wait for Master Tooms , if the lady has gone away ? " " Oh , she went some time ago , doubtless . I did n't  | notice , having done a mort of business this day surely . " If Tamzin had gone there was no reason why I should not hurry back also . It was possible that we had passed each other on the road , unrecognized in the darkness ; or she might have taken a cut across the fields , being more familiar with the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart pace , and the first person I encountered in the hallway was the young person of whom I had been in search . " So you 're back , " said I. " I was just over at the village inn for you . " " So Sylvia told me . Why , in the name of heaven , did you look for me there ? " " Through a hint dropped by Sterne . " " Goodness ! Do you believe anything that man says ? Well , what happened at the village when you got there ? " " Nothing . The landlord at the inn said you had just gone . " " I had just gone ! Why , I was never there ! I started to ride to my cousin Roland 's , but it grew dark earlier than I expected , and I returned . " " You were not at the inn then ? " " Do n't be stupid . No ! " " And Timothy Tooms did not send for you ? " " Let him dare ! " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here is Sylvia . Dickie is back , sister .  | We two are going to sit in father 's room with him . Tell him about Hopkins and Sterne , Sylvia . " " They left right after you did , " she told me . " Then Tamzin came in , and I locked father 's door on the outside ( he was sleeping peacefully , and there was no danger , ) and Tamzin and I went up to the rooms they occupied . Their things are still about , but they have gone ; and all of their servants , too . We will stay with father now until Dodge and the doctor get here . " " Let me stay with him . It seems a pity I can not relieve you in his case . Perhaps , now that his mind is clear , he will welcome my presence . " " I 'll tell you what we can do , " said Sylvia . " Richard and I will sit in father 's room ? we do n't need to make a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rest ? I have too much in this house to attend to , to rest yet . What is the hour , does anybody know ? " " Close to midnight , I judge . Run along , Tamzin . If we want you we 'll call . " " Dodge is certainly late to-night , " answered Tamzin , and hurried away toward the servants ' quarters . ' Sylvia and I went down the dark entry , and she unlocked the door of her father 's room .  | Chapter XXI THE VIGIL IN THE DARK " WHAT IS THAT JANGLING ? " asked Sylvia as she softly opened the bedroom door . " My sword . I will put it here in the corner . That reminds me ; I gave Nathan my dagger when he came here at sundown , and he told me he had left it on the table . I must remember to take it along . It has a gold hilt . " " It will be safe enough . You will never find it in this litter of papers . Wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I fear to light a light , lest we wake him . And I am bothered over his exertion of this evening . Do you think he will suffer by it , Richard ? " " There is no doubt that , had Dodge been here , he would have kept him to his bed . On the other hand , his illness has been brought on by the presence of the witchfinders , and now that they have gone , he will certainly be the better for that . I do n't know what to think of Dodge being so long away . Some desperate case of illness elsewhere , probably , has prevented the doctor from leaving . When he comes we will know more . " " Listen ! Did he move ? "  | " No ; that was the rustling of the curtains by the open window . When you were with him before , Sylvia , did he sleep as peacefully as now , or was he restless and tossing ? " " He was uneasy before . His present peacefulness looks encouraging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master Tooms say , and what was your impression of him ? " " Well , to be frank with you , Sylvia , I can not quite understand Tamzin in that matter . The landlord of the inn recognized her as the caller that Tooms had this evening ; but she denied to me that she was there , and claimed that she started for your cousin 's , Roland Warren 's . It seems strange to me that she would have only started for his home , and not completed the journey . What think you ? " " Well , whatever Tamzin says , I believe . " " What did she tell you ? " " She said that Tooms had sent for her , but that , on her arrival at the inn he was away . " " The truth is certainly garbled somewhere between our two statements . Could she be shielding someone , or deeply immeshed in some trap , that makes her unable to tell us the truth ? " " Good heavens , Richard ! We must rely on Tamzin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at heart . " " Yes . But the landlord of the inn told me that she had had an interview with this Timothy Tooms . " " Then you believe the landlord in preference to my sister ? " " No ; but he had no reason to make any untrue statement . " " Why would you think that Tamzin had ? " " I do n't know . It is possible that Tooms so frightened her with some threat that she fears , at the moment , to speak freely . " " Tamzin is like father , very brave . I might be frightened , but not she . I think simply that we have misunderstood her . We have much more to ponder over that is actually serious , than just this easily explained misunderstanding . " " What things ? " " My father 's condition , for one . And the delay of Master Dodge and the doctor . What if they had , in some way , been prevented from coming back to Parleigh ? " Neither the physician nor his apprentice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitate to hold out against the signing of some papers in the hands of Hopkins and Sterne ? and Tooms , too , I understand . I do n't think anything of that nature is likely . " " Probably not . Then , what will these witchfinders do ? Rouse the tenantry and serfs against us ? Such a thing could be done . Their anger would not last long , of course , but their fury would be dangerous to  | -  | us while it lasted . Then there is poor uncouth Robin to be thought of . The people are , I understand , much wrought up over him . He may be killed , and we , at the moment , seem powerless to save him . " " It all depends on how rapidly your father may recover sufficiently to send , or personally visit , the court . He intimated that he would act swiftly , when he was speaking to Hopkins , did n't you think ? " " Yes . He spoke boldly , and got immediate results ; but can he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be deputized to go to London in his place ; but I hate to be left unprotected , with Sterne and Tooms in the neighborhood . Did you note that Sterne , in his insulting harangue in my room , intimated that he and the Witchfinder General would divide interest from now on , and that he and Tooms would work together ? I , personally , have believed all along that Sterne was the motivating power in this combination of criminals , and this rather suggests I was correct . " " I am not so sure , " I said . " Sterne is the type who would like to let you believe in his importance . If he was actually the head of the band , he and not Hopkins would have the title of Witchfinder General , do n't you think ? " " You may be right . But I doubt if the new combination would be less severe , although they may be less vicious than the present one . Hark ! Is not that Dodge in the entry ? "  | I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physician were coming down the hall toward the entrance ; but , to my amazement , they were being followed by both Sterne and Hopkins ! I stepped into the entry , and pulled the door closed behind me . " Well , what do you wish ? " I asked . " One side ! " said Hopkins , sternly . " These men are doctors in attendance on Sir Thomas Warren . " " I am aware of that ; but why do you come here , after being ordered away ? " " For the same reason that I was invited to Parleigh by the sick gentleman . He rose from a sick bed , and addressed words to Master Sterne and me to-day which savored of a distracted mind . Master Dodge here does not believe that Sir Thomas could have risen from his bed , and climbed the stairs , without aid . I am of the self-same opinion . And the aid he had was not of a natural sort . " " What do you mean by that ? " " What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have him speak with us as he did . And we are here to investigate the matter . " " Nevertheless you and your accomplice will not enter that room ! " " What authority have you to prevent ? " " The authority of his family , of his wish , and of my sword ! " " Threats , gentlemen ! You will take witness to  | this attempted intimidation ! Now , stand aside , and let us enter . " " No ! He ordered you from the house . " " True ; and for that we are to examine him . " " He will repeat the demand . " " Possibly . And if he does , we will comply . " I hesitated , when Sylvia , who had heard , opened the door behind me . " Gentlemen , " she said , " as the daughter of Sir Thomas Warren , I will allow you to come for a moment into his room . He is resting , and I will not have him disturbed , unless these two physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had no light here , as we did not wish to wake him . Bring those candles from the table , yonder , and tread softly , please . " She turned , with me at her side , closely followed by Dodge , who bore one taper , and the physican . Sterne lifted a second candle , and he and Hopkins entered the room with us , and we all went softly to the great bed on which Sir Thomas Warren lay . The subject of our regard and solicitude was lying straight , in the very centre of the mattress , his grey head upon a white pillow , and the covers drawn up to his waist . His pale hands were lying outside these covers , resting easily , and his whole attitude was that of a person who had fallen into a peaceful sleep . Sterne , who had somehow pushed forward , and was now nearest the couch , raised the light which he bore to shed its rays fully upon the still figure ; and even as a gasping groan was wrung from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hilt in the cold breast of Sir Thomas Warren , was my dagger . The aged knight had been stabbed to death !  |  | Chapter XXII I MEET JENKYN WYRRALL FACE TO FACE JUST WHAT HAPPENED in the first few moments subsequent to the discovery of the assassination of Sir Thomas Warren I do not recall clearly . I remember that I stood , holding the unconscious form of Sylvia in my arms , while Sterne and Hopkins pointed at me accusingly , and called me a murderer ; and that Master Dodge and the other physician seemed more interested in examining the body from a professional standpoint than in laying hands on me , which , I believe , they were called upon to do by the two witchfinders . I think that I was too stunned to say a word ; although when Dodge asked me if the dagger used was mine ? as was charged by Hopkins ? I nodded my head . To deny it would be both dangerous and untrue ; although I could see , even then , that I was trapped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this heinous crime was flight . It is not , I believe I can truthfully say , my nature to run from threatened danger ; but the shock of the realization that Sylvia and I had sat there in the darkened room beside her father 's body , whispering and planning , hoping and yearning , while he lay with my knife in his heart , drove me into a momentary panic .  | I turned , then , amid the denunciation of Sterne and Hopkins and the amazed interest of the two doctors , and ? still bearing the unconscious form of the girl ? walked from the room . I had , when I first saw them coming down the hall , instinctively buckled on my sword ; and it was noticeable that , though the witchfinders made much in the way of an oral attack upon me , they did nothing , physically , to prevent me from leaving the apartment of death . Up the stairs I carried Sylvia , and down toward her own room . Tamzin must have heard me approaching , and opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasp when she saw the burden I bore ; and I think the truth as to her father 's death presented itself immediately to her mind . She paled , and visibly trembled , yet retained courage sufficient to aid me to place the still figure on the bed , and began ministrations without asking an explanation . " Tamzin , " I said , as calmly as I could under the circumstances , " a dreadful and unexpected blow has fallen on Parleigh Manor . " " Father ! " she said . " Yes . You and Sylvia have the responsibility , and the direction , of affairs from now on . Ordinarily I would bid you weep for the loss of a just and noble parent , and would respect and protect the privacy of your uncontrolled grief . But the circumstances which surround his passing , and which surround you and  | your home , rather tend me to insist that your personal sorrow be laid aside , or rather , merged with that of an harassed province . " " The witchfinders have returned ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they have already accused me ? of your father 's death . There is no doubt that if I remain here I will be dragged to the gaol . Regardless of the outcome of a trial , I can be of no assistance to either of you then . Little time have I had to think the matter over , but it would seem to me that , if I made immediately for my own home , my father , who is a power in himself , would return with me . Here , in remembrance of the affection in which he held the late Master of Parleigh , he would be a bulwark to you . And he would also see that my trial ? which I fear must be gone through with ? will be conducted with at least a show of fairness . " " Oh , Dickie ! The idea of accusing you is ridiculous . But it well fits in with such natures as Hopkins ' . I do not want to see you leave us , as you must realize ; but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is best for all ; and Sylvia and I will understand , and have faith in you , and your motives . I will send at once for my cousin , Roland . And as my father 's death can not be hid , he will come at once . I do not regard my relative as much of a reliance ; but , at least , we will not be alone . Come back when you can . And if you must go to-night , do not delay until Sylvia recovers , thus giving additional pain to her , and additional hazard to yourself . " " Spoken like the daughter of Sir Thomas Warren , " I said . And I reached to take her hand , and press it to my lips ; but she stopped me gently , standing on tiptoe to kiss my lips . " Good bye , Dickie . God aid you ! Look ! Sylvia is stirring . Go , before she has time to realize ! " With a longing look at the white face on the pillow , I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear door of the Manor , and made for the stables . For once I discovered Nathan Knapp wide awake and bustling . Helped by a stableman , we had Val and Nathan 's horse saddled in no time , and dashed away from Parleigh at top speed . Knapp was too old a soldier to stop to enquire of our haste . He merely saw that to hurry away was my desire , and hurry he did to keep pace with Valentine 's flying hooves . For a league we went as though the devil was after us ; and then I slowed down , and brought Nathan to my side . " I am rushing back to Overmead as swiftly as I may ; and I will probably be followed . You said , when coming here , that you know the roads like the palm of your hand . It is now an excellent time to prove your knowledge . There must be byroads we can follow which will lead me in the general direction we  |  | must go , and at the same time present a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands . Proceed . " Without a word , he led me off of the main highway at the next intersection ; and twisted and turned from then on , to lanes that were slow travel , and grass-grown , rutted roads ; but always , as I readily noted by the sun which rose upon our flight , pressing toward home . Small cots and farms were passed , and a few laborers were seen in the fields ; but we did not stop , even for a midday meal , but pushed forward until our shadows grew long toward the east . For me ? and for Nathan , also , if danger threatened ? food was not a necessity ; but the horses must be cared for , and eventually we looked out for some place to halt for the night . We both had the feeling that the main highway was only a league or two to the east of us , and we turned in that direction with some sense , now , of security . If we had been instantly pursued , our hunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and had they attempted to follow our various and tortuous windings , they would be far behind us . Therefore , we dared to be seen again upon the maintraveled road . Not a hundred yards from the place where we eventually reached the King 's Highway , there stood a fine looking hostelry , and we pulled up boldly before the door , and Nathan went with the cattle to the stable to see they were properly cared for . I entered the  | inn , and ordered dinner for us both ; waiting its arrival at a small table in the corner of the main room . Guests came and went , but no attention was paid to me , and I saw nothing suspicious in the manner of any present to make me uneasy . Nathan returned , and we made a hearty meal ; with the peculiar restriction that my physical condition seemed to demand , I partook robustly of food , while my mental shock and perturbation precluded my enjoyment of the viands , or even the recognition of what I was eating . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the continuation of our journey , and I sat on at the cleared board , wondering and worrying over the outcome of this most serious situation . The day died , as there I sat , and the dusk closed in ; although there was enough of a moon to streak the earth with a somber glow . The inn door now swung less regularly to the entrance of guests , and , save for some wassailers chanting a ribald chorus in a remote , II " portion of the building , this retreat grew quiet . I thought it now high time to continue , but hesitated to awaken my soundly snoring servingman . Poor Nathan was far too old , I felt , for such an adventure ; and was I not certain that I would never in this life be forgiven by him for so doing , I would have left word for him to follow at his leisure , and started alone for the dash to Overmead.  | As I pondered , looking down at his tired , stubblebearded face , a hand fell upon my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze again into the calm eyes of Jenkyn Wyrrall , the cautious . The easy , cool indifference of his attitude , as thus he stood ; the serene and unruffled contemplation of his regard , lit within me a spark that was speedily fanned to a blazing flame of righteous wrath . " Well , " I said , with studied contempt ; " well , Master Prudent ; I am alarmed to see you so close to possible danger . I had thought that , by now , you were at least safe out of England . I had stopped here , on my forced escape to Overmead , trusting I would not be detected ; but this inn must be doubly secure , when you show yourself so openly and free from terror . " " What mean you ? " he demanded , firmly . " What I say , quotha ! That where a coward skulks a less timorous man may feel himself at ease . " " What do you mean by your forced escape for Overmead ? " " Well may you ask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you all lest your new horse be foundered in your attempt to escape . Enough for your ears is , that Sir Thomas Warren is dead , and that I am accused of his murder . You may curry immunity from both Hopkins and Sterne by hurrying to them to tell that I am in haste to Overmead . " " Dead ! Murdered ! The Master of Parleigh ? Sit ,  | sir , and tell me the whole as quickly as may be . " " Nay ! " said I. " I must seek a man of action in the matter . Sir Philip Scot will aid , and there I go post haste . " " I will go with you , then , " he replied . " No , " I rejoined ; " for then I might be regarded by Sylvia in the same light as Tamzin regards you . It will relieve your mind to know that this girl , whom you profess so to love , held a secret meeting yesterday with a bolder man ; and later gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to thank than you . Farewell , fairweather lover ! " And I shook Nathan by the shoulder , who sleepily rose , and followed me to the door , never casting a glance at Jenkyn , who watched us depart in silence . I was pulling tight Valentine 's saddle girth , aided by a voluble hostler , when a word the fellow said made me pause in my precipitation , and encourage for the nonce his ready tongue . " Yes , " he continued , cheerfully , " stabbed to death , as ever were , sir , in his own bed ; and him one of the notedest men in that part of Essex . ' T is a foul deed , undoubted ; and done , so they say , by his own daughter , together with her lover . It was like a story from a play , as the way it was told by a messenger who come by . She thinks , belike , as she 'll get the old soul 's wealth , which I hear is huge ; but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is she lodged in the gaol , the murdering wench ! "  | " And where did all this take place ? " I asked in as calm a voice as I could command . " Up in Parleigh way , so ' t is said . The lover , he takes to his heels ; but the ? " He rambled on , but I had heard enough to plan my next step with decision . " Nathan , " said I , when we had gotten well clear of the neighborhood of the inn ; " You know enough of the matter in hand to tell the story to my father . Go then , as fast as you may , to Overmead ; and tell him all . And say that I am returning to Parleigh Manor , that Mistress Sylvia may not be accused of this crime alone . Haste , now ! My honor calls me back the way I came . "  | Chapter XXIII MASTER DODGE , THE MEDICO I PARTED with Nathan Knapp , and turned Valentine 's head toward Parleigh , expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early the following day . But , since the discovery of the death of Sir Thomas Warren , on the previous night , I had had no rest ; and that fact , coupled with a strenuous ride which had lasted over fifteen hours , had placed me in such physical collapse that I recognized , after covering but a short distance of my return journey , that if I ever did arrive at the Manor without rest , it would be but to fall into an illness . Therefore , I turned in at a small house of entertainment on the way , and claimed for myself some sleep , with good assurance that nothing sinister could befall Sylvia ere I was on the scene . The following day I rose , refreshed , and with a brighter outlook upon events . If I had delayed in my return , that would give Nathan Knapp the more time to reach Overmead , and start my father into action . Just what that good man might do I had no idea ; but if there was one in whom I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even the thought of his calm yet forceful personality imbued me with courage .  | Again I set out , travelling at a good pace , and in an uneventful tour soon saw again the familiar crossroad which led to the enchanted wood and the rustic bridge of tender memory . Forward I rode , and was trotting through the glade , when a hail from behind me bade me halt ; and a horseman advanced , his presence till now unsuspected owing to the noiseless fall of his horse 's shoes in the soft earth . When he drew near , I was glad to recognize the one free man in Parleigh whom I might meet with some respect on the part of both , and speak without mistrust : Master Dodge , the physician 's apprentice . " I thought that you were well away ? " he said , reaching my side . " I was . But you see me now returned , because I heard a rumor that Sir Thomas 's daughter might be charged with this villainous crime . " " Hum ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " let us , if you will , turn in among the trees here , and dismount for some words ? " " Readily , " said I. " And I also appreciate that you seek cover in conversing with an accused murderer . " " Yes , " he replied , without dissimulation ; " one must be wary . Now , sir . We are safe here , I believe . May I be free with you about this matter ? " " Most assuredly . Speak freely . " " Nay ; it is to ask you to speak freely , I actually believe , that I have brought you here . But , tell me of  | the events which led to this grewsome find . " " I left Nathan Knapp , my servant with you , in the sick room , as you remember . For a time I was closeted with one of Sir Thomas Warren 's daughters on the floor above ? " " Mistress Sylvia ? " " Mistress Sylvia , yes . Others were , for a time , present ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of Sir Thomas himself , who expressed his views at some length , and with great clarity and force . He then retired from the apartment ; and his daughter and I almost immediately came to his room , to learn from Nathan that her father had returned and retired ; and was then resting peacefully . I then departed on an errand , leaving Mistress Sylvia to watch alone ; my servant securing my horse for me ; and she remained in the room , which was dark save for the faint light of the stars which scarcely penetrated through the open window . " " Who opened the casement ? " " I do not now . It was open , however , when I left her . " " I am under the impression it was closed when I left . If I am correct , your servant opened it . " " I suppose so . Sir Thomas , so his daughter informed me , seemed to be more undisturbed in his rest than heretofore , and when her sister , Tamzin , came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manor , they both felt it safe to investigate this departure , and leave the sleeping man without attendance for a short while . This was done ; and on my return from my quest , Mistress Sylvia and I again took up our vigil in the dark . There we remained until your arrival ; and the rest you know . " " Thank you , sir . The picture of the case is now clear in my mind . " " It was a most unhappy decision that these two innocent girls ? buoyant in the belief that their father was much improved ? left him unguarded as they did . But you must bear in mind , Master Dodge , that the chief cause of fear for him , the witchfinders , had just made their exit from the house . Thus , they felt comparatively safe . " " I do not criticise their actions , or question their motives , Master Scot . " " No ; but you must , with me , regret that an opportunity was given for an assassin to slay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with evident hesitation , ran his fingers thoughtfully over his high forehead . Then he reached out , and laid a hand upon my sleeve . " I am in a strange position , Master Scot . To you I am going to tell the truth . But after the uproar and tumult which this sudden death engendered , I am not certain if I can tell it to anyone else . " " What truth ? "  | " The fact that Sir Thomas Warren was not slain by your dagger at all . The unexpected recovery of his strength and reason was but the final act of a dying man . He climbed the stairs , spoke with vigor and strength , returned to his bed ? and died of the strain of so doing upon his worn-out heart . A few moments after he had laid him upon that bed , he had passed away . Perhaps even before you had started upon that errand you speak of . Mistress Sylvia sat alone , and later with you at her side , by a dead father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corpse ! " " Are you certain ! " " I knew it the instant I had examined the man . There was no hemorrhage , such as would be bound to occur with a living person . You might have noted , yourself , that he lay there , with scarcely a stain of blood upon the white bed . Had he been alive , he would have bled copiously at the stroke . Also , remember , he lay straight and calm of limb . His death , therefore , took place peacefully , while he was in a coma . He would have struggled , had the steel pierced him while alive . And he had not moved a muscle from the moment he had been helped into bed by your servant . No ; there is not a doubt of the fact that he was already dead , when stabbed . " " Then you can prove me innocent of the murder ? " " Not so fast , " he replied . " I thought so , myself , when I heard of the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , altered my mind . " " Why , in heaven 's name ? " " The temper of the mob , Master Scot . They have been told that you slew the man . It will be a bolder man than I who cheats them of their revenge . " " Revenge ! Had Hopkins or Tooms told these people Sir Thomas was a warlock , they would have strung him to the gallows in an instant . " " Right ! It is not the love of the man which goads them on ; nor the thought of justice , either ; but simply the excitement of superstition and fear . Yet that is more serious to cope with than anything I know . " " Will you then leave me to my fate without a word ? " " Listen ! Having no faith in either Hopkins or Sterne , I went to Master Tooms to-day ; for , although he is a witchfinder , he has that about him which commands a certain respect . He is a busy man , with many irons in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . He listened graciously to what I had to say ; laid aside his many activities to go with me and view the body of the dead ; and seemed to agree with me in all . But he knows not , nor do I , how a trial may be prevented . His idea seems to be to hold back the business for a time , thus giving the villagers a chance to cool their anger . This , doubtless , fits well with his own plans too , for he is leaving again for other parts ere the day closes . "  | " And how , if you charge me with murder , may Mistress Sylvia Warren also escape indictment ? " " Another serious crux , which I took the liberty of pointing out to him . Tooms bade me hold her in her apartment as being very ill of shock , which I have done . " " Is she actually ill , Master Dodge ? " " No ; not ill . Like any normal and dutiful girl , she feels keenly her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his continued illness ; and also by the position in which she finds herself . When one is anxious over one 's own life , facing such a charge , even events as painful as this hold less relative importance . " " Would it not be wise if both she and her sister could vanish for a time ? " " Do you , too , believe in witchcraft , that you suggest it ? " " I know of a hiding place where they would be comparatively safe from discovery ; and one they are familiar with , and willing to occupy . Could you not get them from the Manor , and with me see that they are concealed ? " " I would be willing to aid you , but the danger is considerable ; and I see no way in which it could be managed . The house is entirely in the hands of Hopkins . Even this cousin , Roland Warren , has not been sent for ? through , of course , the witchfinders ' intervention . How could they be removed ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mistress Sylvia is not ; although her alleged illness would prevent , anyway . And her sister does not leave her at any time . No ; no liberty whatever . " " Who is allowed at their room ? " " Myself , and Sterne 's servant , who takes their meals . A physician , you know , has certain privileges which even Hopkins dare not withhold . " " And there is nothing you can think of ; no open casement ; no quiet time of night ; no secret means by which you could get them forth unnoted ? " " Impossible . " I stood in thought for a few minutes . Then I said : " Master Dodge , I have always trusted you , and now I will trust you further . Will you be willing to go , to-day , to the ladies , and tell them both to be prepared to leave their room , and go with me , at exactly one o'clock to-night ? They must be prepared , the instant the chimes ring out . If my plan fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know but you and they . Will you carry that message ? " " I will . But what of you , yourself ? " " My idea in returning was to give myself to the authorities to protect Sylvia . I know full well that I will be hunted down eventually , providing this murder charge is pressed , and appear the more guilty by keeping away . As soon , therefore , as I can arrange the escape of Sir Thomas ' daughters , I will throw myself  | upon the mercy of the law . " " That is entirely for you to decide . Meantime , I am to inform the ladies they are to be ready to leave the Manor at an hour after midnight to-night ? " " If you will . " " There is no risk for me in so doing . " " And it might be wise for you to know where I will hide them ? " " I would prefer not to know , Master Scot . " " As you will . I am greatly in your debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said with a wave of his hand . " Good bye , Master Scot . " And he rode away , across the rustic bridge .  | Chapter XXIV I HIRE A COACH AND PAIR MAKING A SWEEPING DETOUR , I hurried on to the Hunting Horn , and requested parley with Mistress Sibyl Mattison . She responded promptly , and I expected she might show some surprise at my arrival ; but she only smiled her all-embracing wolfish smile , and bade me sit , while she held my hand too long . " There is something I wish you to do for me , " I began . " First , what payment will you make ? " she rejoined , which brought me suddenly to the realization that , in my anxiety to aid the girl I loved I had quite overlooked the fact that others might not be as interested as I ; in truth , might well have reasons for going contrary to my wishes . " I do n't know , " I said . " Let me ask of you the service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fairly put . What can I do ? " " Do you know a rustic bridge which crosses the stream near Parleigh Manor ? " " In a little wood there ? Surely . " " Without asking any questions of anybody , or mentioning the fact to any ? in short , will you , as secretly as possible , ? leave daily a package of food one hun-  | dred paces north of that bridge , at the foot of a great tree on which will be cut an arrow ; food which I will pay you for now ? " " No . " " Then nothing more need be said . " " On the contrary , much more must be said . Now , Richard , any fool who knows you , and the situation at Parleigh , can see through that at once . And if you think I am going to nurse my rival at your request , you 're wrong . " " Rival ? " " Now , you know , Master Richard , that Jonathan Sterne is very vitally involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am as much concerned with Jonathan Sterne . Therefore she is my rival ; whether willingly or otherwise is not the point . You evidently believe you can get her out of the Manor ; which you can not ; and hide her in the wood ; where she will be found . Give up that idea , and get you to a place of safety instead . " " If I would be successful in doing both , you would refuse her your aid ? " " Of course . If she starves to death , or is hanged for murder , so much the better for me . " " At least , you put the matter clearly , madam . But there is one small circumstance you have overlooked . I intend to attempt her rescue , with or without your aid . In doing this I will be in position to kill this  | same Jonathan Sterne , and I mean to do it . So now that we understand each other thoroughly , I will about the business promptly . " " Hold a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger ? " " You know as well as I do that I had no hand in the death of the Master of Parleigh . In fact , I have the most conclusive proof of that . Now , Sterne and Hopkins did the deed between them , and I have a right to slay him in retaliation . And I do not double my own danger ; for the law can hang me but once , even though I am convicted twice . " " You are a hot-headed boy , Richard . " " In this matter I am certainly determined . " " Very well then ; I will do as you ask , and do it secretly and faithfully ? but the wage I demand is your protection of the life of Jonathan Sterne , now and always . What say you ? " " That it is a bargain ; except that the manner in which you play your part will guide me as to how well I must act mine . " " Give me the money , " she said . And after further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I then went to the stables , and happened upon the small but belligerent hostler whom I had remembered for his struggle with Valentine on my first visit to the Hunting Horn . After a long talk with him , and the exchange from my pocket to his of certain monies , I  | sat in a private room , and awaited nightfall ; while my newly acquired ally hired for me a traveling coach , and a pair of spanking bays . When the time for departure arrived , I mounted Val ; and , with my small friend on the box , escorted the lumbering coach to a short distance from the Manor . Then , as the hour of one approached , I secured my own horse to a tree off the road ; and having carefully gone over his instructions with the driver , I entered the conveyance , and had him drive me , with much clatter , to the Manor House door . The tumult of our approach brought one of the witchfinders ' servants to the door without our having to summon him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Master Hopkins ! " I called out in a rough voice , running to grasp the heads of our prancing cattle . " Wait ! " said the servant , and went within . Between the driver and me , we so wrenched the tender mouths of the two horses that they pirouetted about , lashing their forefeet at me , as though unusually fractious . It was too dark for me to be quickly recognized , particularly by anyone coming suddenly from the lighted hall , and I did not fear that . What did cause me a pang was that the servingman returned , bringing Sterne , instead of Hopkins , at his side . And the witchfinder was soundly rating his follower for making a mistake , and the latter was spread-  | ing his hands wide in explanation , and attempted an appeal to me , which his master interrupted instantly . " Who are you , fellow ? " Sterne called from the step . " And what do you want here ? " " From the hackney stables in the village , master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Master Hopkins asked that this coach be sent to him here , at this hour . " " There is some mistake , " he answered . " Master Hopkins is abed . Wait ! " And turning to the servant : " Up to his door with you , and call to him if there is not some error here . " The instant that the menial turned his back I unhooked a rein , dropping it on the path , and at the same time struck the near nag cruelly across the muzzle . The beast reared , carrying me off my feet ; and the driver on the box cried to the witchfinder : " Grab the line , if you please , sir ! Grab the line ! " Instinctively he hurried forward , and stooped for the leather which was whipping on the ground . With a plunge I flew through the air , and had him pinioned by the throat before he could know what had happened . The impact of our bodies sent him sprawling , and me also ; but my clutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more opportunity to cry out than had Sir Thomas Warren when that dagger found his heart . Physically he was like clay in my hands . I could .  | have strangled him with perfect ease , or broken his back over my knee ; and it was difficult for me to resist doing both . Instead , thinking of the promise to Sibyl Mattison , I swung him up , and into the coach , banging the door closed behind us . A halter rope about his arms bound them close to his body , and he could at least make no move when I let go of his stringy neck ; and even had he shouted in the closed coach , his voice would have been lost in the hullabaloo the driver was making as he plunged from his seat to secure the unhooked rein . For an instant my man went limp , and I thought that perhaps I had overdone matters ; but I slapped his face with my opened hand once or twice , smartly , and he mumbled " Mercy ! " in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know me , " I said hurriedly . " Richard Scot ! One cry to your servant , and I 'll slit your throat ! " Grabbing up a heavy burlap bag ? several of which I had placed in the conveyance ? I first thrust a wad of his own cambric shirt so deep in that grimacing mouth that an honest man would have choked to death instanter , and then drew the bag down over his head , and tied it tight with a second hitch of the rope . Throwing him to the bottom of the coach , I piled the remainder of the bags upon him , just as the servant came forth of the house again . Leaping to the drive , at the coach-door opposite to  | the Manor , I spoke , as though to Sterne within . " I am sorry , sir . I was told Master Hopkins said it was for him . I knew of no ladies in the matter , sir . I 'll tell your man . " And I called to the waiting underling : " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking them to the gaol for safe keeping . " The fellow turned , and I had time only to run about to ask my driver if all was in readiness to start , when Tamzin and Sylvia appeared at the door . Unfortunately the first servant , who was at their side , was further accompanied by two more . There was nothing to do , however , but carry on with a high hand . " Master Hopkins said there was some mistake , " began the first of the gillies , but I cut him short as I grabbed the girls each by an arm , and hustled them into the diligence . " It 's all explained now . ' T was Master Tooms who sent for them , it seems . The gentleman inside will see them safely housed . All right , my man ! " And I sprang to the box beside the driver as his whip lashed out , and we rumbled away at a good pace . I thought , when I spoke , that the name of Timothy Tooms would hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get under way , and I was right . But with the tail of my eye I saw one of them sprint back into the Manor to tell the matter to Hopkins , doubtless . Little I cared for that , now . We would be pursued , of course , but , with a two minute start , I could beat them at that .  | Before I could take a deep breath again , we pulled up at the spot where I had tied Val , my horse . Down I sprang , and very unceremoniously hauled forth the two daughters of Sir Thomas Warren . Then bidding the driver whip his way smartly to the home of Roland Warren , and deliver his bound passenger there , I aided Sylvia and Tamzin speedily into a field bordering the road , and we all three sank down in the darkness behind a hedge . " It 's you , Richard ! It 's you ! " whispered Sylvia , gripping my arm , and trembling . " Oh , what does it all mean ? We are so frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little , " I whispered in return . " Tamzin , are you there ? It is so dark , thank heaven , I can not even see you . " " I 'm all right , Dickie . How long will we stay here ? " " Not long , I trust . " " And then ? " " You must lie quiet somewhere , until I , and some friends , get you away to Overmead . Do you remember taking me to that witch 's little cottage by the brook , Sylvia ? " " And the apples ; yes . " " You two will be safe there for a time , do n't you think ? " " It 's worth trying , " said Tamzin . " They can only find us and take us back . I 'd rather be in gaol than in Parleigh Manor with Hopkins and Sterne , just now . "  | " Then , let us first go to the cot ; and there I will explain what vague plans I have . But we had best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are followed . " " And we are , " said Sylvia , drawing closer to me . " Listen ! " Sure enough there was a clatter of horses ' hooves on the roadway near where we crouched ; and I know that my own heart beat fast as I thought of Valentine ? tied near by ? calling a cheering whinny to the oncoming steeds . For once , however , he behaved as he should , and was as quiet as a mouse . The approaching cavalcade , composed of not more than a half-dozen riders , was not moving rapidly ; and near where we cringed they stopped entirely , and one man dismounted with a lantern in his hand . " Here are the marks of the coach wheels in the dust , sir , " I heard him say . " The fellow said , To the gaol , ' and I believe that 's where they 're headed . " " We must overtake them , at all events , " said Matthew Hopkins ' heavy voice . " Press on ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The fellow with the light remounted , and they all spurred away up the road . When they were well along we came forth ourselves , and cutting across the fields , the two maids on Valentine 's back while I led him ( which seemed to surprise him into a modest and seemly demeanor ) we made the wood easily , without detection , and began a search in the blackness for the path to the cot .  | Here I was of no assistance at all ; so I took the horse well within the trees , and hoppled him securely , where he could stand or lie as he chose . Tamzin eventually found the overgrown way ; or at least , had sufficient sense of direction to guess how we should go ; and I headed the file through the tangled undergrowth , suffering many trips and scratches . We finally reached the brook , into which Tamzin promptly slipped and wet her shoes and stockings thoroughly . But when the cottage was eventually discovered , and the door locked by us against intrusion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutter , and the girls had thrown aside their cloaks , we all felt safer and bolder ; and I , for one , happier in the presence of my love , than I thought such a night 's adventure could possibly leave me.  | Chapter XXV THE COT BY THE RILL " AND NOW , DICKIE , " said Tamzin , sitting with her skirt tucked up and her wet , shoeless feet on the warming hearth , looking about twelve years old , or less ; " And now , Dickie , what are your plans for us , and for yourself ? " She was perched upon the one stool the room afforded . I had moved for them the bed , forward across the fireplace , and on that Sylvia and I sat , side by side , my arm about her yielding form , her fragrant head upon my shoulder . Now I must only turn my face to touch her cheek with mine ; to sense the sweetness of her perfumed breath ; to tenderly reach her slender throat with hungry lips , and shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . And all of these most frequently I did ; while her sister sat by , sighing now and then , yet taking no heed , apparently , either of my infatuated overtures , or the submission with which they were received . It may seem strange , but nothing had been said as yet , by either Sylvia or myself , of love ; nevertheless , all seemed arranged and moulded to my heart 's desire . It was as though our troth had been plighted long before ; and still this joyous moment held all that sweetness of the first caress .  | And seated thus , I told them of my departure , on the night of their father 's death ; and of my ride toward Overmead , with Nathan Knapp . Also I spoke of overhearing the remarks of the hostler at the inn , and my decision to return ; but I did not mention my meeting with Jenkyn Wyrrall , or the few remarks which passed between us , because I feared that Tamzin might suffer with the thought that he , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to her every wish , was thus proved but a craven when she required him most . Then I went on to my return , and the meeting with Master Dodge , not far from the very spot where now we sat . They were deeply interested in the assurance he had given me , that Sir Thomas had actually met a natural death , and how the evidence of his presumed murder had been turned against Sylvia and me ? undoubtedly by Hopkins and Sterne . It was this same kindly young physician who had carried my message faithfully to their ears , for which we could thank him for our present freedom , however short it might last . I further told of how I had hired the coach ; and how the driver had agreed , for what I paid him , to carry the bound witchfinder to Roland Warren 's , and ask the latter to come to Parleigh and take what charge he might of the affairs of his dead relative . What the outcome of this ride might be for the driver I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place all  | of the blame where it actually rested , on me ; and if he stuck to his story that he thought the whole matter an elopement , and knew neither Richard Scot nor Sir Thomas Warren , he should be made to suffer little for his part in the business . Neither of the girls , up to that time , had known that Jonathan Sterne was lying , during their short ride , in the bottom of the coach ; and they both assured me that , had they been aware he was there , even though tied with iron gyves , nothing would have forced them into the conveyance . Since the hour when I had ridden from Parleigh , leaving poor Sylvia senseless from the shock of her father 's death , neither of the witchfinders had come to their room , nor communicated with them in any way ; but , on the other hand , a man had been stationed at the door with instructions to see they did not emerge , and they had been absolute prisoners . Dodge had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sylvia 's life ; but nothing else could he do but what he had done , at my suggestion . They had asked him many questions regarding the funeral arrangements for Sir Thomas , but nothing he knew , and they were still uninformed if he had even been buried . For reasons known only to myself , I doubted if he had been , but I did not wish them to dwell upon this mournful element of the case , and simply said I had so far learned nothing . Sir Thomas Warren had been a kind ,  | albeit petulant , father to these two , and they were stunned and appalled at his loss . On the other hand , their own serious position ; in the clutches of these miscreants wielding both power and panic ; had made the blow less terrible to them in the contemplation of their own doubtful future . Mostly we all spoke calmly of what already had , and what still might , happen . And more than any other thing this quiet faith incited in me a courage and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon me ; ! II and revealed their entire confidence in my will to aid . Tamzin , kindly , sisterly in her attitude toward me ; Sylvia , yielding , passionate , crying that if I should be accused , she would stand , and if needs be , die at my side . That , I believe , was the one occasion in which our tensed emotions overpowered us all for a moment ; but we were soon composed again , and tranquil in our words and deportment , at least . It was indeed a strange night that we passed , there in the little bower , we three . I , who know so little of feminine ways and wants , charmed with their sweetness , moved at their sorrows , touched at their thoughtfulness , stirred at their courage . Tamzin slept at last , a little heap of gleaming loveliness , half hidden , half revealed , in the flickering light of the sputtering dip . Curled in the corner of the chimney place , with her tiny unshod feet toward the glowing ash , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less solaced with the  | comforts she exacted . And while I could not forget that , in regard to the visit to Master Timothy Tooms , she had lied prodigiously , there was an immature innocence about her which precluded suspicion . Sylvia never closed her eyes the night through , although I begged her often to rest . " I could not sleep , " she whispered , pressing closer in my arms . " Perhaps , who knows , this may be our last dear night together , Richard . Hold me close , my love ! All that I have been through in these last few days , of fear and danger , and at last of death , is naught to what I fear may come to you . It was my love which called you back when first we met . It was the greater love of mine which brought you from your home , to aid poor me . And now , having placed you in this danger , and this dread , how can I ever rest until I know you 're safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wood , my sweet . And though you would have loved me not at all I came , because my heart lay at your feet . It was the longing in my heart which drew me on to Parleigh once again . A selfish heart , my dear , which took no heed of welcome or of want , as long as I might satisfy my need to see you , touch your hand , and harken to your voice . Since that most precious night , wherein we said farewell ; and you , in the moonlight , gave to me your lips , I 've dreampt this dream , unworthy as I was for its fulfillment . To hold you so ; to kiss your hair ,  | your eyes ; to sense the flutter of your lips with mine ; to feel your pliant body in my arms . Now comes the consummation of my fantasy . The pavement of this cottage turns to gold ; about my heart celestial seraphs sing ; no heaven of my conception could be more than holding you , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we sued and plighted , until the sun struck with a yellow gleam upon the closed shutter . It was broad day , and I must be upon my way . Tamzin awoke , and shook those curls which matched the sunlight , angry that we had let her sleep while we sat by and watched . There was no question that it was best for me to go at once , and no other alternative was considered . They feared the danger of my riding the countryside , not knowing that I was bound for the village , to surrender to authority . The temptation to dash to Overmead , now that these charges of mine were out from the blighting grip of the witchfinders , was almost irresistible ; and there I could muster many a blade to my back , and speedily clear Parleigh of this villianous brood . But my home was far away ; and the men there stanch , but slow to move from their own comfortable firesides . And what authority could my father 's followers wield in Essex , save that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , with their own long swords , a victory ; Parliament or the King would soon be driving us back in disgrace of civil strife . And the days necessary to fly to Overmead , and return were  | too long to leave Sylvia and Tamzin unprotected at the cottage . No , to the gaol for me ; and let them there proceed against me as they would , if in so doing I could protect my love from their merciless clutch . I do n't believe I ever suffered a greater pang of fear or regret than when , in the enchanted wood , I kissed Sylvia a tender farewell ? and Tamzin , too , although I do n't think I ever mentioned that to Jenkyn ? and untied patient Val from the copse where he had , for hours , waited me . I had time then to laboriously carve upon a nearby soft-bark tree the symbol of an arrow , and point it out to Sylvia as the spot where food would lie . And after I swung into the saddle , and flew at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , and dread , and bitter strife ? to Parleigh Manor .  | Chapter XXVI I HEAR OF ROBIN THE SHEPHERD I SWUNG DOWN before the great door at Parleigh Manor , and the first thing I noted was the coach , which had carried away Jonathan Sterne the night before , resting peacefully by the entrance ; and some gillies were taking from it a chest or two , which told me that Roland Warren had at last taken charge of the estate of his dead cousin . Recognizing one of the servants thus occupied , I enquired of him where I might find this gentleman ; and was shortly ushered into his ' presence in the main hall . He was a quiet , studious-appearing person , past middle life , who appeared so utterly at sea in the affair that he was in a state of almost speechless confusion . I did learn , however , that Sterne had arrived at his home the night before , still bound in the conveyance , and discovered merely by accident . He was almost smothered in the burlap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parleigh as yet . The driver had told Master Roland of Sir Thomas Warren 's death , which was the first this good man had learned of it ; and he had driven back to aid in any way he could . Now he found that his relative had been murdered , his two daughters had disappeared , the household overrun with  | the witchfinding gentry , and all in confusion . The addition of my presence , when I introduced myself as the man who had bound Sterne , and was suspected of not only abducting the daughters of the house , but of slaying its master as well , was anything but a help to him at the moment . He was as courteous to me as he had a right to be , under the circumstances , although I could see he thought my proper place was in custody . So I relieved his anxiety at once by asking for an escort of Parleigh men to the gaol . This he very promptly granted ; and I was desirous of their convoy , as I did not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arriving at the small stone building in the village ( crimes of any nature must have been rare in Parleigh , judging from the size and general management of the prison ) I was met and delivered to two good-natured gaolers , who , in turn , brought me to the one ground floor room the structure contained , admitted me , and locked the door at my back . This room , barred of window , was light and clean ; and contained but one other malefactor beside myself ; namely , Robin the Shepherd . " Well , Robin , " said I , as cheerfully as I might under the circumstances , " it would seem that you are here for a confession that I do not believe you ever made ; and I , for a murder I never committed . " " Ah , " he answered , sadly , " I doubt me if you can  | ' boozle the judges , sir . They be hard , they be . " " We can but trust in God , who is all-powerful ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak , I fear . " " Why , I fear no man , an he tell the truth of me , sir . But they have turned that which I love best in the world against me ; and that pains me sore . " " What do you mean ? " I asked . " Well , you 'll pardon my bringing up her dear name in such a place , sir ; but there was the kindness that Mistress Sylvia Warren showed me from time to time . Her telling the kitchen help at the Manor to let me have the broken meats for food ; her paying me high for little errands I might have done in gladness for her ; her kindly greetings to such as me as she rode by of a morn . That was the truest thing in my whole life , sir , my respectful reverence of her ; but they 've turned it into a wicked matter ; said that she was a witch , and that I was another . Soiled and muddied the purest thoughts of my heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just dwell on how lovely she always has been , and always will be , Robin . At least you and I know the truth of her , no matter what is said . " " You 're right of it , but it makes me sad , ne'theless . And then , too , that a poor dumb beast should be the death of the master he so faithfully served . That 's not just fair , sir . " " What mean you ? "  | " My good dog , Wager , Master Scot , " he replied , mournfully . " And how may a dog be evidence against you ? " " Clear enough , alack ! They have told me that he is no dog , but the very devil himself . Told me that ; me , who trained him from a pup ; taught him to fetch and carry ; and to mind the sheep when I lay in the sun . Alas , Master Scot ! ' I taught him too well . He learned to do more than other dogs may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barking at the cooks ' til they tied on his neck such bread and meat as they could spare . And when the load was not enough to his thinking , harder he 'd bark , until they gave him more . Then , through the meadows he 'd come to me , jumping proudly ; wagging his bushy tail . There we would open the victuals together , for never would he touch aught until I gave him leave . And together we would dine like kings , Wager and me . " " And because you had trained him in these tricks , they claim you are a wizard ? " " Aye , sir . You see , I was a lone man , and poor . Nothing I had ; nothing I might call mine own ; save just this dog , Wager . He loved me . Loved me like a mistress . I was , to all else , a slave . Even the sheep I tended belonged to Sir Warren ; and they were less of a servant than was I , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went empty . But of Wager , Master Scot , I was the master . He was my  | slave . And because I knew how hard it was to be a lowly serf , I dealt with him as I had hope that some good master might so deal with me ? in kindness . And Mistress Sylvia , who loved all horses , dogs , and stanch , dependent things , saw how he served me true , and liked him well . Many 's the time that she has tied about his shaggy neck a silver penny , and he has come , his head held high in pride , bearing it to me . Then to the inn I 'd go ; and for the time be , with wealth in my pocket , a man among all . Now , alack , my goodness to him , and his faithfulness to me , will hang me on the gallows . " " Be of better cheer , Robin , " said I , speaking with more assurance than I really felt . " The kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain , than placing a rope about your neck . Tell me , whence did you have this dog ? " " No soul have I ever told , here in Parleigh , how I came by Wager . But you will I trust . Therefore , heed ! I come from Lyme , away in Cheshire . My mother was a turnspit wench in the kitchen at Lyme Hall , scarce yet sixteen when I was born ; and who my father was I never knew . As a little child I sat , I remember , turning the spit with my mother , stirring the drippings in a copper pan , fetching and carrying for the host of cooks who served the great house of Lees there . Then , as I grew , I was chased from before the fire ; and lived with the herders , out among the  | cattle . At fifteen I was big and strong , and they made me tender of the sheep , as here ; except that there at Lyme Park I had a score for every one that Parleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a man indeed . " " About the fire , when I was young , and out among the men on summer nights , the story was told of how the great Piers Lee , a doughty knight , was saved in battle many , many years before . Belike you know the tale ? " " No . It is new to me . " " It seems that , years and years ago , the English went to France to make a war . And the French had at them on a field named Agincourt . Full five to one the enemy outnumbered us , but men like this Piers of Lee were no wit daunted . The night before the battling armies met , the rain came down as though a second flood ; and in the dawn the mud there lay so thick that steel-dressed men sank to their knees in mire . E'en so , the English archers formed attack , building about themselves a hedge of out-thrust spears , whose hafts were driven in the earth beneath the ooze . In vain the Frenchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were driven , floundering in the clay . And when , at length , disorder cut their ranks , these English archers ? tossing bow aside ? drew forth the hatchets from their leather belts , and slew until the earth was thick with dead . Sir Piers Lee , he of Lyme ,  | was foremost in the fray , and sorely stricken . Down from his horse he fell , unconscious , sinking in the slime . Further the fight had moved , leaving him there to drown , or perish at the hands of wandering foes . When he had come from Lyme , he 'd brought his horse , which now had fled , ? and a favorite dog , a mastiff of great strength and shrewdness . Over his fallen body now this faithful dog took vigil . With snarling throat and gleaming fangs he fought off those who meant his master harm . And when the night came on , he still remained ; warming the pain-racked body with his close caress ; lapping at the wounds and barking back death , defiant . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since , at Lyme Hall , these dogs have had their honored place . No other breed is cared for , as is this ; and jealously they guard their mastiff blood . " " And from these Wager springs ? " " Yes . Although , were it known at Lyme , he would be slain for crossing this pure breed . When I was still a ' prentice at the herding , my master , an old shepherd , died ; and left to me a great northcountry sheep dog : Maid of Battle . Shaggy she was , and cunning with the flock ; fearless and grim , as fitting to her name . Often , as a boy , I 'd heard the Lyme mastiffs baying in their court , but never had I seen these noble dogs . A junior keeper of this valued stock twitted me often of my Maid of Battle ; saying she 'd run from those he daily fed . I struck him for the taunt , which raised  | his ire . That night he brought one of his terrible charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trusting that it would kill my faithful beast . " " And did it ? " " Nay . Friendly they were at once . About they sniffed , then dashed toward the woods . The keeper , in fright of losing his charge , attempted to follow after ; but I , amused at the miscarriage of his evil plans , held him back , and mocked his erstwhile boasts of dreadful slaughter . Finally we heard them gamboling through the brush . I let the fellow go , and with his peaceful beast he went his way . Days passed . Slower and heavier the Maid of Battle plodded by the herd . And one late night , in the hut where only she and I had shelter , she bore a pup , just one , who held the blood of the lordly strain of the Lyme Hall mastiffs . " I barred it in the hut , for well I knew that it would be destroyed if such were known ; and soon it wound itself about my heart as had the mother . And because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dogs , I called my new friend Wager . He grew until he topped this Maid of Battle overmuch ; until he matched in size the greatest mastiff in the Lyme Hall court ; until he was the strongest , fiercest , and the wisest dog that ever England saw , I do believe . One summer night , when he 'd been there a year , the Maid of Battle lay at the open door , while Wager sat with me , licking his chops for supper . Suddenly I heard the ping ! ' of a gun-bolt split the air . My faithful herder at the door screamed out ; then fell to kicking , mouthing bloody foam . A quarrel had reached her , shot from close at hand , and almost in an instant she was dead . Out from the door I bounded , armed with the strength of fury . Through the woods I raced toward the hall . And just as the outer keep was reached I saw a form slink in the gate ; a man who threw one side his weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior keeper who had brought the dog . I charged the entrance , caught him by the throat , but instantly was dragged off by the other keepers . I told my tale , but he denied the charge ; and I was driven off , to weep my loss . " But in my telling of the former visit I had made mention of the whelp I reared . A few nights hence , I heard the baying of a nearby dog , so fierce , so deep of throat , it could be none but the killers , trained to destroy all other dogs which bore their blood . Alone he came , sniffing the dank night air , led by this selfsame keeper . Wager had never tasted battle yet , but in his eyes there burned an eager spark . A blow fell on the door . Open ! Open , and let your hound come to the Lyme Court mastiff ! ' I held my peace , my faithful friend and I hugging close the floor . Then , Crash ! ' And the door was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The night was starlit , but the hut was dark . I  |  | only saw , through the square that marked the door , the great beast spring within . Like a lion roaring for its prey it came ; eyes shining , soft of foot and teeth agleam . And then a scream went up to heaven as never did I hear before or since . A wrestling , panting , moaning in the hut beat me in sorrow to my knees ? and fear ! When my poor beast was done , and that great killer had his taste of blood , would then his keeper call him off ? Ah , no ! And he could say my death lay in the dark . In panic , then , I sprang toward the door . But the victorious brute , fresh from the torn throat of his dead adversary , leaped like a meteor out upon the hillside . And when I reached the entrance , quaking , crushed , I saw a sight which made my hair rise up . There , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wager . The death of the Maid of Battle he 'd repaid , by killing both the mastiff and his master ! " Calling the dog to heel , I fled away . Over the land I hastened , fear , and the beast , at my back . Far I went , but finally settled here . Perhaps ' t is long forgot . Perhaps ' I was to blame ; I do not know . Belike this fix , in which I find myself , is just , because my Wager killed a man .  | Chapter XXVII I AM TRIED AS A MURDEROUS WARLOCK THE FOLLOWING MORNING Robin the Shepherd was taken away to be tried by the witch court , and I sat alone all the day . Food was brought to me , and some cool ale , which was refreshing . The windows were too high for me to see out , and there was nothing I could stand on , like a stool . I might either walk about the small room , or sit on the floor , as I chose . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; lifting and falling like a distant murmur of the restless sea ; and I judged this to be the crowd at the trial . Further than that I knew nothing . Often footsteps came and went about the building , and always there was the rather irksome whistle of a most unmusical guard , who never left the small wooden enclosure before the door . Each time this individual brought me food , I asked him how Robin 's trial was going ; and each time he said that he did not know . I took this to mean that I was not to learn , and decided to ask no more ; but as he did not come in again after sundown I had no opportunity to test my powers of reticence . Some time after dusk the guard was changed at the entrance . Robin did not return , however , which had me believing at one moment that he was acquitted of the  | charges , and the next , that he had been summarily executed . I walked the floor the best part of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken by some court officers , and , after a hurried gulping of food , led forth to my trial . The court was held in the open , that all men might hear ; and as the day was dark , with an occasional drizzle , the setting was dismal as well as grim . To my amazement and consternation , I found I was to be tried , not for the murder of Sir Thomas Warren before a proper judge , such as Sir Hubart Johnstone ; but for " sorcery and witchcraft against a Knight of the Realm , and high treason in so putting him to death by divers means , in detriment to His Majesty the King . " At such charges the civil judges , like Sir Hubart , who was present , could do naught but look on ; and Hopkins , or Tooms would conduct the entire proceedings , as I knew they had against Robin the Shepherd . The indictment against me had been carefully drawn ; wherein I was accused of the following witcheries , to wit : " That I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master , thrown down noted wrestlers , breaking their bones ; of which fact there were sundry witnesses . " That I had thus thrown down Robin the Shepherd , although he was himself protected by an evil imp . " That I had ridden on my horse , with Robin , over the trees to the witches ' sabbath ; to which Robin would bear evidence .  | " That I had touched one Jonathan Sterne , who had immediately fallen into a state of trance , and had later discovered himself many miles from where he had formerly been , although he knew not how he had been so conveyed . " That I had aided the disappearance of two women from their home , and concealed them until they were lost to this day ; their death being supposed . " That I had stabbed to death Sir Robert Warren , knight , of Parleigh Manor , Essex , while he lay ill in his bed . " That I had remained over his corpse in the darkness , performing certain evil and horrible rites , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other charges , held in reserve , I believe ; but these were deemed sufficient to cause me to be done to death , providing they were clearly proved . And to that worthy end this august court now convened . Justice Hubart Johnstone , Witchfinder Jonathan Sterne , and two other judges graced the bench . One of them was Tooms , I supposed , but I did not know which . Only the Witchfinder , however , was in authority to judge witchcraft ; the others were merely to see that the laws of England were not violated . And as these same laws allowed of my being burned alive if the witchfinders thought wise , there was very little that they might do to help me . Master Matthew Hopkins , as the Witchfinder Gen- eral , presented the evidence against me , decided what witnesses should appear against me , and decided for the court , with no assistance from the judges whatever , that no witnesses might appear in my behalf . Also , he warned all present , anyone who ventured to express agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any manner their leaning toward my cause , would be immediately indicted as a witch . That I had thrown the champion of the Bury St. Edmunds Fair , and broken his collar-bone in so doing , was testified to by both Hopkins and Sterne . Justice Johnstone begged leave to ask me if I admitted this act , which of course I did . I explained that I considered myself an accomplished wrestler , and had learned such tricks of hold . And , furthermore , my opponent had struck a stone on the ground , which had actually caused his injury . The Justice enquired further , where had I learned this art ; and I replied , at the university . " But , from whom ? " asked Hopkins . I was only able to say that what prowess I possessed came from practice , and a natural aptitude . The witchfinder then pointed out that I had learned from my master , the devil ; and that he had also placed the stone where Pruden might fall upon it . I demanded that proof of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of the substances of the earth so aiding me attested that it was not my power alone which pre-  | vailed ; therefore , a compact with the devil could naturally be considered logical . The second charge , of having so thrown Robin the Shepherd , I likewise admitted ; and the fact that he had confessed himself a witch , and must have been protected in this encounter , again pointed to my guardian as being of a very superior kind . I then made offer to duplicate this feat , either upon Robin or any strong man present , and to explain the hold , and the leverage employed . This led to a deep discussion , on one side the judges present , and on the other Hopkins and Sterne . The eminent Sir Hubart Johnstone believed that I had the right , under the English law , to illustrate that my actions were governed by natural laws , rather than by supernatural agencies . And in this argument he was sustained by the two other Justices who sat at his side . But Matthew Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to my being charged with the murder of Sir Thomas Warren , I might then demand that I be allowed to kill a man present , to show how this already dead man met his fate . A long time was taken up in this debate , much to the unrest of the many persons present . And eventually it was decided that I would not be given the right of illustration ; but the judges must take my willingness to do so into consideration when finding a verdict . With the two judges who would decide my fate being Hopkins  | and Sterne , I most thoroughly realized how much that decision would influence their opinion of my guilt . That I had ridden Valentine over the tree-tops to the witches ' sabbath , and borne Robin with me , was read from the shepherd 's confession . I asked that the man himself be brought as a witness against me , and again the civil judges supported my wish . They were overruled , however , as the witness in this case ( which I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it was possible I might cast some spell over him , as he confessed I had done before . Therefore his testimony , dictated to Hopkins , was more valuable in that form than by word of mouth . " I demand that the horse in question then be brought , and examined , to prove that no wings could grow upon his shoulders , " I cried . But Hopkins stooped , and held on high an acorn . " Behold this , " he cried . " Examine it as you will . No man may say that it shows evidence of limbs and branches , leaves and fruit . Yet , plant it in the ground , and you will raise a mighty tree . Because the animal , to our eyes , shows no evidence of wings , it does not prove the devil can not raise them at his will ! " Jonathan Sterne testified as having been touched by me in the night , at which he fell into a trance , and was found bound in the boot of a coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he had been rescued by a certain Roland Warren . And , further , it
