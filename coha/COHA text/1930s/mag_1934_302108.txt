By last week the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council , a wholly private agency sponsored by President Roosevelt to sidestep the international embarrassments of Title II of the Securities Act , had two solid achievements to its credit . <P> Shortly after an irascible holder of a German bond tried to attach the S. S. Europa one day last January , the Council dispatched Lawyer Laird Bell to the Berlin conference between the German Government and John Foster Dulles , acting as representative of the U. S. banking houses which had issued German bonds . Upshot of that conference was a slight increase in interest payments on German dollar bonds and a promise by the German Government that it would cease treating European creditors more handsomely than U. S. creditors . <P> To represent holders of $380,000,000 defaulted Brazilian dollar bonds at conferences in Rio de Janeiro , the Council dispatched J. ( for Joshua ) Reuben Clark Jr. , Mormon lawyer from Salt Lake City who succeeded the late Dwight Morrow as Ambassador to Mexico . The negotiations involved all the 100 or more issues comprising Brazil 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bondholders were also represented . Upshot of this conference was a pact segregating the various issues into eight classes on which service on all but one ( old defaults ) will be promptly resumed in whole or in part . A few Federal issues will pay full interest and sinking funds charges . The rest , including most State and municipal issues , will pay from 7% to 50% of the interest due . Slicing about $75,000,000 per year from Brazil 's external debt service , the pact will run for four years , after which another will be negotiated . <P> Max Winkler , foreign bond expert , flayed many details of the pact , claiming that since the U. S. buys 70% of Brazil 's annual coffee exports , U. S. creditors deserved better treatment . And no sooner were the terms of the decree published than British bondholders also began to grumble . <P> Just back from Rio with the pact in his pocket , Mr. Clark last week was made acting head of the Council in place of Raymond Stevens , who was granted a leave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
