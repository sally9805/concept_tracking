Mother ( adapted by Bert Brecht ; Theatre Union , producer ) . The Red Russians may run their trains off the rails and foolishly crack up their super-airships , but their Revolutionary Theatre , with more than 50 houses filled every night in Moscow and stock companies by the hundreds performing throughout the provinces , is by all odds the world 's most active and inventive . With an imitative eye on its spiritual mother , the Theatre Union has produced Mother , adapted from Maxim Gorky 's novel of an illiterate old woman ( Helen Henry ) * who , once she gets the hang of things , turns out to be the best Marxist of them all . The play 's subject matter is no more radical than the technique by which it is presented . <P> Mother is divided into 18 scenes , scenery for which is starkly expressionistic . Visible batteries of lights play on bare drops , while overhead a cinema screen is used to describe the locale or to exhibit significant photographs . In the wings , also visible , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary anthems at the conclusion of each episode . <P> Like most experiments , Mother is thrilling for a while . Along about the sixth scene , however , playgoers indifferent to or agnostic about Communism begin to feel that the production is solemnly , insufferably pretentious , that the narrative of the old woman who loses a son and a husband but still gallantly waves the red flag has not been written up to its exciting possibilities . <P> Abide With Me ( by Clare Boothe Brokaw ; Malcolm L. Pearson , Donald E. Baruch , A. H. Woods , producers ) . Up to last week the meanest , man to walk a Broadway stage in a decade was Stanley Vance , central character of The Dark Tower ( TIME , Dec. 4 , 1933 ) . Vance , a homosexual sadist , kept white mice in his bedroom , cowed a family living in one of Manhattan 's fine old gloomy mansions , finally sent his poor wife into a trance . <P> Abide With Me , which provided Manhattan 's most gilded opening of the week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a psychopathic drunkard called Marsden ( Earle Larimore ) . He did not keep mice in his bedroom but he killed bugs when a boy . He , too , terrified the inhabitants of a gloomy Manhattan mansion . Marsden had been abused by an equally liquorish father when a child , which accounted for the fiendish campaign he put on to terrify his wife ( Barbara Robbins ) into giving him a son of his own to torture . Since Marsden makes no effort to temper his dangerous lunacy to the other five members of an excellent cast , they all have good reasons for shooting him . In the middle of the last act some one finally does . This event brings relief from much tedious psychiatry and gratifies those spectators who like melodrama . <P> <P> *In private life , Mrs. Elisha Cook Sr. , mother of capable Juvenile Elisha Cook Jr . ( Ah , Wilderness ! , Crime Marches On ) .
