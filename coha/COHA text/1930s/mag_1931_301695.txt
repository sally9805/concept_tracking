Broiling sun beat down on Hankow , China last week . It was nearly 100 . On the roofs of their rickety houses , Chinese hoisted scraps of cloth for shade and gazed glumly at muddy water , five to 15 feet deep , that roiled through the streets , stretched as far as they could see . On rafts made of doors , on treasured family coffins , on crude inflated goatskin life-preservers , on junks and sampans , refugees from outlying districts were cruising aimlessly . An Associated Press man went about in a sampan to see what he could see . At one point his boatman nosed up to an aged couple , up to their armpits in dirty , pestilential water , told them to move aside . They signalled him to run them down . Suicide is hateful to Chinese , but everywhere one saw them hopelessly , apathetically killing themselves . <P> As the waters of the Yangtze , swollen by last month 's rains-rose to 53.4 ft. , ten feet above flood level , and continued going higher , relief agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's great central plain , an area 500 by 1,000 miles was affected by the floods , not only of the Yangtze but of the Hwai River to the north . Homeless were 30,000,000 people ; 10,000,000 were utterly destitute , with hundreds dying daily . Eventually , it was estimated , the death toll would reach 2,000,000 . Pestilence was abroad , was to become worse . Hankow ( pop . some 800,000 ) and its sister cities Hanyang and Wuchang were doomed to destruction : houses were collapsing everywhere , mud walls on which refugees perched were slowly sinking into the floodwaters . The three cities had enough cereals for three weeks . A little meat , no vegetables , no ice . The power plants were in danger . <P> The National Flood Relief Commission under able Minister of Finance T. V. Soong , worked busily . The Nationalist Government , already harassed by rebellion in the south , disaffection in the far west and money troubles of its own , arranged to float a $15,000,000 bond issue , provided $600,000 in ready cash . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations Public Health Service cabled an offer of epidemiologists and supplies from stations in India , Indo-China , the Dutch East Indies and Japan . Emperor Hirohito of Japan sent $27,000 . The Asiatic fleet of the U. S. Navy was mobilized for emergency work and to look after U. S. citizens ( the New York Times counted 896 in the district , all safe , most of the women leaving for mountain resorts , the men remaining to watch their property ) . The Navy helped out by keeping Hankow in touch with Shanghai : Chinese telegraph lines were virtually useless . A plan was under consideration to mobilize all foreign navies in Chinese waters . Also , an international river patrol will be formed when the waters begin to subside . <P> First thing to do was arrange for transportation of food . At least 5,000,000 lb. of grain per month will be needed for the next six months . Waters will recede after several months , but slowly , for the fall of the Yangtze at Hankow is little more than one inch per mile . The Hwai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Grand Canal , which , ordinarily sufficient to empty it , will keep it flooded for many a month . Crops this year are already ruined ; soon cold weather will freeze the water lying over the vast plain , and planting will be impossible next spring . Then there will be some more famine .
