DANGER-HIGH VOLTAGE . It must be realized that the plate supply of even a low-powered transmitter is a potential lethal machine . . . . <P> That warning was put into the American Radio Relay League 's Radio Amateur 's Handbook by Technical Expert Ross A. Hull . Recently Expert Hull began experimenting with television reception , assembled specially powerful and sensitive equipment to receive RCA-NBC television transmission in his Vernon cottage ( near Hartford , Conn . ) . He temporarily rigged up a 2-kilowatt , 4,400-volt pole transformer . Last week it killed him . <P> Leaving his dinner guests , Ross Hull went into his radio room , put on his earphones , was found dead a few minutes later . His body was lying on the floor , hands and face burned , earphones charred . <P> A.R.R.L. engineers concluded that he had listened for NBC 's sound , had reached under the table to plug in his power supply for pictures . In withdrawing his hand he seemed to have brushed loose a high-voltage wire , got a shock which threw him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit to his earphones , may have carried through his head more than a full ampere of current. * <P> Such an accident was possible only with Editor Hull 's makeshift equipment . Nevertheless , television 's green eye , which only last June saw its first suicide , had taken its first notable life . <P> * As little as 1/10 ampere of alternating current can be fatal .
