Among the chances for honest graft which come a legislator 's way , few are more hallowed by time and custom than mileage allowances . U. S. Congressmen get 20 per mile for traveling between their homes and the Capitol between sessions , may collect whether they travel or not . Ohio legislators get only 3.6 per mile . Vexed perhaps by that discrepancy , Ohio 's Representatives did their best to make up for it last week . Meeting for the first time since a " five-minute recess " which began July 22 , the House voted to declare that it had held semiweekly " skeleton sessions " since that date , proceeded to enter these sessions in its journal . Thereby each Representative was entitled to collect for 40 round trips between his home and Columbus which he had not taken , at a cost to Ohio taxpayers of $21,507 . Dismayed were Representatives when a grudging farmer named Arnett Harbage got wind of this skulduggery , secured an injunction to forestall it . Until he learned that he would have to sue each Senator individually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also considered filing suit to force Ohio Senators to refund $5,557 in mileage allowances which they had already collected by voting fictitious sessions.
