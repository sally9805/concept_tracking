txt Appreciation of Good Reporting May I congratulate you on having such an outstanding correspondent at Washington as Arthur Krock ? To one deeply interested in , politics and public questions his dispatches are indeed a liberal education . I commend to those who want first-hand , reliable information about what is going on in politics , and the Washington atmosphere th particular , his articles in your paper .. Follow his analyses , news and comments and you wo n't go wrong in doping out what is likely to happen in the November election . His analysis of the situation on the week preceding the election four years ago was almost prophetic . I pay little attention to the claims of the politicians , but I do find I can rely on the stuff put out by a brilliant commentator and reporter such as Arthur Krock . C. E. BRADLEY . East Orange , N. J. , May 1 , 1938.
