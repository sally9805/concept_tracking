Chaotic terror in Palestine-politely called " serious deterioration " by British statesmen-moved U.S. bigwigs last week far more than Czechoslovakia 's unhappy fate did three weeks ago . Secretary of State Cordell Hull promised to consult Britain on Palestine 's future . <P> The U.S. is interested in Palestine because : 1 ) 9,000 U.S. Jews have settled there ; 2 ) some $200,000,000 collected by U.S. Jews is invested there ; 3 ) by the 1924 U.S.-British Palestine Mandate Convention the U.S. has the same right as any League of Nations member to enter objections to any change in Britain 's mandate over the Holy Land . Among 8,500 telegraphing protestants urging U.S. pressure on Britain to keep Palestine open to Jewish immigration were Representatives and Senators , five Governors , many Protestant churchmen , New York City 's Council , prominent labor leaders , hundreds of Zionists , numerous literary and political figures . <P> Meanwhile , a defiant Moslem Congress with delegates from eight Moslem countries , exultant that Arab rebels now rule large areas of Palestine , met in Cairo , demanded that Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national home for the Jewish people ' ' in Palestine , stop Jewish immigration , resign as mandatory Power-in plainer words , that Britain get out and leave the 400,000 Jews to the mercy of the 900,000 Arabs . Significant it was that the delegates journeyed to Alexandria to drink tea at Ras-El-Tin Palace with plump , ambitious , 18-year-old King Farouk I of Egypt , whose palace clique foresees for him the future role of Caliph of all Islam . <P> To the studied ambiguity of the 1917 declaration by Arthur James Balfour , British Foreign Secretary , can be attributed Britain 's contradictory rule in the old Kingdoms of Israel and Judah . A one-sentence , 67-word declaration , it promised a " Jewish national homeland " but conspicuously failed to define whether a Jewish homeland meant a home with an Arab or a Jewish majority . At first high Arab leaders , equally lulled by Lord Balf our 's vagueness , were inclined to welcome their " Semitic brothers " back to the Holy Land . <P> When Jewish immigration increased by leaps and bounds , when Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabs ' attitude stiffened . Successive terroristic campaigns were waged , a " holy war " was in progress . Exile , imprisonment , death on the gallows only seemed to increase the crusading ardor of those who believed the Prophet 's promise : " Whosoever falls in battle , his sins are forgiven ; at the day of judgment his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion and odoriferous as musk and the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by the wings of angels and cherubims.
