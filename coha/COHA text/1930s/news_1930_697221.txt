txt ? Tlllnols ' long awaited and widely advertised special legislature came into being today with a message from Gov . Ernmenson asking for an amendment to the state constitution which shall give to future legislatures the power unrestrictedly to levy all manner of . taxes .

" The general revenue act of 187 ' 2 , as modified by the revenue act of 1S98 , provides fixed schedules of calendar dates for the various steps in the assessment of property for taxation and for . the collection of taxes . Due to the reassessment in Cook county , the 1928 assessment has been so much delayed that it is impossible to comply for a number of years with the dates fixed by law . The 1928 assessment normally would have been completed toward the end of 192S ; it was completed about ten days ago . " One bill amends eleven sections of pthe act of IS9S , the other fifteen sections of the general revenue law of 1872 .

" The various taxing bodies have ant , icipated the collection of taxes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue system . The statute permits the anticipation of 75 per cent of the taxes ex-. pected . " The reassessment of 1928 has so reduced the assessed valuations of the several taxing districts in Cook county that the amount of taxes which will be collected for their purposes will in some cases be less than the amount of the anticipation warrants . A Validating Measure . " 7 . Bill to validate appropriation ordinances and tax levies generally . " Appropriation bills , and resolutions providing for appropriations , and ordinances and resolutions for tax levies in the various taxing bodies of Cook county for 1928. 1929 and 1930 , were based on estimates of assessed values following generally the 1927 assessment .
