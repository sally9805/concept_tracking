When Joseph Patrick Kennedy finally settled on board the S. S. Manhattan last week to take his Irish temper to the Court of St. James , he had no fear of failing to get safely to his post . All the ship 's seamen were members of the National Maritime Union , and presumably his sworn enemies , but their spokesman announced through his teeth : " Our members wall give Mr. Kennedy every courtesy no matter what they think of his attempts to wreck their union . . . . " <P> Why C. I. O. maritime labor regards the former chairman of the U. S. Maritime Commission as a union-wrecker was made clear by the New York Maritime Council on the eve of Mr. Kennedy 's departure : Mr. Kennedy 's insistence on mediation &; arbitration of maritime labor disputes is a curtailment of the union 's right to strike . Arbitration of minor controversies arising out of signed contracts and prohibition of strikes &; lockouts ( during the duration of the contracts ) is now accepted in all N. M. U. agreements . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the union wants free and untrammeled negotiation . Therefore , to the council , restrictive legislation is a device of the shipowners , and Mr. Kennedy is their " staunch lobbyist . " <P> The bothersome matter of " quickie " strikes , the unions described as " practically a thing of the past . . . necessary a few months ago when the shipowners were leaving no stone unturned to break the back of a struggling new union . " <P> By last week the description of N. M. U. as " a struggling new union " was itself practically a thing of the past . Spawned during the sweaty struggles within the old-line A. F. of L. maritime unions , it is today one of the most successful " rank &; file " movements in American labor history . Since fall , it has won 43 of the 50 maritime labor elections held by the National Labor Relations Board . Of some 20,000 votes cast , exactly 16,325 were cast for it in preference to A. F. of L. 's drowning International Seamen 's Union and International Longshoremen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair-warming stage in union development are the 21 long and involved collective agreements which the N. M. U. has concluded for nearly 10,000 of its members . The contracts are mainly with the coal carriers and tankers , including Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey . Since fall , the union has wrangled unsuccessfully with the deep sea lines . <P> Last week it passed two more milestones : N. M. U. received a charter from C. I. 0. , and it had written to 30 steamship companies , including the big International Mercantile Marine ( U. S. Lines , Panama Pacific Line , etc . ) : " The National Maritime Union has been chosen overwhelmingly as the Collective Bargaining agency for the unlicensed personnel on your ships . It is now your duty to comply with the law ... " ( i. e. , bargain under the National Labor Relations Act ) .
