txt Further financial retrenchments to be made by the Committee of the Whole of the Board of Estimate today are expected to clear the way for a loan from the city 's leading banking houses , which will enable Controller Charles W. Berry to meet the $32,500,000 of short-term obligations falling due tomorrow . The new retrenchment program , approved at a meeting of all the members of the Board of Estimate at City Hall yesterday , may also lead to an arrangement with the banks under which succeeding maturities will be met , taking care of a total of about $150,000,000 of short-term obligations due by May 1 . The necessity for an early settlement of the city 's financial troubles was emphasized by the disclosure that Controller Berry , as indicated by the files of The City Record , had not paid any current bills , except payrolls , since Jan. 1 , because of unwillingness to expend substantial amounts of the city 's cash resources until arrangements had been made to take care of the pending shortterm obligations . The payments held up include rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The total amount is said to be large . The City Record , as a matter of routine , lists daily the voucher numbers of all bills approved and sent to the disbursement office for payment . No voucher number has appeared in the city 's official journal since Jan. 1 . It was said yesterday that the necessary funds were available , but that payment had been held up until the loan negotiations were closed , so that the Controller might conserve as long as possible for payroll purposes the city 's available cash . Home Aid for Jobless Resumed . The city 's seventy-nine home relief stations for the unemployed , which reopened yesterday after having been closed by lack of funds , were swamped , 6,717 applications for aid being received .

Under existing market conditions , he explained , the bankers felt that not only they but the investors from whom the banks drew funds must be convinced that the city was rigidly retrenching . There veils a general impression at City Hall that the funds necessary to meet all outstanding short-term obligations due up to May 1 , when tax collections begin , would be virtually assured as the result of the action of the Committee of the Whole today , even if the banks do not lend immediately enough funds to take care of the $150,000,000 total .

This " dole " method of lending . it is ' understood . also appeals to the banking groups because it will give definite assurance of strict adherence to the retrenchment policy by the city , Mayor Walker indicated that the retrenchments to be made today would by no means be all that the Board of Estimate would put into effect before Mar I.
