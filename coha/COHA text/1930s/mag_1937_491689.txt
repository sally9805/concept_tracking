WILLIAM HAROLD TERRY always was a good businessman . On an early day in November , 1898 , in the Terry home at Atlanta , Georgia , the nursemaid smoothed the pillow in the new baby 's crib and offered a nice warm bottle . But William Harold was not going to sell himself short . He had n't learned to talk , of course , but he made signs and stood off the nurse . Finally she understood . William Harold was asking , in no uncertain terms , what was in it for him , And now that same William Harold Terry , the baby-faced businessman ballplayer , who ran the ability to keep an eye on the ball and the future into the best managerial job in baseball , has won two pennants and a world championship during his four full years as leader of the New York Giants , and has proved the wisdom of taking all front-office shackles and restrictions off the man who directs a ball club . Terry has proved many things . He has presented rather strong evidence to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows more about his men and his needs and his problems than anybody who sits up in the office ; that the field general ought to have the final word regarding trades and the hiring and firing of ballplayers . And he has proved , furthermore , that , though ii may he true what they say about . a soft answer , wrath is n't going to handicap a manager of a baseball team , even when that wrath is multiplied by the combined circulation of most of the newspapers . For Terry , while winning his pennants and making much money for his club owner and stockholders , has , during his spare time , caused gentlemen of the press to set many new world records for the standing and running high dudgeon . Terry is one of the few boss men among baseball managers . Certainly he is the only one in the National League and , with the exception of the venerable Connie Mack , there is no field general in either league who has as much authority as the manager of the Giants . The victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hottest National League race in years , must be accepted as a triumph for Bill Terry . Smart Swapper I T WAS Terry who took the club when . John McGraw retired in 1932 and quickly whipped it into the world-championship team of 1933 . And it was Terry who tore apart the club in 1935 and , by smart trading , obtained the replacements necessary to make it a winner again in the National League in the 1935 season . Three trades which would not have been approved by any board of directors , vice presidents or many business managers made the Giants what they are today ; and when the transactions were announced there was much arching of eyebrows by baseball men and observers , who thought that power and authority had gone to Terry 's head and , perhaps , softened it a wee bit . When Terry took the club from John McGraw , it needed a catcher badly , and so Terry looked around and decided that the man he wanted was Gus Mancuso , then second-string backstop with the St. Louis Cardinals . Most major-league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branch Rickey 's reputation as an astute dealer in baseball flesh . Bill Terry Keeps His Shirt A T BASEBALL meetings , when a man is seen in conference with Rickey , it is considered good wit afterward to ask him if he still has his shirt ; the implication being that when you swap haberdashery with Rickey , you 're likely to wind up a nudist . But Bill Terry was n't afraid , and though it seemed that he was pitying a heap for his whistle when he gave Bill Walker , Jim Mooney , Ethan Alen and Bob O'Farrell for Mancuso and a recruit pitcher named Ray Starr , Bill knew that he had what he went after  --  a good , serviceable , intelligent catcher , young enough to he good for many years . Mancuso is still catching for the i tiants , and though he never will be ranked with the Hall of Fame receivers , he is given no small amount of credit for the success of the New York pitching staff . On the other side of the ledger , the Cardinals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the next weakness that developed in the New York machine , and again Terry was willing to give a seemingly large price to get his man . He picked Dick Bartell , of the Chillies. and before the 11135 season be had ohtinned the shortstop by throwing in cash with Blondy Ryan , Johnny Verges , George Watkins and Pitcher Fez-sulk ) . The observers said Bartell was n't that good , but Bartell plugged up that hole in the New York infield and is better than he was at Philadelphia . Meantime , however , Hughie Critz had grown old and brittle , and Terry needed a now second baseman . Again he scanned the rosters , and decided that Branch Rickey and Sam Breadon , of the Cardinals , had just the man the Giants needed , in Burgess Whitehead . Before the trade was arranged , observers cautioned Terry about Whitehead . They told him the young man , though a brilliant fielder , lacked the stamina , to play 154 games and , above all , not to weaken his pitching staff 112 THE SATURDAY Goya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a first husband 's uncle travels Europe , picks up Naples fisher-boys pictures , a little Rousseau and a tops Goya and do n't know the difference ! And was I seared she finds out this is the one I 'm after ? Oh-h ! would she held me up ! " The happy dealer sighed with loud relief , thinking of this hairbreadth escape . Then he lighted an expensive cigar , called Gus Huss , unctuously told him to convey the Queen of Spain to Mr. Hollins 's apartment , and took Georgina with him to her desk in the reception room for dictation . " Come too , Howie , " he said . " I got a question . You springs on me the wort ' etticks . ' Would it be etticks Mrs. Pella tries to stick me behaving like sweetness , so it 's all right I behave like sweetness , too , flowers and lunches , so as to make me a reas'nable profit acquiring the Goya for practical nothing ? merely to get a reserve infielder like Whitehead . But Bill Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary second baseman , he did break up his pitching staff , giving LeRoy Parmelee , a regular starter , to the Cardinals along with Phil Weintraub , Allyn Stout and Al Cuceinello . They were calling Bill Santa Claus by this time and asking rhetorical questions about what he was going to use for pitchers , and laughing as the answer . But Terry had made another good trade . Whitehead made the New York infield . With the graceful gazelle at second , Bartell was able to cover more ground , and the combine tion had much to do with putting the Giants into the World Series . They think more of Terry in the St. Louis office since that . trade . Parmelee was undependable in the late months of the race , and one of the first things Rickey did when the season ended was to trade the strong-armed right-hander to the Cubs . If Terry had wanted to trade Hubbell , he could have made the deal . If he had wanted to throw in another pitcher fur Whitehead , no one in the fiont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Giants ' strength . It is doubtful if any other manager in either league would have been permitted to make the deals that Terry made . Cautious vice presidents would have insisted that he was giving too much for Mancuso , for Bartell and for Whitehead . If Brooklyn is negotiating a trade . there are so many directors to be consulted that before they all are reached . it is too late . It was a public secret that Frank Frisch wanted to arrange a trade with Brooklyn for Joe Strips ) , but the St. Louis front office said no . Had Frisch had the power that Terry has , he would have obtained Stripp , and the third baseman easily could have made the Cardinals the season 's champions . It is the same with most of the National League clubs . Charley Grimm was made a vice-president of the Cubs for a time , to give him standing with his players , but no extra authority went with the title , because there already were too many vice presidents , and finally Charley asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it , Howie ? " " Well , I  --  I suppose ? " Howard began , uncertain ; but the telephone on Georgina 's desk interrupted . " Mr. Rumbin 's secretary speaking , " Georgina responded . " Just one moment , I 'll see . " She covered the mouthpiece with the palm of her hand . " It 's Mrs. Pella . She wants to ? " " Wait ! " Mr. Rumbin strode hastily to the outer door , left it open and spoke from the corridor . " Tell her I just gone out , Georchie . Ai n't I making it true ? " Georgina addressed the instrument : " He 's just gone out , Mrs. Pella . . . Oh , yes , any message , of course . " Then she was kept listening for several minutes , during which Mr. Rumbin stepped noiselessly back into the room , closed the door , and seemed again to be upon a strain . " I 'll tell him , " Georgina said , finally . . . " Not at of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned it . Brooklyn managers have had little to say since the late ' Wilbert Robinson was at his robust peak ; Charley Dressen , at Cincinnati , merely takes orders , and in St. Louis . Rickey determines the personnel of the ball club and then gives Frisch free rein to handle the available men on the field . The flaw in such an arrangement rests in the fact that the manager of a. ball club knows , or should know , more about players than anybody can in the front office . The manager sees players day after day . He sees players on each opposing team in twenty-two games each season . The front-office man , in contrast , sees them only occasionally . The vice president may hear that Joe Doque , of another team , is a clubhouse lawyer , a trouble maker , and he may hear it from so many sources that he believes it and does n't want Joe at any price . The manager , on the other hand , knows that Joe 's great trouble is an all-consuming desire to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complains about errors , and wrangles with other players and even with the , manager . To the field generals , Joe is a winning ballplayer , but he 's a Bolshevik to the vice presidents , and so , " no " is the answer to any trade suggestion involving Joe . Baseball 's Big Businessman Terry , who , while he was in the ranks , reasoned only in the terms of a player 's value to a club and the compensation for services , and who figured in several stubborn holdout sieges , quickly slid over to the other side of the table when he was made manager and was expected to see things from the moneychangers ' point of view . He has been a splendid businessman for the Giants , never overlooking a chance to add to the club 's revenue . Each spring he leads his troupe in a cash tour of out-of-the-way towns and villages whore major-league baseball is a novelty . The exhibition tour is a pain in the neck to the player . He sleeps in a different bed or in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of hotels and trains . But it 's good business for the club . The March 21,11757 all . Good-by . " She turned to her employer .

" Mr. Rumbin used his handkerchief to dry a pale forehead . " I 'm going ' Tlentie City  --  you do n't know where , Georchie and Bowie . I got to rest . I 'm gone a week ! " " Yes , but ?

" larger towns have been milked dry by barnstorming major-league clubs . The money now is in the villages , And so , no spot on the map is too small for Terry 's Giants if the guaranty is large enough and the security ample . However , there again you have an indication of the power and authority that are Terry 's . When the Cincinnati Reds inaugurated night baseball as solution of their financial problems , all the other clubs agreed to play one game under the floodlights  --  that is , all other clubs but the Giants . Terry said it was bad for the game and bad for the players to play night baseball . Another thing that marked Terry as a manager who would succeed when he took over the reins from the great John J. McGraw was his handling of personnel problems . One arose with Bill 's appointment as leader . Bill and Freddie Lindstrom had been bosom friends , roommates . But it was generally known that Lindstrom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was whispered in many quarters close to the throne room that when and if Mr. McGraw stepped down , Lindstrom would step up . And so , when a typewritten notice was posted in the clubhouse at the Polo Grounds , June 3 , 1932 , that , effective on that date , Bill Terry was manager of the Giants , it was a shock and a disappointment to Lindstrom . Lindstrom was still one of the best players in the league , but Terry quickly saw that the situation was intolerable , and before he started his first full year as manager , he traded his former roomie to the Pirates , It was stern and all that , but Bill Terry felt that it was for the best interests of the Giants . But do n't get the idea that Bill is always the hard-boiled egg , sterile to the roots of friendship . Not at all . He has shown that ho knows the flower . Consider the case of Travis Jackson . Jackson was a youngster with the Little Rook club when Terry , older and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an independent team . Their paths crossed . They became friends . Later they found themselves in the same infield , playing for Mr. McGraw . Dick Vidmer , of the New York Herald Tribune , tells me that Terry , ( Contruursd an Pug . 114 ) ( Conitnuod from Page 112J Jackson and Lindstrom formed a bad-boy triumvirate . They did everything together . They played tricks on John McGraw and made life miserable for Secretary Jim Tierney , and broke rules , and even hold out together one spring , pledging that none would sign unless all were satisfied in the dotted-line department . Terry 's promotion to the managerial job did n't break up the Terry-Jackson friendship . They did n't pal around as much as when both were in the ranks . Bill was afraid other players would think he was making a favorite of Jackson . But the friendship went on , and recently , when everybody was lamenting that a great courageous figure had reached the end of his career , lamenting but not doing anything about it , Terry did something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking , Jackson wanted to stay in the big leagues . But Bill talked future . There was n't any money in coaching , but . a new avenue of opportunity was open to a man who showed he could run a ball club . Some of his severer critics may say Bill was talking for his farm system . I prefer to think that Dr. Jekyll Terry was talking fur his old friend Travis Jackson and that the purchase of the Jersey City club , though a wise move for the Giants , too , was also something that Bill wanted for Stoney . Jackson was signed to a three-year contract as manager of Jersey City , and when the announcement was given to the press , Terry paid his old friend a compliment . " If Mr. Stoneham ever decides to fire me , " he said , " I hope that he gives my job to Jackson . " Nor is that an isolated instance . Terry has the reputation of being-always mindful of his players ' best interests and , therefore , is respected and well liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimportant that William Harold has antagonized many of the men who make their living writing about baseball games and baseball persons . Bill had no trouble with the writers when he was a player , and the suggestion has been made that he was so busy hieing a businessman ballplayer that be did n't have time to learn about the allied industries . But it is more plausible that while he was a player , his contact with the writers was casual . There is nothing casual about a big-league manager and the baseball writers . They are constantly on his trail , in person and by telephone . They want to know about his plans , his views , his reactions to this and that . They want color stories . Terry Disowns the Press When a manager arrives in a new town during the season , as they all do three or four times each year , the writers there want to interview him . What does he think of the pennant race ? How does he rate the home club ? Who looks like a candidate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go see that dandy new boat ? The questions got into Terry 's hair and they got into his eggs and his spinach . He became surfeited and sour . There is something paradoxical about it  --  that the game 's outstanding businessman ballplayer should show such an utter disregard for whatever value the good will of the press may have . Certainly other managers and even owners are ever ready to be interviewed , and though , occasionally , the observant scribe may suspect that they are being polite , rather than cordial , they at least make the effort . Not so Bill Terry . As early as May , 1934 , he and his club arrived in Boston one morning . Paul Shannon , who , as a baseball writer for the Boston Post , upholds the best Boston traditions of culture , called on the New York manager . Paul passed the time of day in his best Back Bay manner , and then switched quickly to baseball questions . Whereupon , according to Shannon 's subsequent narrative , Terry arose from his seat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning , be was n't going to stand for it , and in high dudgeon William Harold departed , leaving one of the most indignant Shannons that ever lived . The fact that an apology later was offered was poor salve for hurt Feelings . It was late the same season when Terry suddenly discovered the Cardinals off his rear flank . It was the last week of the race , and the Giants were playing in Boston , their lead slipping slowly but obviously away from them . The Boston American sent a girl reporter , Ann Marsters , to interview Bill . Miss Marsters discovered Terry at breakfast in the Copley-Plaza . She introduced herself and said she was there for the purpose of interviewing him . Selling Baseball in Reverse " I never grant interviews to women writers , " answered Sweet William , with what is now traditional Terry brusqueness . He remained seated and did not ask the young lady to sit down . A few minutes convinced Miss Marsters that her case was hopeless , but she remained in the lobby with a photographer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill through the palms , a shot which did him no good , portraying him , as luck would have it , at his grumpiest . Terry has stated his reasons for not granting interviews to women reporters . lie says they know nothing about sports and , therefore , would present a garbled account , attributing to him statements that he did not make . Another of Terry 's aversions is to be interviewed in his hotel on the road . He takes the stand that his hours off the ball field are his own , and that when lie takes off the uniform and quits the baseball park , people ought not to bother him . He overlooks the salient argument advanced by other baseball men that efforts ought to be made at every hour of the day and night to sell the sport to the public . In that respect , again , he is not the good businessman . I have a home and a family , too , just as Bill has , though I never sang in any choir and have no rich baritone voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I do n't like to do . It may be very distasteful for the office to phone me and tell mis that Bill Terry is in town and will I please go out to the hotel and ask him about his world-series plans , or find out if he is going to trade Carl Hubbell for Mungo . But I go with a smile on my face and pretend that it is a pleasure to talk to Terry  --  that is , I would if he would be kind enough to talk back , In St. Louis last August , Terry refused to talk to Ray Gillespie , a St. Louis writer who has traveled with the Cardinals for many years , even though Tom Meany , a New York writer , got Bill on the phone to make the eleven am. appointment . " He 'll have to see me at ' the ball park , " said Terry . The result was to cool off any enthusiasm Gillespie may have-had for the manager of the Giants . And it certainly kindled no fire of admiration or pride with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't see Gillespie at the hotel , and that is another of his faults . He seldom thinks of explaining his actions , and the result is to pile up needless enmity , or at least to kill off what might have been good will . The Giant clubhouse is the only one in either major league to which baseball writers are neither welcome nor admitted . Terry has set aside a room for the scribes where they may interview him after the ball game , and if they wish to question any particular player , an attendant sends for him . Terry says the players desire it that way , and , perhaps , they do . It certainly does n't add to the entente cordiale . After the Giants had flopped in 1934 , a wire-service story was sent out of New Orleans . Terry , visiting Mel Ott there , was quoted as saying that he contemplated no special trades , regardless of what baseball writers might be saying , and that Charles A. Stoneham , then president of the Giants , was paying him to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball writers could do a , better job , he undoubtedly would have hired them to manage it . Terry later denied flatly that he had ever made those statements , and the baseball writers , even those who bore him no especial love and thought the statement characteristic , were inclined to believe him , such is his reputation for veracity . At that time Terry was touring the country with Guy Lombardo , for an oil company , with which firm he held and still holds an executive position which pays him a very good salary . The wave of protest in all but one of the metropolitan papers was so strong that somebody prevailed upon Terry to give a " good-will luncheon " at the Hotel New Yorker . Bill sent personal telegrams to every baseball writer in New York , whether or not he was on friendly terms with him . Approximately seventy-five writers attended . Some said the move was dictated by President Stoneham , others , that the oil company was responsible , on the grounds that a man getting " a bad press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset on tour . Love Feast That Boomeranged The luncheon was held and was a great success . Terry went from table to table , chatting with the writers , and frequently huddled in a corner with this aeribe or that , ironing out feuds that had cropped up during the season . It 's a safe assertion that at no time before or since has Bill had the respect and friendship of the writers as he did that mid-December day in 1934 . But there was even a boomerang to that . It showed the writers that Bill could be friendly , and so , when he soured again , they decided that he wanted to be that way . Terry 's executive ability , never questioned by friend or foe , is attested to by the story of his rise with the oil company . Bill operated a filling station for the company and played independent baseball around Memphis from 1918 to 1921 . In three years Bill demonstrated enough ability to land an off-season job with the firm , which since has become permanent . Winning the pennant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the loser 's share , and they tell the story about Bill , which I do n't believe , that when Mark Koenig was called out on strikes in the seventh inning of that sixth and final game , Bill , stepping off third base , said to Coach Snyder , " Frank , what did you say the loser 's share amounted to ? " Terry is one of the first world-series managers in years who did no ghost writing , but while he explained that he " did n't want to hold out on any of the boys , " preferring to be available for all to interview , another story is that no syndicate or paper would meet his price . Christy Walsh told me that he did n't try to get Bill 's stories , because Bill wanted too much for himself , and New York 's writers informed me that he offered his services to the Times for $2000 , before deciding " not to hold out on the boys . " In one of his rare moments of ebullience , the night the Giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer that winning the pennant would increase his earnings for 1936 to a grand total of $.47,000 . His baseball salary is believed to be about $30,000 . Reporters in the Doghouse Frequently pictured as a singer in the choir of the church that he attends in Memphis , Terry no longer indulges in any choir singing , and has n't for several years . He still possesses a fine , rich baritone , but rarely uses it since he became manager . Early in his managerial career he turned down sizable offers to sing in vaudeville and over the radio . When the Giants clinched the 1936 pennant in Boston , Terry threw a party for the players . This was all right with the writers , who recognized the fact that their presence at such a party might cast a pall of restraint over it . Bill , however , did n't enhance his popularity by placing a. detective at the door or the private dining room with instructions that nobody but players was to be admitted  --  particularly no newspapermen . Writers were given permission to enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might record for posterity the scenes of hysteria there . Terry , who took the whole affair calmly , consented to give out his world-series plans later , immediately after reaching the hotel . The writers gathered at Terry 's room , bubbling with questions as to the sequence in which the pitchers would be used ; where would Ripple bat ; would Leiber he used , would Bill play first base himself , and so on . Knocks on the door brought no response , nor did calls on the phone . The writers withdrew to the lobby . Terry joined them in the lobby in half an hour and opened the interview with a gruff " What do you want ? " Such was his attitude that the interview lasted about seven minutes . And Bill 's stock hit a new low with those who traveled with him when they found reason to suspect that he had been in his room during the period of the knocking on the door and the jangling of the telephone . He was shaving , so they tell me , and could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do , for papers scattered through the country , have met the Terry rebuff . Harry Grayson , a syndicate writer , with headquarters at Cleveland , journeyed to Pittsburgh with a photographer to snap the prospeetive league champions , but Terry forbade EVENING POST his players to pose for Grayson 's photographer , because Harry once had written something he did n't like . The New York writers have told me that Terry reads every had written about him in every paper he can get hands on . This may explain a lot about Terry , for Bill was an unfortunate victim of what might be called a blasting era in baseball writing . Many of the old-time scribes , who wrote of the drama of the diamond and made heroes of the cow jockeys and stump jumpers from Walla Walla and Macon , had passed to their reward or to desk jobs , when Bill moved from the ranks to become head man . Much of the baseball writing was being done by young whippersnappers of the patent-leatherhair-comb age , who spent much of their time trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynicism and savoir-faire . Instead of singing of arms and men and base hits , they came right out in twocolumn-lead paragraphs and said that Terry and his Giants were bums . Then . too , it is well known that as soon as a young man is hired to write about baseball , he becomes an expert . He may seek information or counsel for a few days , or even for a season , if his rearing was good , but usually , before the first season wanes , he knows that he knows more about baseball than does any manager , and is criticizing and making suggestions under his by-line . Nobody can ask more foolish questions than a half-baked baseball expert , unless it is a fully baked common or garden fan , and the half-baked boys quickly had William Harold Terry well irked . Bill , of course , must have lacked vision , or he could have differentiated between the scribes who knew what they were talking about and the beardless youths with a managerial complex . But instead of accepting the press as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he could eliminate it all by scowls and refusals to be interviewed , While the Giants and Cardinals were playing their final 1936 game at the Polo Grounds , and Terry 's men were taking another long stride toward the October pot of gold , I asked one of the calmer Now York baseball writers about Terry 's current status with the men who place one word after another . " Just the same as always , " he replied . " Any time he smiles at us , it 's a physiognomical error . We were all atareli 17 , loss very happy yesterday in the dugout , chatting with the Giant players , Out there around us was a crowd of 64,417 persons , the largest paid attendance in the history of the National League . It was a great show , just to see those people . The dugout group included four or five writers , some of them fairly friendly with Terry . But he came scowling into the dugout and did n't even nod or say ' Go to hell ' or ' Nice crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue today . ' " John Drebinger , of the Times , seems to be sitting in the king row right now , or did n't you hear about John and his doubtful nod ? John was in the elevator at the Chase Hotel , in St. Louis , when Terry and a party entered . Drebinger was n't sure , but he thought Bill gave him a doubtful nod . John did n't have any witnesses , but as he has a fine reputation for veracity , that puts him way ahead of the rest of us . John has been very happy about it . " There 's another side to Terry , of course . Wilbur Wood , of the New York Sun , made a trip around the circuit with the Giants in 1934 . " Terry was great to me , " Wood told me . " He liked to talk baseball . Frequently we would sit up together till one or two o'clock and he discussed all phases of the game without restraint , And when the trip ended , he shook hands with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told me he was sorry I was n't going to travel with the club all season .

" And I include managers , owners and business managers . He is one of the smartest men in base- 4i ball . He knows players , he knows the ' game , he knows men and he knows business . " No , Terry does n't have to mope . Wilbur Wood likes him , and so does Branch Rickey . And what do a few enemies mean ? Across the river from Manhattan there is a ball club which , for a time , had a manager named Casey Stengel . All the writers loved him , boosted him . But they gave Casey the gate , for all the friendly press . And at the same time Terry was playing in a World Series . Perhaps the wrath of the writers is- a feeble , harmless thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
