VI I DO N'T know enough about labor to write its story , but it might help explain N RA to tell what . I think that story is . An era of westward expansion of empire ended , roughly , with the nineteenth century . The last big " opening " of Indian lauds was the Run into the Cherokee Strip in 1893 . Up to that time , at least. , any American had alternatives to despair . It was not merely that there was free land in the West . The new mushroom communities were fields of opportunity for individual initiative to men of every trade , calling or profession , or of no vocation at all . America was called a haven of refuge for the poor and downtrodden of the whole world . Our portals were open to immigrants of every race and creed except Asiatics , who were excluded sixty years ago . That is a significant exception . The Pacific Coast is still largely agricultural and only partly industrial . It is a region of individual enterprise , and it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , and they could not be admitted without importing the degraded living standards of teeming China . On the East Coast an exactly reverse philosophy prevailed . Industrialism in increasingly larger units was the rule . Men were living on the labor of other men , and the less it cost them the larger their living seemed to be . Cheap immigrant labor was thought to be the surest road to profit , and the industrial net work of the East caught the westward tide and strained it through mills and factories , keeping it as long as it could at wages a little better than European wages . Sometimes this was not very long  --  usually only as long as it took for these alien people to taste the higher standards of this country . They also could always move on west . The obvious remedy of employers was to encourage a constant stream of nonselective immigration , which poured through our portals sometimes at a rate of many hundreds of thousaods a year . The Seeds of Labor Troubles B UT not nearly the whole stream strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to demand in the mills and factories of the East at least a part of the opportunity of the West . The old industrial philosophy of high profits through low wages was stubborn , and the old arrogance of the Hamiltonian theory of an aristocracy of wealth was very haughty . Battle was inevitable  --  and it came  --  bloody and seemingly interminable . Compared with the present , the early handicaps to unionism were so great that I have never been able to see how it survived . The broad Western road always beckoned the dissatisfied . The never-failing stream of mass migration to take the jobs of any who rebelled continued , and political power of employers was so great and that of workers so small that , looking backward , the battle seems heroic . And battle it was , bloody , cruel and implacable  --  brutal days in the last great stand to exploit labor , behind which lay the shadow of slavery itself and the bloodiest Civil War in history . Blood and hatred were welded into much that we produced . One of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as air on a mountaintop from air in a coal pit  --  is the wounds and scars and hatreds and distrust and the memories of old oppressions and old rebellions left over from those days . Beginning at about the turn of the century , the bright promise of the West began to dim ; it was increasingly better for workers to stay and fight it out than to go on to more quiet sectors . Furthermore , the necessity for fighting it out became greater  --  the age of specialization , mechanization and huge integrated industrial units was upon us . As has been repeatedly pointed out , an industrial specialist is a cog in a machine ; when he loses his job in a depression there is almost no place for him to turn for a living , because he knows bow to do only one thing which , standing alone , has little value . The first generation of industrial barons at least ran and largely owned their own shops . Out to Moline , Illinois , Swedish iron workers used to make the whole trip from Stockholm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deere  --  Moline " ? Charlie Deere being president of the great John Deere Plow Company . He knew all his men by their first names and all their personal or other troubles , and he took care of them . Their grandchildren still man those plants . But the Charlie Deeres of fact and the Old Gorgon Grahams of fancy are over the Great Divide . The great modern industrial clusters are owned by millions of stockholders who never saw the plants and have no idea of what labor problems are . The companies are controlled as to policy by financial houses far removed from personal contact , and managed by financiers , now largely of the second generation , some of whom never saw the inside of a factory , and would not know what it was all about if they did see one . They are managed by men who are employees themselves and who have so many other responsibilities that hiring and firing have come to be regarded by them as a relatively minor function , attended to by an official far down the line of rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no bargaining in any accurate sense . The board of directors is usually composed of officials in the particular corporation or in other corporations , a lawyer or two and a sprinkling of bankers . The modern American directorate is in no sense the attentive legislative unit that is found in Britain . It is too frequently a double row of stuffed shirts , facing inward and performing the functions of a rubber stamp . Such a board sets a basic hourly labor rate derived from cost studies and competitive price schedules . These are converted into wage scales and piece rates on the basis of specification and time studies , and the result is passed down to labor like a menu in a restaurant : " Take it or leave it . That is the rate . These are the hours . The working conditions are before you . " There is no strictly uniform practice , and this method is tempered by all kinds of exceptions and differences  --  company unions , shop committees , welfare organizations and company-housing plans . Some of these industrial presidents do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walter Chrysler or Charlie Nash could go to almost any bench in his factory or Bill Irwin to any open hearth in Big Steel and do the trick almost as well as the regular man on the job . But these are exceptions , and what I have described is the rule . It is of the utmost importance to visualize this situation , because it is deep in the hearts of some industrialists that they have a vested right to continue the rule and this is a , cause of much labor controversy . But we are getting considerably ahead of the story . Buckle , in his History of Civilization in England , said that the effect of war is to accelerate natural trends . The World War did that to us . Even before the American declaration the rush for production to accommodate the belligerents was such that prices and wages in this country surged upward like the tides in Fundy . Immigration was cut off and there began an unbridled competition for labor which trebled and quadrupled wages . The old dollar-a-day school of management wailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they managed to bear up . Before long , some of the brightest of them began to discover an astonishing thing . In addition to the tremendous foreign war demand for all that this country could produce , a sudden new and unprecedented domestic demand began to appear and , after a slight lull for a few months after the Armistice , it resurged and taxed our factories beyond wartime capacity . The Worker 's Peak of Prosperity S UDDENLY industry realized that higher wages and shorter hours bad created right under its nose a market so much more active than anything ever known before that , in the period from 1921 to 1929 , industrial output and consumption per capita in the United States increased at an unprecedented rate . . . several times faster than population . In the meantime , the end of the war disclosed the probability of a mass migration . The immigration bars went up , and labor stood at the all-time peak of its prosperity . Not so for the institution of organized labor . Things went so well without organization that the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a union . For the first time , too , working men enjoyed the facilities of credit , . Installment sales and salary loans multiplied and flourished . Labor activated industry not only by spending its wages but also by mortgaging its wages . That was at a time when we were just about to " abolish poverty , have a chicken in every pot . and two cars in every garage . " The end of that pious project has been sufficiently discussed and never better than by the man who said " two chickens in every garage . " But when the avalanche came , the sapping of labor organization left labor deprived of any refuge , and although employers were asked by President Hoover to delay the threatened wage and work cuts of the 1929 disaster , there were vast inroads into pay and employment . There is not a destructive price war , no retrograde movement in industrial production , no vicious downward spiral which does not immediately result in degradation of the economic status of workers . There is only one place from which the sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out of labor . It is something that both labor and industry should learn and cherish . The business of industry is the business of labor . The success of labor is the success of industry . Whether they think so or not , labor and management are partners , and until they think and act as partners , we can never have peace , nor can we stabilize prosperity . There is never a proper question of what is the most labor can get out of management . The real question is what is fairly necessary to the success of the joint adventure . There is never a proper question of what is the least that management can pay labor . The real question is what is the most it can pay to support its own markets and to live against competition . From what I have seen in NRA , I am sure of these deductions , but I am equally sure that the remarks on this industrial partnership amount to little without three indispensable conditions : 1 . Code organization of the whole industry . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . A complete and conclusive system within the industry for settlement of labor disputes , local , regional and national . The Conditions of Industrial Partnership I THINK that I can prove this . Consider a company in an industry with either a company union or an outside union which does not cover the whole industry . Let us suppose that the management wants to co-operate with the union to the uttermost . How far can it . go in raising wages and shortening hours , or in any other improvements in labor conditions which will increase its cost of production ? No matter how degraded the condition of labor in that industry may be , that-one company can go exactly as far as other companies in that industry with which it competes , and not one step farther . All the strikes and lockouts which attempt to make it go farther can have only a single effect  --  to throw it into bankruptcy and kill for its // employees the goose that lays the golden egg . But there are no such limits on what can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Code Authority and the heads of the union can sit down together like partners in a business and plan what working conditions and wages they can permit throughout the whole industry without impairment of consumption and , hence , of production of the product of that industry  --  which is to say , of employment in that industry . That is always a business question of the first magnitude , and that is why I was so disappointed by the action of the union in the second textile strike . They wrote demands which , if granted , were as sure to decimate production and employment as the sun is sure to rise tomorrow , The picture in bituminous coal is an entirely different story . That whole industry has serious and threatening competition . with crude oil , gas , electricity and , even more significant , with constantly increasing efficiency in the combustion of coal . Does anybody suppose thatlohn Lewis does n't know that ? He has lust as much interest in it as the Code Authority . He fights for that industry just as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is getting stronger every day , and it was compounded of a wider variety of more bitterly warring elements on both the industrial and the labor side of the table than existed in any other industry in this country . That industry was in a hotter spot than any other . It is far from being out of the woods , but it is so much better off than it was in March , 1933 , that there are no words in which quickly and adequately to make the comparison . All of which leads to one very definite statement about NRA  --  to the extent that it has been honestly and effectively applied , it has removed the wages and hours of labor from the lowering effects of industrial competition . Labor as a Commodity It is of interest to note that several important British economists recently remarked to a friend of mine that if there had been done in England for coal , oil and textiles alone what NRA has done here , instead of an inferiority complex on the accomplishment , the British Government would hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking leaves out of the NRA hook . The trouble with us is that while we win the 100-yard dash with a spectacular sprint we just are n't there on the 440 and the marathon . It was meaningless for Congress to say , in the Antitrust Acts , that " human laboris not a commodity of commerce . " Of course it is a commodity of commerce . The moment it develops a surplus , the price goes down . When there is a shortage , the price goes up . It is imported , exported and shipped from spot to spot . When PRA ? Presiden t 's Re-employment Agreement  --  went into effect , the result was to say to every signer : " Compete as you will , but not by cutting wages below the minimum . " The Codes say the same thing . It is the greatest single contribution of the New Deal to economic stability in the United States . If a labor unit confined to a single company is absolutely free of suggestion , influence , favor , or domination by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such freedom has been set up or selected by a group of employees , it is authorized by the Recovery Act , and any attempt by any Government official to interfere with it is wholly unlawful . But I must in frankness say that I have doubts that there are very many of such free unions in existence . The real trouble about company unions is that they give to neither management nor labor the full benefits of the Recovery Act , because they relieve neither from the competition of the cut prices , of any other company , derived from reduced wages and increased hours . The Thorny Section 7 ? A The relationship and the atmosphere in respect of 7-A is Far from right , and it ought to he cleared up . The most potent cause of seething unrest is hopeless confusion in the welter of contradictory interpretations of Section 7-A . Mr. Richberg and I jointly made one . The President confirmed that in the automobile settlement . Mr. Garrison reversed the President . Then Mr. Rich-berg reconciled the NRA and Garrison interpretations by inventing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , reconciled nothing , but greatly increased the confusion . Then a court reversed Garrison in the Houde case . Then Mr. Richberg commented on that in still another interpretation , which has been hailed by the highly conservative press as " clear , " but which , to my mind , is a " yes and no " conundrum which adds nothing but perplexity . It is highly important to decide the question beyond peradventure , because it is causing more bitterness and loss of time , money and production , and bad administration , than any single force . The only authority that can now clear it is Congress . I think that the right of free organization should be made unequivocal .. that compulsion should be prevented . that two parallel unions can not function in the same shop . If a new statute provided for a Code agreement that , where a substantial majority of workers belong to a particular freely chosen union , the employer should recognize no other parallel union , most of the problems would be solved . For the present highly unsatisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame . I am going to criticize management first . Time after time , in all the long and painful sessions looking toward industrial peace , I saw mature men get up and walk out of a room because they would not sit at the same table with labor men , even though it was once in the presence of the Secretary of Labor , who was doing her conscientious best to restore peace . I would sit down with the devil himself , if I thought it would make hell any cooler . Industry is not going to he able to avoid collective bargaining with unions . Managers must manage , but there is no reason why they should expect any less give-and-take trading in purchasing human effort than they expend in buying steel to make plows or catgut for fiddle-strings . So to trade is not to " let employees run business " any more than 1 would he running Henry Ford 's business if I dickered to sell him tons of carpet for his cars . Organization of both industry and labor to the ultimate is the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced . I think Indus ; try should confer , not as to how to combat the inevitable but as to a way that would be most acceptable to it and still meet the economic requirements of the country . It should take the initiative to and the most conclusive effect . Next I am going to criticize labor . When the President laid down the basic policy of NRA , he said , " . . . the first move expected by the nation is a great co-operation of all employers , by one single mass action , to improve the case of workers on a scale never attempted in any nation . Industries can do this only if they have the support of the whole public , and especially of their own workers . This is not a law to foment. discord , and it will not be executed as such . . . . We can safely . . assure every industry which now moves forward pronaptly in this united drive against depression that its workers will be with it to a man . " Industry moved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of strikes pulled without even stating a grievance . . . of agreements for industrial peace made and broken with as little regard for the pledged word as though it had not been spoken . . . of demands made without regard to the economic possibility of meeting them . . . of strikes against the general public , strikes against a Code to coerce Government and strikes against one perfectly satisfactory employer to coerce another . I know that actions by management cited in preceding paragraphs are limitations to acts recited here , but so are these acts of labor in-citations to the acts and attitude of management . On another point both labor and management are to be criticized for jumping the gun and misleading employees about the meaning of the Recovery Act . So thoroughly did they both do this that it is difficult to place the balance of blame . Con/tiring With the President 's Name Some labor organizers oversold the provisions of Section 7-A . They told men  --  who have no time to study and decide for themselves , and who trusted their leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that or the other union , and some are still doing it . It was not true . It is not the function of Government to organize labor . On the other hand , some employers , who never before had given the slightest consideration to representation of their men in the conduct of business , rushed to initiate company unions in which every right of labor they did themselves " contrive , enact , behold . " They also told the men that this was what the President wanted . This also was untrue . In view of the President 's high endeavor , it was bad business on both sides . In spite of all bickering , great demonstrations of co-operation are going 92 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 23.193 ) 3 on every day all over the country . The President 's recent request for truce has largely been respected . In that kind of calm , the few fierce quarrels that spring up will seem to most Americans like somebody turning a fire siren in the midst of a symphony . George James of the Federal Re-servo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor farmer was plowing with an ox and a mule . The ox had a brainstorm ; " I do n't need to go on pulling . " So he lay down and chewed his cud . The field had to be plowed . So the farmer got into the yoke with the mule , The ox ambled away . At sundown the mule came home tired , but the ox was rested and talkative . He asked : " What did the farmer say ? " " Nothing . He just pulled on with me . " " Did n't he even mention my name ? " " Nope . " And then the mule remembered , " Oh , yes . A man drove along in a buckboard , and the farmer went out to the fence to borrow a chew . I remember now that he did mention your name . " " Who was the man ? " asked the ox . The mule said , " It was the butcher . " There is fault enough on both sides to make it hard to say which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field is not being properly plowed . The farmer is the long-suffering people and the butcher is public opinion , which is the really effective driving force in NIRA . The third criticism is coming to Government itself or rather to me . I was far too slow in getting adequate compliance mechanism started . As a matter of fact , it is n't started yet . I have a pile of alibis , but I am not going to use them here . There is n't any proper excuse , because nothing short of a result was required , and I did n't get that result . I was afraid of too much territorial delegation of power at first , because the greatest danger in NRA is that several aspects of it can easily be turned into rackets . I thought that if we let the actual snatching of Blue Eagles get out of our own control , it might turn out to be the biggest racket of all . I should have taken the risk and made examples of abuses . Noncompliance flourished , and the effect was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Done Also our legal department failed to get prompt prosecutions in outstanding cases . For this , also , I take full blame , as I do for any justified criticism of any department of NRA  --  the men in direct charge were chosen by me . At last analysis I was responsible for delivering a. result , and here also a proper result was not delivered . It is vitally important to get rid of the bitterness and resentment and hostility that exist on both sides of the labor-management argument . It is my firm conviction that it can be done . When the first Industrial Advisory Board , led by Swope , Teagle and Kirstein , was working , it was rapidly being done . It and the Labor Advisory Board were meeting and spending evenings together frequently , and the good will and mutual understanding that were being developed lulled me to sleep to the fact that , after they were " rotated out , " the good work did not go on . It must go on . We ca n't get to any conclusion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team of proved high caliber who have on their shoulders the heaViest of responsibilities for their side but who , through the fire of long service , see this thing in its broader bearing , ankso , have become economic statesmen . Such a team , concentrated on this problem , could solve it , and I know of no greater need in this country today . Here they are : 1 . Gerard Swope 2 . John Lewis 3 . Walter Teagle 4 . Edward TvIcGrady 5 . Louis Kirstein 0 . Sidney Hillman 7 . Walter Chrysler 8 . George Berry 9 . Bill Irwin 10 . Mike MacDonough There are plenty of others  --  dozens of them on both sides  --  but some of them will be needed where they are . I just happen to have seen these men work . I did not leave Bill Green off this list because of any doubt of equality in economic statesmanship but only because of his position as president of the Federation . R Plan for a Partnership The full possibilities are never in this world going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before boards composed of men whose training in these deadly serious problems is political or theoretical , nor by the passage of legislation attempting either to curb the movement of labor toward complete organization , on the one hand , or to , Cram some particular form or unit of labor organization down the throat of industry , an the other . If a council composed of such men as I have suggested were convened and sent clear away from any city , to confer , to get acquainted and to reach an agreement , they would return with a community of policy and a practiCal plan of action . Then , if they would proceed to carry it out as diligently as they perform their other duties , in a very short space of time we could hair* the necessary partnership of Labor , Management &; Co. formed and filr upon its way to function . If we could do that. , we would have accomplished more for this country , in both the short and the long run , than anything since the enactment of NIRA . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be written on the score card of the New Deal . You can wear out pencils chalking up all three but nobody will ever say it was n't a ball game . Criticize as we will , it has left a mark that never will rub out  --  Franklin Roosevelt has taught our people that this country belongs to them  --  not as a pleasant piece of political baloney but as a living fact . Nobody will ever again put over on them the old idea of inside groupings to run this country . If the old leaders in both business and politics would just grasp that fact and get in to make it useful to the country , recovery would come with greater speed . There is nothing whatever to fear about it . The change simply places the governance of affairs and the benefits thereof , both political and economic , more directly in the hands of the people themselves . That is of the essence of democracy . It is exactly what democracy means and has meant since centuries before Thomas Jefferson . Of course some people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age .

Our people change styles in food , clothing , furniture , cosmetics and habits of thought clear across the whole country in almost perfect unison . A flapper in Carrizozo , New Mexico , is scarcely to be distinguished from a flapper in Syracuse , New York . Our towns look alike . Within the space of my lifetime you could almost look out of a car window and tell what state , or at least what region , you were in . Now our architecture is pretty much standardized , and when it is not , you are in some showplace of affectation .

It is more of an informed and considering mind . The depression , the New Deal , and especially NRA , have gone further by way of education in homely but sound economics than anything that ever happened here . The mass mind is yearly more able to control its own destiny , less amenable to intending leaders who strive to mold , guide and use it to serve their own ends . It is better implemented to act for itself , and it is momentarily more determined that there is to be a more widely spread receipt of benefits and use of our resources and opportunities .

That is the essence of the New Deal and the aim of liberal government . Turentieth  --  Century Changes And this is triply necessary because of the astonishing economic and mechanical development of the past twenty years . The very form and power and strength of great economic unitsbillion-dollar corporations mechanized to the reduced use of human labor and powerful beyond the ability of any individual to compete with them ; chain systems in distribution blotting out any possibility of individual competition ; great medical centers ; department-store law firms  --  the entire trend away from individual enterprise , and restriction of human reward to wage or salary from some impersonal employer  --  the trend toward these things may be inevitable and is perhaps for the best , but if they can not somehow be controlled to protect the people who both serve and are served by them , then the few who do control them will conduct them with no more reference to the common good than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such purpose as they choose . The determination that this must be prevented is no academic brainstorm  --  it is a human necessity of our day and ago . If the people are to progress to a wider participation in benefits and a more intelligent functioning of the improved mass mind , there must be unity and powerful purpose , and those are infrequent in democracies . They are possible only when two essentials are present  --  pretty unanimous popular conviction , and a leadership toward which it can turn . That happened once in the war , when the aspiration was to quench a conflagration which was consuming the youth of all nations , and the leader was Woodrow Wilson , an apostle of peace , and yet , when occasion ca-me , the greatest lord of war who ever trod the earth . The conviction now is that it is time to take a nation half destitute out of what the President once called , " four years of economic hell .

His is a doctrine of action based on the proposition that American people can do anything to which they set their minds . . . something of the idea of the man who , when asked whether he thought Andrew Jackson would go to heaven , answered : " He will if he wants to . " Through the Blue Eagle the contribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do by a combined effort , instead of leaving them helpless under the bludgeoning of a great disaster . That is a human value which can not be drawn on any chart , but it ought to be the very greatest element of recovery . Napoleon said , speaking of the efficiency of armies : " The moral is to the physical as three is to one . " When he took his tattered troops up into the Alps , they were a starving rabble . But he showed them Italy . Within ten days after his first Italian campaign opened , they began destroying one splendid Austrian army after another , until they had beaten six times their own numbers , with never a defeat . That is what we could do if somebody could just convincingly show us Italy . I thought we had done it in the autumn of 1933 ; I still believe it would have worked if we could have enjoyed and continued the unity of action which we then had . What broke that up ? First , contrivances of ambitious people within NRA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Now Deal outnumber enemies by thousands to one . But the few enemies are powerful and they do not scatter their shots . They want just one thing , and they know exactly what they want  --  to scuttle the Recovery Program , make the Blue Eagle walk the plank , hoist the Jolly Roger on the Ship of State , and sail back to the good old piracy that brought the crash of 1929 and all that has happened since  --  and 1 must say with regret that just now they are making excellent progress . With the numerical odds so hopelessly against them , with the wreckage created by their leadership still smoking , there is a temptation to ignore them . But there is one way in which they can succeed  --  the old Napoleonic strategy of " divide and conquer " ? split the friends of recovery into small quarreling groups and than absorb each one in detail . NRA can succeed only if a very great majority of the people and of business not only want it but actively support it . A study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each complaint  --  a wish to retain its benefits and a plea to avoid its burdens . Almost every class is in some manner benefited . Very few say : " Away with the whole thing . " But there is hardly a group which , for the benefit it receives , is wholly willing to accept the accompanying burden . The designing leaders of the opposition know this . It forms the basis of their strategy to " divide and conquer . " They do n't like the Blue Eagle because it does give the people wider control of economic forces . The essence of their political faith has always been that people must take what these leaders choose to give them . There is not enough room in the whole country for these two policies to live side by side . Enemies will succeed if they find a way to force the vast mass of beneficiaries of the New Deal apart by playing upon the discontent of separate groups . That is the great danger . If we are to rely upon a whole people to support a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No law can do that completely . With every benefit that is received come burdens , and therein lies the chance to " divide and conquer . " Unless the friends and beneficiaries of NRA are willing to take the bitter with the sweet , they are risking all that they have gained under the Recovery Program . NRA has been the first to insist on continuous improvement in its first tentative steps . Any man who could expect within a few months practically to reorganize the greatest industrial unit in time or space and not make mistakes expects a miracle . But the way to cure faults in the Codes is not by statute , not by strikes against Codes , not through the courts , but through NRA itself . This is because , under the law , if NRA makes a mistake , the President can and will change it within twenty-four hours . The other methods either take months and years or end in bloodshed and riot . The Wedge of Farm Complaint Take the case of the farmer . NRA increased the price of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the benefit he received both from the enrichment of his domestic market and from other aspects of the Recovery Program . Yet , at a. very critical period in the life of NRA , the wedge of farm complaint of higher prices was thrust in literally between NRA and a large part of the Mississippi Valley . Another example is the attack on NRA by saying that it " oppresses the Little Fellow . " Insofar as there is Little Fellow trouble due to higher wages , both Little Fellows and Big Fellows have been burdened , but this country has got to continue employment and maintain wages or sink back into a worse depression . The benefit of living wages comes to the whole country , and the Little Fellow has been ( command ors Page 97 ) ( Continued from Page 04 ) literally snatched from destruction by other fair-trade provisions of the Codes . He should be the last to complain of the slight burden of paying living wages . Yet this charlatan Little Fellow propaganda has fooled some people , aroused some opposition to NRA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? benefits without burdens . It is arrant buncombe based on partisan desire to wreak NRA . Absurd as is all this , the perversion of the consumer situation really caps the fantastic structure of " benefits without burdens , " " divisions and conquest . " The argument runs this way : NRA spreads work by shortening hours . It raises the cost of living and , therefore , is bad for the consumer . But we are all consumers . The great majority of us are wage earners . If 14,000,000 potential wage earners are unemployed and many more are on half wages , they can consume little . As individuals they should not complain of a plan that restores their jobs , raises their wages , yet the complaints continue . Can you beat it ? A man  --  in his role as a consumer  --  should oppose a plan which  --  in his role as a wage earner  --  is enabling him to consume at all . This carries the enemy strategy of " divide and conquer " to heights that make the senses stagger . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New Dealer when he produces , but an Old Dealer when he consumes ! The epidemic of strikes is not without this aspect of seeking benefits without burdens . NRA did more in six months for both organized and unorganized labor than all the strikes and labor organizations ever did in all the previous history of this country . The only burden impcised is a little patience and forbearance . Workers ought seriously to consider this , when advised to rush recklessly into the waste and wreckage of a widespread strike . They are playing into the hands of the enemy . Industries fight for every ounce of benefit included in the Codes . But I know of some which have used every device from tricky evasion to forthright resistance to escape Section 7-A . They regard it as a burden . But if they take the benefits , they should accept the burden . If Section 7-A is a burden , it is part of the bargain they made in their extremity to save themselves a year and a half ago . p Noncompliance ! Dereliction of statutory duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to play the game in a great national crisis . It is the same old story . . . roses without thorns , something for 110thing , benefits without burdens . It permits the enemies of recovery to " divide and conquer " ; it threatens the whole program . Needless , unwarranted if not lawless resistance to the statutory rights of labor by management ; needless , unwarranted use of extreme weapons by labor when there are so many effective alternatives at hand  --  it is just another aspect of the kind of thing that constitutes the greatest danger to the whole New Deal . Like farmers , like Little Fellows , like consumers , both management and workers also must give something when they take something . They also must play the game . ? This danger from division and conquest is not a peril to NRA alone , but to all the new democracy of Franklin Roosevelt  --  to his whole ideal of popular rule . We never had it before because the bulk of us was a disorganized mob and the rest an organized appetite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . But that rally can fall to pieces in many selfish groups and , if it does , either the ruddy old gang under the Jolly Roger will sail back to power or  --  worse  --  we will get a new ride in a Mussolini model . Or the rally can break up in greater groups under extremists  --  and that way lies the Red Terror . The safe course is to maintain the leadership of the President which seeks to adjust American institutions to give America to Americans . But that can be only if his following does not thus fall apart . That must not happen . The result would be destruction and the danger is great . This means neither subserviency nor an end of opinion . It means only unselfishness , constant loyalty , and obedience to enacted law . There is a way and a very prompt way back to prosperity . It is becoming clearer every day . But the way to reach it is through Franklin Roosevelt at the head of a united people  --  to convince him if you can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . What would happen to this country were he to fail or die tonight ? Editor ' , Note  --  This is the ! sixth of a aerie , of article , by General Johnson . The next and last will appear next week . S ossmIstEs patches of stubble on the face can be as embarrassing as patches in the pants . If you do n't believe this just think back over your own experience , or ask your friends about it . Do you remember that time you thought you 'd get by without shaving  --  then met someone very important ? Did n't you feel like a tramp  --  untidy and slovenly ? It pays to look your best at all times  --  to use a blade that shaves you close and clean without discomfort . That is why the Gillette " Blue Blade " is first choice of the overwhelming majority of men . It is an amazingly keen blade  --  especially made to shave tender faces easily .

Grinding , honing and stropping operations are automatic , held to unbelievably close standards of accuracy . In fact , no expense L4 spared to make this the smoothest-shaving blade ever produced .

A trial will awaken you to shaving comfort far beyond your expectations . See for yourself , ask your dealer for Gillette " Blue Blades " today . you 'll come to another crossroad . Turn left , and three miles farther on you 'll see the highway again . Turn right on it and go five miles . There you 'll find a red filling station and hot-dog stand . Turn left and go six  --  no , I guess about seven miles . You 'll pass a big white house on a large estate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard of him ; most everybody has . Fine fellow , Mr. Jenkins . Well , you keep straight ahead till you reach Mackville . It 's not a very big place ; just a wide place in the road , you might say . My brother Bill lives there  --  he 's the mayor and chief of police . Well , there you hit the highway again and follow it ten miles to Lake-town . There 's a big lake near ; that 's why they named it Laketown . Mighty fine fishing too . At Laketown you take the old road to Hilltop Lodge . If you ca n't get through on account of Mill Creek being up , take the new road . If the new road is impassable , too , you 'll have to take the highway . When you get to Hilltop Lodge , turn left and go about fifteen miles till you come to the highway again and follow it to Reesburg . " Now , that 's what we call the short way . If you want to go the long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this highway you 're on now . "
