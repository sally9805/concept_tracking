txt General McCoy To the Editor of The New York Times : As one who served on the brigade staff of General McCoy at Juvigny and in the Argonne , I want to express my warm appreciation of your editorial " A Soldier in War and Peace . " It is a splendid and well deserved tribute to a man whose rare qualities have for so long been at the service of his country . It does not , however , mention certain additional qualities , which we young emergency officers who were with General McCoy in the line found so attractive : his charm and graciousness , his high regard for the finer things of life , his unconscious ability to inspire in us , not merely unqualified loyalty , but also genuine affection and the almost fanatical eagerness to follow him anywhere . Our service under him was a precious thing at the time ; the memory of it is priceless ! RUSSELL GORDON CARTER . Newton , Mass. , May 5 , 1936. -            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
