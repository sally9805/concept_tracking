txt HANDICRAFTS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS of verses Miss Cobb writes frequently of the " dulcimore . " ' Quotations are made from two of these poems , the first is from A Mountain Seaman : Allus-ago I yearned to view the sea . Maw had a sight of old song-ballads for To sing us young-uns , picking out the tunes On her old dulcimore . The one I liked Was that that told about the Old Salt Sea , And Ships A-Sail , and wonders of the deep . But it is in the Dulcimer Over the Fireboard that she suggests the mountaineer 's deep reverence for the instrument and its true place in his life . Dulcimer over the fireboard , hanging sence allus-ago , Strangers are wishful to buy you , and make of your music a show ; Not while the selling a heart for a gold-piece is reckoned a sin , Not while the word of old Enoch still stands as a law for his kin . Grandsir ' he made you in Breathitt , the while he was courting a maid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least one , but played , Played and passed on to his people , with only the song to abide , Long-ago songs of Old England , whose lads we 're now fighting beside . There you 'll be hanging to greet him , when Jasper comes home from the fight . Nary a letter he 's writ us , but he 'll be a-coming , all right . Jasper 's the last of the Logans . Hit 's reason to think that he 'll beat , Beat and beget sons and daughters to sing the old songs at his feet . ' The origin of the dulcimer of the Southern Highlands is unknown , although instruments of that name have long been made throughout the world . Research on the subject is rather difficult because the word itself , which can he traced back to ancient times , can not be relied upon to signify the same instrument in different periods or in different countries . Webster defines the dulcimer as " an instrument having metallic wires stretched over a trapezoidal sound board , with a compass of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammers held in the hands . " This definition clearly MOUNTAIN MUSIC AND INSTRUMENTS refers to another instrument , much more elaborate in structure and played in a manner differing from any known performance in the Highlands . The mountain dulcimer is played with a plectrum of wood or a goose quill ; in very rare instances with a bow . The best known type was made by James Edward Thomas near Bath , Kentucky . The instrument , of which this is an example , is often referred to as the Kentucky dulcimer and it may have originated in Kentucky , where certainly many more " dulcimores " have been produced in the last half century than anywhere else . But they have also been made and played for many years in Virginia , West Virginia , North Carolina , Tennessee , and Georgia , as well as in Kentucky , and probably in the mountain areas of Alabama , South Carolina , and Maryland . Reason would seem to uphold the claim that the Kentucky dulcimer originated in the Southern Highlands , and that only the name for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is possible that the Kentucky dulcimer might have grown out of an attempt to fashion with a few crude tools and limited material an instrument after one faintly remembered , rather than to have been a copy of an instrument actually in existence . This would appear to be supported by two facts : first , that no close prototype of the Highland dulcimers is to be found in the instrument collections of Europe or of America ; and second , that there are considerable variations in those discovered in different parts of the mountains . When such dissimilarities in form exist among instruments made in the same region , is it not reasonable to suppose that the instrument made for generatidns in the wilderness of the southern mountains would vary still more from its possible ancestor ? One of the most thorough pieces of research on an American musical instrument that bears a likeness to the dulcimer is that on the Pennsylvania zither by the late Dr. Henry Mercer of the Bucks County Historical Society . After tracing this instrument to sources in Germany , Holland , and France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making of these instruments in America . Dr. Mercer refers to the Kentucky dulcimer as probably having been copied from a similar instrument brought over from England about one hundred and fifty years ago . While this surmise as to // the English origin may be correct , it seems to rest rather upon the assumption that the dulcimer came from the Mother Country of many Highland forebears than upon an established fact that there was a similar instrument in England . To England , Ireland , or Scotland would be the obvious directions in which to look , but the obvious direction does not always prove to be the right one ; and might it not be possible that the Kentucky dulcimer was influenced directly by the Pennsylvania German instrument , just as some of the spinning wheels found in the Highlands were undoubtedly copied from models originally made in Pennsylvania ? Moreover , this theory would be strengthened by the fact that the Germans of Pennsylvania did migrate into the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia and occasionally into other Highland states . There are no dulcimers so old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the German zither to which it bears such striking resemblance . I t is unquestionably true that the dulcimer in the mountains has long been used as an accompaniment to English , Scotch , and Irish songs by the folk of these national strains , but that does not prove its origin . It might reasonably be that the first dulcimer of the Highland type was an adaptation from the German zither ; or , as stated before , it may have been an entirely new instrument modeled to meet the need of the Highlander for an accompaniment to his songs , which it does so admirably ? the one point about which there is no dispute . Whatever the origin , the dulcimer is now the accredited musical instrument of the Highland region and bids fair to continue in popularity as an accompaniment to old ballads . Mr. Thomas , the most outstanding dulcimer maker of the Highlands , was born about 185o in Letcher County , Kentucky . He began making dulcimers when he was twenty-one years old , continuing with considerable regularity until shortly before his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is said to have numbered the instruments . It is believed by some of his acquaintances that he may have made as many as 1,500 all told . There is no record showing exactly what disposition was made of all of these , but probably Mr. Thomas ' statement that " they went to all lands everywhere " is not too vague if we think of all lands as meaning the United States and England . Most of them , he is // reported to have said , were sold in New York because there were " more people there than anywhere else . " He sold a considerable number by mail , and these sometimes gave him trouble . His nephew at one time said that " Uncle Eddie " had made a dulcimer for the Prince of Wales , but he had not sent it yet because he did not know his post-office address . The instrument finally went , however , and Mr. Thomas related the agreeable news that " the king " had written him a nice letter " with a lot of gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said burned the letter by mistake , " so he could n't show it to anyone any more ! " Mr. Thomas made his dulcimers usually of walnut though sometimes of maple or birch , and a few of California redwood which he said came from " far over the seas . " His earlier ones were carefully put together , but time and weather have loosened some of the joints and in his late years the craftsmanship did not come up to that in the early ones . His favorite design for the holes in the body of the dulcimer was heart shaped . The decoration around the heart is painted in gold on a few of his instruments . There are dulcimers in the mountains said to be older than those made by Mr. Thomas . Jean Thomas , founder of the American Folk Song Society , reports two old players , Enos Williams and Tom West , who took part in the first annual meeting of the Society near Ashland , Kentucky , in 1930 as using dulcimers which their grandfathers had made , and she believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in the mountains . Jethro Amburgey , who has charge of the woodwork in the shops at Hindman Settlement School , and who is also a proficient player of the dulcimer , is probably the best maker in the mountains today and he learned the craft from Mr. Thomas . Jethro is a descendant of Ambrose Amburgey , who came from Clinch River , Virginia , to what is known as Knott County , Kentucky , in 1825 , and bought 10,000 acres of land at the rate of six cents an acre on Carr Creek . Lewis Hinkle of Volga , Upshur County , West Virginia , who is now seventy-nine years of age , has been making dulcimers for over fifty years . His instruments are about a yard long , often constructed from several kinds of wood . The body of one Wade recently is of yellow pine , cedar , white oak , poplar , and black walnut . The pegs are carefully carved . During the major part of his // life Mr. Hinkle was a teacher and at the noon recreational period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any discussion of the dulcimer of today should include a reference to the experiments of Mr. Niles , an authority on the mountain dulcimer . An accomplished player of that instrument , Mr. Niles has had several made in different parts of the Highlands . These differ in materials used , and somewhat in the form of the body and in other small details . Three of them are made respectively of walnut , maple , and holly wood . After working with these dulcimers and with others in connection with mountain songs , Mr. Niles believes that the original instrument differed from that of today , having possibly fewer frets and probably more than the usual three strings . On this supposition he has worked out with different mountain craftsmen a few models somewhat larger in size and with a number of improvements which give not only a wider range of expression but a much greater volume , so that the tones will carry quite well throughout a concert hall . In the old days the mountain dulcimer was not often required to carry its tones beyond the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it was used sometimes at a dance . It was essentially a personal instrument . The large dulcimer in the group pictured opposite page 242 was made at the John C. Campbell Folk School by Mr. Niles and Park Fisher . FIDDLES AND FIDDLERS While the fiddle is in no way a unique instrument in the moun- a tains , it is one of the most important and is probably played by more people than any other instrument . It is used for entertainment , for dancing , for singing , and occasionally at church . Fiddlers ' conventions are still carried on , and fiddling contests are among the popular features of every " old-folks " ' day , of pioneer meetings , and family reunions , the competition among players being the keenest of that on any instrument in the South . Knoxville , Tennessee , is an old-time center for fiddlers ' conventions . One is held annually in which there are usually from 20 to 40 entries . The judges are sometimes chosen from the audience , the contestants having the privilege of questioning any candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . A // few years ago one of the candidates was asked by an old-time player which he liked better ? the " old-timey " music or the " new fangled " music . The candidate replied that he liked them both , to which the fiddler said with quickness and conviction , " You 're out . " Other candidates were also rejected by him until one who was positive in his attitude toward old tunes was chosen . In this fiddlers ' convention each contestant had the right to play two tunes of his own choice and there was a great variety of selections , including Grey Eagle , Old Hen and Chickens , Sourwood Mountain , Turkey Buzzard , Old Blue Eagle , and Napoleon Crossing the Rocky Mountains , which several contestants chose to render . This tune seemed to be a favorite and one which it was stated was local to that part of Tennessee . This , however , proved to be an error , for it was found to be also popular in parts of North Carolina and in Kentucky . Dean William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tells this story about it : " Uncle John " delighted in playing for visitors and sooner or later he would say , " Now , I want to play you my favorite ; I calls hit Napoleon Crossing the Rocky Mountains . " One day a teacher at Pine Mountain said , " Uncle John , you mean Napoleon Crossing the Alps . " " I do n't know , maybe I do , " he replied . Sometime later he was playing for a visitor and at his usual point announced , " Now I want to play you my favorite ; I calls hit Napoleon Crossing the Rockies . Some folks say Napoleon never crossed the Rockies , that he crossed the Alps , but historians differ on that point . " Fiddler John learned to play on a gourd fiddle and in his time made several of them . These fiddles have no very lasting qualities but serve a need in the absence of any other . Many old people in Tennessee , Kentucky , and the Carolinas can remember when a " fotched on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were home-made instruments in the Highlands , but among many families it was only the gourd fiddle that was to be found , and some are still to be seen at Pine Mountain and in the neighborhood of Hindman today . Miss Cobb , whose verse is always based on facts , in " Ole Bald Eagle " refers to " Gabriel scraping his old gourd fiddle , " and in " The Christmas Tree Up Scuddy " as a part of the entertainment someone prophesies that " Granny 'll play // of craftsmen in the Highlands coming under observation in the course of this study , no other group has as large a percentage doing work without any assurance of a market as that making musical instruments . Most of the work is done rather on the principle that there is no probability the product will reach a market . The workers proceed enthusiastically nonetheless , and it is interesting and pertinent to inquire why they employ themselves in producing instruments without a reasonable expectation of money returns . A maker of violins and guitars , who employs old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not sell his instruments except to a friend now and then , but he adds , " My guitars win in contests . " A rare pride of craftsmanship ! Another who makes his violins for local distribution asserts that the pattern is an old Stradivarius dated 1721 , which " is easy to copy because it is flat and easy to shave and hollow out . " His banjos are old-time instruments with cat-skin heads . A worker of thirty-eight years ' experience , making violins of curly maple with ebony trimmings , said he learned " from books and from just working at it . " Another in North Carolina constructed a violin from wood taken from an old house built in the year 1837 ; and a man in Tennessee , who began working in a blacksmith shop at the age of twelve , picked up fiddle making from an " old fellow working there . " He plays the fiddle and makes it " just as a hobby . " A man who has been a carpenter all his life states : " I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another one in 1934 , just made them for pastime . The fiddle was of poplar , one guitar of black gum and the other of cedar ? just experimenting with woods . " The testimony of other instrument makers is interesting : I am a painter by trade but I have made dulcimers for thirty-eight years . I make my fiddles from start to finish except strings . I have never advertised my violins in any form . I do not make violins for a livelihood but it is entirely a hobby of mine . My age is sixty-five years and I have made 27 violins . I 've had a hobby for fiddles and some ten years ago began my first . // I learned by research in the field of the old masters . . . . I have made 20 or 30 violins as good as the best . . . . I do not sell . I have never sold any , but old players say they are good violins . People want them but they have no money to buy , so I make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things else and when I was a little boy I knew I could make one . I always have a buyer for every instrument . I have studied hard for over twenty-eight years . A man 's life is too short to learn it all . I am fifty-four years old and feel that I have just begun to learn . Although these expressions from makers of musical instruments are subject to varying interpretations , it is clear that their work is not motivated by market possibilities . The persistent efforts , in the absence of prospective sales , running through many of these reports written in a glowing vein emphasize the close relationship between native music and the making of the instrument that accompanies it . The solitude of the Highlander helped to link two important expressions of mountain culture ? its music and its handicrafts . // and other household utensils used in many rural homes of the region , besides the vases , candlesticks , door stops , tea and coffee sets , beer mugs , garden pottery , and numerous other articles supplied to buyers both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rough outline of the main steps employed in pottery making in the Highlands may interest the reader . The clay , whether local or imported ( for some potters bring in other clays to mix with the local ones ) , is washed and ground . Since these potteries use large quantities in making vessels of generous size , the mixing is quite a task and is usually done by mule or horse power . The clay is placed in a box with the grinding boards or paddles connected with a long shaft to the end of which the mule or horse is attached , and as he makes the circle the boards or paddles slowly grind and mix the earth to workable consistency and proportions . A clay-grinding outfit is illustrated opposite page 139 . The clay is then stored where it is kept wet , and later " wedged " or worked up into small pieces ready to be shaped by hand or turned on the potter 's wheel , as are most of the pieces . Throwing the clay on the kick-wheel is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be adequately described in words but must be seen to be fully appreciated , and in the unhurried work of the Highlands are excellent opportunities for doing so . After the piece is thrown it is set apart and dried to a point where the glaze can be applied with a brush , or by dipping , and after proper seasoning it is placed in the kiln to fire . After having been fired and removed , the articles are assorted ; some are discarded ; a few may require minor operations on an emery-wheel to remove lumps of hardened clay , although not every mountain potter bothers to do this or to level the bases so they will set square . The pieces are then stacked in bins or scattered about on tables and shelves or on the ground for the inspection of the passerby . POTTERIES OF THE PIEDMONT SECTION Some of these potteries are in the high mountains , some on the plateaus , and several especially interesting are in the Piedmont // section of North Carolina . While the Piedmont section is not , strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the base map of the area , yet there is justification for referring to it briefly in a discussion of the pottery of this region . Reference is sometimes made to the " Southern Highlander and his kin in the Piedmont , " for there are many family relationships between these sections and special handicraft practices common to each . Of these the potteries are perhaps the most important link , for frequently in the Highlands one comes across clay products made only in the Piedmont , and in several instances the Piedmont potteries make the jars , bowls , jugs , and other containers used for jams , jellies , preserves , honey , and other foodstuffs prepared by the Highlander for his own markets . Perhaps the product generally known to the public from the Piedmont section of North Carolina is the Jugtown Pottery , which has been revived and improved under the direction of Mr. and Mrs. Jacques Busbee , near Steeds , Montgomery County , North Carolina . These quaint and attractive articles have been described many times in newspapers and magazines and examples are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces are turned on a primitive kick-wheel by workmen of the neighborhood and usually are in Carolina patterns and glazes . A few forms of exceptional interest to the student of ceramics and to artist and collector , inspired by old Chinese influences , have been developed by the Busbees ; but it is the native pottery which is best known , and it is this traditional product which they have conserved , improved , and which they have made available through innumerable outlets the country over . Other potteries in this region which deserve special mention for form , color , and texture are Cole 's Pottery near Seagrove , Randolph County , and the Hilton Pottery at Hickory , Catawba County , both in North Carolina . Some of the most attractive glazes to be found in the South are at Cole 's Pottery where all the pieces are shaped by hand , most of them on the kick-wheel , and where they are fired in long , arched kilns of old type . Hilton potters also produce some special glazes including attractive combinations of gray and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold foods put up by the farm women of the Highlands . // MEADERS ' POTTERY Turning to the potteries within the Highlands , as one gets well over the mountain from Murphy , North Carolina , riding south through northern Georgia in White County , the C. J. Meaders homestead near the small town of Cleveland comes into view . It is situated on a level , grassy spot with a brook running through it , and as one approaches the place he sees between the house and barn , and the road , glistening in the sun , hundreds of pieces of bright , clean ware in brick-reds , browns , blacks , grays , tans , greens , many just out of the kiln . If one 's visit happens fortunately to be in the morning of a day when the kiln is being opened , around the entrance to the arched furnace will be found a lively group of children waiting eagerly to see what is coming out , and each , even the least ones , will now and then claim a piece and , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will deposit it in the right collection . Here is a whole family of potters , each child having learned all the operations and never missing the opportunity to shape a few pieces whenever a new kiln is to be fired . There were , when notes were made from which this material was taken , nine brothers and sisters ranging in age from six to eighteen years . It is like Christmas morning at their home whenever a kiln is drawn , and this happens about once every week in the summer . The family owns a small farm about a mile back from the road on which they get their clay and the wood needed to fire the furnace . The father manages the pottery and gives the children the practical encouragement of making whatever pieces they want for themselves or to sell if buyers should like their wares . One of these pieces , begun as a brown jug , had slumped at some stage in the operation into a candlestick , which the little boy who made it said was just as satisfactory to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone might well feel the same way ; it is not every day that one may see a brown jug turned into a candlestick . Their kiln is built of brick made from a local clay . Except for some of the glazes , which are now procured from outside by mail , this pottery is entirely a local enterprise . Mr. Meaders learned the craft from his father who owned a pottery long ago somewhere in North Carolina . He and the older boys do most of the turning 2I2 POTTERY AND USES OF CLAY on the old-time kick-wheel , apply the glazes , and do the heavy work of stacking the oven , while the children come in on different operations as they learn how and develop sufficient concentration . A later visit showed a kiln that four of the smaller children , none older than eleven years , had themselves built of native clay . While in size it was only a small fraction of the family kiln , yet it was so soundly constructed that it drew well and fired the pieces quite satisfactorily . The duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest for the wood needed for firing . Not any kind would do ; he must get the same that his father used in the firing of the big furnace , cut it up , dry it out thoroughly , and keep a supply on hand . The children stacked and fired the oven and applied their glazes . A picture of their kiln is shown opposite page 291 . A brother , L. Q. Meaders , conducts another pottery in Leo , White County , Georgia , even more crude in its operation . Most of the work is done by himself and his mule , and there is no great hurry about it . He likes to experiment with local materials and grinds his own glaze between two old millstones . One of these glazes he calls the Shanghai glaze . This he makes partly of the ashes of hardwoods from the fireplace mixed with fine clay which he calls " sedlins . " The sedlins he gets only a few hundred yards away , and all the clay he uses comes from within two miles of the pottery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which melts easily and gives a hard , smooth , dark-greenish finish , from some flint he has seen over in Habersham County about twenty-five miles distant . The kiln used by L. Q. Meaders is the type employed throughout the mountain region and also in the Piedmont section . It is 1 5 feet long , 8 feet wide , and 4 feet high . Dimensions of course vary ; a kiln is often much longer . It is made of local brick with straight sides and ends and an arched top resembling the tent of a covered wagon . In the front of the kiln is the firebox , a space about five feet deep and running its entire width . This fire space is separated from the rest of the kiln by a low wall . Behind this wall is the oven in which the pottery for firing is stacked . The kiln is opened by removing at one end an oblong section of the wall , about the size of a small door . When the oven is stacked again for firing this // small opening is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains closed until the pottery is fired and is ready to be taken out . After stacking the oven Mr. Meaders builds in the firebox a moderate , slow fire of poplar wood , working up to a hot one of dry pine for finishing . This is the usual formula , sometimes modified in the lowlands and in other parts of the mountains by the woods available . In any case the principle followed is that of beginning with a light fire and gradually building up to a maximum of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit . The firing requires about twenty-four to thirtysix hours , when the kiln is opened and the objects are taken out as soon as they have cooled enough to handle . Strong household articles still in use in mountain homes are made in both of the Meaders ' potteries . These hard , smooth vessels are especially practical in the milk houses or " mountain spring refrigerators . " OMAR KHAYYAM ART POTTERY Quite in contrast to the potteries just roughly described , in the mountains of northern Georgia is the Omar Khayyam Art Pottery at Candler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which represents the single work of the late O. L. Bachelder , perhaps the oldest potter up to the time of his death in 1935 in the South . Mr. Bachelder had made pottery for more than sixty years and had achieved a high position among American ceramists , receiving a few years ago the award of the Chicago Art Institute craftsmen 's prize for his work . His pottery was carefully modeled , was hard , strong , and finished with excellent glazes which he had worked out through long experimentation . He had two kickwheels and two kilns . Mr. Bachelder was an individualist and was not concerned with mass production ; his attitude toward his work and his feeling as an artist and craftsman is well expressed in a statement which he made upon opening his pottery at Candler : Here we have come and in the virgin forest and fields of the mountains have builded our home and our shop . Nature has provided at our door a fine clay , richly impregnated with mineral oxides , which produces a pottery of great beauty . The ever-changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sky seem to have found expression in the many-colored // shapes produced . Commercial methods of rapid production and duplication are ignored . Each piece produced is a work of loving care . The potter 's wheel , ancient of days , the head , a pair of hands , and a small piece of wood for smoothing are the only tools and in our kilns the various shapes are fired . PISGAH FOREST POTTERY The Pisgah Forest Pottery made by W. B. Stephens , a friend of Mr. Bachelder , who lives a short distance out of Asheville , North Carolina , is also the work of a single potter . Mr. Stephens ' products are not so hard as Mr. Bachelder 's , but they often have great beauty of glaze , he preferring as a rule the lighter shades . One of his most successful glazes is turquoise blue , a rare and beautiful color which he applies to both large and small pieces . Sometimes it crackles either in the kiln or later , but it is always very attractive even with the crackle . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of this kind in our country . Mr. Stephens also does modeling on some of his pieces that results in a type of pottery resembling the old cameo-ware of England , better known as Wedgwood . He is a careful experimenter , building special kilns for his work , and going to great pains to give his product an individual and beautiful appearance . OTHER MOUNTAIN POTTERIES Other potteries in the mountain section of North Carolina of the same general character as those already described , which make the receptacles and containers used in that region and some flower pots and other objects for city use , are : the Brown Pottery at Arden , Buncombe County ; the Kennedy Pottery , Wilkesboro , Wilkes County ; and the Reems Creek Pottery , Weaverville , Buncombe County . D. P. Brown , manager of the Brown Pottery , has made what is said to be the largest single vase ever produced in any southern pottery , measuring 9 feet , 9 inches around , and 5 feet , 9 inches high . Mr. Brown 's son , aged nine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sow and little ones of various sizes , " trying to make every one better and better . " In 1928 the Penland Fireside Industries enlarged the scope of its handicrafts by providing the equipment for ceramics , installing a kick-wheel and a kiln and changing the name to the Penland // Weavers and Potters . They have never produced pottery in large quantities , but have concentrated on both thrown work and tiles and have made many special pieces to harmonize with the textiles for which Penland is noted . In 1935 H. C. Ford , who had helped establish the pottery , assumed full charge and it is now under his able direction . About 20 miles from Berea College , in Madison County , Kentucky , are two potteries , the Bybee and the Waco , whose products are well known throughout the Southern Highlands and examples of which are often seen as far north as New England . These include a great many forms for all sorts of household and domestic purposes , and each pottery has a large and attractive range of colors in both smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominate . These glazes as a rule are not made of native compounds , but there is a color for nearly every use and the price range for the large variety is very reasonable . A unique individual product is the work of Mrs. Annie Latham Bartlett of Buckhannon , Upshur County , West Virginia , who took up the study of ceramics after she was well on in years and who has developed a process of hardening the native West Virginia clay without firing by mixing with it certain ingredients of her own discovery . After the pieces have hardened she applies her colors , which are oil paints , then varnishes them , giving the finished object often the appearance of majolica or sometimes almost the quality of colored porcelain . Her figures are all original and include scenes in color and arrangements of local historical or symbolical subjects . Her method makes it possible for her to model the pieces by hand , to secure a wide variety of color , and to sell them at a much lower cost than could be done otherwise . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scientifically manned ceramic laboratory installed by the Tennessee Valley Authority at Norris , Tennessee . Here they are carrying out careful experiments with the mineral products of the region , and the prospects are promising for important developments in the ceramics of this area . What this may mean to the hand potters of the Southern Highlands it is not yet possible to say , but it places within their reach unparalleled opportunities for experimentation with their native clays and minerals . // FOLK POTTERY In these rather brief observations on the pottery products of the Highland region , reference has been made mainly to the more usual objects produced for the market . Many of these are in the broad sense examples of folk art , but there are occasional creations that are especially so , instances in which children and grown-ups have made things for the delight of doing them without calculating too carefully how they may be regarded by others or how . well they may sell . Among these would be the creations of the younger Meaders children , the pigs made by the Brown children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pottery , as well as the primitive pie plates still made there , the baskets and angels done at Cole 's Pottery for the local county fair , the birds and beasts fashioned by Mr. Cole himself and his daughter Nellie just for the fun of doing them , and the odds and ends which one will see at any of these kilns only when it is pretty clear to the timid artist that the visitor would enjoy them . The pottery of the Cherokee Indians , which though not ranking high as a ceramic product , is expressive of the folk art of this tribe and is evidence of the esthetic feeling of these intelligent and sensitive people who , under the greatest discouragements , have persisted in giving expression to their impulse to creative work through their varied handicrafts . It is a satisfaction to report that steps have recently been taken to give the Cherokees better opportunities to develop their pottery by the installation of a new kiln and some equipment which will enable them to produce a stronger and more varied product . POTTERY AN OLD CRAFT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most interesting chapters in early American ceramics relate to parts of the Southern Highlands and the neighboring country , including portions of southern Pennsylvania , western Maryland , and Virginia , especially the region of the Shenandoah and that extending into North Carolina through the settlements of the Moravians at Bethabara and Salem , now Winston-Salem . While most of this territory is outside the Highland region , a considerable part is nearby and some entirely within . // the area of this study . For those who may be interested in following up a number of these early leads , a book entitled The Shenandoah Pottery is recommended , especially its supplement which contains excerpts from the Moravian Church Diary of Bethabara from February , 1756 , to September , 1779.1 These few realistic and picturesque entries give an exceedingly clear idea of the importance of the ware to the early settlers , many of whom had got along with little or none of it , and the conditions under which it was produced and made available to them .

" In these days of creature comforts , when most of us are surrounded with more conveniences than we know what to do with , it is worthwhile to turn back the pages of history which reveal what luxuries some of these now common objects of utility were to the early settlers of America . Many such glimpses are furnished by these records of the Moravians . A part of an entry of May 18 , 1778 , reads : This was a day the like of which had never yet been seen in Salem . Such a crowd had gathered that the street from the tavern to the blacksmith shop was so full of people and horses that it was difficult to pass through . The potter shop was kept closed , and the persons who had ordered pottery , had paid for it in butter , and had received tickets , were served through the window . Col. Armstrong did good service , threatening the people with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a wonder they were still ; for there were not as many pieces of pottery in the shop as there were people outside .

As many of them were here for the third day they were hungry , and the bread in the bakery had to be cut in pieces in order to help the largest number . On this occasion the store bought about 400 lbs . of butter from those who had come the longest distance , paying for it 8 d. in silver , or 2 sh . new money . Those who lived near by took their butter home with them . Soon after noon our town was clear , and we thanked the Saviour heartily that all had gone so well.2 // In the limitations of this study it has not been possible to pursue the many fascinating leads which the region and neighboring country hold for the student of clay products , but if one is encouraged to follow out his own lines of research it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most noteworthy chapters in American ceramics . // MISCELLANEOUS HANDICRAFTS THE term " miscellaneous handicrafts " as used here will embrace roughly the types practiced in the Highlands which have not been considered in other chapters . Some of the crafts included are important because of the large number of people engaged in them , as the candlewick bedspread industry , which has had a concentrated development in northern Georgia , and hookedrug making carried on in almost every part of the Highlands . Others , although they employ only a few people , are worth mention , as tanning and working of leather or the use of corn husks in a variety of ways , because with other small industries they have possibilities of future expansion . Some are indigenous , a number have been brought in , but all are a part of that ever increasing list which characterizes the handwork of the region . Among the types of work taken up in this chapter are rugs ; candlewick and knotted spreads ; needlework , crocheting , and knitting ; metal work ; objects made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; leather work ; candles ; feather fans ; semiprecious stone cutting ; and food containers . Among these handicrafts , hooked rugs and candlewick spreads have been extensively commercialized and have developed production to meet both wholesale and retail outlets , sometimes having wide business relations with department stores . They are made by individuals , many of whom sell their products to tourists or through schools and handicraft centers to buyers outside the region . Since some work part of the time for commercial organizations and in part independently , there will be no attempt to separate or segregate them , simply to indicate some of the best products with an occasional observation on the worker . RUG MAKING There are three general types of rug making ? the hooked rug , the braided rug , and the woven rug . In the hooked rug , narrow // cloth strips or heavy yarn are pushed and pulled with a metal hook through a cloth base , usually of burlap . The braided rug is made from narrow cloth strips , usually wider than those in hooked rugs , braided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewed together or interlaced to form a flat mat , usually round or oblong , sometimes small , sometimes large . Practically the same technique is employed in making small table mats and runners . The woven rug is done on a loom , and the old-time heavy frame is especially good for this type of weaving . The loom is usually strung up with a cotton warp and strips of cloth or heavy yarn are used for the weft . The best known form of the woven rug is called rag carpet and is frequently woven in long widths , as a rule through a straight weaving process . Some rugs , however , are inlaid , that is , a part of the design is put in by hand similar to finger weaving , or it may be worked out by laying in strips of weft as the weaving proceeds . Of these three methods the hooked rug is by far the most common in the region . It is probably not indigenous ; since in our country it seems to have had its beginning in New England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has also been long made and used in the Province of Quebec and the maritime provinces , and of recent years hooked rugs of high standard have been made by the Grenfell Industries of Labrador . Throughout the Highlands rug making has come to be one of the more widely practiced handicrafts . In some instances temporary factories have been established by commercial organizations which supply all the materials , select the designs , and supervise the work usually handled on a piece basis ; in others the work is taken into the homes where it is always done on a piece basis . But there are hundreds of people throughout the region who work independently of commercial agencies , making their own rugs , either from original designs or from patterns stamped on canvas obtained from the local store , the mail-order houses , or through magazines and pattern books . The technique of the hooked rug is not difficult to master , but there is considerable variation of workmanship in the finished product . The same is of course true of the patterns and color combinations ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mediocre rugs , just as he will in sections of rural 22I HANDICRAFTS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS Canada . But there are many skilful workers in the Highlands , and when leaders develop good patterns and harmonious color schemes the results are often worthy of the hooked-rug craft . The rugs around which was grouped the traveling exhibition of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild in i933 were products of the Spinning Wheel . Of these the central and largest rug was a good example of freedom in design , the workers having used their discretion and pleasure in much of the detail . The Anderson family , who live in the hills near Beaver Lake , make many of the Spinning Wheel rugs . The family consists of five members , all of whom often work together around the rug frame , deciding among themselves just how to till in certain parts of the pattern which had been left for them to " cipher out . " The quality of their hooking is excellent . Mrs. Anderson and her son are shown at work in the illustration opposite page 158 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Crossnore School since the founding of the school industries , the other being hand-loom weaving . Some of the designs are already stamped on the canvas , but others , especially for the picture rugs , are originated at the School . In this section of the mountains this craft is carried on extensively ; one journeying from Asheville to Crossnore passes many homes where rugs are hanging out on clotheslines and porches with signs reading " hand-made by the natives of the ! flue Ridge Mountains . " Along the route Mrs. Mark Hill of Bat Cave , Henderson County , specializes in rugs which she supplies to many stores and shops in the North . Some are made in her own home , but most in the homes of her neighbors . In either case Mrs. I fill exercises careful control over the design , color , and workmanship . The Rosemont Industries at Marion , Virginia , as already mentioned , ' have developed an important hooked-rug department under the direction of Mrs. Laura Copenhaver . A recent design by Mrs. Copenhaver called The Sampler is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects such as Mount Vernon , Wakefield , and others of historical interest are original with these workers . Eastern Tennessee has two rural communities which have developed important and successful hooked-rug industries through // the persistent experimentation of local women in co-operation with the Extension Division of the Agricultural Department of the University of Tennessee . In I921 at a community fair in Apison , a few women of Hamilton County exhibited some carefully made braided rugs . They were so well liked that Mrs. Elizabeth Louderback , home demonstration agent , arranged to have them shown at the next session of the Chattanooga district fair . The exhibition was organized by Mrs. F. D. Huckabee of Apison , who , to the surprise of the rug makers , sold out the exhibit while on display at the fair . Following this success the women made both braided and hooked rugs for the Harvest Market held at the Hamilton County Court House . Here more were sold and orders came in from outside until , in 1930 , the Apison community rug makers had made and sold about 500 rugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents each . More than too people were engaged in the work during that year . A similar community industry was developed at Asbury , Knox County , not far from Knoxville , largely through the encouragement of Inez Lovelace , home demonstration agent for Knox County . The work of instruction here has been largely in charge of Mrs. Huckabee , who organized the work , and these rugs and mats find a market in many states . Some of the designing is done by workers themselves , some by Mrs. Huckabee ; others are standard designs procured from commercial sources . All the work is very carefully executed and the effort to improve its quality is constant . The hooked rugs here and elsewhere are usually made of cotton rags , though wool and other materials are often combined . Occasionally old silk stockings are used , especially for the small mats and table runners . Quite the most unusual example of the hooked-rug technique in the Highlands is that displayed in the wall decorations of Mrs. Joy Kime Benton of Hendersonville , Henderson County , North Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whose experience is a fine illustration of the therapeutic value of a handicraft . Mrs. Benton had experienced a nervous breakdown , and her physician told her that hope for recovery lay in a life in the open with some interesting and not too strenuous work to do with her hands . She acquired a small tract of land in the // Blue Ridge Mountains , went there to live , and then addressed herself to the question of what she could learn to do with her hands to follow out her physician 's instructions . In the neighborhood she had seen people making hooked rugs , some of which she thought could be improved . She began work in a most primitive way . Making herself a hook with a bent nail and obtaining some canvas and rags she determined to make a rug . But what should the design be ? Looking out the window of her cabin was a view which she felt the impulse to interpret in this new medium . Getting some dyes for her rug palette she painstakingly worked out the picture . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill , and when finished , it seemed too delicate to place on the floor , so she hung it on the wall . Someone came in and wanted to buy it for a wall decoration . In time Mrs. Benton found that she had developed a unique home art . She prepared the rags , dyed them with special attention to the color needs , hooked them with care , and when completed clipped the loops of the rug and brushed out the ends to make the colors blend more effectively ; the result was a picture of interest and charm . These rugs are frequently called rag paintings , or tapestries . To earn something meant a great deal to Mrs. Benton after she had thought her earning days had passed , but an even deeper satisfaction came from doing creative work , for it helped as nothing else could in those long days of the rebuilding of her strength . I n May , 1934 , Mrs. Benton 's work won the award at the Chapel Hill Dogwood Festival for the most outstanding artistic achievement during the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nearly so common in the Highlands as hooked rugs . Those made by the women of Apison , Tennessee , have already been mentioned . They still make them , of superior quality , although the demand for them is quite limited . The small mats are also made in the mountains of Georgia and South Carolina . The Highland rag rugs and carpets that are woven on old looms are not so much for market as for home use . However , in the neighborhood of Staunton and Harrisonburg , Virginia , a considerable amount of rag carpeting is made for sale mainly by descendants of the Germans from Pennsylvania who settled in that section . // CANDLEWICK AND OTHER BEDSPREADS The most concentrated home industry and the one employing the largest number of workers in the Southern Highlands is the candlewick bedspread industry , which , as said earlier , has experienced a remarkable development in northern Georgia where innumerable families are engaged , some members working at it continuously . The ride from Dalton through Calhoun to Cartersville , Georgia , is a most picturesque one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of the highway like banners of many colors . They have foundations of white , cream , yellow , green , tan , blue , red , pink , rose , and peach , and are tufted in harmonizing colors , often with an occasional crude design in many hues . But even these at a distance are attractive in the breeze . The countless spreads displayed are but a fraction of the output of the rural homes , for many of the occupants are under contract with commercial firms to supply them on a wholesale basis , and these in turn are sold in department stores throughout the United States . A large firm with headquarters at Dalton , it is said , at one time shipped out 1,000 spreads each morning . J. Cooper Morcock , Jr. , county agent of Gordon County , which is the center of this picturesque district , writes : There are more than 2,000 farm families in this county . In 90 per cent you will find some member of the family doing bedspread work which they call tufting . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is coarsely spun cotton of many strands , about one-quarter inch in diameter . The sheeting on which a design is stamped is obtained from local dealers or bedspread companies . The women and girls , and in many instances the men when they are not otherwise occupied , tuft the design with the various colored yarns . In addition to the rural families , there are scores of people in town at work . The completed bedspreads are disposed of through bedspread companies , and many hundreds of articles including bath mats , spreads , curtains , etc. , are displayed along the highway and sold at what you might call a curb market to the tourists who travel this road . While the tufting is done in a large variety of patterns , some very attractive designs are " made up " by members ' of the family and these occasionally prove to be the best sellers on the clothesline . Recently the pattern of an attractive candlewick spread of . // white tufting on a white background was designed by the grandmother of the household and executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things out his way , and he drew a small peacock in a few simple lines to use as decoration for a child 's apron . Incidentally the peacock seems to be a favorite motif , usually two birds facing each other , with all their natural colors portrayed by the tufting yarns and often many more . Where the design originated no one seems to know , but almost everyone uses it and presumably sells it . It seems perhaps the least tasteful of any of the designs , because of its elaborate form and its variegated colors . Another kind of bed covering belonging to the same classification is the knotted spread , one in which the base may be the same as or similar to that used in the candlewick spread , but the design is put on in knots or loops and remains so . It is often spoken of as a tufted spread , but the material is not cut and frayed as in the candlewick . Bird in the Tree is a favorite design and a good example of a knotted spread . The tufted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the operation , and the knotted spreads are not new to the Southern Highlands , nor do all those being made at the present time come from the northern section of Georgia . The industry is located there but the craft is carried on in the homes of North Carolina , Kentucky , and Tennessee , and in some instances these spreads are made for sale . It is an old occupation , the origin of which is perhaps unknown , but it is referred to in Mountain Homespun ' as one of those which marked the early days of the revival of handicrafts in North Carolina , and today near Allanstand a few women still practice it . At the salesroom of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild in Asheville , both candlewick and knotted spreads are to be had , some survivals of the old-time designs , Wreaths of Roses , Bird in the Tree , Bowknots , Flowers , and Napoleon 's Wreath . A visit to the home of Mrs. W. B. Thompson , who made the candlewick spreads for Fryemont Inn , Bryson City , North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed the naive way in which she worked out most of her patterns . The . // design was founded on an old method of play once common with country children . A large sheet of paper was folded over and over again into small squares , and then some simple forms were cut through the several thicknesses which , when opened out , would yield circles , squares , or other repeated geometric motifs . This unique way of getting designs has in it a delightful element of surprise . Although most of Mrs. Thompson 's are very simple in order that the spreads which sell for $2.00 and $3.0o each may be done quickly , she has devised for herself and family other figures which were quite elaborate and very attractive . A report ' made in 1935 goes quite extensively into the candlewick spread industry as carried on in northern Georgia . In the opinion of the investigators it should be possible so to organize it as to increase considerably the earning power of those engaged in it , many of whom receive at present less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the industry is one about which the business interests are enthusiastic . It is one of the few handicrafts that have been commercially standardized . As one sees the great quantity of spreads in department stores throughout the country one would like to feel that it denotes prosperity at the source of supply , but when the low retail prices which have helped to make them so popular are traced back to their origins , it is too often discovered that the makers ' share is pitifully small . The profits are first to the department store , which will usually average about 10o per cent on the sales ; then to the jobbers , whose firms showed sufficient returns even in depression times to open several new establishments ; and finally comes the worker who in most cases is very much underpaid . Meager as the wage is , however , there are hundreds of homes in northern Georgia which depend upon it for cash incomes , and when working and living conditions are considered the small returns are more important than the figures would indicate . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with results beneficial to the entire industry . The various . // interests concerned should take up these problems and gradually work them out , rather than wait until a quick adjustment is forced that might injure or even destroy the industry which is flourishing at the present time because it supplies an acceptable article at a very low price . The adjustment should not result in raising the price of the product so high that it will no longer seem a bargain to the consumer , for once this is done the industry will suffer , perhaps irretrievably . The problem must therefore be approached in the interest of all those who are engaged in it . NEEDL.EWORK , CROCHETING , AND KNITTING There are many forms of needlework practiced in the mountains , including embroidery , applique , cross-stitching , sampler making , and a good deal of ordinary sewing . It would be possible to mention a great number of examples of work with the sewing needle , the knitting needle , and the crochet hook in every Highland state , but such a list once begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be referred to and that perhaps for a special reason . For instance , Granny Donaldson 's blanket , which is a combination of crocheting and applique , is noted because it is a good expression of folk art and reflects a delightfully refreshing spirit . Granny Donaldson , who lives near Brasstown , North Carolina , saw an Italian cow blanket , a beautiful covering with decorations of crocheted flowers sewed on a linen base . The blanket had been used in Italy to drape over the back of the family cow on festival occasions , and a fine , colorful decoration it was . Granny Donaldson became interested in the purpose of the blanket and the way it had been made and she set about to create a blanket of her own . The work illustrated opposite page 272 is the result . She is glad to make any article that she can sell , for her income is very meager , but she hardly expected that anyone would be interested in purchasing her cow blanket , for she made it to satisfy her desire . Someone admired it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another just like it . No , she was not interested in duplicating anything . In fact she would not do two things alike for any amount of money , but she would be glad " to do something else , maybe better , " for a very reasonable price . The order was placed and the result was even more satisfactory to the purchaser than the // first blanket , without having done violence to the maker 's artistic convictions . A wide variety of crocheted , knitted , and braided articles is made in the Highlands , most of it for personal or family use , but a few centers make special articles for sale ; for instance , members of the Mountaineer Craftsmen 's Cooperative Association of Morgantown , West Virginia , in addition to other novelties crochet some interesting toy animals . The students of Berea also make stuffed animals , dolls , and a variety of novelties . METAL WORK In pioneer days the blacksmith was an important figure , and in the more remote places a mountaineer had to be his own blacksmith . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances in which practically everything that is constructed of iron about the home is done on the place . Some of the shops in the towns and villages and along the roads where they once repaired wagons , buggies , machinery , and so forth , have branched out into wrought-iron work and in a few instances have found quite a demand for it . Such an experience came to the Boone family . There were four brothers , descendants of Daniel Boone , who worked as blacksmiths in the mountains near Burnsville , North Carolina . As automobiles came in , both horse shoeing and wagon repairing decreased until only two of the brothers continued to work at the old trade . Finally three sons of one of them succeeded to the business , where they made principally wrought-iron objects for household use . Their products included andirons , fireplace sets , candlesticks , door knockers , lanterns , weather vanes , and other articles in both sheet and solid metal . Now they are working separately in different parts of the Highlands . At Berea College iron work has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain boys , giving them the double opportunity of developing their skill and of making objects to help defray their school expenses . The work includes an excellent range of objects . A unique business has been built up by a Highland family in the neighborhood of Hendersonville , North Carolina , which collects // old iron from the countryside and works it up into attractive objects for fireplace fixtures and other home furnishings , the craftsmen usually making their own designs . Frank Gayhart , who runs the sawmill at Wooton , Leslie County , Kentucky , where he makes furniture for himself and neighbors , also does iron work . The lanterns at the entrance to the crafts building of the John and Mary R. Markle School were made by Mr. Gayhart . Several schools make candlesticks , candelabra , trays , fire sets , and sometimes articles in which wood and metal are combined . Among the latest to develop objects from scrap-iron is the John C. Campbell Folk School . The workers also combine copper and brass with wood , one of their best efforts being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inaugurated by the Penland Weavers and Potters when several of the boys and men were instructed in the hammering of pewter . Most of this work is plain and on simple lines but well done , and the objects are often very attractive when used with the excellent Penland weaving as a background . Articles MADE FROM THE CORN PLANT Some of the most interesting handicrafts of the region are made from its basic food plant , corn . The little patches on the steep hillsides or in the pocket valleys of the Blue Ridge , the Smokies , or the Nantahala ranges would seem to the farmer of the broad and rich lands of Iowa or Kansas , or the fertile valleys of New York and Pennsylvania , as of little consequence , but to many a Highlander they are the foundation of his existence . The corn patch furnishes food for man and beast . It is the main and dependable crop of the mountains , and as winter sets in the poorest settler will look to his corn-crib and his pigpen to carry him through . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a beautiful ceremonial as with some of our Indian tribes ; but the mountaineer , if you visit him after harvest time , will show you with eagerness and feeling his supply of corn for the winter stored away under the best shelter he can devise . Even to those who have more than corn and pork in prospect for the winter , corn is still the staff of life , and many families able to purchase a variety of // table supplies from the market will make water-ground cornmeal the main item in their larder . There are many places where better corn is grown than in the Highlands , but surely there is no place where it means more to those who raise it . And probably no people in our country have developed so many handicraft expressions from the plant as they have . Among some of the uses to which this great food plant has been put are the following : the stuffing of mattresses , the twisted and woven fibers for chair and stool bottoms , and for screens and other pieces of furniture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite page 99 . Corn husks are woven into door mats for both house and barn , and light-weight mats are made for lamps , hot dishes , and teapots . The husks are sometimes twisted into ropes and used as bed cords , and both horse and mule collars are made from them . They are also pressed out and made into lamp shades , trays , work baskets , shopping bags , handbags , and pocketbooks , also plaited and braided into attractive hats for girls and women . A great number of other objects both ornamental and useful are now fashioned out of the husks , stalks , cobs , silk , and kernels . A very light-weight fan is made of husks , and necklaces are made by stringing together some of the nicely colored grains of corn . Picture and mirror frames are sometimes made of corn stalks , usually with a wooden framework , except with very small frames when no wood is required . A woman in Tennessee makes napkin rings , bracelets , hatbands , flowers , and small fruits and vegetables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the corn-stalk and the corn-cob in home and farm are infinite , that of the corn-cob pipe being a familiar feature of the mountain scene . But the most pleasing sight of all undoubtedly is that of the rows and rows of beautiful ' strings of field and popcorn hanging in the kitchen or chimney corner of mountain homes to be used when snow lies on the hillsides and the fire on the hearth is bright . Combined with strings of shucky beans and red and yellow peppers they make the most appropriate decoration for the mountain cabin that could be devised . The use of corn husks in the making of dolls and other figures has been described in some detail in Chapter X I I , Toys , Dolls , and Miniature Furniture . // ARTICLES MADE FROM BARK , SEEDS , PLANTS , AND GOURDS There are numerous instances of the use of native barks , cones , grasses , seeds , and so forth , for home use or decoration that may be worthwhile to note . Chestnut , poplar , and other barks are employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Linville , Avery County , North Carolina . The bark is carefully cut in strips from about six to 15 inches wide , and from two to four feet long , then flattened out by piling one strip on top of the other out in the woods . When shaped and cured the bark is nailed over the log or board frame of the house , usually vertically , which gives an outside finish that resists the weather , never requires paint or stain , and the color and texture of which are in perfect harmony with the surroundings . Sometimes these natural barks are effectively used for interior finishing , a notable instance being in the community church at Crossnore . This church is a good example of the adaptation of native materials to the construction of a building , much of the wood and all the stone coming from the community . The work was directed by a pioneer Highlander , Uncle Will Franklin , father of the well-known mountain minister , McCoy Franklin . Uncle Will did not begin the church , but reluctantly took the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " outlanders " had begun by building a foundation which , when the concrete forms were taken off , on measurement proved to be from a foot to a foot and a half in error . Preacher Franklin discovered the mistake and asked his father if he would come in and take charge of the work . The father finally consented , and although he could neither read nor write , there having been no schools in the section where he grew up , he was a practical woodsman and carpenter and he finished the job according to his best ideas . The result is one of the most interesting and attractive churches in the mountains . The rafters in the construction of the roof were left exposed and the ceiling open . Instead of finished lumber to fill in between the beams , which would have been quite expensive , Uncle Will thought to use native bark , which he cut into random widths and fastened to the sheathing in a simple but attractive herringbone pattern . When asked how he came to employ that pattern , he explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then some // sideways , and neither of them looked just right to him , but by joining them up into something that was " kind of between " he thought they looked nice , and so continued that way . This section of North Carolina seems to be the only part of the Highlands where bark is extensively used for both exterior and interior finishing . The use of pine cones for making birds is not a new idea nor one native to these regions , but it is likely that the little turkeys made in a number of places in North Carolina are original with mountain people . The wild turkey is sometimes still to be seen in the Highlands . The cones which form the body of the miniature bird are usually moist and quite smooth when made , but later the warm temperature of the house causes them to " ruffle up " much as the turkey does . The color of some of the dry cones is not unlike that of the turkey 's feathers , so that altogether they are quite realistic little toys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across women and children gathering the seeds , pods , berries , acorns , leaves , and cones in which the Highlands abound and arranging them in attractive and interesting forms . The natives call these " wood pretties . " Much of this work is not especially artistic in arrangement but it affords much pleasure . Particularly in parts of Virginia and West Virginia are to be seen well-made wreaths and decorations , and some miniature gardens to be kept under glass which find their way into many homes and to a few markets outside the mountains , especially at Christmas time . The skill and taste required in the arrangement of these attractive plants bring them into the realm of handicrafts . One of these craftswomen is Mrs. W. H. Blauvelt of Asheville , who makes compositions of seeds , stems , and grasses for Allanstand Industries , utilizing both wild plants and those from her own garden . The wild sedge grass growing in many parts of the Southern Highlands is interesting from a handicraft point of view for two reasons : first , it yields very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally in the mountain home for coloring wool ; and second , it is suitable for basket making , the most attractive creations of which have come from the Tallulah Falls Industrial School . These have been noted in Chapter X , Mountain Baskets . Perhaps more gourds are grown and wider use found for i hens in // the Southern Highlands than in any other part of our country . The plants thrive there , and from pioneer days gourd receptacles have been in daily use in the mountain home , the proverbial gourd dipper being a good example . Gourds have , as already mentioned , long been used as sounding boxes for home-made fiddles and banjos . At the present time small gourds are grown quite extensively because of their decorative value , and middle-sized ones are used widely for bird houses . Very little up to this time has been accomplished in the way of decorating gourds , as is the custom in Mexico and other countries , but this practice is likely to come with more intensive handicraft development . LEATHER WORK One of the pioneer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country but is still carried on in parts of the Southern highlands in the same way as it was a hundred years ago in New England , is the tanning and working of leather . The Highlands are particularly rich in trees producing tannic acid , and by old-time tanning methods excellent leather is made there . One of the tanners and leather workers of the region is Covey Odom , living at Luther , I lamblen County , Tennessee , who produces a fine leather , tanned entirely with materials from his own homeplace . He makes the leather up into saddle-bags , harness , and other practical articles used in the region . A study of him at his one-man tannery appears opposite page 154 . William Isaac Wimpey of Hayesville , Clay County , North Carolina , also has a tannery which he operates alone . Probably no better job of tanning could be done than that undertaken in this spot where nature has furnished the materials needed . In addition to the saddle-bags , harness , horse equipment , and purses made in the I lighlands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared in such a way as to insure long service . It seems reasonable that some leather work will continue on a small scale where conditions are so favorable and natural tanning acids are to be found in such abundance . // CANDLE MAKING Candle making is still carried on in a few homes in the Southern Highlands . Two types are made for the market ? one the bayberry , the other the honeywax candle . Bayberry candles are made at Penland , North Carolina . The Penland Weavers and Potters prepare these to harmonize with the pottery and pewter candlesticks which they produce . The honeywax or beeswax candle , which was very common in the old days , is made now by Leonard Lamb of the Wayside Mountain Products Company , Knoxville , Tennessee . Mr. Lamb , who has made a special study of candles , has developed several artistic forms and a variety of colors . The core is standard with a very thick beeswax covering which gives a pleasant fragrance when burning . The flame of the candle makes a cup for itself , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than an ordinary candle and without any smoke . FEATHER FANS An old-time home industry practiced quite widely throughout the United States and now carried on in parts of North Carolina , Georgia , Tennessee , and Kentucky is the making of fans from the feathers of geese , turkeys , guinea fowls , and peacocks . The use of the turkey wing for the mountain hearth is proverbial , but the fashioning of the white and gray feathers of the domestic goose or peacock into a carefully designed and made fan for personal use is a much more refined article . In addition to this type of fan , a " fly bush " of peacock feathers is made ; a gorgeous object which was used before the day of mosquito netting and wire screens to shoo the flies away from the dining table . The feathers , sometimes a hundred of them , are held together by braiding the quills into a strong , firm , handsome handle , the completed object being usually about three or four feet long . STONE CUTTING Stone cutting or lapidary work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although a number of men and boys throughout the country are very much interested in the native mineral products . Roby Buchanan in Cane Creek Valley near // Hawk , Mitchell County , collects the stones in the rough and uses his water wheel for the power to grind them into shape when it is not needed for the regular work of grinding local grain and corn . Another lapidary , Rev. R. B. Owens , of Charlotte , North Carolina , has brought together a very attractive group of semi-precious stones of the state which he himself grinds and polishes . DECORATED FOODS AND CONTAINERS Handicrafts are now being used increasingly in connection with the preservation of foods for home and market . Among the outstanding accomplishments so far in this respect have been the making and use of different pottery receptacles for jams , jellies , and preserves , and other confections mentioned in the chapter on mountain pottery . Because of the abundance of pottery produced in the South , it is possible for mountain people to obtain excellent small containers and receptacles at low prices which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances help to dispose of the food as well . Wild strawberries grow in abundance in parts of North Carolina and Kentucky ; blueberries and dewberries also grow wild , and there are cultivated berries and other fruits which can be sold much more readily when packed in artistic containers . Probably the most popular food confection in the Highlands is the attractively decorated tea sugars from Berea College of which over a million boxes are reported to have been sold in the past two or three years . Berea students began by decorating the sugar cubes with native wild flowers , a motif that is still the most popular perhaps of all they produce , but now they make special designs for Christmas , I lallowe'en , Easter , Fourth of July , and other seasons , thus multiplying the output of the candy kitchen of the school . Food does not ordinarily come within the scope of handicrafts , but when in the preparation thought is given to the form , color , and texture , or special attention given to the receptacles in which it is packed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term as used in this report . The proper packaging of rural foodstuffs is in its infancy , and there is no question that as country people become more experienced and artistic in the way they process their foods and in the choice of containers for them , the demand will be much greater and higher prices will be the result . // THE SOUTHERN HIGHLAND HANDICRAFT GUILD NOT until more than thirty years after the revival of handicrafts had begun in the Southern Highlands , did the producing centers unite in a co-operative effort to improve their products and work out their common problems . The first meeting for this purpose was held at Penland , North Carolina , in late December , 1928 , and out of this came plans leading to the formation of the Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild , later changed to the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild , an organization now comprising the leading handicraft centers and many individual workers of the region . The founding of the Guild marks one of the most important developments in the handicrafts of the Highlands and of the entire country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been improved , variety of products enlarged , individuality of expression encouraged , use of native materials increased , better exhibitions held , markets expanded , and co-operation both within and outside the mountains greatly augmented . Inasmuch as the Guild has come to be widely recognized as a source of information and its co-operation has extended to interests outside the region , a brief sketch of its development and activities would seem in place here . BEGINNING OF THE GUILD Two days after Christmas , in 1928 , a small group of people , mainly from the mountain sections of North Carolina , Tennessee , and Kentucky , came together in the Weavers ' Cabin on the top of Conley 's Ridge at Penland , North Carolina , to talk over the handicraft situation in the mountains and to take what proved to be the first steps toward the formation of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild . The Guild itself was not formally launched until some time later , but here were developed the ideas and principles which have guided the organization from its beginning to the present time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for this pioneer meeting than the Weavers ' Cabin on the summit of this mountain ridge . The cabin had been built by the weavers and their husbands , whose homes were scattered about in coves and hollows and on mountainsides within a radius of about 20 miles ; as a central place to assemble for weaving instructions , receiving supplies , shipping out products , and discussing problems connected with their work . The significance to those who were gathered within its walls was that in this remote section , far from the sources usually looked to for help in such instances , these neighbors , all poor in money and goods , had through an inspiring experience in co-operation growing out of their handicraft activities built a cabin of native materials with their own hands and equipped it for their use . Tacked to a log in an obscure place on the wall behind one of the looms was a sheet of paper on which was written in that brevity of expression characteristic of mountain people the legend of the cabin . A part of it ran about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaked long distances from several mountain homes , and the " boards " for the roof were rived out of white oak , all materials in the cabin except the nails , glass , and hardware coming from the country around . The labor was of course local , and the frame , including the roof , was shaped up and put together in a day by country folk at " a house raisin ' . " The surroundings of that evening meeting in late December were of great natural beauty which those who were there can never forget . It had been a green Christmas in that part of North Carolina , but early in the day of the meeting the first snowstorm of the winter had set in and there were many misgivings as to whether or not the guests would be able to get through , for long before nightfall a heavy blanket of white covered what from the mountain top looked like the whole world . When , however , in the light of the blazing fireplace the evening discussion began , all who had started // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the following handicraft centers represented : Allanstand Cottage Industries , Asheville , North Carolina ; Berea College , Fireside and Student Industries , Berea , Kentucky ; Brasstown Handicraft Association , Brasstown , North Carolina ; Cedar Creek Community Center , Greeneville , Tennessee ; Crossnore School , Crossnore , North Carolina ; The Spinning Wheel , Asheville , North Carolina ; Penland Weavers and Potters , Penland , North Carolina . Discussion continued until late when , in spite of the heavy snow which was still falling , part of the group went to the little town of Spruce Pine about six miles away to spend the night . By morning the storm was over and the sun shone on a beautiful world . The guests from Spruce Pine were at the meeting early , some of the Penland neighbors dropped in , and at noon the weavers served a chicken lunch of proverbial mountain quality and abundance . At lunch time Dr. Mary Sloop of Crossnore School , the nearest handicraft neighbor to Penland , read some extracts from a local document , an Anthology of Death on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old settler . Literary records are rare among the mountain folk , and this was exceptionally interesting because it was part of the history of that section . Uncle Jake had lived for eighty-seven years down on Three Mile Creek in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains . He knew every family in the region , and for about seventy-five years , from 1845 to the time of his death , March to , 1920 ; he kept a notebook , recording each death in the community , with brief annotations , reflecting his opinion of the departed . Although the spelling is faulty and the grammar crude , this self-taught woodsman of a community without schools has made his limited knowledge of writing serve his purpose well . The original journal is now in the hands of Alberta Pierson Hannum , of Moundsville , West Virginia , who is planning to publish it in the near future . With her permission , a few of the entries , some of which include references to the hand skills of the mountain people , appear here , exactly as written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1877 ware a farmer and stild never had no dronken boys never had no dock in hos for sick he had 12 in famely Frankey Burleson age 86 july 3 dide 1896 she spon cloth by 5000 yards // Wm Davis age 100.8 dide oct 5 1841 ware old soldier in rev war and got his thi broke in last fite at Kings mountain he ware a farmer and made brandy and never had no dronkers in famely Joe Frank age 72 july 8 dide 1899 ware fin man he sed what he thot Charles McKiney age 72 dide May to 1852 ware farmer live in blew rige had 4 womin cors marid to 1 live at Mckiney Gap all went to fields to work to mak grave all went to the crib for corn all to smok hos for mete he cild 75 to 8o hogs a yer and wimen never had no words bout his havin so many within if it ware thes times thar wold be hare puld thar ware 42 children belong to him they all went to prechin together nothin sed Thady ware a very bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes got alon fin with everbodi i nod him Samel Frank age 94 dide july 2 1857 he ware farmer he hewed logs for hoses no man cod bete him Tiliant Black age 73 dide oc 10 1896 ware mason for bildin chimleys Kim 1 one age 73 oc 15 1888 ware black smith had 6 gals that cod work in shop he ware 6 feet hi Wm Austin age 8o dide jun 6 1912 ware fine man ware tenor Sady Wise age 95 dide ap 1895 she wov spon cloth I , iley Wise age 82 feb 23 1875 did spon wov cloth mad all they wore Loney ( ) his age 84 dide jun to 1871 grates dere honter wreked bee trees for bony did rat ell snak by Too cild dere by thousen i nod him well Lege Carpenter age 99 march 18 dide 1859 it snode that nite 14 inch hi Lib Wise age 8o dide june 20 1846 ware greates womin for contrary Turner Carpenter age 23 dide nov 20 1862 fite for his contery lost life Samel I lugkin age 18 dide aug 18 1882 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 dide aug 22 1889 ware fin lady to anybody she lik Loner Whitman age 18 1914 dide shot hisself cos his gal went back on him dec 25 Frank James age 74 feb 28 1900 he ware grate bank rober him and Jesse James and Bob Ford At the evening meeting Mrs. Campbell of the John C. Campbell Folk School opened the discussion and President William J. Hutchins of Berea College spoke of the part played by the handicrafts in the educational and economic life of the college . Dr. Sloop told of what they had done for both children and adults at Crossnore , adding " But it is their character building qualities which concern us most at the school . " It was , however , the vital place // of handicrafts in the homes of the mountains which seemed to the group of the greatest importance . There was abundant testimony that the whole aspect of life had been changed by bringing into the lonely mountain cabins a loom or a work bench through which one or more members of the family found both economic and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions ; there were no formal addresses , no committee meetings , no telephone interruptions , no hurrying away to other engagements , but a satisfactory sticking by the subject until all had asked the questions in their minds or had made their contributions to the discussion . The following topics were among those considered : the economic significance of handicrafts in homes and schools ; influence of the crafts upon the character of the workers ; necessity of keeping standards of craftsmanship high ; disposing of work not up to standard ; protection of designs originated by others ; use of native materials ; use of attractive and permanent colors in weaving ; methods of marketing employed in other countries such as Canada , Norway , Sweden , and Denmark ; creation of new objects and new designs to meet market requirements ; methods of financing these industries and of paying workers ; cost of production and its relation to selling price ; partial use of machinery in hand-made articles ; commissions allowed to dealers and consignment plans ; extent of output in the industries represented at this meeting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a co-operating organization was considered . It was unanimously agreed that , although there were many problems that could best be worked out through such a body , each center should be left a maximum freedom to work out its own methods of production and marketing , and that none should be deprived of any outlet it had already developed . A point especially stressed was the high value of creative work and individual expression , and the desire to avoid as far as possible the duplication of objects by different centers . Because most of the centers in the mountains had long been identified with the Conference of Southern Mountain Workers , ' and because of the wish HANDICRAFTS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS to share with the Conference the satisfactions which would grow out of an association concerned entirely with handicrafts , it was resolved to bring the matter before the Conference at its next meeting . The following formal motion was passed unanimously : That we organize ourselves into an informal association whose function may be described by some such name as the Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Russell Sage Foundation the urgent desire of this group that the Foundation advise them with reference to the best form of organization ; and further , that the Foundation conduct an early survey of the handicrafts in the schools and homes of the Southern Mountains as a fact basis for the association 's wisest development ; that the Committee be empowered to take such steps between now and the Conference of Southern Mountain Workers in Knoxville , April 2 ? 4 1929 , as seem best to advance the development of the Guild and its work . 1 lelen Dingman of Berea reporting as chairman of the meeting later said : We met on a mountain hilltop literally and the freedom and friendship of the group as they talked over the mountain handicraft situation ? the hopes and fears and practical problems ? made it a real mountain top experience . ORGANIZING THE GUILD At the Seventeenth Annual Conference of Southern Mountain Workers , held on April 2-4 , 1929 , at Knoxville , Tennessee , there was considerable discussion among the members concerning the possibility of forming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not until December 28 , 1929 , just one year after the Penland meeting , that a slightly larger group gathered at the Spinning Wheel at Asheville , North Carolina , for the purpose of organizing the Guild . It included Frances L. Goodrich of the Allanstand Cottage Industries , Asheville ; Mrs. Campbell of the John C. Campbell Folk School at Brasstown ; Dr. Mary Sloop of the Crossnore School ; Lucy Morgan of the Penland Weavers and Potters ; Wilmer Stone of the Weave Shop , Saluda ; Clementine Douglas of the Spinning Wheel ; Evelyn Bishop of Pi Beta Phi Settlement School , Gatlinburg ; Helen H. Dingman of Berea , who // was chairman of the meeting ; and Allen H. Eaton of Russell Sage Foundation , New York City . This group worked out the foundation for the organization of the Guild , based upon the recommendations made at the earlier Penland meeting . The meeting at the Spinning Wheel was held in the sturdy old log cabin which Miss Douglas had found at Democrat and had rebuilt log for log , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one great room was very comfortable in spite of winter weather , with an old-fashioned iron stove in the center , around which the guests sat in a circle on mountain chairs . Hand-hooked rugs and gay-colored weavings gave comfort and cheer to the meeting place . It was a pleasant and appropriate place for handicraft deliberations , and visits were made to the weaving room nearby where scores of skeins of beautifully colored yarns were hanging on loom frames or being woven into webs . Three types of membership were agreed upon : $1.00 for individual craftsmen ; $5.00 for friends wishing to advance the purpose of the Guild ; and $10 for producing centers . Representatives from the producing centers were to constitute the voting members , each center to have one vote . Those represented at the meeting and those that should join before the next were admitted as charter members . After that date all applicants would require approval of the admissions committee and be voted on by the entire Guild membership . The officers of the Guild were to consist of a president , vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . There were to be semi-annual meetings , one in the spring at the time of the annual Conference of Southern Mountain Workers at Knoxville , and the other in the autumn at a place to be chosen by members . An exhibit of articles made by Guild members was planned for the Knoxville Conference in 1930 . FIRST CO-OPERATIVE EXHIBITION OF MOUNTAIN HANDICRAFTS The exhibit of the Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild at the 1930 spring meeting of the Conference of Southern Mountain Workers brought together for the first time a really comprehensive and representative collection of the handicrafts of the region . Notices had been sent to some 24 centers , but when the shipments // were unpacked in the old Presbyterian Church , not only the centers invited but eight previously unknown groups had sent in their work , making in all 32 centers represented . This was not only proof of a wide interest in handicrafts but also a good illustration of the way news travels in the mountains without the aid of letter writing or newspapers . The exhibition was held in a semicircular room completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many exhibits of furniture of mountain design and construction , as well as carefully styled pieces from some of the schools and better work shops of the region . There was a large collection of baskets , brooms , elaborate and beautiful examples of hand weaving , hooked rugs , and of modern adaptations of mountain handicrafts . For the first time these various objects were arranged , not as separate displays from different centers , but in a way to assure the greatest harmony for them as a whole . At the entrance to the hall was a special group consisting of one object from each center represented , part of which is illustrated opposite page 286 . This arrangement not only presented a striking group of mountain handicrafts but expressed the principle for which the Guild stood ? a co-operative effort of all the centers to advance the work of the entire region . This first comprehensive exhibition was a surprise to members of the Guild as well as to visitors , for with a few exceptions the centers themselves had little idea what others were producing . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution and by-laws were adopted . Serving on the first Board of Directors were Marguerite Butler of the Campbell Folk School ; Miss Stone of the Hindman Settlement School ; Miss Douglas of the Spinning Wheel ; Miss Morgan of Penland Weavers and Potters ; and O. J. Matti of the Woodcrafters and Carvers . Miss Butler was chosen president , Miss Stone vice president , and Miss Dingman secretary-treasurer. // The autumn meeting of the Guild in 1930 was held at Berea College , which afforded visiting members an opportunity to see the activities carried on at this important center . These included the Fireside Industries , the Woodworking Shop , the Mountain Boy // Weavers at the College , the Matheny Weavers , Mrs. Mary Anderson , and the Churchill Weavers . Headquarters were established at Boone Tavern , an excellent stopping place in which the service is provided mainly by college students . Among other matters discussed was the establishment of museums in the region to preserve good examples of pioneer mountain handicrafts . The Guild decided to hold during the following year an exhibition of these old-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with plants still vigorous , was reported on and provision made to protect it . A committee on marketing was appointed to study the comparative prices being asked by different centers and the possibilities of getting co-operation from outside in an effort to style some of the goods . A lending library of books on handicrafts was also proposed and a directory of Guild members planned . // At the 1931 spring meeting , held in connection with the Conference of Southern Mountain Workers , the exhibit of old-time handicrafts which had been planned at Berea was shown . In this collection were very early hand-made tools , cooking utensils , looms of massive proportions , coverlets , patchwork quilts , and so forth . The exhibition also included a collection of coverlets exhibited by Jean Montgomery of Galax , Virginia . In addition to the old handicrafts , and in a separate room , was a fine exhibit of modern weaving from the St. Louis Handicraft Guild which had been brought to the meeting by Emile Bernat , editor of The Handicrafter . It was of great interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Guild which followed the close of the exhibition held at Mountain View Hotel , Gatlinburg , was marked by the generous offer of Miss Goodrich to turn over to the Guild the right and title to the Allanstand Cottage Industries , which she had over a period of nearly forty years developed into a salesroom and supervising center at Asheville . Miss Goodrich had refused opportunities to sell the Industries because it was not a commercial organization in the sense that some of those who wished to buy the enterprise might like to make it , and her-desire was to have it continue under auspices that would as nearly as // possible uphold the original ideals . Later , in writing of the transfer , Miss Goodrich said : " It was given to the agency which offered the greatest promise of carrying on our purpose , the Southern Mountain Handicraft Guild , then newly formed . It has amply fulfilled my hopes . " After Miss Douglas who had been appointed trustee for the Guild had fulfilled her task , making this service a contribution to the Guild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The management of the Industries was later taken over by Mrs. Agnes Loeffler , who had been associated with Miss Goodrich in building up the center , and through Mrs. Loeffler 's thrift , energy , and tact and Mr. Loeffler 's loyal support , the Guild exhibit and salesroom has grown and its business shown a steady increase each year . The autumn meeting of 1931 was held on October 16 ? 17 at the John C. Campbell Folk School , Brasstown , when the members had an opportunity to visit the weaving room in Keith House where an exhibition of local handicrafts was on display ; also the Mill I-louse where the wood and metal work are carried on . The new cow barn with its unique decorations of farm animals , tools , bundles of grain , and other symbols of country work , both modeled and incised in the cement facings , had just been completed and gave the visitors much enjoyment . Sixty persons representing 17 handicraft centers were present . At this meeting an invitation was extended to the American Federation of Arts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the formation and circulation of a representative exhibition of the handicrafts of the entire mountain region . So well did this plan for an exhibition of handicrafts fit into the program of the American Country Life Association , that the Association agreed to arrange for the initial showing of the exhibition at its annual meeting to be held at Blacksburg , Virginia , in August , 1933 . The Russell Sage Foundation agreed to assist in assembling the articles on display , and the American Federation of Arts offered to take charge of the exhibition after the Blacksburg meeting and circulate it throughout the country . Thus through co-operation this important plan was carried out which none of the organizations could have handled separately . The 1932 spring meeting of the Handicraft Guild was held // on April i also in the Mountain View Hotel at Gatlinburg . By this time 25 producing centers had come into membership . At this meeting the Library Committee assembled some 20 volumes on handicrafts , the nucleus of a Guild library , which placed within reach of members for the first time some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicrafts . These books are available to Guild members through the secretary 's office . One of the features of the meeting was the admission of the Cherokee Indians to membership . They had already submitted examples of their work , including basketry , pottery , bows and arrows , blow-guns , and Indian game materials which had been approved by the Admissions Committee . The 1932 autumn meeting of the Guild convened on October I I at Pine Mountain Settlement School , Kentucky , the most remotely situated of any of the handicraft centers , yet one of the most interesting and picturesque . In spite of the difficulty in reaching it , attendance was good . Pine Mountain is about four or five miles by trail from what is now a main highway , and is generally reached from Laden by going over the mountain on foot or by muleback . The question of transporting delegates to the meeting was finally solved by an arrangement with the local logging train , which operates out of Laden and into the Pine Mountain country , to carry them around the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required about seven or eight miles of traveling to reach Pine Mountain Settlement School instead of the four miles of climbing over the mountain if one used the trail . The road-bed of the railway is hardly up to standard , and the engine , and the box ear which had been hooked on to accommodate the passengers , ran off the track three times during the trip . This experience furnished plenty of excitement , but most of the members remained in the car until safely delivered at the School . A few , however , on the occasion of the second jumping off the track got out , and sighting a cabin down in a mountain valley made for it , finally securing horses on which they rode into Pine Mountain , arriving late that evening after some of the delegates had spent several hours in search of the lost members . Thirteen producing centers were represented at the conference // which , among other matters , approved an expenditure for printing a catalogue of the circulating handicraft exhibit to be arranged by the Educational Committee in collaboration with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Guild at Asheville had improved , and four additional producing centers had been admitted to membership . Doris Ulmann of New York City presented the Guild with 50 photographic portraits which she had made of mountain people in Virginia and Kentucky . It should be added that when at the close of the meeting the logging train came to take its passengers back to Laden , it was discovered that a considerable number had left early to walk over the mountain . Those who remained boarded the train . In the journey around the mountain , although the engine again left the track three times , the mechanics soon jacked it back and the sevenmile run was made in the record time of two hours . // At the 1933 spring meeting of the Guild held on March 31 at Hotel Farragut , Knoxville , the word " Highland " was substituted for " Mountain , " making the name Southern Highland Handicraft Guild . At the autumn meeting there were two sessions , one at Weld House , Altamont , Avery County , North Carolina , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent the night ; the other in the Weaving Cabin at Crossnore School on October 1 1 . At the latter meeting Miss Morgan reported on the exhibit of the Penland Weavers and Potters at the Century of Progress in Chicago . The Guild had made a real effort , backed by organizations interested in rural life , to hold an exhibit of mountain handicrafts at the Century of Progress , but charges for space and lack of sympathetic interest on the part of the Fair management had made the undertaking impossible . However , the citizens of Penland encouraged the Penland Weavers and Potters to build a small log cabin on a truck , and with it as a background and showroom , an effective display was made , the business secured in Chicago keeping 34 weavers employed during one of the slackest handicraft seasons the workers in the mountains had known . The cabin and other equipment were designed and built by H. C. Ford of Penland . A // report was also made on the Guild exhibition which had been held in August at Blacksburg , Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious weaving rooms which consist of two historic log cabins joined together to serve the handicraft needs of the School . The 1934 spring meeting of the Guild opened at Ferris Hall , the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , on the morning of March 23 , with luncheon served by the Co-operative Extension Workers in Agriculture and Home Economics . The experience of Miss Morgan at the Century of Progress in Chicago , where there had been many calls for inexpensive articles , was discussed , together with the problems incident to supplying the national parks of the Appalachians with suitable souvenirs at low prices . This brought to a focus a discussion of the possibilities of producing inexpensive handicrafts . The matter of low-cost objects the Guild felt to be distinctively one of its own because of the promise by the National Park Service that handicrafts will be featured in the eastern parks for their educational and cultural value , and that the cheap souvenirs manufactured in cities and sold in other parks will be discouraged in those of the Appalachians . In the autumn of 1934 the Guild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The opening meeting was held in the Old Mill House on the evening of October 16 . No more appropriate or beautiful place for a meeting could have been chosen than this old mill preserved for years by the Dougherty family and now occupied as a home by Mrs. Z. C. Patten , who was hostess to the Guild for supper and the evening session . Many of the original features of the mill have been preserved ? the floors , steps , water wheel , grain hopper , flour bins ? and the quaint interior was beautifully decorated with autumn fruits , flowers , vegetables , and handicrafts from many lands . The guests were housed during the conference at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Blair in Hayslope just outside Russellville . At the evening meeting Bertha M. Nienburg , economic consultant of the Women 's Bureau , United States Department of Labor , reported on a study , which the Bureau had conducted , of employment opportunities for rural women of the Highlands , particularlv in handicraft developments , and asked for the co-opera ' ion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations based on their findings . At the same session a tentative plan developed by L. L. Campbell of the Tennessee Valley Authority , involving a determination of the economic feasibility of a number of small co-operative enterprises throughout the region , was presented for consideration . The discussion of both reports was taken up at the morning session and a committee , with President Hutchins of Berea as chairman , was appointed to confer with both the Women 's Bureau and the Tennessee Valley Authority . In the afternoon of the second day the Guild members attended a reception and exhibit of the work of the Shuttle-Crafters at the Dougherty home and at the log cabin work and exhibit rooms . Among the exhibits were shown examples of the weavings of five generations of the Dougherty family , the first being a bed sheet of linen spun and woven by Elizabeth Cable Mart , great-grandmother of Sarah Dougherty , and examples of coverlets woven by her grandmother , Betsy Flannery Adams , and her mother , Leah Adams Dougherty , one by herself and one by her niece , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the complete process of flax growing and the preparation of linen thread , the flaxseed , the grown plant , the fiber broken on the " break , " the scutching of the fiber , the separation of the fine fiber from the tow by hackling , the placing of the fiber on the distaff , the spinning of the fiber , and the twisting of it into heavier thread . // The spring meeting in April , 1935 , held on the campus of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville , was characterized by three encouraging facts reported : the Guild salesroom at Asheville had had the best sales in its history ; the exhibition of handicrafts under the sponsorship of the Guild , which had been circulated by the American Federation of Arts , had developed a wide interest in handicrafts outside the Highlands ; and the Tennessee Valley Authority had , after several conferences with the Guild Committee appointed to confer with it , decided on a co-operative plan for handicrafts with those already engaged in the work as a basis of organization . The outstanding feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of co-operation between the Guild and // the Tennessee Valley Authority for the advancement of handicrafts in the region . As already indicated , the territory which the Tennessee Valley Authority occupies includes a large part of the Southern Highlands . In making up the advisory committee for the Tennessee Valley Authority , several members from the Guild were selected and Miss Douglas was chosen to direct the work of the new handicraft cooperative known as the Southern Highlanders , Inc . The autumn meeting of the Guild was held on October 2 , 1935 , at Ashland Farm , St. Elmo , near Chattanooga , Tennessee , with Mrs. Patten , owner of the farm , as hostess . The principal subject for consideration was the report on the Southern Highlanders , Inc. , and the opening of the handicraft shop at Norris Dam , Tennessee . The need for determining the requirements of a new consuming public was discussed , and the advisability of engaging a designer and a production manager to assist in solving the numerous problems growing out of the demands of this public in handicrafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made available for an exhibition of the latest handicrafts of the Guild and a collection of Tennessee articles . // The seventh semi-annual meeting of the Guild took place on March 27 at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville . At this session the by-laws were amended to permit individual craftsmen not connected with handicraft centers to serve on committees ; this change also applying to friends of the Guild . The Board of Directors was increased from five to seven . Paul Johnson , acting general manager of the Southern Highlanders , Inc. , stressed the advisability of an information service that would serve all members of the Guild and the Southern Highlanders , Inc. , as well as unaffiliated persons in the field of handicrafts . The autumn meeting on October 13 and 14 was held at Cashiers , Jackson County , North Carolina , at the home of Dr. and Mrs. J. K. Stoddard . In the living room where the delegates gathered were arranged many interesting and beautiful articles which Dr. and Mrs. Stoddard had collected in different parts of the world . To this setting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dingman had recently secured in China . O. J. Mattil reported for the Old Crafts Committee the plans of the Tennessee Park Committee for a museum of old crafts for the Great Smoky Mountains Park . It was thought advisable for the Guild to co-operate with the Tennessee Park Commission for a museum in the Park . Mrs. Patten offered her collection in The Mill at Russellville , and others offered articles or collections , for this purpose . An invitation from the Mint Museum at Charlotte , North Carolina , for members of the Guild to display their handicrafts at the museum from October to December was accepted . The first session of the 1937 spring meeting of the Guild was held on March II , at Knoxville , in connection with the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Conference of Southern Mountain Workers . This session was devoted to an address and the discussion that followed on Handicrafts in Mountain Life , by Allen H. Eaton , who gave an outline of conclusions drawn from the present study which he had just completed on the subject for the Russell Sage Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole Conference . The second session was marked by encouraging reports from both the Allanstand salesroom in Asheville and the Southern Highlanders , Inc . The latter now maintains salesrooms at Norris Dam , at the Patten Hotel in Chattanooga , Chickamauga Dam , Tennessee , and at International Building , Rockefeller Center , New York City . The Guild expressed its desire to join with workers from other parts of the country in mapping out a plan by which the handicrafts in general could be improved and advanced . It also expressed itself as willing to co-operate with the Department of Agriculture in the preparation of an exhibition of rural arts to be held in Washington , D. C. , in November , 1937 , in connection with the Seventy-fifth Anniversary celebration of the Department . EXHIBITIONS OF THE GUILD Up to the time of the organization of the Guild , little concerted thought had been given to acquainting the country generally with the various types of handicrafts produced in the Highlands . Contacts had been made largely through mountain schools with individuals in different parts of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others who were eager to promote enthusiasm for the continuance of handwork among the mountain people . Coincident with the development of the Guild , a plan for exhibiting at one time examples of the best of the handicrafts produced in the mountains was agreed upon as the most satisfactory way of bringing them before the whole country . The first general exhibition held at the Conference of Southern Mountain Workers in Knoxville in 1930 confirmed the belief that not even the Highland people themselves realized the extent to which handwork was carried on in the region . The collection of examples of old crafts shown at the Conference the following year likewise held many surprises , even for those who had been acquainted with the work for a long time . The old tools , rough hand looms , and other articles were of especial interest to those who wished to study the pioneer implements of the mountain country . The assembling , and financing in part , of a comprehensive exhibition of handicrafts for circulation through museums and other art organizations is thus far one of the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases has far exceeded any estimate that had been made in anticipation of the development of the project . While the main objective was its educational value , the many sales that have resulted have given substantial encouragement to the workers . This exhibition known as The Exhibition of the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild , which was first shown at Blacksburg , Virginia , in 1933 at the annual convention of the American Country Life Association , consisted of 586 pieces of handicraft representing 33 handicraft centers . No more fitting event could have been chosen for its initial presentation than this meeting of the outstanding rural organization in our country . In the same hall was a collection of color reproductions on Rural Scenes and Country Life arranged to harmonize with the display of handwork by rural people . The effect upon leaders in the country life movement was highly encouraging , and county and home demonstration agents were unanimous in their feeling that similar exhibitions should he brought before other rural groups throughout the country . At the close of the meeting the American Federation of Arts took charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // at museums throughout the country . From Blacksburg it was taken to Washington , D. C. , and for some weeks was on display at the Corcoran Art Gallery . A constant stream of visitors viewed it each day , and the newspapers carried many interesting articles about the work . Any doubt that may have been evident before as to the advisability of including exhibitions in the program of the Guild was entirely dispelled by the cordial reception given to the display by government officials and other residents , and by art , social , and educational groups . After the Corcoran Gallery at Washington , the circuit included the Brooklyn Museum of New York City ; the Decatur ( Illinois ) Art Institute ; the Joslyn Memorial at Omaha , Nebraska ; the New Municipal Auditorium in St. Louis in connection with the National Folk Festival ; the Everhart Museum , Scranton , Pennsylvania ; the Milwaukee Art Institute ; the Norfolk ( Virginia ) Museum ; and the Art Museum of Berea College at Berea , Kentucky , at the time of the dedication of this Museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Calvin Coolidge. and Mrs. Franklin D.

These cabins with their assortments of crude pioneer objects are folk museums in a true sense , although the meagerness of both buildings and exhibits and the absence of a staff or any plan of administration might make it difficult for the American Association of Museums to give them recognition . In addition to brief descriptions of some of these museums , reference will be made in this chapter to a number of the collections situated a little outside the Highland boundaries , where objects similar to those found in the mountains may be seen . It is , however , the small local museum within the Highlands with which we are mainly concerned . The building is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been lived in sometimes for several generations . It may have belonged to a well-known family or in other ways be associated with the history of the community ; or it may be only a typical cabin of early days . Its contents comprise mainly the things that have been used by those who once lived in the house or in similar ones in that part of the country , and reflect quite faithfully the pioneer life of the region . These small museums have been established usually as local projects without money cost to anyone . No contributions have been sought , no taxes imposed for either equipment or maintenance . They have come in response to a desire to preserve the records of a life now passing . A museum that represents the habits and customs of local people brings about a marked change in the attitude of the community , and the mountaineer , after visiting one , usually attaches more importance to his own hand-made possessions ; he is also sometimes influenced to contribute to their collection . 255        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
