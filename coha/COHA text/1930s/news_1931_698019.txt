txt The government 's income tax campaign against hoodlums and politiclans passed the final test of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday when the convic ? tion of Ralph 3 . Capone , brother o f Scarface Al . was affirmed . Capone was sentenced to three years in the penitentiary at Leay. enworth and fined RALPH " CAPONE. 110,000 , Importance was attached to the Capone appeal by United States Attorney George E. Q. Johnson and his sistants because its result leaves not a single proposition of law in the income tax campaign that has not been upheld by the Appellate court . Moreover , the pleas of guilty entered by Terry Druggan and Frankie Lake , former beer barons , were contingent in part on the outcome of the Capone appeal , These gangsters also conditioned their , pleas , on thesappeal of State Representative Lawrence C. O'Brien , which- has been decided in favor of . the goverittnent Pin Hope on Supreme Court . Druggan and Lake . are now clutching , at their last straw , ' the chance that the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which their lawyers regard as strong because of an . opinion in the O'Brien case written by Presiding Judge Samuel Alschuler of the Circuit court . There was no dissenting opinion in the Capone decision to encourage an appeal to the Supreme court , The conviction and sentence of Capone on one misdemeanor count , that of concealing assets in connection with an offer of compromise of his tax liability , was reversed by the Appellate court Prosecutors Jacob Grossman and Dwight H. Green , however , regarded this as of no importance , because no pending cases were contingent upon its outcome and the Sentence on this count was only a year in the county jail , to run concurrently with the prison sentence . Charge Attempts to Cheat U. S. The chief ' point of interest in Capone 's case was his conviction on two felony counts charging willful attempts to " cheat , swindle and defraud the United States . " for in that respect the prosecution was unprecedented . Never before had a man been charged under.a general statute of the criminal code in connection with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guilty to the same charge , and the Circuit court sustained the legality of the Indictment . Capone failed to file income tax returns or to pay any taxes for the years 1922 , 1923 , 1924 , and 1925 . In November , 1925. he was called in by the collector of internal revenue , and . after being questioned , admitted that he owed 0,00.13 in taxes , interest : ma penalties , and fled delinquent returns . But instead of paying the tax , which would have saved him all his subsequent trouble . he filed , on Oct. 3. 1927. an offer In compromise , contending that he was a poor man , his only assets being a half interest in two race horses , and seeking to settle for 31.000. which he said he would have to borrow . For this offer he was charged with trying to cheat the government The Court 's Opinion . In connection with Capone 's attempt to deceive the collector , the Appellate court 's opinion , written by Judge Evan A. Evans and concurred in by Judge Alschuler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared thai he deposited ha money in various banks under fictitious names and conducted his bustness under various false or feigned names , frequently changing the deposits or- the names in , which the deposits were made . It further appeared that he thus deposited , during a periodl of five years and four months next Preceding April 22 , 1929 , sums aggregating $1,951,840.08 " One of the assignments of error relied upon by the appellant was the admission by Judge James H. Wilber son of evidence showing the sale of beer at $55 a barrel by Capone , the defense contending that he was not on trial as a bootlegger and that such evidence was prejudicial . In this respect the Appellate court 's opinion says : " Appellant stated in his offer of compromise and in his various efforts to secure a settlement of the taxes due the government for a sum less than the full amount that he was a professional gambler whose property had all been lost ; that his only assets were a couple of broken down race horses , and that he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fortune . He also stated that he had to borrow the $1,000 with which to make the offer in compromise . " To disprove these facts , to show that the accused made false and fraudulent representations and to show that his failure to pay his taxes was willful , It was permissible for the government to show that the appellant 's principal business was trafficking in beer ; that the proceeds from the beer business in five or six years exceeded a million and a half dollars , and that at all times he had to his credit , under fictitious names , in various banks , sums far in excess of the amount required to pay his taxes . " Defense Attorney George N. Mur ? dock said he would apply to the Appellate court for a rehearing and that , failing in this move , he would ask for a stay of execution to permit an appeal to the Supreme court . The defense has twenty days in which to seek a rehearing before the Appellate court issues a mandate . Meanwhile , Capone is at liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Guzik , and Al Capone have entered unconditional pleas of guilty to tax evasion charges . NMI and Guzik are in the penitentiary . Al Capone is to be sentenced next Thursday
