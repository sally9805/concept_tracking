txt The Democratic State Senate and the Republican Assembly were in a deadlock tonight over Governor Lehman 's fiscal program , including three of his four executive budget bills and one of his six revenue measures . This bill provides for continuance for another , year of the temporary emergency tax of 2 cents a gallon on gasoline . In passing this measure and the other disputed bills after a bitter all-night fight the Assembly Repub. licans lopped 1 cent off the emert gency gasoline tax , reducing the estimated revenue for the next fiscal year by about $15,000,000 , while in other amendments they cut $15,562,368 from the appropriations recommended by Mr. Lehman . Hence the Governor contends they have passed an unbalanced budget and he is ready for a fight to restore it to balance . With the bills coming back today to the Senate , where they had been passed on Feb. 17 in the form they were submitted by the Governor , the battle is on in earnest , with every indication that the deadlock will be of long duration and that it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjournment late this month in advance of the Spring primaries April 2 . Republicans Expect Support . The Republicans in the Legislature appear to be confident that ' public sentiment will support their action in saving $15,000,000 in gasoline levies to motorists next year , and their fight against " free spending " of the taxpayers ' money , which , they declare , has brought the State to the verge of an economic and industrial crisis . Governor Lehman , and with him the Democrats in both the Senate and Assembly , feel that the Republican course , when fully understood , will arouse public resentment and force restoration of the budget and the revenue measure to the form in which they left the Governor 's hands . That Mr. Lehman will take a hand in the fight before many days is the general opinion of his friends and advisers at the Capitol . His special message sent to the Legislature last week , in which he scored proponents of the budget cut , and especially the action of the Republicans in " postponing " an appropriation of $11,160,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the changes made in his fiscal bills have convinced observers that the Governor is prepared to " stand pat " on his financial program . " I regret very much , " Governor Lehman said tonight , " that the Assembly has passed an unbalanced budget . Their action has instituted a very dangerous budgetary prac- tice which seriously threatens State and municipal credit . " I regret that the Assembly of the State of New York has tinkered with the debt service obligations of the State , which at all times must rigidly be kept free from manipulation if government credit is to be maintained . " This was all he would say " at the present time . " It is expected that for the next few days he will wait for normal legislative processes in connection with the deadlock to work themselves out . Under ordinary circumstances the Senate and Assembly each would have appointed a conference committee in an effort to reach an agreement and break the deadlock .

When the Lehman fiscal bills were handed down today among reports to the Senate from the Assembly , George R. Fearon , the Republican floor leader , moved that the Senate concur in the Assembly amendments . This motion was lost by a party vote of 29 to 22 . Dunnigan Moves for Hearing . At such a point the President pro tern . of the Senate , John J. Dunnigan , nominally would have moved for the appointment of a conference committee . Instead , the Senate leader , to the vast surprise of his Republican colleagues , moved that the bills be referred to the Senate Finance Committee for a hearing . This was set for March 18 , a week from tomorrow . The amended Gasoline Bill will not come up at the hearing , only the amended budget bills passed by the Assembly . In explaing his motion , Senator Dunnigan said : " State officials will be afforded an opportunity to relate publicly bow the proposed cuts in the Governor 's budget will cripple State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit of the State and the stability of its securities will have an opportunity to show that deferment of the $11 , - 000,000 appropriation for debt service purposes , as proposed by the Republicans , is uncqnstitutional . " Speaker Ives of the Assembly said he was confident that the Republicans had touched a popular chord in moving for a close scrutiny of the budget and a reduction in taxes . When the principal budget bill came to a final vote after 4 A. M. , Irwin Steingut , the minority leader , demanded a roll-call . The measure was passed , 79 to 65 . A bill making an appropriation for the Legislature and the judiciary and another making provisions for the Temporary Relief Administration were then quickly passed by votes of 79 to 64 and 77 to 66 respectively . The fourth budget bill , making appropriations of $20,000,000 for various public improvements out of the proceeds from the $55,000,000 bond issue for relief purposes , had to be sent back to the Ways and Means Committee for amendments and can not be taken up for final passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of next . Then the bill providing for the reduced gasoline tax was taken up . A Democratic amendment to restore the tax to its original 2-cent rate was voted down by a party vote . The bill in its amended form , with only one-half of the emergency tax remaining , was then passed by a vote of 102 to 42.
