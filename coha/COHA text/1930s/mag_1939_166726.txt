With the bravery of youth two young Socialists , Harry Leland Mitchell and Clay East from eastern Arkansas , set out in 1934 to do something for Southern sharecroppers . What they did , with the help of No. 1 Socialist Norman Thomas , was to organize the Southern Tenant Farmers Union . Having bearded many a planter and even bettered matters a little for its poverty-stricken membership , S. T. F. U. in 1937 tried to affiliate with C. I. O. as an autonomous union . Because the United Cannery , Agricultural , Packing &; Allied Workers of America was already in the farm field , S. T. F. U. was required to hook up with that union as a supposedly autonomous division . Last week S. T. F. U. 's Executive Secretary Mitchell and President J. R. Butler , suddenly breaking off the affiliation , made ugly charges . <P> President of U. C. A. P. A. W. A. ( pronounced Ucpawa for short ) is Donald Henderson , who according to Messrs . Butler and Mitchell used to be a central committeeman of the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he tells his C. I. 0 . superiors , he smells like one to Socialists Butler &; Mitchell . Last week they accused him of deliberately wrecking their union to subordinate it to the Communist Party . They declared that he confused simple Southern Negroes and " poor whites " with red tape , refused to support S. T. F. U. 's roadside sit-down in Missouri , finally suspended all its officers without a hearing and called a reorganization convention in St. Louis this week . On Donald Henderson 's behalf , a C. I. 0 . spokesman replied that he had simply tried to bring order into a maladministered union , that Messrs . Butler &; Mitchell fooled themselves in thinking they could pull out of Ucpawa and stay in C. I. O. , as they hope to do . <P> Donald Henderson 's union claims 124 , - 750 members , reportedly has a dues-paying membership of about 15,000 . S. T. F. U. claims 35,000 , concedes that no more than 3,000 can pay dues at any one time . To figures like these , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of L. points as evidence that C. I. 0 . should grow up and heal its sores before it tries to make peace on its own terms ( see p. 14 ) .
