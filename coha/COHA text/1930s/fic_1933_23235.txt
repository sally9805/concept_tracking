OVER THE BRIDGE IN THE BRONX A STORY BY ALBERT HALPER r E men from the marshal 's office came walking up the quiet street with a firm and heavy tread . They knew that the block was thickly inhabited by Ulster Protestants from the north of Ireland and were prepared for trouble ; hut the sight of empty sidewalks convinced them that they could carry out their business in peace . Turning into the second tenement from the corner , they hammered on the door and , when Mrs. Mahoney opened it , they brushed past her and began carting out her household goods . At first the woman stood there with a white face , but finally , the blood rushing to her bead , she gripped a heavy leather chair in the hands of one of the men and held on grimly . With a deft wrench , he whirled it from her grasp and walked out with it , puffing . The chair , rather cumbersome and smoky brown in color , was worn smooth by many years of usage , and he struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart and the men took them outside also . Then they went for the oaken dressers . Mrs. Mahoney , growing desperate , placed herself in the doorway , but the men from the marshal 's office brushed her firmly aside . There were three of them , all big and heavy looking , with big , gloomy faces , and they worked in silence . As they bent down they grunted , and when one of them bumped his head against the door , another said , " We 've got to work fast , there 's one more in this block , and I want to pay a visit to O'Malley 's before twelve o'clock . " The others nodded . O'Malley ran a speakeasy on East 138th Street and was noted far and wide for his mock-turtle soup . His bottled goods were also pretty fair , considering the times and the prices he charged . Carrying out the household goods , the men from the marshal 's office were thankful that Mrs. Mahoney lived on the first floor . They did not like going down narrow tortuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned your money then . Besides , there was always a chance of a bitter-hearted neighbor throwing a pot of hot water on your head just as you reached the vestibule . And as the torrent was always accompanied by the quick slam of a door , you could n't find out who had done it . After the dressers were carried from the flat they started on the tables . They worked fast and pretty soon were sweating . In ten minutes a group of neighbors gathered outside upon the sidewalk , most of them women and children , but after a while a sprinkling of men appeared . The men , standing gloomily , watched the proceedings with deadened eyes , while the women , for the first time , could satisfy their curiosity by taking an inventory of just what and what not Mrs. Mahoney owned . The children stood about silently , their glances very much alive , and took in everything . The sun was shining . It was cold in the shade , however . Down the block the bells of Mount Olivet Church began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat , stood about , her body rigid , and atched the three heavy men going in and out her door . She watched them as they bent down to pick up the goods and saw their cheeks quiver and the cloth of their jackets strain across their meaty shoulders as they stooped . " You ca n't do it , you ca n't do it , " she muttered , but the men did not bother to answer her . A middle-sized , sturdy woman in her early fifties , with iron-gray hair , she did not interest them . Poverty and woe was stamped upon her countenance . Her husband was dead and her oldest son was in jail . She did not know where her two other boys were ; they had left home early in the spring and had written only once , from California . One was seventeen and the other was fifteen , but the fifteen-year-old was the leader . In fifteen minutes the heavy old-fashioned furniture was out upon the sidewalk , but the flat was still full of small items , worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a conference , one of the three men went up the block to a chain store and returned with some big paper packing-cases . They dumped the small items in . The rugs on the floor , worn halfway through and faded , were easy to roll up . The fellow who stood on a chair to take the heavy musty curtains down almost fell . The others cautioned him . " Careful , John , you 'll break your neck yet , " one of them said . The man on the chair gave a short , humorless laugh . By this time the group upon the sidewalk had grown in size , and after the removal of the curtains everybody could look into the rooms of the flat from the street . The three men , finishing up , trudged heavily in and out like a. trio of pachyderms , while the floor trembled beneath their stolid tread . Mrs. Mahoney , glancing toward the windows , noticed the neighbors for the first time and , staring past them up the street , saw the slight , hurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The minister was on his way to pay a visit to Mrs. Ryan , who had been bedridden for six weeks , and as he walked his dark oxford-gray topcoat was fluttered by the October wind . Under medium height , slender and of a meek appearance , the pastor carried his head tilted sensitively to one side , as if in a half-dream . When Mrs. Mahoney , a devout Ulster Protestant , saw that it was Pastor Curry , she opened a front window and shouted out at him . He was just turning into the building across the street where Mrs. Ryan lived and did not hear her at first . Mrs. Mahoney shouted louder . Her voice was strong and , as the neighbors on the sideWalk stood quiet , it carried . Pastor Curry , glancing at the group and seeing furniture at the curbing , took in the situation at once . He quickened his pace and hurried into the dark hallway without looking back . Lately there had been a lot of evictions in the neighborhood , and this troubled him . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them there was really nothing he could do . He told them that after Detective Sergeant James Connelley had paid him a visit , asking for co-operation . Sergeant Connelley had held a long discourse with Pastor Curry and had talked a good deal about the Communists , although the neighborhood had never seen an agitator . When Mrs. Mahoney saw that the minister had apparently not heard her voice she stood in the empty parlor , shaking with wrath . She had lived in these rooms for twelve years , and the sudden bareness of the place horrified her . Where a picture had been taken down the wallpaper showed a lighter color . Her lower lip began to quiver . Outside on the sidewalk a few children from another street began jeering the men from the marshal 's office . They shouted , " Great big bums ! Great big bums ! Who are your fathers , great big bums ? " The marshal 's men did n't like it . Yesterday morning the same children had shouted the same phrases in a block farther south , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later with a luncheon and some drinks . O'Malley himself had opened up a bottle and , coming over genially , had inquired how the world was going . The men had grumbled in answer . Being called great big bums by small children had rankled them . They had stared away . From the rear windows the supports of the Third Avenue bridge could be seen and beyond the bridge loomed the tall towers of Manhattan . They could not see the river . O'Malley sat down and began discoursing like a philosopher . He knew they hated their jobs . But he told them that if they did n't carry out the stuff according to orders , other men would ; so what was there to say about it ? He clinked glasses with them . In the back of his head was the thought that should the men grow disgusted and quit he would probably lose three good customers . He clapped one on the back . " The next is on the house ! " he announced and poured the whiskey into the glasses , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , as the marshal 's men were removing the last of Mrs. Mahoney'sbelongings they remembered O'Malley 's words . O'Malley had spoken the truth ; if they quit , other men could be got for the jobs . Staring straight ahead , they did not answer the taunting words , though the children chanted away . In a few more minutes the job was finished ; the stuff was piled up upon the sidewalk in a huge heap , the wind flapping a bed-sheet with a rent in the center . One of the marshal 's men placed a frying pan on it and the sheet stopped flapping . Then the biggest fellow went inside and asked Mrs. Mahoney for the key . She answered that she had lost it . Three times the man asked for it and three times she gave him back the same answer , her voice rising all the while . The crowd on the sidewalk could hear it , and the men and women , looking on , stirred as they stood . The children began to chant again . The big fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him out . All of their faces were moist and steamy from their labor . The refusal of the woman to hand over the key irritated them , but they saw she was determined to stand her ground ; so at last one of them went up the street to the grocery store again and a few minutes later returned with a hammer and a huge nail . Then , pushing , they finally got Mrs. Mahoney out of the flat and drove the nail through the door and into the framework . The wood was old and dry ; it cracked as the spike was driven in , but to test it one of the men leaned his bulk against the door , felt that it was firm , and the others were satisfied . After that they went away . They walked up the block and made a second call , but this time they ran into a piece of luck . A small moving van was drawn up to the curbing and all they had to do was to carry the stuff out . The tenant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door to them without any fuss whatsoever . From the seat of the van , the driver , a little skinny man with a pipe in his mouth , looked on , contented . It was all right with him because the marshal 's men were doing the dirty work , and all he 'd have to do would be to lift the stuff into the truck . He sat there on the seat , watching the big fellows trudging in and out , an amiable gleam in his eye . The marshal 's men worked fast , finishing the job just as the bells of Mount Olivet 's struck the quarter hour at fifteen minutes after eleven . One of them , listening , told the others that they could make O'Malley 's in plenty of time . They liked to reach the speakeasy before the noontime rush , because then the mock-turtle soup had not yet been thinned out by adding water in case O'Malley had had a run on his specialty . The bells ceased tolling . From across the street the children came over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first eviction . Mrs. Mahoney was talking heatedly . She cursed the ' marshal 's office in her strong North Ireland accent and re-enforced her language with defiant gestures . The women in the crowd forgave her profanity because she was a widow . She stood there shouting for a long time . Across the street Pastor Curry , at Mrs. Ryan 's bedside , heard every word and lowered his tone as he spoke to the sick woman . He was reading a passage from St. Luke , and his gentle voice rose and fell like wavelets running and receding along a shore of sand . The effect upon the sick woman was very soothing . " Is that something I hear ? " she asked the minister , but Pastor Curry merely frowned and did not interrupt his reading . A minute later he went to the window and drew the blinds , which muffled the sounds of the street effectively . This darkened the room , however , so he had to stop reading . He could have put on the lamp , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloom . After he stopped reading the clergyman conversed with the sick woman . He spoke quietly of many things , soothing her with his gentle voice . Under the quilt old Mrs. Ryan lay small and bony with her knees , slightly hunched , making a sharp peak in the center of the bed . Her daughter-in-law , who had answered the doorbell for the minister , had gone back to the kitchen to her ironing and did not come into the bedroom any more . She was a young , healthy woman , and the clergyman , hearing her moving about , glanced toward the kitchen once or twice . Then he pitched his voice lower . He inquired of old Mrs. Ryan if her daughter-in-law , who was childless , liked children . Mrs. Ryan answered that the marriage was only a year old . Alter that Pastor Curry grew meditatively silent and sat there with his gentle head tilted slightly to the side . He was finished with his call but did not get up from the chair ; Mrs. Mahoney was still shouting out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conscience-stricken , inquired of his own heart and began to feel that he should get up and go out to brave the wrangle on the street . After all , most of the people there were of his flock . But though his heart urged him to get up and leave , he continued to sit in the darkened room . Mrs. Ryan in a weak voice began talking about her son Charley . She told Pastor Curry that Charley 's pay had been cut again . There was no trace of bitterness in her voice , only a strain of hurt puzzlement . She told the pastor she could n't understand the things that were going on in the world . Every-thing was upside down , she said . " It gives me a headache to think of it , " she added . Then her tired voice died down . The minister , to soothe her further , opened up the book in his lap and began reading a chapter from St. John , even though the light was very poor . His low-pitched voice , taking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Mrs. Ryan felt better and closed her eyes . Pastor Curry , finishing , sat in silence , looking at her . The old woman 's lips were dry , and from a small mole under her chin he saw a long silvery hair sticking out like the sensitive feeler of some strange insect . By this time his eyes were accustomed to the gloom . He sat in silence for quite a while . Then he started . Straightening in the chair , he listened attentively , but he heard no street noises . Everything was quiet . Closing his book , he rose , buttoned his coat , and glanced at Mrs. Ryan , whose eyes were shut as if in sleep . As soon as he rose , however , she opened them and gave him a small smile . He saw that her teeth were bad . " Thank you , thank you for coming over , " she said and sighed . He told her he would leave her now . " I 'll be around to-morrow , " he said and began walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the entrance of the building was long and dark . As he neared the end of it , coming toward the daylight , he stopped astonished . A half dozen men were carrying Mrs. Mahoney 's furniture in again . Someone must have smashed in the door or extracted the nail . Mrs. Mahoney herself was directing operations and was smiling grimly . The street had grown shady because the morning had suddenly turned cloudy , so the clergyman did not recognize all the men . Maybe it was his glasses , he told himself ; he intended to change them soon . He did not go out upon the street but receded a few paces deeper into the hallway , thankful for the dark . One of the men he recognized as Steve Gallery who lived in Willis Avenue  --  Gallery who had not been to church for three months now . Last week the pastor had called at the Gallery flat , and Steve had answered curtly . The clergyman had departed as Steve 's voice had begun to rise . " Can the church give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister had left . " Answer me that , pastor , can the church give me a job ? " Pastor Curry had left displeased and a trifle hurt . Young Gallery had been too caustic he had felt . Now he saw Steve grinning and joking as he assisted the other fellows with Mrs. Mahoney 's furniture . Cutting a caper , Steve dropped a big dinner plate , but Mrs. Mahoney , glad to get a roof over her head again , laughed , pushed him playfully , and told him to forget it . It was cracked anyway she said . In a short time the sidewalk was cleared and a few children carried in the smaller items . Five or six women went inside the flat to help Mrs. Mahoney to arrange her furniture , while the men stood round for a few minutes with nothing more to do . Finally , tired of watching , they left . They left with Mrs. Mahoney 's loudly spoken thanks ringing after them . Across the street , out of sight in the hallway , the clergyman stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the building , but hesitated . The women helping Mrs. Mahoney had not yet rehung the curtains , and if he left , he would be seen immediately from the flat . He stood there thinking , trying to remember if another member of his flock lived in the building . At last he went back deeper into the hall and began climbing the stairs . He climbed the stairs even though he knew that Mr. Simon Healy was not in . Healy , a conductor on the Third Avenue elevated , came home at four-thirty ; he was a bachelor in his late forties and a steady church-goer , a quiet man . Pastor Curry , reaching the top floor , paused to get his breath , then he knocked . No one answered . He knocked again , knowing Simon Healy was working , but this time the door swung gently open at his rapping . He started . Then his surprise wore off ; it was evident that Simon had forgotten to slam it shut . The pastor , staring through his glasses at the empty rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the place was so quiet . Before he knew what he was doing , he found himself walking into the flat . The furnishings were old and a trifle shabby , and a stale odor of unbeaten rugs and closed rooms hung in the place . " Are you here , Simon ? " the clergyman called softly . " Simon , are you anywhere about ? " Then he closed the door and sat down quietly ; he knew that no one had heard him ; if anyone knocked he would open the door and explain that he was waiting for Mr. Healy . He would say that he had come up to talk to Mr. Healy about the forthcoming bazaar at the church . Yes , that was it . Now that he remembered it he had really intended to speak to Simon about the matter . He sat in the chair with more firmness . The chair was near the window . Four floors below , the street , stretching gray and quiet , was empty . The children had gone away . Pastor Curry , leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet rehung her curtains . Then he saw something else . Looking from behind Simon Healy 's heavy , musty curtains , the pastor caught sight of the agent of Mrs. Mahoney 's building walking brisklyup the street  --  a tall man , lean and well dressed , with a white mustache . His name was Mr. Fleming and he had been a rent collector for many years . At a glance the agent took in the situation . He did not go into the house but , instead , walked back up the street , entered a drugstore , and ' phoned the marshal 's office . He spoke crisply into the mouthpiece , listened for his answer , then hung up . Fifteen minutes later two other men , also heavy fellows from the marshal 's office , came from the neighborhood police station on Alexander Avenue . They were accompanied by an officer in uniform . The policeman , walking at their side , swung his club idly in the air and from his other hand there dangled a lock and chain . When the three men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The uniform of the officer silenced them . Mrs. Mahoney , when she saw the two heavy fellows get down to business immediately and start dragging out her furniture , made as if to speak , but could not get her mouth open . On her face was a look as if someone had given her a cruel and unexpected blow from behind . A small vein began throbbing in her neck . The policeman in the parlor stood by with a blank face , and the lock swung slowly from its short length of chain . It was a black , heavy , iron lock and twirled around to the left , then the right , unwinding . When it became almost stationary , the policeman touched it with his little finger so that it started twirling slowly all over again . He stood by , taking it easy as the two big men from the marshal 's office went in and out , making many trips . He did not give them a hand , as he had been detailed merely to fix the lock on the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were thankful that Mrs. Mahoney lived on the first floor . In a blunt though inoffensive voice the officer requested the other women to go out on the street . They went . A minute later the children came hack , but , seeing the policeman inside the flat , they did not start their chanting . The men , who had gone off to the Mott Haven Pool Hall down the street , did not return because they were unaware that more marshal 's men had shown up . Without Steve Gallery and his friends , the women and children watching on the sidewalk had a moody and disconsolate look . From the top floor of the building across the street , holding the curtain back , the minister was watching . In his heart was genuine sympathy for Mrs. Mahoney and be forgave her her shouting and swearing , but he felt there was nothing he could do to help . His thoughts took on a troubled hue and trailed off uneasily . Changing his clasp upon his leather book from left to right hand , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Olivet 's tolled again , a quarter after twelve . By this time most of Mrs. Mahoney 's worldly possessions again stood out upon the sidewalk . The men from the marshal 's office , though only two in number , were hard workers and went after things with a more scientific swing than their fellows who had been detailed to the job earlier in the morning . Finally the job was finished , everything was outside again . Mrs. Mahoney , her face contracted as if a nerve in her jaw was stabbing her , stood by with her mouth opened slightly , half-sucking in the air . From her gray face it was evident that she was torn between anger and anguish , and also bereft of her power of speech . At the top windows across the street the minister , glancing above the rooftops , became apprehensive because the sky was darkening ominously . Itbecame so overcast and cloudy that one thought for a moment dusk had fallen . He leaned forward as he heard hammer blows , then understood . The policeman was nailing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer leave the tenement , accompanied by the pair from the marshal 's office . Then he saw Mrs. Mahoney sit upon a chair near the curb under the open sky and begin to weep . The minister , steeling himself , went from the windows , walked through the silent house and left the flat . He saw his duty clearly . He descended the flights and when he reached the hallway on the bottom floor he strode firmly toward the entrance , resolved to cross the street and comfort Mrs. Mahoney . As he reached the street he felt the first few scattered drops of rain . The sky had lightened . The drops struck his hat little glancing blows , and one cold drop slashed his cheek . Then he hesitated . Mrs. Mahoney , seeing him , had whirled about and was motioning at him not to approach her . Her face , distorted with anguish , was also filled with rage and hopelessness . But her jaw was firm and she motioned vigorously . Pastor Curry , nevertheless , felt it was his duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripping his bible tighter , but no sooner had he spoken a few words than Mrs. Mahoney , regaining her power of speech , began shouting at him . She cried that she had no use for him . Her tone was so vehement that the half dozen women at her side walked hurriedly away , lowering their glances . A few more drops of rain fell . In a patient voice Pastor Curry argued , but , to counteract this , Mrs. Mahoney 's pitch grew shriller . When Mrs. Mahoney became really angered she lost control of her saliva , and the sight of surplus spittle overrunning the woman 's lips caused the clergyman to feel a bit frightened . He stuck to his guns , however , talking soothingly . Finally Mrs. Mahoney , driven to desperation by his control and coolness , snatched up a small stool and brandished it ; and there was something so starkly primitive in the gesture that the minister , aghast , jumped back three feet . " If you act like that , I ca n't help you , Mrs. Mahoney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , leave me be ! " the woman screamed . " In the good name of Christ , leave me be ! " He started walking . The wind blew his dark coat out , but he made the distance to the church before the rain grew heavier . At the curb Mrs. Mahoney , sobbing brokenly , set the stool upon the sidewalk and sat down exhausted in a chair . With a quick , drumming sound , the rain hurried up the street . There was a loud clap of thunder , followed by a sudden , cold , lashing downpour . In a few minutes all the goods were dripping wet . Mrs. Mahoney , looking up to heaven with the rain driving inher face , wailed out her woe and sorrow and , with her clothes sticking to her beaten , middle-aged back , started rocking from side to side , moaning . Her hair become plastered to her scalp , while from both her ear lobes drops of water , like quivering beads of pearl , hung for a moment , then fell toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Steve Gallery , dressed in an old raincoat , was seen walking up the street toward her . He tried to get her to come into a hallway out of the rain , but she sat there rocking and moaning and would not budge . Finally he started moving the heavier pieces of furniture toward the wall of the building where the sidewalk was dry , and after a while , rising wearily , she helped . A minute later a few other men joined Steve and when they were finished , the soaked household goods were strung out in a long crooked line close against the tenement . Across the way , at the windows of all the houses up and down the street , were the silent , crowded , watchful faces of women and men and children .
