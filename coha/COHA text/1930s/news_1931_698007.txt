Purchases during this period have totaled $79,000.000 , bringing the banks ' portfolio to $678,000,000 , the largest on record except over the year-end of 1930 . These purchases are the first that have been made for any except seasonal purposes since June , 1930 . Only a part of the additional Federal Reserve credit thrown into the money market by these purchases has returned to the Federal Reserve banks .
