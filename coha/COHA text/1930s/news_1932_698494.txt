txt Mr. Rogers Expresses Thanks For Mr. Mellon 's Services To the Editor of The New York Times : ABOARD S. S. EUROPA , Feb. 5 . ? This is just a little note to " Uncle Andy " Mellon , the first man to step down in order to take the Ambassadorship to Great Britain . Mr. Mellon , you saved us taxes and you made us money , and we like a lot of " yaps " went and blew it in . When it was all gone we took it out on you . The thing busted in your face the same as it did in ours . This is a crisis where the bigger you were the harder you fell . We are mighty poor losers if we ca n't remember what you did and thank you , and wish you well . So goodbye Andy , take care of yourself . If you put on knee breeches be sure and put on long woolens underneath and always remember if we had saved what you saved for us we would n't need saving now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
