" How Far Must We Tolerate Intolerance ? " demanded Rev. Wilbur Larremore Caswell last week in the liberal Episcopal Churchman . Mr. Caswell thus stated a dilemma which bothers many a religious liberal . It was posed for him last month by a Nazi Bund rally on Washington 's Birthday in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden . That rally loudly cheered Adolf Hitler and Rev. Charles Edward ( " Silo Charlie " ) Coughlin , loudly booed President Roosevelt ( " Rosenfeld " to Bund speakers ) . Ejected from the meeting was Pundit Dorothy Thompson , who laughed shrilly at a speaker 's citation of the Golden Rule . The rally was perfectly legal , and Bund-sters ' freedom of speech was protected by police . All this moved Liberal Caswell to write : " It could well be that a rather severe limitation of liberty and even a censorship might not be too high a price to pay to save democracy from complete destruction . " To a liberal group which met last week in a West Philadelphia Y. M. C. A. , intolerance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its convictions . This Committee for Racial and Religious Tolerance-an organization headed by such men as Quaker Rufus Matthew Jones , Baptist Daniel Alfred Poling , Congressman Francis J. Myers-was in session when 30 hecklers burst into its meeting . The Committee tolerantly let them heckle . The invaders shouted denunciations of Jews and praise of Hitler , tossed around anti-Semitic pamphlets and stickers . <P> Detectives of Philadelphia 's radical squad were not so tolerant . They arrested eleven hecklers , including the chairman of a " Philadelphia Committee for the Defense of Constitutional Rights , " which pickets Station WDAS for not broadcasting Radiorator Coughlin 's speeches . The eleven , charged with inciting to riot , were each held in $1,000 bond , the dangers of intolerance have been Father Coughlin 's efforts to link Jews with Communism . This charge was lately riddled ( in a Commonweal article ) by an outstanding Catholic , Washington 's Monsignor John Augustine Ryan . Last week brought more rebukes , tacit and otherwise , for the radio priest . <P> &gt; Rev. Dr. Maurice Stephen Sheehy , able young Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radio with a scholarly speech detailing the pro-Jewish policies of the Popes , from the earliest ( the first Pope , St. Peter , and several of his immediate successors were born Jews ) to the late Pius XL Father Sheehy 's talk was made under the auspices of a new , interfaith Council Against Intolerance in America . <P> &gt; Father Coughlin 's weekly Social Justice ( price 10 ) ceased to print the statement that it was published " By permission of His Superior . " Reason : the Detroit archdiocese now considers it a secular , not a Catholic , organ . <P> &gt;Chief radio critic of Orator Coughlin is Father William Charles Kernan ( pronounced Kernan ) , a Yale-trained ( ' 23 ) high church Episcopalian , rector of Bayonne , N. J. 's Trinity Episcopal Church . Last fortnight , in the fourth of a series of anti-Coughlin blasts on Manhattan Station <P> WEVD , Father Kernan said of Father Coughlin 's " American Christian Program " :                @ @ @ @ @
