TO PRESIDENT HOOVER 'S APPEAL for nation- wide support for the drive for funds to care for the unemployed victims of our acquisitive economic system , we hope all the readers of The Nation will respond , even though they should feel , as we do , that the government is shirking its solemn duty in not assuming this responsibility . Mr. Hoover is of course correct , despite his " sob-stuff " rhetoric , in declaring that " no one with a spark of human sympathy can contemplate unmoved the possibilities of suffering . . . " in the coming winter . People are already dying of undernourishment , which means starvation , in all our large cities . Eyerywhere the depression has reduced men and women to despair , wiped out their savings , and deprived them of all hope for the future . Not to give " until it hurts " under these circumstances would be to show oneself callous indeed . That the dole will come if the depression lasts another two years is certain . Meanwhile , however , private benevolence will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves hard hit by the depression it ought to be possible to raise the sums asked  --  only $12,000,000 in New York City . Whether this sum will be large enough , in addition to the amounts voted by the municipality and the State , to care adequately for the 750,000 men and women in the metropolis now officially reported unemployed remains to be seen . W HEN THE FINANCIAL HISTORY of the present time comes to be written , our children will surely read with incredulity that in 1931 , when the United States had in its vaults $5,000,000,000 of gold  --  nearly half the world supply  --  foreign holders of credit began withdrawing gold in the fear that we were going to abandon the gold basis ! It is a situation to which only the author of " Alice in Wonderland " could really do justice , and the most striking illustration we have so far had of the unreasoning hysteria which has seized the world . Panic , of course , always tends to create the very event it fears : it has done so for Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desertion of the gold standard that has caused many people now to think that nothing is too incredible or ridiculous to be believed . Less than four weeks after England 's suspension of the gold standard , it is true , the Federal Reserve system has lost $650,000,000 in gold , a loss which breaks all records for so short a period ; the largest previous export of gold in any month was $100,000,000 in June , 1928 . But even with the present loss , our gold supply is still as great as it was in the spring of 1929 , when the chief concern of European and American economists was how our unparalleled holdings could be better distributed . Though the system 's reserve ratio has fallen in the last four weeks from 78 per cent to 62 per cent , the latter ratio is still ample . Moreover , it would be higher than it is were it not for an increase in note circulation in the same period of $605,000,000 , an increase made necessary at least in part by the hoarding of paper money by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold back to Europe would be an event to be greeted with real satisfaction . While we may still view the outflow calmly , there are several considerations which greatly reduce the satisfaction that might otherwise be felt . One is the very rapid rate of the withdrawal , which may prove slightly unsettling . Another is the fact that the gold is being withdrawn because of senseless panic , not because of basic changes in the flow of international trade . A third is that 80 per cent of the gold has been going , not to England or Germany , where it would prove most helpful , but to the one other country in the world that does not need it ? France . So far as our own position goes , it is quite clear that the Federal Reserve banks can offer gold without endangering their reserves far longer than foreigners will have the credit balances to enable them to pay for the gold . Meanwhile , one hardly knows whether the innuendoes reflecting on the dollar 's safety that have been appearing recently in a large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity or for their unscrupulousness . It would be illuminating to know not only who is inspiring them , but for what purpose . THE UNPREDICTABLE British election , which takes place on October 27 , ranges from free-for-all fights during the speeches of Sir Oswald Mosley , in which the candidate was hit by a chair in a Birmingham meeting and was provided , against his will , with a police escort , to meeting after meeting at which the deadly apathy of the British voter is the only thing to be noted . Even the Seaham district , in which Prime Minister MacDonald is trying to preserve his seat against the protests of his former Labor friends , can get up only sporadic enthusiasm or heckling . There have been a few meetings when even Mr. Mac-Donald 's charm and forceful oratory were not able to overcome the protests of the audience . It must have been bitter for him , who was , as he said , Labor at his birth , and would be " Labor till I die , " to hear the miners who sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into silence and call him names among which " Traitor ! " was not the least . J. H. Thomas , too , is coming in for his share of abuse . When he attempted to speak in behalf of Derwent Hall Caine in Liverpool he was greeted with shouts of " Twister ! " and was assured that " we are not going to starve in silence ! " The London City , that barometer of national attitudes , is betting heavy odds that the Conservatives will come in with a handsome majority . One can not be sure ; if the voters are in the main apathetic , it is not safe to predict that their apathy necessarily means Tory votes . Yet it is undeniable that the Labor Party is divided in counsel and lacking in decisive campaign leadership . The press , of course , is almost unanimous in support of the National Government . T HE PATRIOTS have found a new argument against disarmament : we must be prepared to defend ourselves from the Terrible . Turk ! Apparently hoping to start a back-fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International League for Peace and Freedom has had , the National Civic Federation is circulating a disarmament questionnaire to ascertain the " real " state of the public mind on this question . In a letter accompanying the questionnaire , Matthew Woll , acting president of the federation , calls attention to the " spectacular " Peace Caravan . He goes on to suggest that the many governors and mayors who signed the petition of the Women 's International League were not quite aware of what they were doing . Why ? Seemingly because the petition was the work of an ultra-pacifist organization which , with the Socialists and Communists , wants complete disarmament , whereas " all normal-minded Americans " favor limitation , which is " a very different proposition . " But even limitation must be limited , according to Acting President Woll , for " many advocates of limitation insist upon certain safeguards  --  particularly that our country and the other civilized nations , through neglect to provide adequate means of defense , shall not place themselves in a position where they can be overrun by the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is no wonder that , as Mr. Woll points out , there is " such great confusion " on the question of disarmament . P UBLIC COMPETITION with private enterprise in the utilities field may be urged by the Progressives in Congress as a solution of the utilities regulation and transportation problems . This course has been recommended by the committee of experts chosen at the Progressive Conference in Washington last spring to study these questions . " The federal and State governments , " the committee said in its report to Senator Norris , chairman of the conference , " should cooperate in establishing enterprises for the production and distribution of electric power wherever feasible , and thereby create standards of service and of rates which can be applied in regulation of privately owned and operated electrical utilities . " An experiment along these lines is already being tried under Governor La Follette in Wisconsin . In the case of the railroads , the committee said : " The federal government has the power to construct or to take over public highways . This power should be exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive with the privately owned railroads , " again with a view to establishing " standards of service and of rates " to be " applied in the regulation of private enterprises . " Proponents of private enterprise could not ask for a fairer deal than this . We believe that public competition is the most practical and workable solution of these problems . Moreover , we are morally certain that unless a definite solution , either this or some other that will fully protect the public interest , is soon found , it will not be long before private enterprise in the utilities field is wiped out . A LFRED EMANUEL SMITH , ex-Governor of New York , and the last candidate of the Democratic Party for the Presidency , dealt himself a deadly blow in New York on October 10 , when he attended the great campaign rally of Tammany Hall . This was the Al Smith who once impressed upon the country the idea that there was a new Tammany . This was the Al Smith whom men of all faiths had come to respect as one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept himself and his ideals clean . Yet there he was on the platform with the most brazen Mayor New York has ever had , joining with the " boys " in glorifying the Hall and the administration under which the city is being exploited as never before . The very week in which this meeting was held was the week in which it came out that Under-Sheriff Peter J. Curry on a salary of $7,500 a year had banked the sum of $622,311 between 1925 and 1931 , thus nearly doubling the sums banked by Sheriff Thomas M. Farley during the same period ? $360 , - 600 . If Mr. Smith had read the papers he must also have known that the Kings County ( Brooklyn ) Register banked $510,000 . For months revelations like these have been in the daily press as a result of the Seabury inquiry . Al Smith found nothing to deplore , nothing to regret . Instead , he gave a sweeping indorsement to all the candidates of Tammany Hall , whose appointees have thus grown rich while in public service . The - new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now what it always has been  --  a gigantic conspiracy to govern New York for the benefit of the pockets of the insiders of Tammany Hall and their friends . G ERMANY WILL GO into the coming winter , one that may prove the most difficult it has experienced since 1919 , with Heinrich Bruning still at the head of the government . The vote of the Reichstag sustaining the chancellor was not a vote for continued republican rule as against a possible fascist dictatorship ? Bnining has himself assumed virtual dictatorial control , though it may be hoped that this is only for the period of the economic emergency . Rather did the vote represent an unavoidable choice between a dictatorship of the moderates and possible civil warfare , for it is almost certain that victory for the right opposition would have been the signal for an outburst of violence from the Communists , if not also from the Socialists . The fascists and their Nationalist colleagues walked out of the Reichstag chamber when they saw their plan to unsaddle Bruning had failed . Their theatrical gesture , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed through a resolution , supported by the Social Democrats , under which the next instalment for the construction of armored cruiser " B , " amounting to about $2,500,000 , would be devoted to feeding children of the unemployed . The government and the middle parties , being in the minority , were unable to block the resolution and it was legally approved . Thus Germany 's unemployed were served in an unexpected but handsome manner by the " patriotic " fascists . O NCE MORE GERMANY 'S foreign-trade figures are outwardly reassuring . In September the excess of exports over imports amounted to $92,000,000 , the largest export surplus that Germany has achieved in any month since the war , exceeding by $9,000,000 even that of August , which itself had established a record . For the first nine months of the present year the export surplus has amounted to $457,000,000 . It must not be overlooked , however , that this so-called " favorable balance of trade " is not so much something that Germany has achieved as something that has been forced upon her . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable " since the latter part of 1929 ; but it was then , ' immediately after the New York stock-market collapse , that American bankers and investors stopped lending to Germany on a large scale . It was possible for Germany to have an excess of imports , even while she was making reparations payments to France , only because she was borrowing on long and short term from England and America . The panic this summer brought the possibility of securing such credit to an end . It is now virtually impossible , therefore , for Germany to have an import surplus , if only because there is no credit available for such a surplus . It remains to be seen how long the present export excess , secured through drastic economies in consumption and mainly the result , not of an increase in exports , but of a falling off in imports , can be maintained . B OTH THE CORTES and the church authorities in Spain are to be congratulated on their tactful handling of the religious problem . When the Cortes voted to separate church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had anticipated and vote to abolish all religious orders , although it did leave open the question of possible confiscation of their property in the future . On the other hand , the Papal Nuncio in Madrid refused to become alarmed when the Cortes took the action everyone had looked for . He informed the government that " the church feels wounded , but not hostile to the republic , " and told the press that he hoped there would be no rupture between the Vatican and Spain , for in that case he feared there would be a much more radical program adopted . President Zamora resigned because he thought the Cortes had gone too far , but even he took a strong stand against any hostile reaction on the part of the Catholics which might threaten the stability of the republic . There must be no thought , he warned , " of following the path of monarchical reaction or dictatorial madness . " There have been inevitable disorders as a result of the Cortes vote , the Catholic deputies from the Basque country have threatened to withdraw from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible religious war in the Basque provinces . But it is generally believed that Manual Azana , the new President , will be able to control the situation . p OLITICAL UNREST in quarters as yet undefined has been ascribed as the immediate cause of the government crisis in Mexico . But whale % er the immediate reasons for the sudden Cabinet changes , the crisis was not entirely unexpected . Economically Mexico has been suffering as much as the rest of the world . The treasury has been struggling with an unbalanced budget , with re , enues decreasing at an alarming rate . So serious had the situation become by early August that the government felt compelled to shift the national currency to a silver basis , but ' his served neither to check the increasing deficit nor to improve the general economic situation . Apart from economic troubles , Mexico has had to contend with political and social dissatisfaction . The revolutionary program has been all but forgotten , as was ably shown by Blas Urrea ( Luis Cabrera ) in The Nation of December 31 , 1930 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A symptom of the resultant unrest was the pistol battle on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies on August 25 , in the course of which one member was slain and two others wounded . The crisis has brought Plutarco Calles to the Ministry of War . Thus the former President now virtually controls both the army and the country 's financial system , having a few months ago assumed direction of the Bank of Mexico at the invitation of the government and leading financiers . YALE UNIVERSITY , much to its probable discom- fiture , has hatched another crop of mosquitoes to edit again the Harkness Hoot . These young pests hover over Yale 's precious architecture , thumb their noses at its partially Gothic elegance , refuse to be in any way cowed by the Harkness millions , and take an unholy delight in the inconsistencies they see taking shape about them  --  particularly in the Gothic exterior of Pierson-Davenport College and its Georgian inner court . They helpfully offer as their own proposed Yale building a drawing of a very prettily designed small church of American colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the Woolworth Building had ambled down Broadway and climbed up on the top of St. Paul 's Chapel . It is possible that the Yale powers-thatbe will find these criticisms merely annoying . An article in the magazine ; however , Sober Advice to Freshmen , by one of the editors , Richard S. Childs , should , if they retain any powers of self-criticism , fill them with shame . M r . Chi.is has drawn for them a picture of Yale as he sees it , the place where gentlemen are manufactured and scholars are laughed at , a shallow , self-seeking , trivial , insincere playground for young bond salesmen to make contacts in before they take up the serious business of life . This may or not be a just picture . But that a thoughtful young man , as Mr. Chods reveals himself to be , one who is already well on the I. ay to education and who possesses an enviable command of : he English language , should see the university in this light shows that something is wrong with Yale which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz of an undergraduate mosquito ; it is a serious indictment of one of the leading American universities . It should be taken seriously .
