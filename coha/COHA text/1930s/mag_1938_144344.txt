Yataghans at 15 Blocks <P> On Franklin Roosevelt 's desk , when reporters trooped into his office one day last week , lay a wicked-looking gold-handled seven-inch knife-a " yataghan , " presented to him by the Sultan of Muscat and Oman . Said the President , waving it over his head : " I can put it in the wall at 30 paces . " Replied New York Daily News Reporter Doris Fleeson : " How far down Pennsylvania Avenue can you throw it ? " <P> Three days after the President had exhibited his sheath-knife , the House of Representatives voted 204-to-196 to kill his Plan to reorganize the executive branch of the Federal Government . Upon Franklin Roosevelt , the net effect was comparable to that of having his own party toss a yataghan 15 blocks up Pennsylvania Avenue and put it squarely in between his shoulder blades . Reason : unlike the battle over the Supreme Court plan , the battle over the Reorganization Bill involved no major issue except whether Franklin Delano Roosevelt was still the master of his party . Until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . <P> Plans to reorganize the executive branch date back to the turn of the Century . Franklin Roosevelt 's plan , introduced just before the scheme to enlarge the court , resembled one proposed by Herbert Hoover . Recognized for what it was-a straightforward attempt to increase efficiency-it occasioned little indignation . The President 's subsequent sad effort to streamline the Supreme Court naturally made suspect his efforts to streamline anything else . As redrafted and passed by the Senate , the Reorganization Bill 's principal provisions allowed the President to shift executive agencies with certain important exceptions , appoint one man to replace the present three-man Civil Service Commission , choose six administrative assistants " with a passion for anonymity , " created a Department of Welfare and rearranged the Federal accounting system . The last thing in the world the Reorganization Bill represented was an effort on the part of Franklin Roosevelt to make himself a dictator . That it was attacked as precisely this proved that to a large section of the U. S. any administrative change which the President now suggests can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no kind of Congress wants to give up patronage , for one of the most important phases of the bill would have facilitated putting hundreds of appointive jobs under Civil Service . <P> The Supreme Court fight , concerning a question on which there was ample room for valid difference of opinion , was lost in the ordinarily self-willed Senate . It was of the greatest significance that last week 's battle was lost in a chamber normally more amenable to Administrative wishes .
