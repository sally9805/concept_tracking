That vitamins A and D can now be produced to sell as cheaply as good brandy is a fact which the chemical engineers of Arthur D. Little , Inc. let out of the pandora box of industry last week . The process simply requires distillation in a vacuum . This is an engineering feat so new that few industrialists know that it exists or what it means . Patents belong to English and Dutch concerns ( Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. , Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Co . Ltd .. Batavian Petroleum Co . ) . In the U. S. , Eastman Kodak Co. is using the method to refine organic mixtures like cod liver oil , which decompose before they boil . <P> The simple apparatus for vacuum distillation includes a cylinder set squarely within another cylinder like an arm in a sleeve . A heating device keeps the inner cylinder warm . The outer cylinder remains at room temperature or may be cooled . A vacuum pump exhausts air from the space between the two cylinders . When the vacuum has been created , the liquid to be distilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the liquid flows , molecules of vitamin A or D or other light substances pop off , jump the inter-cylinder gap , condense on the inner wall of the bigger cylinder . Condensed , they dribble down into a container , while the heavier fluid flowing down the inner cylinder runs off into a second pair of evacuated cylinders . <P> The temperature of the second pair may be higher than that of the first . In that case heavier molecules will be driven from the mother liquid , and a new . distillate is produced . The number of cylinder sets in such a vacuum still may amount to a dozen , but four or five seems to be the most efficient series . <P> Europeans use vacuum distillation to strip the flavor ingredients and vitamins from butter . Their vitamin concentrates are reported free from all taste , stable and suitable for mixture with foods . They also sublime hormones from urine , soap stock from fish , caffeine from coffee , quinine from cinchona bark .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
