Last week in Washington , 1,500 businessmen descended on the Capitol in a fleet of taxicabs to tell Congressmen that they must vote for a two-year extension of NRA . In Manhattan William Green of the A. F. of L. roared to 18,000 clothing workers a threat of a general strike if Congress did not vote a two-year extension of NRA . At the White House Franklin Roosevelt came out strongly for two more years for NRA . The Ways &; Means Committee of the House obediently prepared to report a bill for NRA extension . And the Supreme Court knocked the constitutional props out from under NRA in the first test case of that No. 1 New Deal agency . <P> Guards stood at the door of the Courtroom keeping crowds of tourists at bay in the corridors . Newshawks and those with passes entered the Courtroom through the adjoining marshal 's office . At the counsel table sat Donald Richberg and Solicitor General Stanley Reed who had argued the test case , both in fine fettle . <P> " I feel , " said Mr. Richberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jury to come in-guilty or not guilty . " <P> Only persons to worry , however , about legal guilt were four Brooklyn poulterers , Joseph , Martin , Alex &; Aaron Schechter . Were they guilty of violating the law of the land because , contrary to the Poultry Code , they had allowed their customers to pick what chickens they bought , instead of making customers take chickens by the coop , good and bad alike ? Were they guilty because , also contrary to code , they had sold an allegedly sick chicken ? Guilty for not paying their employes code wages , not working them code hours ? For not making proper code reports ? For conspiring to do these things ? A Federal Circuit Court of Appeals had held them guilty on 17 counts , innocent on only two concerning wages and hours ( TIME , May 13 et ante ) . It was for the Supreme Court to decide finally whether the Schechters were guilty of breaking a real law or whether NRA was guilty of having regulated U. S. business for nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Court filed in looking cheerful , particularly Chief Justice Hughes , Justices Stone and McReynolds . By turns the Justices began to read decisions . Justice Butler read one of little public interest . Justice Sutherland read one making news , in which it was held that President Roosevelt had no right to oust a Federal Trade Commissioner without specific cause ( see p. 11 ) . Next , more news : Mr. Justice Brandeis declared the Frazier-Lemke Farm Mortgage Bill unconstitutional ( see p. 15 ) . Then all that news of a newsworthy Court session grew inconspicuous . The Chief Justice announced that he would read the Court 's decision concerning four poulterers from Brooklyn . Donald Richberg visibly stiffened and grew pale . The Chief Justice began to read . Only a few sentences had left his mouth when a newshawk scribbled on a piece of paper : ' ' Can there be a new Recovery Law ? " , passed it to Donald Richberg . A moment later it came back , bearing the comment of the NIRB Acting Chairman-a huge question mark . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justices unanimously agreed that the power of code-making was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority by Congress . That meant that 557 NRA codes were no longer the law of the land . Said Chief Justice Hughes :
