Fifty years ago U. S. art students headed for Rome in a fever of esthetic excitement . " I went reeling and moaning thro ' the streets ! " said Henry James of his first visit . If art students reel less easily nowadays it is not because Rome is less intoxicating , but because they have a harder time freeing their minds of the parlous state of art in the modern world , the parlous state of the world itself . Last week a 27-year-old architect named Erling Frithjof Iversen , winner of this year 's Prix de Rome , revealed the sobriety of his generation when he took the occasion of his victory to comment darkly on the dark outlook for modern architects . <P> The Prix de Rome is the choicest plum for U. S. art students who are under 30 and unmarried . It gives them two years at the American Academy in Rome , from $1,400 to $1,500 a year , studio and materials , freedom to travel . To win it , Architect Iversen got through preliminaries that eliminated 74 entrants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition with eight other finalists . The problem : to design an open-air theatre for a city of 500,000 , in an amusement park on the westerly edge of a hypothetical lake , with the stage mounted on a barge . Said Winner Iversen , unflushed by his victory , " I do n't think I could get a $30 a week architecture job here right now . " <P> Born in Manhattan of Norwegian parents , big , chubby-cheeked Erling Iversen is a graduate of New York University , lives in Brooklyn , studied this past year at Princeton 's Graduate School . His fellowship requires that he spend some six months each year in Rome , but the rest of the time , far from reeling and moaning through the streets . Architect Iversen intends to travel- " if they keep the peace , " he said gloomily , " which I doubt . "
