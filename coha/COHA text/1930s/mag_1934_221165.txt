Far higher above the earth than any balloon has ever ascended lies a series of curved shells of electrified air which scientists call the ionosphere . From this ionized region of upper space radio waves carom and curl around the earth . For two years Carnegie Institution 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism has had under way a program of ionosphere research mustering a platoon of scientists and ranging from the tropics to the far North . At the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , Dr. Edward Olson Hulburt kept track of the work , conferred with the workers . Last week in the Physical Review he put forth some remarkable conclusions : <P> There are three major ionized layers . Their heights were obtained by noting the time required for radio echoes to return to Earth . As the signal frequency is stepped up , a " critical frequency " is usually found at which the signals shoot through a lower layer and bounce back from a higher , or escape into space . By this means density of ionization and fluctuations therein may be charted . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F1 ( 65 and 130 miles up ) are not deadly cold but fairly hot . Their temperature seems to be 80 F. , with a daily and seasonal variation above &; below that point of about 55 . <P> During a total eclipse of the sun , loss of ionization is sevenfold greater than usual . <P> At night the two top layers , F1 , and F , merge into one . <P> The top layer , F , is " strongly heated " where the sun enters it vertically . From that point winds of heat-expanded air blow out in all directions , carrying tides of dense ionization , like a jet of water pouring over a round ball . But the Earth-ball is also rotating . Where the expanding waves go in the direction of rotation the wave-front is smooth ; where they go against it they are like whitecaps in a tide rip .
