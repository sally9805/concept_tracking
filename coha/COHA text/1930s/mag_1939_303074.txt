While Hitler was marching east last week ( see p. 16 ) , Central European Correspondent G. E. R. Gedye published in World 's Press News ( British equivalent of Editor &; Publisher ) a blistering attack on the English press . After telling how he had to resign from the London Telegraph for criticizing British foreign policy in his book , Betrayal in Central Europe , Correspondent G. E. R. Gedye published in evidence of censorship : " Today one great Conservative newspaper is actually binding its foreign correspondents to write nothing whatever outside its columns without permission . " Everybody knew he meant the London Times . <P> A century ago the press of England , if not its Government , was made of tougher stuff . The Times was not the Government organ it is now but a muckraking , anti-aristocratic , jingoistic sheet . In 1854 it helped to push the country into the Crimean War , then ribbed the Government for all its blunders and published such thorough accounts of British strategy that the Russians were tipped off on it in advance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our army is not only melting away but our national position is doing the same , that ill bird The Times wh. daily fouls its own nest contributes powerfully to the decline of England . . . . Things are bad enough Heaven knows in the Crimea but the glowing colors in wh. every detail is painted have excited the people of this country almost to madness &; have led among other things to a ministerial crisis .

" Wicked , " clucked the Prince Consort . " Insolent , " sniffed Mr. Gladstone . Lord John Russell wrote to Lord Clarendon : " . . . If England is ever to be England again , this vile tyranny of The Times must be cut off . " <P> Hated and feared by the ruling classes , The Times was nevertheless always first to print stories of ministerial crises ( often before they occurred ) , got first copies of dispatches from diplomats abroad , read the Queen 's speeches before the Queen herself had read them . Editor Delane made Cabinet members so scared of The Thunderer that often they hurried to tell him their most vital decisions to save themselves from attack . <P> Incorruptible , impervious to social lionizing , Delane had one weakness as an independent editor : he would do almost anything to maintain his supply of exclusive news . When Lord Palmerston , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1855 , Delane made peace to keep his sources of information secure .
