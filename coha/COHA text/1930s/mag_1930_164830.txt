A curious election was held last week in Chicago . It was preceded by no oratory , either to praise , defame or nominate a candidate . There were , officially , no candidates . Nonetheless Rt . Rev. Dr. James De Wolf Perry , Bishop of Rhode Island , was elected presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the U. S. , became thereby the U. S. analog to Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang , Archbishop of Canterbury . <P> Bishop Perry was chosen amid the whining of a great Chicago blizzard ( see p. 13 ) so tempestuous that only 84% of the 134 bishops eligible to vote could make their way through it . On the seventh ballot , after unofficial conferring , he received 69 votes , one more than the necessary majority . No one was surprised . <P> Bishop Perry now finds in his hands the task of national Episcopal coordination , for which he has been strongly recommended by able services in reorganizing and simplifying the operations of the National Council . This work churchmen believe will , among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from affairs spiritual in the church . <P> Bishop Perry succeeds the late Bishop Charles Palmerston Anderson who died on Jan. 30 .
