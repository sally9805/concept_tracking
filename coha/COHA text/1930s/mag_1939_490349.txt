FOR years , nine-year-old Dan Frentress , of Portales , New Mexi- co , laughed at everything he saw , getting a local reputation for being balmy . Checking up , the doctors discovered he had " camera eyes , " a condition that makes him see everything upside down and backward , and they despair of ever being able to help him . Our advice to them is to let him alone . We like to think of this child going down the street wrapped up in his private conviction that the world is hilarious . If these paragraphs occasionally lack the antic touch , it is because the world , observed right side up and from left to right , produces something less than mirth . We would like to have Dan 's peculiar gift sometime , just long enough to dash off a few little notes explaining what a sidesplitting world it is , and what a merry time .

You may remember that Lord &; Taylor got into the newspapers two months ago when the Fifth Avenue Association publicly bawled them out for staging a realistic blizzard in their windows . Mr. Elles Derby of the Association told us that the no-motion-in-windows policy was adopted in 1924 . The purpose , of course , is to prevent gaudy electric signs , parades of live models such as you can see on Fourteenth Street , or even , God forbid , electric buzzers of the sort that attracts you to the windows of joke shops . The Association consists of a thousand-odd merchants  --  all but a dozen or so small shops  --  who do business on the Avenue . They vote on their rules , of which they have many , and usually abide by them . Three inspectors patrol the sidewalks , looking for violations . However , the Association ca n't do anything to the offending store ; just tries " moral suasion , " Mr. Derby told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the only thing that happened was another lawless window display  --  the Christmas bells . This was a double violation , sound being forbidden as well as motion . Lord &; Taylor is really the enfant terrible of the Avenue , we learned . Last February they had eight windows devoted to displays featuring different kinds of perfume ; above the windows were atomizers spraying scent on the passers-by . You can imagine what the Association thought about that . Most of the crack window-dressers are employed on the Avenue , and they chafe under the restrictions . Once jaeckel had a tiny electric signboard , like Douglas Leigh 's Wilson 's Whiskey on Broadway , advertising their winter for sale ; it was cute , but the Association persuaded them to take it out . Helena Rubinstein celebrated the openinL , of her new quarters by displaying live models framed head and shoulders in reproductions of old masters ; said it was Art , and she would n't stop for anybody .

Marcus has several times installed windows showing model stage sets , with rising curtains ; the Association keeps asking them not to do it again . But it was thumbs down on Dorothy Gray 's idea of creating a rainstorm with BB shot , Bergdorf 's dream of having cobblers make shoes in their windows , and the project of another shoeshop , which involved girls in period costume putting on and taking off pretty little boots . Now that sight , sound , and smell have been used to attract attention , we asked a decorator we know about the possibility of appealing to the other two senses , taste and touch . " Well , not taste , " he told us ; then , suddenly inspired , he cried , " But I can certainly understand that some rich fabric could he projected to advantage through a slot in the glass . " %Ye shall see . Little Mixup AS strange a tale as ever we heard is 1 the one about a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the Consolidated Edison Company of New York . It started with this Miss Johnson deciding she wanted a new tray for the broiler part of her gas oven . She notified the Edison Company by let-. ter , specifying the size of the tray and asking them to send it around at their earliest convenience . They replied that they would be glad to send one of their men to make the installation if she would let them know when she 'd he at home , because it was dangerous for laymen to tinker with gas ovens . Miss Johnson is a busy girl with a job , but she finally fixed an appointment for one o'clock the next Saturday . At about one-ten there was a great fuss outside  --  sirens , bells , shouts ? and the next thing she knew people were heating on her apartment door . When she opened it , in came a couple of cops , a uniformed Edison Company man , and a hospital interne with an oxygen tank . " Whcreza guy ? " thy shouted at her .

" Miss Johnson admitted him and he proceeded to slide the tray into the oven . " I would of been here at one o'clock only some dope put down the wrong address for me , " he told her . " Good thing , too , because when I got to that place there was a guy trying to commit suicide by sticking his head in the gas oven . He 'll be O.K. , though , " the fellow concluded cheerily . " I opened all the windows and sent for the ( Inc around the corner , and the guy 's going to he O.K. " Brit if , WHEN WHEN Richard C. Gill returned from a seven months ' expedition into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers reported that he 'd brought back a drug that would prevent baldness . We went over to the Hotel Shelton , where he and his wife were staying before departing for Washington , and found him to be a tall , tweedy man with a fine head of hair , graying at the temples . He said right off that he was n't sure the tonsorial drug , avelina rosada in Spanish but nameless as yet in English , was a cure for anything . All he knows is that certain Indians who brew it from roots and shampoo their heads with it have luxurious hair and that certain other Indians who do n't brew it become bald and gray . This k significant but not conclusive . Mr. Gill has had several offers from hair-tonic people but has refused them all ; his interest in the drug is scientific . Mr. Gill , Cornell ' 25 , and for a time an English teacher at Lafayette , first visited South America twenty years ago . Deciding that Ecuador was the most pleasant country there , in 1929 he bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at the edge of the jungle , and started a dude ranch  --  the only one in South America . It has n't been open to guests for a couple of years , but before that he was host to all sorts of world travellers : three schoolteachers from Brooklyn , writers picking up material and color , a hank robber from Philadelphia and a murderer from Texas ( passing through hastily on their way to the jungle ) , and Donald Oenslager , who on his return to this country designed the tropical settings for the Mgt 's production of " Salome " in 1934 . Mr. Gill himself has written two books and many magazine articles , and has made more expeditions , using the ranch as a base , than he can remember . The last one was to get drugs ; he found seventy , including the one that interests him most  --  curare , the brown , gummy substance , extracted from vines , which the Indians use to poison arrows . It 's interesting to scientists because it has a relaxing effect . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a grain  --  it may prove helpful in treating hydrophobia , tetanus , and other afflictions which involve convulsive paralytic symptoms . Mr. Gill 's drugs will he analyzed at the Newyork Botanical Garden , after which he expects to know how much of the Indians ' witchcraft is hokum and how much has therapeutic or cosmetic value . He 's in on the secrets of the Canelos , a friendly tribe , having shown them some white man 's magic : trapping Inti , the sun , and having him shine at night  --  or , more specifically , turning on a flashlight . In recognition of this feat , they made him a bru jo , or witch doctor . " I can hobble a pretty good pot of poison now , " he told US . On his last expedition , he was accompanied by his wife and seventy porters and went so far into the jungle that it took twenty days to get out once he 'd collected his drugs . For six weeks , moreover , the party was stranded without food , except such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery of supplies broke down when Ecuador and Peru became involved in a border dispute . The most exciting moment came when the trip was all over . Gill was unpacking a case nailed up several weeks before and a hungry bushmaster popped out , as poisonous as curare .

It seems that a Mr. Farr was vacationing on the Riviera some time ago and was invited to dinner by P. G. Wodehouse . While they were having cocktails , Mr. Wodehouse said apologetically that he was afraid dinner was n't going to be very good that evening ; his butler had run off that morning with Wodehouse 's studs and the best silver . Chimney Sweeps RECENDECENTLY a couple of islands got TLY the newspapers , driving our Mr. Stanley frantic with excitement . The islands in question are the Chimney Sweeps , which lie a little way off Orchard Beach ( the Bronx 's Jones Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take these islets from their owner by the process of condemnation and use them as a base of operations for municipal fireworks . Stanley hopped right up to City Island , hired a rowboat , and rowed over to the Chimney Sweeps . On the westward island he found two small , unpainted shacks , one of which had evidently been pushed about by the hurricane ; on the eastward one stood a single house with green shingled walls . There was nothing else on the Sweeps but rocks : no humans , not even a blade of grass . Back at City Island , Stanley chatted with some old salts who remembered something of the islands ' history . Years ago , it seems , wild duck used to congregate out there in great numbers ; it was n't unusual for the local hunters to bag as many as a thousand in a day 's shooting . The Chimney Sweeps also figured romantically in the development of the old silent movies . Whenever you saw Pauline , at the end of an installment , dangling perilously from a rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff was a Chimney Sweeps rock and the sea was Long Island Sound . Stanley next called up Deputy Mayor Curran , who said that the present owner had refused to sell and that the city would shortly take the islands , paying about $3,000 . Without being asked , he volunteered the opinion that the islands got their curious name because they were " two forlorn little orphan islands . " " You think of chimney sweeps as forlorn little orphans , " he explained . " That 's true , " said Stanley . In the office of the Bronx County Registry , his next stop , Stanley found the easterly and westerly islands officially described as being .383 acre and .147 acre in size , respectively . The first owner wasa Thomas Pell , who received them by grant in 1666 from the Colonial government . Title ultimately reverted to the State , and in 1893 the State gave them , free , to Henry D. Carey . An Allen Carey sold them to Franz Marquardt in 1914 , and in 1920 Marquardt sold them to the Chimney- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation was listed as Mr. Russell Smith of the Chase National Bank . Mr. Smith , a mild-mannered man with thinning hair who works in the accounting department , got together with Stanley for a drink after banking hours and told him about the corporation . He and eight friends had bought the islands jointly as a place to go for summer weekends and issued a share of stock apiece .. They used to have fine times there , with lots of privacy and excellent swimming and fishing . Once Mr. Smith and three of his friends rescued a party of canoeists caught in a sudden squall , and the Life Saving Benevolent Association gave them gold medals . In recent years the other members all sold out to Mr. Smith , though some of them still go out for weekends . He 's naturally worked up about the fnrthcnming condemnation ; says it 's unfair and arbitrary , and that , anyway , he probably wo n't get his money for three or four years . As to the name , he thinks it comes from an unusual English usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water between two rocks in the ocean . From that to Chimney Sweeps is only a step . In a Tearoom AMAN went into a tearoom in the East Fifties for lunch last Wednesday , figuring that he could at least get scrambled eggs and coffee with no fuss or marshmallow . The eggs were so nice that he decided to take a chance on dessert , too . He found hot mince pie on the menu , so he ordered some . " Hot mince pie ? " said the young lady . " Oh , dear , I must have given you yesterday 's menu . Tuesday is hot-mincepie day . Today is **38;928;TOOLONG day . " ?

" Crossed Paths FOR the benefit of future chroniclers of the McKesson &; Robbins affair , we present the story of Leo Leventritt . His tale begins in 1913 , when Philip Musica , dealer in human hair , was languishing in the Tombs without counsel , awaiting trial on the charge of using fraudulent bills of lading in his importing business . He stayed there for two years before pleading guilty and receiving a suspended sentence , and during this time a frequent visitor to his cell was Leventritt , who was the son of Judge David Leventritt of the New York Supreme Court , and a lawyer himself , and had been appointed amicus airily ' , or friend of the court , in the case . Leventritt was supposed to convince Musica that by revealing the hiding place of some $180,000 worth of missing assets , he 'd get off easier . At first Musica was polite but stubbornly uninformative . Finally , at the urging of a priest ( Musica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked . The lawyer and the prisoner of to know each other pretty well during all this , but after the trial Musica disappeared entirely from Leventritt 's ken . The lawyer did n't miss him much ; he had already sized him up as a born crook . Next in the chronicle comes a day in the spring of 1936 , over twenty years later . Leventritt had by then retired from his law practice because of ill health and opened a liquor store on Madison Avenue called the Cork &; Bottle . Like many other men in the trade , he bought some of his stock from McKesson &; Robbins and one day a McKesson salesman asked him to accompany him to his office in New York to meet the president of the firm . It seems that Mr. Coster , checking up on retail outlets , had dropped in at the Cork &; Bottle and had been favorably impressed , but had failed to find the proprietor in at the time . Leventritt went to the McKesson office . At the meeting , Coster went into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen much . He was thinking hard . After ten minutes he said , " Have n't our paths crossed somewhere before ? Your face looks awfully familiar . " At this , Mr. Coster looked Mr. Leventritt straight in the eye and said , " I do n't remember 3ou . It must be a case of mistaken identity . " Leventritt let the matter drop , thereby missing probably as good a chance as anyone had of busting the Coster bubble before the Peace of Munich . The story skips to a day a few weeks ago when Leventritt was playing bridge and discussing the early reports on the McKesson &; Robbins involutions . " It reminds me of the Musica case I worked on before the war , " he said , leading a trump . A few days later the CosterMusica relationship was exposed ; Leventritt almost fell out of his chair when he picked up the paper . He was soon able , though , to say " I told you so " to his bridge-playing friends . Thinking the matter over now , he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in 1936 . He is sure that at the interview Musica knew who he was . Leventritt has n't changed much in appearance : he 's frequently recognized by people he has n't seen since he left college ( Columbia ' 06 ) . He 's convinced , too , that his failure to identify Musica was caused by more than the mere effects of glasses and gray hair . His conviction is that the master criminal had had a facial operation . Thoughts of II OM " WE know an anxious young mother whose son went away to school for the first time last fall . When he came hack for Christmas vacation , she naturally made quite a fuss over him . He seemed somewhat averse to sentimentalism , however , preferring to keep the conversation on such matters as hockey and skiing . Finally his mother reproached him . " I do n't believe you 've even thought about me since you went away ! " she cried . " But I have , Mother , " he said , " and always very pleasantly . "
