One hundred years ago last week a persevering Yankee named Charles Goodyear brewed some crude rubber , sulfur and white lead on his kitchen stove , discovered vulcanization . That invention changed rubber from a scientist 's plaything to one of mankind 's most useful commodities . Today there are some 35,000 uses for rubber , 4,000,000 people are employed in the industry and its world-wide investment comes to $2,698,000,000 . Greatest concentration of this great sum is found in Ohio 's 122 rubber factories and last week in Akron , " rubber capital of the world , " the industry celebrated its centennial by unveiling an eight-foot bronze statue of Vulcanizer Goodyear , presented to the city by Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. ' s President Paul W. Litchfield . <P> Charles Goodyear never visited Akron . His invention arrived there in 1869 , eleven years after his death . That year , Dr. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich founded the city 's first rubber company , choosing the town because the Ohio &; Erie Canal afforded cheap transportation . Goodrich celebrated its 70th birthday last week by announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $878,580 . Surpassing it in size are three younger competitors-Firestone Tire &; Rubber , U. S. Rubber , Goodyear Tire &; Rubber . Goodyear , now the industry 's biggest ( with 1938 profit of $6,012,423 on net sales of $165,000,000 ) , was founded in Akron in 1898 by the Seiberling family , has no connection with Inventor Goodyear save its name , chosen to do him honor . <P> The rubber industry rises and falls with automobile sales and the price of crude rubber . Two years ago most of the companies were sagging under heavy inventories ; currently , the tire inventory position is the lowest in four years and revival of the automobile industry gives rubbermen reason to anticipate an excellent year . But though tire and tube sales are the industry 's mainstay , providing 65% of total volume , the most significant fact about rubber today is its technological progress . At the threshold of its second 100 years , the industry is bubbling over with new ideas , new products . <P> More pounds of rubber now go into automobile accessories than into tires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business only because of replacement demand . The average car requires 40 Ib. of rubber for its accessories ; some cars have as many as 300 rubber parts . And these do not include a new rubber spring Goodrich is perfecting , a new rubber shock absorber of Firestone 's , or the industry 's current prize hope-sponge rubber cushions , which it believes will supplant horsehair , coil springs and other upholstering material not only in cars but in mattresses and furniture . <P> All the companies are experimenting with rubber-laminated walls for houses . A section of rubber paving in Akron 's East Market Street that has lasted ten years points to a lucrative field if crude rubber prices ever fall low enough to compete with concrete . Rubber is vulnerable to oil and sun , so scientists have developed rubbery synthetics like DuPrene which are not . Such new products as Goodyear 's Pliofilm and Goodrich 's Koroseal are beginning to threaten Cellophane as packaging material . From rubber conveyor belts ( Grand Coulee Dam has one 10,000 ft. long ) , the industry expects to make millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
