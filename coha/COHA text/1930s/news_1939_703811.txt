txt A warning that dissension in Democratio ranks would lead to defeat in 1940 lams delivered today to House Democrats by their leaders , whose alarm over the possibility of a split has spread to the Senate and to Democrats elsewhere in the capital . The " harmony " meeting probably will have at least a temporary benefit , a concensus showed , but expressions of House " moderates " indicated that they would await some show of cooperation from the White House rather than , in the words of one member , be called upon to do " all the cooperating . " Meanwhile , it was revealed that self-appointed agents of party peace , some of them officials high in the Administration , had been sounding out Democratic Senators of the moderate faction to see how far they would go toward healing the breach between them and the White House . They made it clear that they were not yet speaking for President Roosevelt in their peace overtures . In fact , the Senators were told , it was not known whether the President would even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind . They were acting on their own volition and as Democratic leaders from various States on duty in Washington who were becoming rapidly convinced that if the schism in the party is not closed the Presidency and the Congress will be handed over to the Republicans on a silver platter in 1940 . Hearken to Mutual Concessions These intermediaries found a responsive note among the leading " moderates " in the Senate , particularly to their suggestion that the party peace would have to be reached through mutual concessions . Reciprocity , however , was the one thing they could not yet guarantee from the wing of the party which controls the executive branch of the government . " The President holds the key to the whole problem , " was the way one Senator put it . The same sentiment was expressed in the House caucus by several members of the moderate group , and , inferentially , by some of the Administrationists . Representative Drewry of Virginia , chairman of the Democratio Congressional Committee , which is charged with the task of holding the party front in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were seated in that chamber by less than a 10 per cent majority of the votes in their districts . Unless there was to be unity , he said , there could be no victory in 1940 . Mr. Drewry was said to have laid about him on all sides . President Roosevelt 's attempted " purge " of last Summer and Fall was given as one reason for dissension . Resentment and ill feeling had been created , he said , not only among those directly affected but generally in Congress , and the dissension had spread in the party throughout the country . But , he said , he stood squarely behind the Administration because only in unity could there be victory in 1940 . Rayburn Calls for Cooperation Representative Rayburn , the majority leader ; Speaker Bankhead and Representative McCormack , chairman of the caucus , pleaded with their colleagues to cooperate with the President in his program , and to stop bickering over amendments to bills and quit following the Republicans down the aisles when teller votes are taken . Representative Cox of Georgia , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have retorted sharply that the Administration would do well to cooperate with Congress instead of asking Congress to do all the cooperating . Mr. Cox later said publicly that he stood For independence and freedom of action in Congress , and that " we lo not want to be treated like wooden men to be pushed over at the will and whim of the Presi- dent . " He asserted that the President would do well to take members of Congress into his confidence . Mr. Rayburn complained that not enough Democrats were in their seats during consideration of the bills in committee of the whole . When bills were considered under the rules of committee of the whole , Republicans were able , with the help of Democratic moderates , to write in much legislation . In such a way , advocates of reduced relief spending clinched their victory . Mr. Rayburn said he told the President y-sterday there was an honest difference of opinion among House Democrats over relief , but no evidence of a revolt or a desire to offend him . Objects to New Relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a White House favorite , was said to have objected to Mr. Roosevelt 's message asking $150,000,000 more for relief just after he had signed the bill expressing Congress 's will on the subject . It amounted to a rebuff , a rebuke and an affront to Congress , Mr. Randolph was quoted as having told the caucus . Private expressions of members after the caucus indicated that the President 's message for additional relief was the most tender of a number of Congressional wounds over White House treatment . Realizing this , an Administration spokesman suggested after the caucus that as a compromise Congress lop off an average of $15,000 , - 000 from each of the ten major appropriation bills and , with this saving , grant the $150,000,000 more for relief . The idea was not well received , however , by some of the " moderates . " They indicated they would oppose the additional relief grant in any event and would go along for reductions on all bills . Mr. Rayburn and Speaker Bankhead insisted that the present situation is not a split and predicted harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack the whip to compel Democratic members to attend the sessions . This was said to have brought from one " moderate " the observation , accompanied by a wink , that perhaps it would not be too well for some of the President 's proposals if all the Democrats were in their seats . Last night several House liberals met and decided to do all in their power to promote party harmony . Democrats Still Stay Away By The Associated Press : WASHINGTON , Feb. 14 . ? House leaders gathered Democratic Congressmen into a meeting today with the intention of infusing in them a spirit of party unity , solidarity and harmony . While no votes were in prospect until tomorrow , two hours after the conference had ended forty-five Republicans and forty-two Democrats were on the House floor during debate on an Administration defense bill . Many Democrats joined their leaders , however , in insisting that the " harmony " meeting had been a success . Most of the criticisms and complaints , they said , were intended to be constructive , rather than caustic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to " blow off some steam " helped , they said , to knot the House Democrats more closely together . But Representative Martin 3 . Kennedy , Democrat of New York , labeled the conference an utter failure and added : " The only impression I got was that the President had given the leadership a spanking for their failure to deliver the goods , and they in turn were crying on the shoulders of the House membership . " Members said that Speaker Bankhead had conceded that some mistakes had been made which did not foster Democratic unity and had asked the members to let by-gones be by-gones and cooperate with the Administration . Not Ail Criticism for White House The Administration itself did not take all the criticism that was passed out , however . One speaker was reported to have denounced the Appropriations Committee for permitting the Relief and the Independent Offices Appropriations Bills to reach the House in such shape that roll-call votes could not be obtained on vital issues . There was no record vote on restoring the relief fund to the $875 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there one on an amendment to the Independent Offices Bill which cut $17 , - 000,000 from the appropriation for the TVA and was designed to halt construction on the Gilbertsville and other TVA dams . Administration bills will get into trouble , the critic was reported to have remarked , as long as members do not have to go on record with their votes . It was the second conference of House Democrats in two days that had been called because of concern over the way Republicans had been working together , turning out in full force for major votes , and teaming up with anti-New Deal Democrats . Members who comprise a remnant of the old " liberal bloc " met last night to plan help for New Deal legislation . Representative Martin , Democrat of Colorado , said a score of members were present . Asserting that " we 've got knocked on our backs " three times since Congress convened , Mr. Martin said the meeting had decided first , to see that more Democrats attended sessions of the House , and second , to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders . " " We do not subscribe to the theory that the New Deal is on the way out , " Mr. Martin said . " I personally predict that if the Democrats do not ' ake steps to correct these two practices , there will not be enough Democrats after 1940 to make any difference . "
