THE FOOL OF THE FAMILY-Margaret Kennedy-Doubleday , Doran ( $2 ) . <P> Old Albert Sanger died , Tessa died , Lewis Dodd went back to the efficient arms of Florence Churcill , whom he had married without knowing exactly why . With things that way The Constant Nymph ended ; the story of the Sanger family , Sanger 's circus , seemed to be over . But Tessa 's brothers , Sebastian and Caryl , were left . The Fool of the Family tells about them . With these two so different Sangers Margaret Kennedy continues the story that The Constant Nymph started in 1924 . <P> Caryl has little in common with Sebastian . He likes him as a brother , as a reminder of the strange happy days when the family was together . But Sebastian is too much the turbulent , nose-thumbing Sanger for intimate comradeship . And Caryl , so far as Sebastian is concerned , is little more than the fool of the family , a queer fellow simply because he is quite without eccentricity or individuality of any sort . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastian , whether he especially wants them to or not . <P> In Venice they meet . Disaster immediately pounces upon Caryl . Powerless to prevent it , he sees his first opportunity to attract some notice as a pianist casually swept aside by his brother . Sebastian 's motives are purely fraternal when he starts out to help Caryl find Fenella , the girl Caryl loves , the girl who has sworn eternal love to him . Caryl again sits by while Sebastian 's fraternal motives are overcome by something warmer . After Venice , where his ambition has foundered , and the Dolomites , where the search for Fenella and Sebastian 's conquest of her has taken place , Caryl goes to London . Sebastian follows , continuing his bland usurpation of Caryl 's life . The reasons for these happenings are bona fide . They are found in Sebastian 's genius , in his egotism , his self-sufficiency , which enable him to disregard the minutiae that make up most of Caryl 's life . They also are found in Caryl 's defeatist recognition of Sebastian 's genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Caryl it is nonetheless there . He has its troubled spirit if he has not its fire . Gemma , the little hoyden that Sebastian has picked up and lives with contentedly and illegally , knows it is there before the others do . She provoked it one afternoon in the Dolomites . Gemma knows , too , that Caryl 's solidness is a much-needed compensation to Sebastian 's brilliance . When Sebastian goes off to Paris to conduct the opening of his first ballet , he leaves Gemma in an ecstasy of fear for her sick baby and of anger at Sebastian 's incomplete sympathy . The baby dies . It is Caryl who soothes Gemma , takes care of her , distracts her from bitterness and madness . <P> The Sanger strain in Caryl becomes completely apparent to Sebastian on his return from Paris when Caryl , told by Gemma of Sebastian 's relations with Fenella , kicks him downstairs . Sebastian promptly calls Fenella and runs away with her . But this time Caryl profits . Like most things brilliant , Sebastian 's charms are not particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sebastian and resigned to the loss of Fenella , finds them together , he discovers that all is not harmony between them , that Sebastian is thinking of Gemma , Fenella thinking of Caryl . After that Caryl takes Fenella away . Sebastian will go back to Gemma , who will be waiting for him .
