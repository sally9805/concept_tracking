Peering over sunny Edwards Field at Berkeley , Calif. last week , 15,000 pairs of curious eyes strained to see the University of Southern California 's track team defend its National Collegiate Athletic Association title . They expected Stanford , whom the Trojans had already vanquished in a dual meet and in the Pacific Coast Conference championships , to take second place . They expected to see Johnny Woodruff , long-striding University of Pittsburgh Negro , break the N.C.A.A. record for the half-mile . They expected old Amos Alonzo Stagg , now coaching football at the College of the Pacific , to officiate as head referee at the meet he inaugurated in Chicago 16 years ago . In particular , the 15,000 track fans had come expecting to see Southern California 's Bill Sefton and Earle Meadows tie for an all-time record pole-vault of 15 ft. or over . In only the last instance was the audience disappointed . <P> Earle Elmer Meadows , 24 , and William Healy Sefton , 22 , pole-vaulted separately before they entered U.S.C. in 1933 . Beginning at 10 , Earle practiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Little Rock front yard . Anxious to spur his son 's aerial career , Father Meadows , a cloth manufacturer , offered him a nickel for every inch above 5 ft. that he could make . In 1932 when he was a high-school senior at Fort Worth , Earle cleared 13 ft. to establish a Texas scholastic record , 6 in. less than the national interscholastic record Bill Sefton , son of a California oilman , chalked up while at Los Angeles Polytechnic High School the same year . <P> Once united , Sefton and Meadows learned from each other . The two started vaulting to equal heights , soon were breaking records in partnership . Meadows did 13 ft. 11 in. by the end of freshman year , Sefton an even 14 ft . With almost monotonous regularity they tied for national and intercollegiate titles during the next two years . Meadows took the Olympic title alone last year , but twice this spring the Trojan " twins " have vaulted to identical heights to smash the accepted world 's record of 14 ft. 6 in. held by Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soared 14 ft. 8 in . Three weeks later at the Pacific Coast Conference meet they vaulted 14 ft. 11 in. , quit then simply because the crossbar could not be extended higher . As host for the N.C.A.A. meet last week , the University of California erected new standards 15 ft. 6 in. high . Somewhat psychic , Sefton and Meadows both correctly guessed before the meet that their four-year doubling streak might not last . They explained : " People are looking too hard for it . " As it turned out , Sefton went over at 14 ft. 8 ? in. and Meadows could not get higher than 14 ft. 4 ? in . <P> Sefton and Meadows learned their art from Southern California 's Coach Dean Cromwell , who declares that an expert vaulter 's greatest single asset is a correct psychological outlook . Both run a 99-ft. stretch before the takeoff , grasp the pole at 12 ft. 2 in. for the ascension . At the crest of their flight they are poised almost upside down , flip their bodies over the bar with a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet , depends upon speed along the runway . Sefton is taller ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) and huskier ( 180 lb. ) , counts more upon brute strength .
