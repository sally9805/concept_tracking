txt For Efficient Management Government and Industry Each Found to Have Own Proper Sphere To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In a letter published in THE TIMES recently an interesting proposal is made . Paul Starrett writes : " My experience has been that government work is uselessly expensive and the men put in charge are , with few exceptions , incompetent . I would recommend that the government turn over its farm problem to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company , which I am sure would within a short time put farms on a profitable basis . " The insurance company , it is explained , has taken in hand 7,000 farms which fell to it in foreclosure or default . Through efficient private management , reinforced by an investment of only $7,500,000 , the farms have been turning in to the company and the farmers $12,000,000 a year for the past eight years . The fine performance is contrasted with the meager results of the Farm Resettlement Bureau . Opportunity Still Here In passing , it may be pointed out that this striking record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social service , should convince the world of finance and industry that the possibilities for constructive and profitable service have always existed during the last eight years , in spite of depressions and the handicaps of governmental " politics " and " incompetence . " That is , of course , if the venture was undertaken by a management and directorate equally willing and competent as is that which Mr. Starrett graces . Great as may be the disparity in surface results between government and private management , comparisons between them are futile and the conclusions unavailing . They are two entities with dissimilar capabilities and each arrives at results quite differently . For instance , can we be certain the company would have succeeded as brilliantly had it not been for the indirect help of the government in the form of liberal financial aid to the farmers through " spendthrift " agencies ? In appraising their relative merits and defects we must not forget that it was under private management that these 7,000 farms got into difficulties . And it is true that millions of other farms hurtled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debacle with measures which , believe it or not , consisted of what many call " taking the advice of every crackpot . " Drawing Conclusions A proper conclusion from the record , therefore , might be that on particular jobs an inexperienced and tape-bound government authority is more likely to fail where private initiative might succeed , while in matters of general extent government has the power and can if need be rescue even private initiative when through its errors it is in danger of collapsing . Especially is this true where the virtue of economy would be a deterrent to success . We will go much farther when business and government admit that each has distinct and peculiar capabilities and cease making- a contest out of differences which could be put to complementary benefit . This requires that each keep within its proper sphere . For it may be found on closer study that however promising the plan proposed by Mr. Starrett is as a solution for the government 's farm problem there are many reasons why its adoption is not advisable for the welfare of the Metropolitan Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would promptly invade the company 's fine organization ; the other private agencies might become jealous and vainglorious and set up a clamor that they can do the job better and cheaper ; the farmers might set up a cry of feudalism and fascism if the company failed to respond to political influences . Soon investigations would destroy the good name of the institution . The plan is a good business proposition , but in a democracy governmental affairs can not be a business . ALBERT A. VOLK . New York , Jan. 2 , 1939 . Increased Fare Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I wish to protest against the discontinuance of the one-cent-a-mile railroad fare for Civilian Conservation Corps enrollees who have to travel in interstate traffic . From camp to my home in Philadelphia my fare amounted to $2.45 ; with the regular rate going into effect the fare for me would be $6.13 . My allotment home and quartermaster deposit amounts to $22 , leaving me and many others in the same condition with a balance of $8 a month . Going home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and paying this increased fare leaves me and many others in the 1,500 camps throughout the nation with very little pocket change or funds for emergencies .

M. in today 's TIMES , allow me to point out that he is wrong in saying that the legend on our 1%c postage stamps should be " 114 cent . " The dictionaries define " plural " as more than one ; not , as F. R. M. claims , two or more . As 14 is more than one , the stamps are correct as they stand : " 1% cents . " The government of British India issued a " 1% anna " stamp in 1919 but was forced to admit its error and reissued the stamp as " 1% annas " in 1921 . As to $1.50 : it may be read as " one dollar and a half " or " one and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty cents . " JEROME A. BRUNSWICK . New York , Jan. 3 , 1039 .

" Jan. 14 has been set , aside as ' Lord Baldwin Day , ' when 10 per cent of the receipts of every theatre , film house , music hall , concert and circus in the country will be set aside for the refugees . With the help of collections among the audiences , it is hoped to raise f100,000 in a single day for the Baldwin Fund . " It is my sincere belief that this matter should receive a great deal of publicity in this country to the end that the people of this country set aside Jan. 14 as " German Refugee Day .

Switzerland 's Position Sympathy With the Nazi Regime in Germany Is Doubted To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : For the last fourteen years I have lived in Europe , chiefly in Switzerland , and , I think , am in a position to speak clearly on the question of the supposed sympathy of that country toward Germany . The people who constitute the Swiss Confederation are made up of four linguistic divisions : German , French , Italian and Romansch ; the great difference being that the German spoken in Switzerland , although based on the language spoken in Germany , is in fact quite another tongue , and the Swiss people pride themselves on the difference . The Italian is practically pure and the French is spoken as in France . Romansch is a language typical of the Grisons and is used and understood only there . For instance , a very few miles will mean a complete change in language , and even on the borders of some cantons neighbors may speak and only be partially understood by each other . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the 4,000,000 inhabitants of the country is first , last and all the time Swiss , with complete national unity , and will resist to the bitter end any attempt at invasion from any country by armed force or by political ideas . Unless any one has lived as intimately as I have with the Swiss people , he can not understand their innate love of country and its independence , which springs from customs and traditions born 650 years ago , when every man of legal age voted openly . Today every citizen must vote on Federal questions or pay a fine . Does it seem possible that a government which can unite under the same ideal a people speaking four languages into one of the only really democratic countries left in the world would peacefully accept the Nazi regime ?

That , too , is an unprecedented event and represents the first step toward the appointment of a Papal Nuncio to the Court of St. James . " While the appointment of an Apostolic Delegate in London may be a desirable step and could be followed by the appointment of a Papal Nuncio , " Augur 's " premises and conclusions are not correct . In reply to a question by Colonel Wedgwood , Labor member , Mr. Butler , Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , stated in the House of Commons : " An Apostolic Delegate is an ecclesiastical official appointed to carry out certain ecclesiastical duties ; he enjoys no diplomatic status or privileges . " Furthermore Mgr . Richard L. Smith , vice rector of the English College at Rome , has written to the English press : " It is not a nunciature , nor an internunciature : neither is it a step toward diplomatic status , not to be compared in any way with the position of a charg ? d'affaires .

JAN DROHOJOWSKL New York , Dec. 31 , 1938 . Handling Spanish News To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW - YORK TIMES : It seems a hopeful omen of the new year when THE TIMES has the necessary intestinal fortitude to enable its readers to find the Loyalist and Rebel Spanish news both on the front page . I understand that you receive heavy mail objecting to putting either side of the Spanish question on the front page while you relegate the opposite side to Page 16 . I hope my letter will be one of a large number approving your step in placing both sides of such an important issue where they rightly belong  --  on the front page . CATHERINE LAW CoLWELL .
