THE TROJAN HORSE-Christopher Morley-Lippiucott ( $2.50 ) . <P> BARTLETT 'S FAMILIAR QUOTATIONS - Edited by Christopher Morley &; Louella D. Everett-Little , Brown ( $5 ) . <P> Christopher Morley 's first 41 books have been notable for affable after-dinner humor , a slightly ponderous display of undergraduate learning , a unique brand of lecture-platform whimsy . His 42nd , The Trojan Horse , is a scrambled modernization of the tale of Troy , complete with radio broadcasts , scenes in night clubs , pacifist demonstrations . In it Troilus is cast as a kind of star quarterback ; the siege is a cross between a football game and a marathon dance ; Cressida is a modern young woman whose wisecracks seem not quite so up-to-date ; Pandarus is a Wall Street sophisticate ; the Horse is a symbol whose exact significance can not be determined from the text . <P> But if The Trojan Horse seemed likely to bewilder more readers than it pleased , another Christopher Morley revision of a classic . Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations , gave free play to his quotation-loving mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , valuable for reference . The first Bartlett 's was published in 1855 , when Josiah Bartlett , then a Cambridge , Mass , bookseller , brought out his personal collection of apt phrases to show " the obligations our language owes to various authors for ... familiar quotations which have become ' household words . ' " By 1891 Bartlett had published nine revisions ; the tenth appeared in 1914 . Despite its encyclopedic scope , Bartlett 's left out Hawthorne , Melville , Emily Dickinson , William Blake , included many forgotten patriots of the Revolutionary War , many forgotten minor poets . Cutting down these , reducing the quotations from Byron and Wordsworth , Editors Morley and Everett have brought in moderns from Archibald MacLeish to William Butler Yeats . Shakespeare still leads with 77 of the 1,126 pages of quotations , the Bible is second with 32 pages . <P> If the quotations from moderns seem less striking than those from the past , it may be because there are so many moderns in the Morley revision . Editor Morley included George Ade ( " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Seventies " ) , many newspaper rhymesters , Eliot , Lenin , Pound . Marx ( " The only part of the so-called national wealth that actually enters into the collective possessions of modern peoples is their national debt " ) . Generous to his colleagues on The Saturday Review of Literature , he gives two pages to William Rose Benet , almost three pages to Stephen Vincent Benet , a half-page each to Editor Bernard De Voto and ex-Editor Henry Seidel Canby , a page to himself . The Morley Bartlett includes enough contemporary wisecracks. ephemeral fragments of minor living poets , to make other future revisions seem likely , but it shows that a few moderns ( Thomas Mann , Bernard Shaw , Henry Adams ) are as quotable as the giants of the past .
