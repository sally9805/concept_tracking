A gambler 's quarrel , hot words , a slap in the face and five revolver shots took Reno ( whose Mayor boasts that in his town " everybody can do what they please " ) another step further back into the tradition of the Old West last week . Into the Haymarket Club , a recently licensed palace of chance on Douglas Alley , strode one W. H. McCracken , a gambling dealer . Night before , McCracken had wrangled with William Graham , one of the " Big Four " of Nevada 's gaming fraternity , over money matters . Graham had finally knocked McCracken down . <P> The lookout at the Haymarket Club told Graham that his enemy was approaching . When McCracken passed the door he started firing . One bullet hit the bar , another went through Graham 's sleeve . Then the gun jammed . Graham fired three times , killed McCracken instantly . True to the canons of Wild Bill Hickok and Kit Carson , next day a coroner 's jury exonerated the surviving duelist as having killed in self-defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight with William Harrison ( " Jack " ) Dempsey , who is in Reno for the sport and to get a divorce from his wife , Estelle Taylor .
