Badger , following the sale of $1,000 worth of Cotter Butte Mines stock to Abe April , friend of Badger , Ewald faces a charge of falsely attesting to a public record , it was learned . District Attorney Crain has received data purporting to show that Ewald , as a magistrate , affixed his signature to records showing Badger was friir and acquitted before him on a third-offense speeding charge , when as a matter of fact he was never tried .

This , it was learned from another source , consisted in part of the rogues ' Gallery photographs of a politician , now prominent in German-American circles , who served a term for bribery in 1914 , and who is credited in political circles with having been influential in getting the appointment of Magistrate Ewald to the bench . Requests for favors believed to be from this politician to Ewald are in the possession of Mr. Crain . Magistrate Ewald 's troubles began a week ago Monday , when he was indicted with five others for use of the mails to defraud in connection with the Cotter Butte Mines , Inc. , of which he was a director until last Fall .

Addressed to Mayor Walker from the magistrate 's home at 359 Fort Washington Avenue , it read : " I hereby tender my resignation as city magistrate . My reason for doing so is because I feel satisfied that my usefulness on the bench has been seriously impaired by the false tnd misleading statements which have recently been made about me . " My continuance in office might prove an own personal interest . " I wish to assure you as well as my numerous friends who have confidence in me that I have been guilty of no wrongdoing , either officially or in my private capacity . The charges that have been made against me are false and I am confident that at the proper time I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years upon the bench and up to the present no suggestion has been made in any way reflecting upon my integrity nor upon the conduct of my judicial office . I regret the necessity for taking this step and only do so through my high regard for the magistrates ' courts and the judges who have been associated with me since I have been on the bench . " The resignation was read to Mayor Walker over the telephone when he called in from Montauk , where he was still fishing yesterday noon . By quitting the bench Ewald joined the ranks composed of former Magistrate . Albert H. Vitale , removed by the Appellate Division ; Kings County Judge W. Bernard Vause , who resigned after being indicted in the Federal courts , and General Sessions Judge Francis X. Mancuso , who resigned after being indicted in the City Trust Company crash , all of whom have quit the bench in the past year .

The Mayor 's answer was short and to the point . " Accepted . I 'll see you tomorrow , " was all he said to Mr. . It was generally be-k lieved that a short message of acceptance of the resignation would go forth from the Mayor 's office today , . although some said no acceptance in . writing was necessary . Chief Magistrate Corrigan appeared to be relieved at the resignation when informed of it shortly after noon . He said that he would not , and ' could not if he wished , take any further action in the case . He communicated late in the afternoon with Justiec Edward R. Finch of the Appellate Division to have him call off the conference scheduled for this morning to consider ouster proceedings against Ewald . Ewald was relieved of active duty at his own ' request last Tuesday , the day following his indictment , and on Friday his lawyer , Alfred J. Talley , was told by Mr. Corrigan that the magistrate 's resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The preparation of the charges against Ewald for the county grand jury , begun yesterday by Assistant District Attorney Harold Hastings , besides the falsification charge , will Involve another charge in the Badger case . It will be attempted to be proved that since Magistrate Ewald received a $250 commission on the stock he sold to Abe April , that the sale constituted the receiving of a gratuity , in exchange for the dismissal of the case against Badger . The falsification charge is one that is regarded as much easier to prove , it was said yesterday . The testimony of Patrolman Edward J. Heffernan constitutes almost a prima facie case , it was said . Investigation into the Cotter Butte Company and the Norwood Mining Company , in which Ewald has been reported also to have been interested , continued yesterday before the July Federal grand jury . The principal witness was Peter Eckert , Ewald 's father-in-law , who testified , it is believed , in connection with stock he bought in the mining companies . Other witnesses are scheduled for today in the Norwood case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Magistrate Francis X. , questioned by Norman Thomas , the Socialist leader , said yesterday that nothing is likely to be decided before the end of the week in the case . Thomas asked the removal of from the bencir'on the ground that he was violating the law by holding a position as treasurer of the National Exhibition Company , which owns the New York Giants , while he was at the same time a city magistrate . Mr. Minton , head of thb Bar Association committee conducting the inquiry , explained that the question as to whether Mr. was still treasurer of the baseball club was still on appeal in the courts , and that no definite action by his committee was likely until that point had been settled . Heffernan , on whose testimony Ewald faces both disbarment and grand jury actions , arrested Badger on Central Park West Oct. 31 , 1928 , Badger 's third arrest for speeding in six months . He was fined on the first arrest , and sentence was suspended the second time . Heffernan told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first set for Nov. 5 , and that on that day an adjournment was granted until Nov. 9 . On ? Nov. 9 Heffernan waited in court for the case to be called . It was called , but Badger was not in the court room ' to respond . Heffernan started for the warrant officer 's desk , to have a warrant sworn out , when he saw April and Badger outside the court room . They persuaded him not to see the warrant officer until they had had a chance to see Magistrate Ewald , he testified . All three went to Ewald 's chambers and Heffernan was told to wait outside . He did for ten minutes or so and then was told by a court attendant to come in . According to Heffernan 's statement , Ewald asked him if he was sure he had given the ticket to the right man . After an affirmative answer he was asked if his speedometer was right , and if he was sure of it . He answered again in the affirmative and then was directed by Magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour later by a court attendant that his appearance no longer was necessary , that the case had been dismissed . The indictment in the Federal courts charged directly that a sale of $1,000 of Cotter Butte stock to April took place in the magistrate 's chambers while Heffernan was waiting outside . April , in his statement to the grand jury , it was learned yesterday , ad- I mitted his presence in the chambers that morning , but said he was there because he had heard Magistrate Ewald had some good inside information on a certain stock and that being interested in stocks he made a personal call , intending to buy 5,000 shares if the magistrate gave him his word that the stock was promising . Ewald told him it was , April is understood to have said , but in the meantime he had decided to buy only 1,000 shares at $1 per share . Leaving the chambers he met Badger outside , he declared , and was asked by Badger to intercede for an adjournment . Badger 's statement was said yesterday to have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreement Magistrate Ewald had with the Cotter Butte Company he received a 25 per cent commission on all the stock he sold , the Federal indictments charged . Thus , on the Badger sale , he would have received $250 commission . A similar amount would have gone into the company 's treasury . the indictments declared .
