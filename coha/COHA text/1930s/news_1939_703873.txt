txt President Roosevelt has now rounded out his folk Supreme Court appointments by sending to the Senate the ' nompation of an outstanding expect m corporation law , William 0 . Douglas , Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission . And so his list lines tip as follows taking them backward : William 0 . Douglas , nationally-recognized authority on corporate structure , business and financial law . Felix Frankfurter , eminent legal scholar . Stanley F. Reed , the New Deal 's ablest legal advocate . Hugo L. Bigck , zealous reformer and " radical " re-interpreter of the law . The appointments make an evi ? dent pattern , displaying unusual diversity and a consideraple geographical and ideological spread as well , from Massachusetts to Washington State , with Alabama and Kentucky on the way . The latest appointee , though a ruthless student of corporation set-ups , is not rated as a " radical . " Indeed , recent and probably unjustified New Deal criticism was that he is too conservative . " " Bill " Douglas , whose nomination had long been expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lived the first 22 years of his life in the West , mostly in the Pacific Northwest . But his adult years have been spent on the Atlantic seaboard ; in Columbia University Law School ; in a New York law firm ; as teacher of law at Columbia and Yale , and since 1936 as Chairman of the SEC . The appointment was probably influenced by geography , and the fact that there was no member of the Court born or resident west of the Mississippi . But an even more potent and less-noticed reason was Mr. Douglas 's expertness in knowledge of the modern corporation . He is now guiding the investigation of the Monopoly Committee as well as the affairs of the SEC , and in his background is keen , first-hand acqhaintance with the vast structures which loom over American economic life . Doesn'tAike Bigness By more than coincidence , Mr. Douglas is just as much , a critic of " the curse of bigness " as was the retired Mr. Justice Brandeis , whose place he takes . in the recent life insurance investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigness were given free play . In an interview , he explained how much better he considered it would be if the $5,000,000,000 Metropolitan Life Insurance Company were actually ten $500,000,000 companies scattered geographically throughout the country , diversifying their investment and advantages . Mr. Douglas 's expertness in the field of corporation law rounds out the Supreme Court . Mr. Justice Frankfurter , President Roosevelt 's most recent appointee , brought to the high tribunal an unrivalled authority in academic Jaw . ' Mr. Justice Reed was the New Deal 's most accomplished legal advocate . Mr. Justice Black , the first Roosevelt appointee , brought social conscience and fervor  --  from the Administration viewpoint , at . least  --  to the tribunal . And now Mr. Douglas brings skill in unravelling the affairs of the vast economic and financial combinations which dominate modern life . Ncw Court Follows Pattern The geographical reason for the Douglas appointment has been much emphasized . Mr. Justice Butler , who lives just east of the Mississippi at St. Paul , Minn. , is the farthest-west justice now on the bench . Recently retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not by birth . Including those two , only four justices from the Far West have ever sat on the High Tribunal . The others were Mr. Justices Field and . Mr. Douglas is one of the youngest men ever named to the High Tribunal . He is only 40 years of age , having been born In Maine , Minn. , on Oct. 16 , 1898 , the son of a Presbyterian home missionary . At the age of five he was taken to the State of Washington , which comes nearest to being his native state . He graduated from school and college there , taught school for two years at Yakima in the sun-baked Inland Empire , and then came east to make his career . Thorough New Dealer He is a thorough-going New Dealer , but his administration of the SEC has been generally praised , and the Monopoly Committee has not been a witch-hunt . Mr. Douglas looks and talks like a Westerner  --  breezy , informal , slangy , His rumpled tow hair is hard to control , his eyes have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds . His eyes are steel-blue , and he is what might be called is hard-boiled idealist . If You talk with him in his office he is likely to pull out the desk slide and hook his legs over it . He has two children , and his wife was photographed last week helping the Washington , D. C. hotel strikers . He lives modestly in Washington . Mr. Douglas has been publishing authoritative books on business organization since 1931 , and making special business studies for Yale University and the Government since long before the New Deal . In ' view of Mr. Douglas 's Western background and his reputation for fairness in the SEC , there does not seem to be any real doubt about his confirmation in the Senate . And if confirmed , he will become the second-youngest man over to don the robes of the Supreme Court . In 1811 , President James Madison nominated the great Justice Storey of Massachusetts , who was 32 years old at the time . The appointment was derided at the time , but " Joe " Story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed on the bench for 34 years . Mr. Douglas has many years of service ahead of him .
