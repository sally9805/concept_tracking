txt IT ARE N'T BRITISH . Mr. Hamilton Corrects a Statement Concerning English Usage . To the Editor of The New York Times : According to the report of Max J. Herzberg 's statements to the National Council of Teachers of English at Milwaukee yesterday , the Superintendent of English in the Newark public schools appears to have been enjoying his holiday very much indeed . Undoubtedly he gave the English teachers of Milwaukee " something to take away . " But his determination to make vagary rhyme with Mary is indeed a wild or fanciful freak , a whim , a wandering of the thoughts . As to the word " ai n't , " which Merrill Bishop did not feel able wholly to condemn , he has , it is clear , a certain fondness for the affectatious which has endured since the picturesque period of " Trelawney of the Wells . " So have I. But when he said that " are n't it " is perfectly good British English he made a slight mistake . It is never used in England , although " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Instead of " are n't It , " " ai n't it " goes with illiteracy or affectation . " Is n't it " is right . COSMO HAMILTON . New York , Nov. 28 , 1931 . Productive Spending . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES recently published a letter from James W. Gerard regarding the duty of spending money rather than hoarding in such a time as this . I think every one must agree with this general thesis , but can not some of our economists give us some practical advice as to the kind of spending that would do most to revive industry ? If $100,000 is spent in a building operation , approximately 90 per cent goes into wages , whereas when the same amount is spent in the purchase of a rare jewel perhaps less than 1 per cent goes into wages .

H. New York , Nov. 28 , 1931 . Reich 's Constitutional Flag . To the Editor of The New York TIMM ' Tull ; Timm dispatch from Madrid mentions that the Cortes voted an article of the Constitution providing that the national flag should be of red , yellow and purple horizontal stripes . This , the dispatch states , is believed to be the first time a flag ever has been mentioned in any Constitution . May I point out that the Constitution of the German Reich provides ( Article 3 ) that the national colors are black , red and gold ? It is also provided that the commercial flag is black , white and red , with the national colors in the upper inner corner . M. K. W. New York , Nov. 28 , 1431 . Suggesting a Retort .
