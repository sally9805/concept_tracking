txt Development of a powerful financial machine based on revolutionary changes in the Federal Reserve System and designed to stimulate credit through a possible increase of $2,500,000,000 in the currency was decided upon at a non-partisan conference of Democratic and Republican leaders called at the White House today by President Hoover . Bills will be introduced in Congress tomorrow to drastically liberalize the rediscount authority of the Reserve Banks to make eligible billions of dollars in paper not eligible under present regulations , and for the effective use in the creation of credit of hundreds of millions of dollars of " free gold " of the Reserve System . The bills will be introduced by Senator I Glass , Democrat , of Virginia , and Chairman Steagall , Democratic chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee . An administration leader said tonight that the results of the conference at the White House had shown a constructive cooperation of leaders in Congress with the government in its effort to meet the emergency situation . He declared that the bill was sound , constructive and in no way tending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth the way out of the crisis . Leaders predicted that the legislation , including a section of the new banking bill for permanent revision of the Reserve System introduced by Senator Glass , would have speedy consideration on both sides of the Capitol . Every argument will be made that it is designed to relieve an emergency situation . This pressure was expected to have a potent influence on all factions . With Senator Glass back of the bill little opposition was anticipated in the Senate . Purpose of the Bill Set Forth . A statement issued by the Congressional representatives read : " A bill will be introduced in the Senate by Senator Glass and Representative Steagall in the House of Representatives which will improve the facilities of the Federal Reserve System for the benefit of commerce , industry and agriculture , and provide means for meeting the needs of member banks in exceptional circumstances . " The bill will include three proposals , the : ' first two of which will improve the facilities of access of the member banks to the Reserve banks , by providing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member banks that have no further eligible or acceptable paper , upon the security of sound securities , not technically , eligible for discount . " Member banks may obtain these advances under proper safeguards , either upon the endorsement of other member banks or , in unusual cases , without such endorsement . " This provision will prove valuable in cases where , by means of diminished business or other causes , the bank does not have an adequate supply of paper technically eligible for discount , though having Other sound and adequate security . " Moreover , many banks which have no immediate need for the use of these provisions would feel increased confidence in meeting their customers ' needs freely by reason of the knowledge of the existence of these facilities . " The third provision is for the purpose of giving greater effectiveness to the gold reserve of the Federal Reserve System by releasing for use large amounts of gold which ' might temporarily be tied up as collateral for Federal Reserve notes in excess of the 40 per cent required by law . " The Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note issues . Owing to the present unusual circumstances the amount actually held is now far in excess of 40 per cent . " The proposed amendment would , when the Federal Reserve Board deems it desirable in the public interest , have the effect of making all of the assets acquired by the Reserve banks under the present provisions of law available for not to exceed one year as collateral for Federal Reserve notes in addition to the 40 per cent gold reserve , thus making the excess gold serviceable . " This provision will have the effect of giving greater flexibility to Federal Reserve operations . It will make the system 's large supply of gold more useful as a basis of credit . It will at once increase the system 's free gold by nearly $1,000 , - 000,000 . " This proposed legislation is not intended to displace the bill now before the Banking and Currency Committee for permanent modifications of the banking law . " CARTER GLASS , " HENRY B. STEAGALL , " F. C. WALCOTT , " JAMES F. STRONG . " Glass Called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued , Eugene Meyer , governor of the Federal Reserve Board , conferred with the Senator , who later was closeted with Senator Walcott , Representatives Steagall and Strong , Dr. W. R. Burgess , deputy governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , who has been making a special study of the original Glass bill , Dr. E. A. Goldenweiser , chief statistician of the Federal Reserve Board , and Chester Morrill , secretary of the board . The way was cleared for the new bill when President Hoover called Senator Glass to the White House for a breakfast conference , with Senators Watson and Robinson , the two party floor leaders , and Senators Bulkley , Walcott and Townsend of the Senate Banking and Currency Sub-Committee , which drew up the original Glass bill . In addition , Governor Meyer , Charles G. Dawes , president of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , and Ogden L. Mills , whose nomination as Secretary of the Treasury was confirmed by the Senate today , were present . The conference lasted for an hour , and was followed by another which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Representative Snell , the Republican floor leader ; Chairman Steagall , and Representatives Strong of Kansas , Luce of Massachusetts and Beady of Maine , all members of the House Banking and prrrency Committee . Aim to Release More Credit . The two important features of the proposed legislation are those making possible the rediscounting of a wide range of paper and the use of this paper as collateral for the issuance of Federal Reserve notes . This , in theory would release a large amount of gold held temporarily by the Reserve banks and agents against note issues , and thereby create more liberal credit . While a large amount of credit is available at the present time , lack of confidence has caused the member banks , in their effort to maintain a position of extreme liquidity of assets to hesitate to make loans , for instance on real estate , which would tie up funds for several years . The theory held . by the bankers of the legislation is that with credit available to the member banks at the Reserve banks through a more liberal rediscounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their customers . The result , in theory , would be a resumption of many activities , such as home building , smaller industrial and other developments , which would form the basis for a return of normal business activity . The possibility exists that many of the banks would not be in need of greater extension of credits than they enjoy at the present time from the Reserve banks , but the mere knowledge that the credit is there if needed would restore their confidence and form en important factor in the general reconstruction move . Vandenberg Sees Wide Advantages . Senator Vandenberg of Michigan , who has been endeavoring to obtain legislation along the lines proposed , declared that it would decentralize credit relief " into every section of every State in the Union to a degree not possible under any legislation previously passed . " He asserted that it will completely supplement the Reconstruction Finance Corporation at its greatest point of weakness by extending the benefits of the corporation across the country and into the back country . Senator Vandenberg continued : " It will place a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is little short of complete . " It will for the first time permit the maximum use of the national stock of gold as a basis for currency issue , because under it for the first time provision will exist for creation of Federal Reserve currency circulation to the maximum permitted by the gold in hand . " President Hoover stated last week that the gold coverage of Federal Reserve currency is now between 75 and 80 per cent of the total outstanding , whereas only 40 per cent of gold coverage is required by law . The reason for the present excessive gold coverage is the shortage of securities eligible to rediscount and thus available as a basis of currency issue . " In Plain Terms , More Money . " " This bill means , in plain terms , more money . It will open the way to recapture of the normal money supply , so that we will no longer be completely at the mercy of the hoarder . " Its effect will be to bring the price of the dollar down and bring the commodity price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a renewal of buying , more demand for commodities and less unemployment . " This is no panacea for all our ills and it is no nostrum . It must not be expected to work overnight , but I am convinced that , with this bill passed into law , we will for the first time be in position to utilize the central reservoir of credit and currency . created for use in just such an emergency as this , but which has been scrupulously ignored in all of our reconstruction plans heretofore . The Federal Reserve System up to this time has been the greatest of all our frozen assets . " The present Federal Reserve regulations are strict in relation to the eligibility and acceptability of member bank paper for rediscount. since the framers of the original act sought for an extremely liquid position of the Reserve Banks at all times . With that In mind it was provided that ninety-day paper , such as notes , drafts and bills of exchange , arising out of actual commercial transactions , which are drawn or issued for agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount . Paper secured by United States bonds , certificates and notes are eligible , provided its maturity is not beyond ninety days%t the time it is offered for rediscount . An exception to the ninety-day rule is made in the case of agricultural and live stock paper , which may have a maturity of nine months on the theory that agricultural transactions extend over a longer period than eommerclal transactions . Notes , drafts or bills of exchange , the proceeds of which have been used for permanent or fixed investments of any kind or for investments of a purely speculative character , are not eligible under the present law . With certain exceptions , notes , drafts and bills of exchange , the proceeeds of hick have been or are to be loaned to other borrowers , are ineligible . Federal Reserve Banks have the authority to reject eligible paper when it appears to be an uncertain credit risk . Apparently these restrictions , with the exception of authority to reject eligible paper where it does not have any intrinsic value , would be largely removed by the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The belief prevails that the member banks of the country have tremendous investments in securities and mortgages which can not be used as collateral for Federal Reserve Bank borrowing . Some experts insist that the member banks , to a great extent , have exhausted their eligible paper , and are , therefore , powerless to obtain further credit at the Reserve banks . It is for this reason that they have been calling loans and declining further extensions of credit to the detriment of business generally . This is a big factor contributing to the deflation and liquidation that has been the feature of the financial situation since 1929 , and more especially since the financial crisis of September and October , 1931 . " The character of the paper to be accepted is entirely within the discretion of the board of directors of the Reserve banks , " Senator Walcott declared . " The purpose of broadening the base is to give the banks additional borrowing power , which in time will give them a better chance to serve the business of the country and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies of cash , from lack of which they have been suffering " It is hoped that the bill will restore confidence and prevent further hoarding by drawing back into circulation the hoarded currency , now estimated at $1,500,000,000 . It will restore confidence by putting cash back into the banks . " Sees Big Increase in Currency . Senator Walcott admitted that the increase in the currency resultant from the measure could reach $2,1200 , - 000,000 . He said , however , that he did not expect anything like that amount to bp issued . On the %contrary , he thought that hoarded currency would be brdtight out of hiding , thus obviating the necessity for a huge increase in the currency . Senator Walcott referred to the ability of the Federal Reserve Banks to issue a larger volume of Federal Reserve notes . The outstanding note issues amount to $2,664,003,000 in actual circulation , as of Feb. 3 , which is an increase of more than $1,000 , - 000,000 in a year , as the Reserve System has provided additional money to counteract the hoarding tendency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets " of the Reserve Banks could be used as collateral for Federal Reserve notes . it was learned that the language of the new bill relates specifically to government bonds . The bill will add to the section of the Federal Reserve law defining the present acceptable collateral these words : " Provided , however , that if the Federal Reserve Board deems the public interest requires , it may designate and authorize a Federal Reserve . Bank to offer and a Federal agent to accept obligations of the United States . " Assets of the Federal eserve Banks include " good lawful money , " commercial paper of specified maturity , government securities , bankers ' acceptances and bills discounted or bought . Representative Strong , Republican , of Kansas , said that " we have a very large overcoverage of gold . " The bill , he pointed out , will increase the amount of free gold by nearly $1,000,000,000 . " I expect the bill will go through the House rapidly , " he continued . " It will furnish the basis for more currency if needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflation . It just means the loosening of credit . It broadens the loaning privileges of the Federal Reserve Banks . " We have provided that foreign securities will not be purchasable . We felt that we should not allow more latitude in that direction than we permitted the Reconstruction Finance Corporation . " Generally speaking the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that the Federal Reserve agent must hold collateral to the full amount of the outstanding Federal Reserve notes . The Federal Reserve act provides that the Federal Reserve Bank maintain a gold reserve equal to 4.0 per cent of the amount of its Feder Reserve notes in circulation , but allows the gold reserve or any part of it to be used as collateral with the Federal Reserve agent . Therefore , if the agent holds 40 per cent of gold , and 60 per cent eligible paper , the bank is not required to hold any gold as an additional reserve against the notes . Bank Required to Make Up Amount . If , however , the agent holds less than 40 per cent of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold to make up the 40 p'er cent , notwithstanding the fact that it may have more than 60 per cent of paper lodged with the agent as collateral . The agent is required to deposit with the Treasurer of the United States as a redemption fund 5 per cent of the gold held by him as collateral for Federal Reserve notes , and the bank is required to deposit an additional amount sufficient to make the redemption fund in the hands of the Treasurer equal to 5 per cent of the total amount of outstanding Federal Reserve notes . At the present time the Federal Reserve ratio is practically 67 per cent . Potentially the excess gold above the 40 per cent reserve requirement could be replaced with the same amount of eligible paper , thus releasing the gold , according to framers of the bill , for the creation of additional credit . A dollar gold generally is understood to represent about $10 in possible credit . The excess over the reserve requirement is known as " free gold , " although there was considerable difference of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " free gold . " The principal accomplishment in the release of the free gold for credit purposes would be a re-establishment of confidence , apparently , on the theory that credit should expand if easily available . Framers of the legislation emphasized , however , that no inflation is contemplated , since the credit expansion will be kept under control with proper safeguards . Requirements for Note Issue . Experts today explained the method of issuing Federal Reserve notes . At present , if a Federal Reserve Bank desires to issue $1,000 worth of notes , it tenders $1,000 worth of eligible commercial paper to the Federal Reserve agent and also deposits a reserve of $400 in gold behind the issue ; or , if it has no commercial paper , it can secure the $1,000 in notes with an equal amount of gold . Although in the first instance there is 40 per cent of gold reserve behind the note issue , the Federal Reserve Banks ordinarily have gold in their vaults in excess of that requirement , and this excess is termed " free gold . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 000,000 in gold , which is sometimes called " free gold , " but which has been earmarked and belongs to foreign nations , chiefly to France . One of the Senators participating in today 's conference said that the $600 , - 000,000 had been taken into account in stating that the Federal Reserve System 's " free gold " will he increased at once by nearly $1,000,000 , - 000 under the new bill . Senator Walcott said the " free gold would be there to be used if necessary . " " It is just what we call it , ' serviceable gold , ' " he added . " You mean that it is ' psychological gold ' ? " it was suggested . , " Yes , " he agreed . I One Senator contended that eligible I paper , under present regulations , had not yet been exhausted . He held that all eligible paper should be taken up by the Reserve Banks before the pro- I posed new provisions are applied . More Loan Agencies Named . The establishment ? of five more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for handling applications was announced by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation . The reported appointment of Joseph E. Chapman as manager of the Minneapolis agency was confirmed . The managers for other agencies announced were J. E. Olsen for Denver ; L. H. Earhart , Omaha ; C. E. Daniel , Oklahoma City , and Charles F. Fisher , Detroit . The managers will fill out the committees by appointing two or four other members to receive applications and recommend approval or rejection . There appeared little probability , meanwhile , of the adoption of a suggestion that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation publicly offer large amounts of its governmentguaranteed debentures in small denominations to ' attract hoarded money back into circulation . Officials were of the opinion , generally , that while the proposal possessed merit the disadvantages of a public subscription offset the good . The opinion was expressed , however , that while investors might withdraw deposits from local banks to purchase the debentures , this tendency could be checked by making the interest rate normal , or at least lower than that for deposits . Point to Treasury 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any public offering might entail a widespread campaign with considerable expense . Moreover , it was contended that the method would be slower and that public issues by the corporation , which probably would be purchased by banks , might conflict with the enormous program of refinancing which confronts the treasury in the next year or so . Many of the financial institutions to which the corporation is authorized to make loans are those Limier the supervision of the Federal Farm Board . A statement of condition for such institutions today put their outstanding net loans on Dec. 31 at $1.817.637,000 . Assets were $2,046 , - 932,000 . Outstanding loans of the Federal Land Banks were $1.167,898.000. with assets of $1,282,880.000 ; Joint Stock Land Bank loans were $531,804,000 , with assets of $606,192,000 , and Intermediate Credit Bank loans and discounts were $117,935,000 , with assets of $157,860,000 . The three groups of banks made loans of $307,423,000 during 1931 , an increase of $35,241,000 over the year before . Among the assets of the Federal Land Banks in addition to the loans were $13,348.000 in United States securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $18,580,000 , of which $8,377,000 had been delinquent ninety days or more . Real estate owned outright amounted to $29,245,000 . The Joint Stock Land Banks had in assets $14,089,000 in notes receivable . Delinquent payments amounted to $8,327,300 , including $4,855,000 delinquent ninety days or more . These banks owned outright real estate valued at $28,290,000 . Sheriffs ' certificates and judgments totaled $10,924 , - 000 . Loans and discounts by Federal Intermediate Credit Banks to cooperative associations amounted to $43 , - 521,900 , and to financing institutions $74,613,000.
