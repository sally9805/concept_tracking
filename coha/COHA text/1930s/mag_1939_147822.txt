A little jaded last week were U. S. businessmen . The thrill of seeing industrial production run ahead of corresponding months in 1929 wore off . There were some who found many an indication to justify a little pessimism , if they felt like it . Items : <P> &gt; Department of Commerce 's October report from nearly 3,000 wholesalers showed a 6.5% drop in volume of sales , a 6.3% drop in dollar value from September . Meanwhile , inventories ( from 1,729 firms ) were up 3% ( in cost value ) from September , 6% from October 1938 . <P> &gt; October food chain sales lost their September oomph . The Department of Commerce 's index ( unadjusted ) which usually rises seasonally , fell from 107.2 to 106.9 . <P> &gt; Exports , counted on since September to absorb overproduction , still got nowhere . Brightest spot was Latin America : October takings were up 14% from September , 18% from October 1938 . But cash buying is a luxury for Latin America necessitated by War II 's cutting down its barter trading with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten into their New York bank balances , were wondering whether Washington intended to do some export pump priming . <P> &gt; Steel , No. 1 U. S. industry ( which weights no less than 18% on the Federal Reserve Board 's Index of Production ) , has been running at 93.9% of capacity , well ahead of consumption , but the temperamentally optimistic Iron Age reported that orders for early 1940 production would account for only 65-80% of capacity . A decline to this level in the steel rate will be enough to drag the production index down from its current 120-plus to something closer to 103 , the level the boom started from . <P> &gt; At the outbreak of War II , steel manufacturers , inadequately stocked for capacity runs , fearing that war exports would cause a famine of steel scrap , cleared out the junk yards , sent the price of scrap skyrocketing to $22.50 a ton , but capacity production yields a good deal of new scrap , and the mills have already bought sizable supplies . By last week , scrap had not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking it up for as little as $19 . <P> &gt; The National Lumber Manufacturers Association reported that new business was 23% below lumber production ( another weighty item in the production index ) . <P> &gt; In spite of the temporary coal boom which war produced , anthracite ran into one of its characteristic price wars , and bituminous coal production , down 6% from the 10,450,000-ton peak hit week ended Oct. 26 , was apparently headed back down to a 9,000,000-ton weekly rate . <P> &gt; Oil , not yet seeing any war business ahead , looking back on a very sour year , slipped towards another inventory crisis . ( Last one : August-September 1939 . ) In spite of Texas ' restricting crude production to only four days a week , gasoline inventories rose another 425,000 barrels to 73,696,000-approximately 4,000,000 barrels above the same week in 1938 . <P> &gt; Last week , the Department of Labor 's all-commodity index , whose war-boom peak had been 79.5 , slid to 79.1 . The New York Journal of Commerce 's more sensitive index ( autumn peak : 82.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of big dividends , stocks first stagnated , then slumped to 148.47 on the Dow-Jones average .
