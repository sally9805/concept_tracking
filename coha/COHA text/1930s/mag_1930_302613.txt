Concerts certain to cause as much comment as any this season will be given during the next fortnight in Manhattan and Philadelphia . Arturo Toscanini will leave his Philharmonic-Symphony , go to Philadelphia to conduct Leopold Stokowski 's Orchestra . Stokowski will go to Manhattan to conduct the Philharmonic . Changing boats in the middle of the stream is a unique venture for conductors , a challenge to audiences to compare their talents . <P> Last week Stokowski anticipated the inevitable comparison with a press statement which lavishly extolled the genius of Toscanini in terms applicable to any great conductor , perhaps even to Stokowski himself . Excerpt : " The melodic line he molds just as a sculptor molds in soft clay the forms appearing under his fingers . . . . His originality of conception comes from his expressing the essence and soul of the score instead of merely the literal notes . ... It is the divine fire in him which elevates all he expresses through tone , so that one knows that at that moment music is being created which through its vitality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vision of the beauty and power of which this life is capable , when that vision is brought to us by such a master . " <P> Toscanini characteristically made no reply . In the six years he has conducted the Philharmonic , Toscanini has never given an interview , never explained his musical methods or described his diet . " I speak , " he tells his friends , " a universal language . If the public can not understand . . . " and he will shrug his shoulders . But his attitude is known to be one of humility . He regards himself as the servant of the composer , holds every note important . <P> Contrastingly , Stokowski delivers himself more and more of public utterances . At a recent luncheon in Philadelphia he said : " Peace can only come through the individual evolution of man . " At the Poor Richard Club ( Philadelphia ) , where he was presented with a silver spoon and porringer for his infant daughter , Andrea Sadja , he said : " Symphonic music is only a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to anything man ever has had for exchange of thought , of imagination , of beauty ; for developing everything that makes life a wonderful thing . Perhaps never before has there been such a medium . For the development of civilization , nothing is so important . "
