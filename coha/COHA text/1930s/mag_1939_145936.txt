Attracted by the oozing sap , a winged bark louse flitted greedily around the tree . Alighting on the sticky stuff , he was soon stuck fast . A watchful spider darted toward the struggling louse , had almost reached him when the flow of sap engulfed both him and his quarry . <P> This little drama occurred during the Oligocene Period , some 30,000,000 years ago , in the Baltic region . Last week the shells of the spider ( Oonopidae ) and the bark louse ( Psocidae ) , beautifully preserved in the amber , were put on display at Manhattan 's Museum of Natural History .
