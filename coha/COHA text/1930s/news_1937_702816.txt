txt For the first time since it became an annual institution , the National Socialist congress was distinguished today by the presence of virtually the entire diplomatic corps represented in Berlin . There are only four , absentees ? the Papal Nuncio. and the Russians , for obvious reasons ; the Norwegians , who are said to be aggrieved by the German boycott of the Nobel Prizes , and the Peruvians , who still cherish a grievance over a football incident at the last Olympics . All the rest are here . On a special train that arrived early this morning came our own Prentiss Gilbert ; Charge d'Affaires in Ambassador William E. Dodd 's absence ; Sir Nevile Henderson , the British Ambassador , and the Greek , Chinese , Danish , Swedish , Egyptian , - Netherland , Czechoslovak and Belgian envoys . Andre Francois-Poncet , the French Ambassador , came by road ; but - joined his colleagues on the train , in which they will live during their stay here . French Reluctance Reported There was a report that M. Francois-Poncet came only after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German attitude toward . khe Mediterranean conference at Nyon was inclined to balk at special social amenities at this time . However , it was deemed too late to withdraw . The diplomatic train is parked in a railroad yard outside Nuremberg , surrounded by the flags of fortyseven nations . Alongside it is another train which brought the Italians , Austrians and Poles and the envoys of minor countries earlier in the week . Nuremberg draws a distinction between the two sits as , respectively a la carte and table d'h ? te diplomats . Each train has dining facilities , and a drawing room for all has been improvised in a freight station . A squadron of seventeen military scouting planes welcomed the visitors by flying over them in the form of a swastika . Tile only - other special-welcome thus far observable is a large , new signboard bearing the legend , " The Stuermer Will Enlighten You . " The Stuermer is Julius Stretcher 's violently anti-Semitic , organ . He is the Nazi leader of this province and he misses no opportunities . The diplomats bre-akfastEd on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they felt a certain hesitation in exploring further , not knowing ? just what they might encounter . Newspapers available on the train carried full reports of yesterday 's speeches by Dr. Joseph Goebbels , the Propaganda . Minister , and Dr. Otto Dietrich , the Reich press chief . At noon , however , official motor cars arrived to take the , diplomats Into town , where they lunched at the old castle . There were fortyeight guests at the luncheon and with Rudolf - Hess , deputy party leader , as chief host were Dr. Wilhelm Frick , Minister of the Interior ; Heinrich Himmler , head of the German police ; Baldur von Schirach , Reich Youth leader , and Fritz Todt , the Reich commissioner who is building the new motor roads . Immediately after the luncheon the motor cars reappeared and carried the guests on a tour of Nuremberg in which they saw the new buildings being erected for the congress , the huge camps for the Storm Troops , Elite Guards and Hitler Youth and other sights . At 5 o'clock they were deposited at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Baron Constantin von Neurath , the Foreign Minister , and Field Marshal August von Mackensen with him to receive them . M. Francois-Poncet as the dean of the corps in the Papal ? Nunicio 's absence acknowledged the Fuehrer 's hospitality and praised the arrangements made for the diplomats Hitler in return thankedthem for coming to " this annual demonstration of the German people . " Tea . was served at small tables and afterward Hitler moved about among his guests , personally greeting each . They then took their own way in individual sight-seeing , Mr. Gilbert in the company of the Mexican Minister . They dined on their trains and came back to Nuremberg tonight to witness what is the most beautiful of all the spectacles of this annual congress . It is the mass assembly of Reich political leaders on Zeppelin Meadow for the Fuehrer . There were present this year 140,000 of them , all in the brown uniform of the Storm Troops . At 8 o'clock they were drawn up in the great arena in four wide columns separated by narrow lanes . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadow a Great Stadium The so-called meadow is a great stadium rivaling in size that erected in Berlin for the Olympics . Floodlights along the rim tonight lighted up the brown masses of leaders marshaled below , bathed in soft light the high gallery , . backed by great crimson banners between stone pillars , at the center of which is the Fuehrer 's rostrum , and made the gigantic golden swastika above it shine out as if it were carved of living flame . Actual flames flared from enormous cressets at the corners of the stadium . At 8 o'clock trumpets . blared the news of Hitler 's arrival . The massed bands struck up his Badenweiler March as he entered . At the same moment vertical beams from 250 army searchlights , hidden behind the galleries , rose in the sky , making 3,000 feet above the stadium agreat square of soft , fleecy light and lighting up the scene below with an effulgence no sunlight could equal . Sinaultaneonsly from the far background and down the narrow lanes between the brown masses came , six abreast , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold eagles . They made three rivers of red , flowing slowly down to the lighted gallery on which the Fuehrer stood . The movements of the standardbearers created little undulations in the rivers and the light alining on the eagles made on the undulations little waves crested with shining gold . Over and encompassing all was the great square dome of iridescence from the searchlights . Few man-made spectacles surpass the beauty of this annual Nuremberg night scene . It turns the great stone stadium with its ring of upturned faces into a magic world in which all individuality is lost . The bands played soft music as the crimson gold-flecked rivers flowed noiselessely to the front and spread outward there . Then , in the name of " the 140,000 party leaders here assembled , with 2,000,000 other functionaries who are listening to these ceremonies , " the brown-uniformed Dr. Robert Ley , leader of the German Labor Front , formally welcomed Chancellor Hitler . Ninety-seven per cent of those in whose name he spoke , Dr. Ley reminded the Fuehrer , were honorary workers who labored unpaid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . Hitler'sreplying speech was quite brief . " You may be asked , " he said , " why we meet here every year . We know the  --  value of this party congress , just as we know the hard work it entails for every one . But when it is over and we all return to our homes throughout the Reich , we feel like little children who have just enjoyed some unusual festivity . " When we were fighting for this movement , I went out and found you . Now you come to me as the old guard . In this hour you must feel that Germany does not belong to any one of us but to all of us . " I am happy that I can see you before me once yearly . One always feels every so often that one yearns for the company of those with whom one labored in shaping one 's life , and you have made possible my victory for Germany . " Hitler made a brief reference to bolshevism as one adversary of the Third Reich still trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " National Socialism will balk him . I can look into the futdre with full confidence , for we have built our house on a firm foundation . " The greater part of this afternoon was devoted to the women , whose organizations assembled in a great meeting in the Luitpoldshalle . There are seats in the body of the hall for 20,000 , but another 5,000 women were massed standing in the aisles and at the sides . All these were Germany 's housewives , upon whom depends the value of the economies now being introduced ail over the land . It was the largest meeting of women ever held in Germany . They rose and cheered when , after they were all assembled , 2,000 more uniformed women and girls filed down the center aisle to the stage . These were leaders and instructors from the women 's labor service , which on farms and in the countryside is doing work corresponding to that done by the men 's labor corps ; from women 's leagues comprising factory workers , and older girls from the- . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - in field costume and the blue-skirted , white-bloused dress of the girls from the cities . Frau Gertrud Scholtz-Klinck , leader of all the Reich 's women 's organizations , a slight , middle-aged , neatly coiffured woman ; addressed them . She told them about the great problem that had been faced in organizing the women of the entire nation and the difficulties her women had to meet . Four Difficulties Cited These difficulties were four : how to make German households conform with the exigencies of the Four-Year Plan for national selfsufficiency ; how to accustom German households to use new products ; how to carry on the national anti-waste struggle and how to learn to use raw materials . These , Frau Scholtz-Klinck said , were women 's problems  --  already 34,000 lecture courses attended . by 785,000 housewives had been given in- the last year to spread the requisite knowledge , and this instruction was continually being extended as new instructors were trained . In the future , she added , all girls over twenty-one would be taken into the women 's organization , and . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required . Her speech was filled with sound , homely advice , and contained many telling phrases that , judging by the applause , were keenly appreciated . " Our weapon is the soup ladle , " she said , " but let no one underrate its efficacy . " She turned into pleasantries also some of the new Reich 's hardships , of which it is known that women complain . For instance , she told of a girl who married a man in the Hitler Elite Guard . A friend visiting her saw in her bedroom two beds , one of which she occupied . Above the other was a picture of her husband in uniform , with the inscription , " This was where my husband used to sleep before he joined the Schutzstaffel . " To the strains of the Badenweiler March Chancellor Hitler , with the usual procession , entered the friendly atmosphere this address had created . For half an hour he talked to the women in a pleasant , intimate fashion and . in his softest tones . There was no word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping him build up " the world 's greatest women 's organization . " Then he spoke of the German woman 's fortunate lot . Thanks to ideas conveyed by " the sincere foreign press , " he said ironically , there was a notion in foreign countries that women in Germany lived in servitude , dependent wholly on men 's will . They knew it was not true , he declared ; the sexes had to get along with each other just as a man and his wife had to do in married life , and they did . The experience of a million years had proved it , he added , so it could be safely assumed that the getting along together would continue through the next thousand years under National Socialism . The sexes , said the Fuehrer , had different tasks . In German eyes it was not desirable to approve men becoming feminine in outlook or women trying to become masculine .. The final aim in all countries must be the creation of a sound , healthy generation to uphold the nation . " We may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually we are always acting for the future of ourselves and our nation , " the Chancellor asserted . " That knowledge should bring happiness not only to me , the Fuehrer , but to everybody . " " Nature Doctors " Curbed An interesting announcement was made at a conference of German physicians held this afternoon . Dr. Gerhard Wagner , the Reich medical leader , told his colleagues the Fuehrer had decided that in the future no medical practice should be permitted in Germany without a university diploma . This will put out of practice osteopaths , chiropractors and so-called nature doctors , of whom there are some 5,000 in Germany , all practicing without diplomas , which the universities refuse to issue to them as such . This will be a distinct innovation in Germany , where " the liberty to cure " has been free and entirely independent of a'medical diploma . An attempt to adopt a law ending this liberty was made in the Reichstag in 1870 after its abuses had been exposed . It was defeated by the arguments of the famous Dr. Rudolf Virchow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would refuse to be cared for in sickness by anybody but a properly qualified physician . Hitler Urges More Children NUREMBERG , Germany , Sept. 10 ( IP ) . ? Chancellor Hitler , , himself a bachelor , today urged the women of Germany " to be yourselves and have more children . " The object of the National Socialist movement , the Fuehrer told a cheering gathering of Nazi women at - the party congress , was the generation of the future . " Children are the highest ambition of man and wife , " he declared . Frau Gertrud Scholtz-Klink , leader of the Nazi women 's organization , recommended for young women six weeks of voluntary service without pay as " mothers ' helpers " in farm or village families with more than five children . Max , Amann , president of the Reich Press Chamber , lauded the " power of our National Socialist press " and told the congress that plans were being made to build in Munich " the biggest publishing house in the world " to house Hitler'i newspaper , the Voelkischer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
