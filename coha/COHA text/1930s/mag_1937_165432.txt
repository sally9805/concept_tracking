FERMENT-John T. Mclntyre-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $2.50 ) . <P> Last year John Thomas Mclntyre won first place as the U. S. contender in the All-Nations Prize Novel Competition with a complex , fast-moving study of the Philadelphia underworld called Steps Going Down . Readers of that book found themselves plunged at once into a teeming , submoral environment that would have seemed strange anywhere , but which seemed specially inappropriate against the background of the quiet City of Friends-a harsh , double-crossing , violent world inhabited by welching gamblers , well-meaning stool pigeons , jealous streetwalkers , petty gangsters on the run , crooked lawyers on the make . <P> This week Author Mclntyre pictures a still less scrupulous group of thugs and undercover men working hard at their trade of breaking strikes . Similar to Steps Going Down in its neat plot , bitter humor , convincing portrayal of underworld types ( as well as in its philosophical asides that delay the story without explaining much ) , Ferment will strike most readers as a far better book , will arouse more interest in its successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central character is a smart , amiable , curly-headed , educated young man named Steve Brown , whose socks and ties always match and who gets along well with everyone except the people from whom he tried to borrow money-a large and growing crowd . <P> For years Steve had a good job as a spotter on street cars , working for a shoe-string detective agency . When his employer branched out into strikebreaking , Steve went along , told his family he was a traveling salesman . In that game he was up against tough people who started strikes in order to be paid for breaking them . He was slipping without admitting it , but went ahead with his grandiose plans for an expensive wedding trip with his redheaded , impressionable sweetheart Maggie . His quiet , stingy older brother Tom worked hard driving a taxi , became treasurer of the union . For a long time he put up with Steve . But after Steve had stolen Maggie from him , Tom refused to loan his brother any more money . " I always took it for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know what I mean ? I never gave Steve a thought . And then , one night , he just put out his hand and took her . "
