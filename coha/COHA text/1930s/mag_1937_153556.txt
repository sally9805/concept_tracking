In X-ray Room No. 13 of Manhattan 's Bellevue Hospital a 15-year-old girl with abdominal trouble diffidently stretched out on the X-ray table . The technician , a ruddy , healthy farm boy named Frank Brown , 28 , who " was lucky to get a job at Bellevue right after coming out of high school , " smiled reassuringly . He placed a metal cassette containing a photographing film under the girl , whose name was Martha Berger , adjusted the X-ray tube over her , turned on the current . There was a brief hum and the picture was made . <P> Technician Brown , long at the profession and in a hurry , as everyone at busy Bellevue must be , told the girl to turn on her side for another view of her insides . As he slid a second cassette under her with his right hand , with his left he started to push the tube into position . Then the accident happened which X-ray operators fear more than the sterilization which their profession makes practically inevitable . <P> Brown 's right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected to turn off the supply of electricity , and 75,000 volts , 37 times as powerful as prison executioners use in electric chairs , poured through him . Electric chairs use five amperes of electricity , X-ray machines only one-tenth of an ampere , and although that small unit rushed through him like straws blown by a tornado , sturdy Frank Brown had strength enough to haul his stiffened left hand away from the X-ray tube to tug at his right hand frozen to the metal . The current gripped his right hand also . Both hands began to burn and stink . <P> Young Patient Martha Berger sniffed , screamed , rolled off the table , scrambled from the room . Mrs. Grace Fusco , 48 , X-ray assistant , whose back had been turned , noticed the commotion , grabbed Frank Brown 's arm to pull him from the grip of the electricity . The 75,000 volts knocked her across the room . She staggered back for another tug . The man thought he shook his head to warn her away . But his muscles were too tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , grabbed again , was again knocked away . <P> By this time young Martha Berger , wondering if all this were part of the routine of taking X-ray pictures , put her head through the door . She was just in time to see Mrs. Fusco knocked down for a third time . The girl 's screams summoned a man who turned off the current which then let Frank Brown fall unconscious to the floor . <P> Said Mrs. Fusco , who had a headache as result of the incident : " Screams are not unusual in our department . But the girl had good lungs-fine lungs , in fact-and she kept screaming so loud that they must have thought it was something different , and come running in . " <P> Said Frank Brown , whose only apparent injuries were seared hands : " It must be the anticipation , the thinking about what you are going to feel in the days and hours before you go to the chair , that is the worst suffering . <P> " I know damned well that , if they told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow what I 've been through already , I 'd jump right out of this bed and run from here to Jericho !
