txt Ambassador Charles G. Dawes . speaking last night by radio-telephone from his home at 14 Prince 's Gate , London , prophesied that this generation of Chicagoans would rise up and seize " the venemous serpent of organized crime " and choke it to death . This Dawesian conception of a new day for Chicago was based on what other generations have done in similar crises . and his address was the chief event of a dinner of 1.200 retire . sentative business men in the grand ballroom of the Stevens hotel under the sponsorship of the Chicago Better Business bureau . Picture the Real Chicago . It was not only a demonstration of how these business leaders feel about their city but the beginning of a coordinated movement to sell to the world the fact that Chicago is a good place in which to live , a safe place to visit , and a city which is ' making a great dream of beauty come true . Col Robert Isham Randolph , president of the Chicago Association of Commerce , which is carving on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Elmer F. Weibolt , president of the Better Business bureau . and Walter A. Strong , Publisher , were the other speakers . Fred Novak , an Eagle Scout , who came out of a district that has produced much in the way of youthful crime , was presented as a type of the future Chicagoan that may be fashioned by proper leadership . Dawes Traces City 's Rise . " Chicago needs no defense , " said Gen. Dawes , his familiar rasping voice coming Into the banquet chamber in crackling waves . He had to get up at 3 in the morning to deliver this speech . He pictured the advance of Chicago as inexorable , irresistible and Imperial through the centuries . " The spirit of this generation , " he said , " is no whit different from tho unconquerable spirits of its forebears who first masteredl the savage wilderness in its settlement less than a hundred years ago and who , when thirty-eight years later , ' grown already from a forest clearing to a great city , it burned to the ground , rebuilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Progress . " Consider its phenomenal advance , not only In population but in educational and artistic achievement and In industrial , financial , . and commercial Power during the last twenty years ? an advance unparalleled in the world 's history . Consider the majestic and battlemented front of Michigan avenue Overlooking the lake and then think of it as it was twenty years ago . " On the cultural side , consider ably some of the outstanding achievements of recent decades  --  the Field museum , the Opera , the Art institute , the Symphony orchestra and the wonderful and brilliant growth of our two universities . " Consider all this , you who are obsessed by the fear that the organiption of a few contemptible un  --  American gangsters can not be mastered and stamped out by this generation of Chicagoans . TM Lion and the Hornet . , " Once it is aroused they are but hornets on the flank of a Icon . Yet . they are stinging the lion into action . " For a brief time , organized criminals in league with politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago calls . its people answer difficulties . Do not . tils ? courage . but Inspire them . " The answer of this generation of Chicago to tha crime emergency has been given . It was given In the elec . Rim two years ngo . It has been given in the advancc by its citizens of $74 , 000,000 within the last . few weeks for the needs of Chicago . " It has been given in the steady marshaling Int. ; the battle tines behind law and order , of civic organization after civic organization and of the best elements of our citizenship . It has been given by the actions of the Chicago Association of Commerce and your business bureau . The movement has but started . - Sees Organized Crime Crushed . " I say to you that this generation of our citizens will vindicate itself as have the generations of the difficult : past , and in the glorious history of Chicago . Itself not dependent upon any one generation ! Will be remembered not only as a eonstructive generation but as 01112 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime : old choked it to death . It is not a new day fur Chicago . It is a new day for this generation of Chi . sago 's citizens . " Col. Randolph gave his conception of the " great and beautiful soul of Chicago emerging out of the struggle and strife of a century of Progress . " with emphasis upon the schools and the realization of the Burnham plan . Clearing City 's Reputation . Mr. Wieboldt and Mr. Winans took up the question of how Chicago 's reputation as a wicked city could be corrected . " This is not an attempt to white . wash Chicago , " said Mr. Wieboldt . " Our city has its weaknesses , and the Chicago public should be fully aware of them . It is not an attempt to obtain suppression of crime or sensational news as long as the news is based upon fact and is not pure action , even though such news may be damaging to Chicago . " This dinner is an open manifestation of the business and service leaders that they are ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea harbored by thousands of people that Chicago is an unsafe place to live in or to visit . " He said that definite activities had been planned by the coordinated organizations to obtain favorable news treatment . Winans Tells His Idea .. Mr. Winans said that it was all right to tell the world about parks and museums arid other fine examples of civic consciousness , but that this would never balance the dark side of the picture until Chicago shows the world by real action that it is not as bad as painted . " Chicago must make good , " he said . " If for no other reason than to answer the skeptics who , after all , ca n't be blamed for their attitude , considering thin disappointing results of so many of the so-called antl  --  critne that have been started here and else ? where . " Get a few convictions , break up the alliance between gangdom and crooked politics , show the world that Chicago does mean business , that it is not satisfied to shun : 19th or 99th in homicides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change and the mat of your helpful publicity will get a receptive ear . Comparison in Point .. How long would any of you cherish any regard for a store that permitted hoodlums to throng its aisles or that failed to take direction action in dealing with dishonest employees ? " Mr. Winans , who now lives in New York , said that one reason for Chi ? cugo 's reputation was that we are less inclined to adopt the " hush hush " policy of other cities . " No better examples of this could be asked , " he said , " than a comparison of the New York and Chicago newspapers for the week ended March 20 . In that period , one gangster was shot in Chicago and the newspaper .. spread the fact all over the front pages . In the same period in the borough of Brooklyn , nine men were slain in six gang outbursts . The best the New York dailes did was to give these affairs a half column on their less conspicuous pages . The St. Louis papers referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection in New York Opposes " Hush Hush " Plan . " It has been suggested by many well meaning , Chicagoans who feel that crime here receives too much notoriety that we might emulate the , examples of the New York dailies. ! Much as I dislike to see Chicago 's reputation injured , I differ with this stand . Keep the real facts before the people long enough and they will effect the cure . " " Supply . the facts and the truth n can do us no liarm , " said Mr. Strong . on this same point of discussion . He charged the midwest with a responsibility toward Chicago , its natural center , and said that the city needed help and cooperation In its regenerative efforts . It needs other things , he said , constitutional changes . reformed . judicial practice and code , consollda ? Bon of taxing bodies and Internal ministrativo inuirocements .
