Mr. Hemingway is so fussed he starts to take a couple of Pullman towels with him by mistake , thinking they 're his underwear .

As soon as he does so Mabel , stunned by his hasty retreat , snaps the bolt on the door . A little disappointed , she crosses to a wash basin and notes a train envelop lying there . She snoops in it and extracts a Pullman receipt , along with a business card . &nbsp; MABEL DE MOND ( reading the card aloud ) Horace P. Hemingway .

CUT TO : FULL SHOT STAIRS Barbara , biting her lip , slightly vexed and disappointed , remains on the stairs.Norwood steps into the scene and stops at the bottom of the steps , gazing up admiringly at her . &nbsp; BARBARA GREYI  --  please excuse the way I came tearing down the stairs . I was expecting someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've spoiled it . &nbsp; BARBARA GREYSpoiled what ?  --  61  --  &nbsp; NORWOOD ( with mock fervor ) The beautiful picture you made  --  standing there in startled surprise . The soft rays of light kissing your cheeks  --  the darkness behind you caressing your hair  --  CUT TO : TWIDDLES as he raises his eyebrows , compresses his lips and flashes Norwood , off scene , a disgusted look . He exits quickly . CUT TO : FULL SHOT STAIRS as Norwood even goes further with his baloney . &nbsp; NORWOODTell me  --  have you ever been painted ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( with a twinkle in her eye ) Once  --  I think . When I was a child I stumbled and sat in a bucket of paint . ( she makes a move as though to get past him ) May I come downstairs ? &nbsp; NORWOOD ( gallantly ) Please do !

Barbara is surprised by the tone of his voice . She looks at him , puzzled . &nbsp; BARBARA GREYExquisite ? &nbsp; NORWOOD ( chuckling  --  moving his face closer to hers ) And talented . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( uneasily  --  a little distressed ) Please  --  Mr. Norwood . Shall I tell Uncle Horace you 're here ? I know you want to see him  --  She makes a move as though to pass him . Norwood puts out his hand and detains her . &nbsp; NORWOODI assure you  --  not while I 'm so charmingly occupied . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( a little annoyed , but trying to be polite ) Mr. Norwood , I do n't want to offend you  --  but I do n't like people who fence with me . &nbsp; NORWOOD ( his expression changing a little and staring meaningly at her ) Neither do I. Therefore , we should get along admirably .  --  63  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; NORWOOD ( lightly ) Let 's go into the music room . The atmosphere there lends itself to a  --  shall I say explanation  --  of this sort ? Norwood turns and , amused , exits from the scene . Barbara , now distressed by the veiled hints of the man , follows him . CUT TO : Section Details INT . MUSIC ROOM HEMINGWAY RESIDENCE as Norwood opens the door and steps aside to permit Barbara to enter . He then follows her into the room and carefully closes the door . &nbsp; BARBARA GREYNow , what 's this , all about , Mr. Norwood ? &nbsp; NORWOOD ( amused ) Excellent , my dear . You should have been an attorney . ( he crosses to her and gazes down into her face ) &nbsp; NORWOODReally , I think I 'm enjoying this much more than the last one I saw you give . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( annoyed ) I still do n't know what you 're talking about . &nbsp; NORWOOD ( quietly ) I refer to your performance . I was fortunate enough to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe it was " Honey-suckle Time " .  --  64  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( taken back ) Then you know who I am ! &nbsp; NORWOOD ( chuckling at her concern ) Exactly . Now suppose we chop out this fencing and be honest with each other . Shall we ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( quickly  --  pleadingly ) Look , Mr. Norwood . Please do n't mention anything about it to Mr. Hemingway or Jimmy . They think I 'm just a girl out of work  --  &nbsp; NORWOOD ( knowingly ) Naturally  --  and they want to help you  --  ( dryly )  --  liberally  --  you hope . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( pleadingly ) You misunderstand ! I do n't want help ! I want to help Jimmy ! Ca n't you see he 's under his Aunt and Uncle 's thumb and they 've got him in a rut ? Somebody 's got to push him out of it . His Uncle 's got him writing hymns and his Aunt 's even got him so he dislikes the theatre . ( putting her hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them I was on the stage ! I 've got to have Jimmy 's confidence . &nbsp; NORWOOD ( lightly ) Are you sure , that ' a all you want of his ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREYAbsolutely . I 've known him since we were kids ! I always felt some day he was going to do big things  --  and now he 's going to start doing them no matter what I have to do to push him !  --  65  --  &nbsp; NORWOOD ( quietly  --  gazing at her with a fascinated stare ) It 's remarkable ! &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( uneasily ) What ? &nbsp; NORWOOD ( squeezing her hand ) How fascinating you are when you 're upset . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( angrily ) You 're positively a  --  a  --  ( in her anger she says the first word she can think of )  --  a serpent ! &nbsp; NORWOOD ( chuckling ) Perhaps you 're right  --  but you 'll have to admit  --  I could be a very charming one . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( disgusted ) I 'm sorry , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to excuse me . I 'm going right to Mr. Hemingway and confess everything . She starts to go . Instantly Norwood changes . He grabs her arm and detains her . &nbsp; NORWOOD ( impatiently ) Wait ! Do n't be ridiculous ! &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( trying to shake off his grip ) Let me go ! I 'm going to tell him exactly who I am ! &nbsp; NORWOOD ( protesting ) But that 's unnecessary ! Let 's be sensible about this !  --  66  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREYIn what way ? &nbsp; NORWOOD ( releasing his grip on her arm and once more speaking casually ) Why  --  ( he gropes for the right words )  --  let 's talk this thing over . You know  --  have lunch together . Say tomorrow  --  in some nice quiet spot  --  a little music , perhaps  --  a dance or two . ( taking her hand and becoming a trifle enthused as he pats it ) Really , I know the cutest little spot up the Post Road  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( aghast ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested ! Furthermore , if you think you have anything on me you 're sadly mistaken ! I 'm going in right now to Mr. Hemingway and let him know the truth about myself and then I 'm getting out of this house ! She angrily starts for the door . Norwood , amazed by her show of spirit , stands watching her go , stunned . Barbara seizes the door-knob of the door leading into the Reception Room . She yanks the door open  --  and suddenly finds herself staring into the face of Jimmy , who is just in the act of opening the door to enter the room . He has a music portfolio under his arm . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( startled ) Jimmy ! &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( his face brightening at the sight of her ) Hello , Babs . Twiddles just told me you were in here . ( he gazes over Barbara 's shoulder and politely greets Norwood who has instantly assumed a casual air ) Hello , Mr. Norwood . Am I interrupting something ?  --  67  --  &nbsp; NORWOOD ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come in . Jimmy enters the room , still unconsciously holding Barbara 's hand in his.Barbara is struggling to control herself . &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( suddenly looking at Barbara 's hand in his  --  concerned ) You 're trembling , honey ! &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( laughing weakly to cover up ) Am I ? Maybe that 's your fault . &nbsp; NORWOOD ( chuckling ) That remark makes me feel I 'm positively intruding. ( he starts to go ) &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( objecting ) No , you 're not  --  &nbsp; NORWOOD ( amused ) And furthermore , I 'm going to be just rude enough not to ask to be excused . He promptly crosses to the door , hesitates , looks back over his shoulder , chuckles , exits and closes the door . Instantly Jimmy takes Barbara 's hands in his and grins at her . &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILLThe guy is psychic ! &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( cutely  --  indicating the portfolio under his arm ) Can I  --  can I take your trunk ? &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( grinning and handing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't use hooks . The life work is in it !  --  68  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( kiddingly ) Oh , I get it . At twenty-four you 're doing a novel about your scarlet youth  --  for one of those love story magazines ! &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( seriously ) Nix . It 's the oratorio . Remember ? I told you about it  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( afraid of something ) You  --  you did n't bring it over to play it , did you ? &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( quickly ) Sure , if you want me to . I do n't mind . Before Barbara can stop him , he opens the portfolio , brings out a number of manuscript pages and places them on the piano . He sits down at the instrument . &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( exercising his fingers to limber them up ) I have n't got the introductory overture yet but the theme starts off with a storm gathering over a shady glen . ( becoming enthused ) You 'll notice all through the first movement this  --  ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind whistling through the leaves . I have to be careful and not play it too hard . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( trying not to let him see how bored she is ) I know . You might blow all the leaves off and then it would n't be shady .  --  69  --  &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILLDo n't kid about it . Look  --  ( he pounds a loud bass passage )  --  when you hear that  --  it 's rain clouds suddenly stumbling across the face of the sun . How do you like it ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( innocently ) Much better if they 'd kinda sneak across . &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILLYou wo n't clown when you hear the whole thing . ( he gets set ) Listen  --  He starts playing a very classical movement . It is almost a discord in minor notes . There is , however , a dominant series of notes which are repeated in several bars which sound like a melody . As Jimmy plays , frowning seriously , Barbara stifles a yawn . &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( as he plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all atwitter , spread the warning of the coming storm  --  ( he suddenly plays a menacing chord or two  --  and explains it to Barbara , turning and almost catching her yawning , ) A barbed fleck of lightning knifes the sky . Were you expecting it ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREYNo  --  but the birds were . Jimmy now , with great fervor , repeats the series of notes which sound a little like a melody.Barbara , bored , suddenly sits up and listens.Jimmy repeats them again.Suddenly Barbara , her face instantly lighting up with an idea , jumps up enthusiastically .  --  70  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( springing over to the piano ) Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( stopping  --  surprised ) What 's the matter ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( excited ) You 've got a great tune there ! &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( pleased ) That 's what I think  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREYBut you 're playing it wrong ! Play it in fox trot time ! Give it a little rhythm ! &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( puzzled ) Change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREY ( excitedly ) Yes you can ! Here , let me show you  --  ( she pushes him off the seat and sits down at the piano herself )  --  listen ! She plays the passage in fox trot time , faking a new base . The result is  --  it sounds like a catchy musical comedy tune  --  one that instantly strikes us could become very popular ! Jimmy , his face changing , listens . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( turning excitedly to him ) See what I mean ? &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( coldly ) I think I do .  --  71  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( up  --  grabbing his arm enthusiastically ) I 'm telling you , Jimmy it 's bound to be smash hit ! It would be a cinch to place in a show ! Just think ! It might make you famous over night ! ( wildly turning back to the manuscript ) I 'll bet you 've got other tunes tucked away in this fool thing  --  ( she turns over a few pages and suddenly brightens ) I knew it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you play it  --  ( she plays several classical chords . ) That 's wrong ! Listen what happens when you play it waltz time  --  Barbara changes the time , leaves out some of the fancy stuff , adds a few grace notes  --  and the result is a fascinating waltz tune ! Jimmy watches her . His face is grave , cold . Barbara jumps up , excitedly . &nbsp; BARBARA GREYJimmy . I 've got an idea ! Let me give this to Dubin and Warren and I 'll bet they can revamp it into a score for a musical comedy ! &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( gazing at her , his face grim ) Do you really mean that ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( too excited to notice his expression ) Of course I do ! Why , the producers on Broadway would chase you from morning till night just to  --  &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( quietly ) Look , Barbara  --  I guess you do n't get the idea at all . I want to be proud of that piece some day .  --  72  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to try and do something with it ? &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( coldly ) I 'm sorry , but I did n't write it expecting to make money with it . If it 's the kind of trash you think it is , I might just as well tear it up . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( staring at him ) Jimmy ! What 's the matter with you ? &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( bitterly ) I mean it ! ( he starts picking up the manuscript and putting it away in the portfolio ) I want to do something like Beethoven , Liszt , Mendelssohn ! People remember them ! I want to write something that will go down in history and live ! You ca n't do it with popular songs . They 're whistled and sung and played and plugged one week and forgotten the next ! ( putting the portfolio in a cabinet and slamming the door in disgust ) Can you tell me the names of the composers who wrote the smash hit popular songs three years ago ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREYNot off hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But look at Beethoven ! Liszt ! Mendelssohn ! ( suddenly softening ) Honest , Babs , I do n't want you to think I 'm highbrow  --  but with me it 's a serious thing . I want to write something that will be played on the concert stages of the world long after I 'm dead .  --  73  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( exasperated ) But would n't you rather be famous now  --  so you could enjoy it ? Get some benefit out of it ? &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( uneasily ) I do n't think I 'd enjoy that kind of fame . My Aunt always says  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( angrily ) Oh , your Aunt my eye ! All I hear is your Aunt ! Have n't you got any spirit of your own ? &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( peeved ) Do n't be like that , Babs  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( with spirit ) I will be like that ! You 're in a rut and it 's about time someone jarred you out of it ! You look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so old even moths would starve on them ! &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( a little burned ) Maybe I bore you , huh ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( upset ) It 's not that . It 's the fact that when somebody wants to help you come down to earth  --  &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( coldly ) I do n't need anybody 's help . What 's more , if we 're going to sit here and quarrel all night  --   --  74  --  &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( bitterly ) There is n't a chance . I 'm too disappointed in you . &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILL ( in a huff ) Okay , baby . He turns , in a typical lover 's huff , and crosses to the door . He opens it and stops to gaze quietly back at Barbara . &nbsp; JIMMY O'NEILLSee you sometime when you 're better dressed . He exits and closes the door . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( suddenly weakening and taking a step forward ) Jimmy  --  Suddenly she stops and gets a grip on herself .

HEMINGWAY ( surprised ) Help Jimmy ? How ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( pleadingly ) He 's getting nowhere ! When I first saw him in the drug store I felt so sorry for him I just could n't tell him of my own success ! I 'd have felt funny ! And besides , he does n't like stage people either ! &nbsp; HORACE P.

HEMINGWAY ( grimacing ) Yes , darn it  --  a whole evening . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( appealingly ) Then do n't you see why I made up my mind to help him ? &nbsp; HORACE P. HEMINGWAY ( looking at her quizzically ) You  --  you sort of like him , do n't you ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( sincerely ) I 'm crazy about him !

HEMINGWAY ( he looks around furtively and then speaks mysteriously ) To tell the truth , I sort of like the theatre . I go occasionally . Do n't mention it to Mrs. Hemingway  --  but I saw the Merry Widow in 1908 . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( becoming enthused ) Get your hat ! &nbsp; HORACE P. HEMINGWAY ( puzzled ) My hat ? What for ? &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( grabbing him by the arm ) I 'm going to show you stage people are n't so bad after all .

I 'm going to introduce you to a lot of swell people and you 'll love them ! Barbara slams Mr. Hemingway 's hat on his head and pulls him towards the door , overcoming his protest . At the door he balks . &nbsp; HORACE P. HEMINGWAY ( weakly ) Wait ! I  --  I 'd better take a drink of water first . My knees feel like tissue paper  --  With trembling hands , he pours himself a glass of water from a desk decanter and raises it to his lips .  --  79  --  Suddenly Barbara reacts as she remembers something . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( startled ) Gosh ! I almost forgot the most important thing ! You know Jimmy 's oratorio ? &nbsp; HORACE P. HEMINGWAYYes  --  ( he starts to drink the glass of water ) &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( a trifle frightened ) You  --  you wo n't be angry if I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ugh  --  ugh . &nbsp; BARBARA GREY ( abruptly ) I sneaked it out of the house , had two song writers change it into jazz and it 's going into " Sweet and Low-D0wn " !
