Europe 's outstanding example of mass production in industry , the great Bat'a Shoe Co. of Zlin , braced itself last week against a dire economic threat . Recent German press stories have declared : " The Bat'a family are Czech Jews . " If this charge can be made to stick , Bat'a chain shoe stores in Vienna and other parts of Greater Germany face confiscation . Even if not made to stick it may seriously injure their business . Actually , most of the Bat'a family are tall , big-boned , straight-nosed , bristle-haired blonds . <P> But last week in his native Zlin ( which lies in Moravia well back of the Sudeten German district ) , Shoe Master Jan Bat'a , half brother and successor to the late founder , Thomas Bat'a , who was killed when his private plane crashed ( TIME , July 25 , 1932 ) , felt obliged to make an answer . He announced in the Bat'a magazine Zlin that he had sent German officials genealogical data tracing his Roman Catholic ancestry back to 1576 . <P> " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Jan Bat'a . " I am only curious to see whether there is still someone in Germany today with the courage to place truth above lying propaganda . I would not be ashamed to be a Jew despite all the attacks of the German press . I would feel equal with all people . But I am no Jew . "
