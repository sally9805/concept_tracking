Thumbing through his mail about a year ago , A. F. of L. 's President William Green came across a letter from Princeton , N. J. The missive suggested that in these troubled times Mr. Green could do himself and the public a service by writing a book on Labor 's role in democracy . This week Labor and Democracy* appeared under William Green 's signature. + Mr. Green being a busy and none too articulate man , readers could reasonably conclude that his first book was the fruit of collaboration with some brainy hireling . <P> Labor and Democracy is nevertheless a true mirror of William Green-a plain work by a plain man . " Those of us who have grown up in the labor movement , " he observes , " know that its real strength and function is not as an army with banners flying , enlisted for a crusade , but as groups of workers interested in having a job and in doing a good day 's work . . . . " <P> Of his intimate associations with John Lewis in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with A. F. of L. 's Founder Sam Gompers , with many another Laborite and politico , impersonal Author Green tells almost nothing . The one anecdote in his 194 pages of record and analysis concerns John D. Rockefeller Jr . ( see col. 2 ) and the ill-famed Ludlow " massacre " at a Rockefeller coal mine in Colorado , where eleven children and two women suffocated when National Guardsmen burned a strikers ' camp . Mr. Green was dedicating a monument to the Ludlow martyrs of 1914 when a closed car drew up : <P> " . . . A man from the car came to the platform and indicated that he wanted to speak to me . ' Mr. Rockefeller is in that car , ' he whispered , ' he wants to speak to the miners . ' It was difficult for me to believe that anyone could so misunderstand a situation . ' For God 's sake tell Mr. Rockefeller to leave here at once , ' I replied , ' he may be killed , if these men find out he is here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views on C. I. O. are strictly A. F. of L. : that C. I. O. is the rotten fruit of John Lewis ' personal , destructive ambition . True to A. F. of L. tradition , Author Green insists that Labor 's base and strength are in the shop , that political activity must be nonpartisan and secondary . But , surveying the corporate structure of modern business , he worriedly notes " points of control which Labor can not reach by collective bargaining alone , " goes on to preach Government regulation ( and even ownership of railroads ) , when &; where private enterprise " can not alone adjust itself to new conditions . " Near the end of his timid tome , he tentatively concludes : <P> " . . . Experience with democratic procedures develops discrimination and the realization that identical provisions for all do not necessarily result in equal opportunity for all . To work out the transition from a social structure that provides special privilege for those in positions of power , to a social order providing equal opportunity for all , is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> * Princeton University Press ( $2.50 ) . <P> + Mr. Green 's rival , John Lewis , has one book to his credit : Miners ' Fight for American Standards , published in 1925.
