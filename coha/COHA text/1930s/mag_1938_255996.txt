Testifying before SEC last month , Edward H. H. Simmons said he had known that his former fellow Exchange Governor Richard Whitney had used cash belonging to the Gratuity Fund , but had not thought this significant enough to report to the Exchange because using customers ' cash was general practice among brokerage houses . SEC regarded this assertion as remarkable , ordered the Exchange to look into the matter . <P> The Exchange found that on March 31 the 452 member firms handling margin accounts in the metropolitan area were custodians of free cash balances of $245,562,000 belonging to customers . After sampling 60 presumably representative firms with aggregate free customers ' balances of $51,349,000 , Exchange accountants last week confirmed Mr. Simmons ' assertion . The Exchange discovered a general disregard of a joint opinion of seven law firms representing the largest brokerage firms on the Exchange . This opinion , written in 1934 as an aftermath of the Banking Act of 1933 which divorced deposit banking from underwriting and brokerage , held that brokerage firms could legally keep their huge customers ' balances so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be " not available for use by the firm in its general business . " Of the 60 sampled firms , just seven made any attempt to live up to this requirement .
