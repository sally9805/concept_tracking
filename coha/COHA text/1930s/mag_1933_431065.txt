HE LAY there so pale and worn , and looking so pathetically young , but with a great shining iii his eyes . . . . He 'd just been rescued from the bottom of a dry well he had been digging on his new ranch , having fallen in when the rope broke . He 'd been down there a week when they found him ? passersby curious about the new well in the sagebrush so far from any habitation , and stopping to take a look ? legs broken , fever burning in his veins , not much reason to hope for rescue , for there was little to lure travelers that way . And now here he was , safe out of it all . True , he was wasted away to skin and bone , and the doctor would be there presently and would probably take off his legs below the knees , and he had no money and would be dependent for care on kindly neighbors , and his ranching plans had gone a-glimmering for that season ? and there 'd been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . but the shining in his eyes went beyond all these considerations ; beyond the shining of fever , or thankfulness for escape , or any other apparent reason for it . " What is it , Billy ? " asked the motherly rancher 's wife , bending above him . He 'd been so hopeful when he bade them all a gay farewell and rode off to start his ranch in the hills . " What is it , Billy , that you 're thinking ? " " That I 'll never again be able to pass a well without looking down into it . " Only that ; that there were-other wells in this vast virgin country where townbred men were struggling with the problem of making a home on the soil ; and another rope might slip or break , and another man might fall in , and Billy might help with his rescue . Looking down wells ? wells of grief ? wells of worry ? wells of illness ? wells of aloneness . Most of us have been at the bottom of some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out . I wonder , when we get out , do we all feel as Billy did ? Do we think of the possible others who may still be in the depths ? Down there ? as with Billy ? rescue seemed to depend on others ; we could do so little for ourselves . Then these others came to our aid . And this one was pulled out , his old company opening up , sending for him . Work once more ! And worry fell away like a weighted mantle ! And a great light shone in his eyes ! . . . What is it , friend ? Of what are you thinking ? Of that old gardener you can now put to work again ? Of that repair man you can call up about the basement stairs ? Or are you only glad you 're out ?  | That woman so long discouraged , her savings nearly gone , nobody left to borrow from ; and then the summons , " Come back to your desk ; we need you ! " That glow of gladness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Is the shining from relief for herself alone ? Or is some of it because she 'll now be able to give another a lift ? Are we all sure we shall never again be able to pass certain wells without looking down into them , without offering a hand ? That new job in a strange field ? the dread of unaccustomedness to theroutine-minded . But here 's one who 's been through it all . " Buck up , Buddy , " he calls briskly , " it 's not so bad . It 's looking on that gives you the jitters ! Take hold ! Get going ! I did , and now I would n't trade back . " The new locality ? everybody strange , that terrible forlorn , left-out feeling . Oh , for just one familiar face ! And then there 's a cheery greeting , a pleasant-mannered woman at your elbow . . . . " You 're a newcomer , are n't you ? I was ? last year . I thought I 'd die of loneliness at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Come to church Sunday , wo n't you ? I 'll be looking for you . " . . . And the bleakness goes ; and all at once it 's a homey little street with nice people in it . But will you remember that particular well in the future ? A well into which others are constantly slipping ? To receive and not to pass on is to be as a lake with no outlets ; in the end ? only stagnation . A woman about to lose her luxurious home , obsessed with the thought of it , put on her warm furs and set out for a long walk . " I 'll try walking it off , " was her thought . Of course , she could n't walk off the gripping circumstance , but she might be able to walk off its iron grip on her consciousness . She must , for the way she was going meant a complete breakdown , and this would only add one more burden to her already overburdened husband . She dropped a package of cookies into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she might grow faint . Leaving the highway , she went down a country road , down another , then into a patch that led through the woods ? on and on and on in a desperate sort of stumbling blindness . She was brought up short by seeing a small shack with smoke issuing from its stovepipe chimney . Her first thought was flight ; desperadoes might live there . Then she glimpsed a woman 's face through the window , and a little child 's ; and all at once she felt exhausted , ready to drop . She rapped at the door . The woman opened it gingerly ? a gaunt , shabby woman who was patching an already overpatched stocking . Two barefoot children played on the floor with some old pasteboard boxes . " May I rest a few minutes ? " the visitor asked . " I 'm afraid I 've walked too far . " Instantly the door was opened wide , the one good chair was offered . " Can I make you a cup of tea ? " The voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do need it ; and we 'll have a tea party . " She emptied her cookies on to the table . Quickly the tea was ready . The children came shyly ? nice , clean children . They had only cambric tea , but cookies ! The visitor knew from the way they ate them that cookies were almost a forgotten treat . They smiled confidently into the visitor 's eyes , kicking little red heels happily . The mother saw , and her eyes filled ; then the two women 's eyes met , and they both broke down and had a good cry together ? the w roman in expensive furs and the woman in patched rags . " We 're losing our home , " said the former presently . " It 's got me ; my nerves are shot to pieces ; I cry at alook . " " I know ! " said the other . " We lost ours . That awful worry , I know all about it . But I do n't mind any more , so long as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part . In summer it 's beautiful here , and the children play outdoors all day and are as happy as birds . We 'll  | have a better house as soon as my husband can get to it ; he 's getting up wood now , then there 'll be the garden . It 's just like pioneering really . with that same spirit of new hope , something to look forward to . You 'll feel so much better once you let go ; it 's the hanging-on that kills . " She , too , had been down that dark well . She knew . She did n't speak from platitudes , but from experience , and her words were as balm : " I clung to our home so ? it was the memories ; I went there as a bride , and the children were born there . Then one day I got to thinking about cave women , and how they must have clung to their homes in the same way , thinking if anything should happen to that particular cave , there could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time so much better homes were on ahead for women ? mud houses , and brick houses , and frame houses , and stucco houses , and now it 's to be glass houses . And I got to thinking how it was n't just the house , but the associations that made it blessed ? and you could carry the associations away with you ? in memory ; and build anew , correcting old mistakes , incorporating the things specially loved . The more I thought about it this way , the less I clung to the physical house ? the more deeply I realized that life is a flow , but property is dead matter . " The healing had come . A new richness entered into living for the visitor . That philosopher-woman , her gray eyes alight , had reached down and pulled the other out of the depths ? and a new friendship was born that day in the woods that helped both , each with her own particular problem . An old man sat alone in his cabin , whittling away on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miner lost in dreams and visionings . He could make it again , he knew , if he could only get another grubstake . He did n't need much , only beans and bacon and flour , then with his pack on his back he 'd be off to where they were digging gold . But he could n't ask for another grubstake . Every one roundabout was hard hit . Women and children first ? he understood that . He was only one old man , alone ; it did n't much matter what happened to him ? only he loved life . He 'd scarcely eaten now for two days ? he 'd been making the bow and arrow for something to do ; he 'd always made bows and arrows in his off hours . Maybe he could go out and get a rabbit , if he could only get the arrow pointed up sharp . One thing , he would n't ask for help . Women and children first ... . " Well , hello ! Who 's this ? " . . . Somebody at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ khaki forever following down old , forgotten Western trails . An alert , lively young face . " A bow and arrow ! Let me try it . " The old man handed it over . A young man 's face appeared above the girl 's shoulder ; a man hiker , khaki and boots told the story ? and a knapsack . Each tried it . " Would n't that be great for the girl scouts this spring ? And made of our own native arrow-wood , too ! " Her companion agreed that it would . . . . Sell it ? " Sell it ! But he was n't a selling man ; he always gave away his bows and arrows ; he Dnly knew to dig for his gold . However , he trembled with joy at the prospect ? some real money . The khaki-clad one sensed the situation , knew the meaning of those trembling old hands . Could you get us out a lot of them ? for the ; irl scouts ? " Could he ! He could scarcely speak for exitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... a reprieve . . . the hand held out ! A few weeks later , when the scout leader returned for the bows and arrows , they were all ready for her . " Say , pard , " said the old miner , " is there anything you 'd like special ? when I make it again ? " His eyes shone as he accepted the bills that would buy bacon and beans and flour for one more grubstake . " I 'll be startin ' to the mines purty soon now . " " A tiny gold nugget . " " I 'll send it , pard ; you 'll get that nugget . " And in the late spring , when it came with ) ne apiece for each of her scouts , a scrawled note accompanied it : " I am doin ' purty good , pard , " he had written , " so I 'm grubstakin ' some other fellers. know how it feels to want to go diggin ' gold and ca n't . I him thar ! " People in wells ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what our own situation ? people we can understand best because we 've " bin thar . " Sometimes I feel that many of the hard experiences come to us just for that ? to give us special insight : to make us ambassadors extraordinary to others in times of similar distress . " You , too , lost a  | child ? " and the bereaved mother weeps on the other 's breast ; that other knows ; she , too , has been in the depths ; she can best lead that poor mother up into the light , because she can go with her all the way into the dark . All the hard experiences have this richness for us ; they make us know ; they open doors ; they clarify opaqueness . To miss all this from suffering is to turn it into barrenness ? ashes and barrenness where springs of understanding might have been . The thing we can do seems so small , of ten ? hardly big enough to count in life 's full flow of pressing material needs ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of kindness : feeding the hungry , mending the broken , comforting the sorrowing , opening a door , pointing a way , reviving the , spark of hope in dead ashes of endeavor , offering a hand to people sunk in wells of despair ? and he did it for the people round about him : for fishermen and plowmen , gardeners and housekeepers , his neighbors and friends and relatives , little children and casual acquaintances , the rich and the poor , the sick and the well . And because many of these remembered , and passed the good of it on to another , steadily multiplying the will to help , now , after nearly 2000 years , his way is still fresh before us ? the only way . The ministry of kindness : we can not turn from it ? and survive ? for it 's a fundamental law of human existence . The ablest leaders can offer no substitute . Economists , scientists , statesmen can make no workable plan not based on it . The simplest housewife can accomplish miracles with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? some one who needs you . Turn from your useless worrying ? and open the door .  |
