Sevillian choir boys dance prettily in the Cathedral on the festivals of Corpus Christi and the Immaculate Conception . In Chinese temples priests play on exotic little instruments . Hebrew cantors intone wailing dirges in their synagogs . But , thought perturbed members of the Maplewood Methodist Episcopal Church in Maiden , Mass. , who ever heard of whistling in church ? <P> The church was celebrating its 80th anniversary . Through the congregation circulated the same respectable , soberly-clad gentlemen who take up the Maplewood collection every Sunday . But today , every now and then one of these gentlemen would pucker his lips and , discreetly yet unmistakably , whistle ! <P> Soon Pastor Duane B. Aldrich explained to his amazed , amused and scandalized flock : he had instructed the stewards to whistle every time a dollar bill or more was dropped in the plates . There had been 105 whistles .
