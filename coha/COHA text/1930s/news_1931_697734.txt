txt A resolution protesting against Federal and State laws " depriving the medical profession of its inherent and deputized rights to prescribe drugs and remedial measures in ' such quantity as it may deem necessary in treating the sick " was adopted with only one dissenting vote today at the annual general business session of the 1 American College of Physicians , con- ; vened here this week fof its fifteenth ' clinical- session . While no particular " drug " was mentioned , it was generally understood . that the resolution aims at laws limiting the right to prescribe - alcoholic liquors . " New laws and regulations have been and are now being forced upon medical men to such an extent that they can no longer be the judge , of their own methods of treatment , but must bow to the prescribed forms of non-professional legislators and boards , " said the resolution . " State medicine is generally undermining the ancient and traditional rights of medical practice , and , if continued at its present rate , legitimate practice will soon be displaced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by patent and proprietory medicines . " Recognizing these deplorable conditions , the American College of Physicians , met in regular assembly , recommends : " First . That every legitimate effort be made to impress upon the members of Congress that unrestricted medical treatment of disease by properly licensed physicians should be granted and that they should not be penalized on account of the misuse of medical methods by a very small percentage of so-called medical and non-medical men . Let the profession be its own judge of how it can best treat the sick and properly penalize those who flagrantly abuse their licensed or unlicensed trust . " Second . That the fellows and associates of the college must become more active in medical legislation and join with their State societies in an effort to repeal inimical State laws now in force , and influence a higher type of medical methods for the future protection of the sick and those to whom their lives are entrusted . " At the annual banquet this evening , Dr. William H. Welch of Johns Hopkins University , who only recently celebrated his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the history of medicine and its importance to each member of the profession , he made a plea for wider cultural interests among physicians , championed fulltime service for doctors engaged in clinical work , and " disagreed with Dr. Sydney R. Miller , president of the college , who , in his presidential address last night , suggested that non-practicing teachers of medicine should be replaced by physicians coming from " the front line trenches of practice . " Medicine is becoming more and more scientific and specialized , Dr. Welch said , and the doctors of today stand in need of the leaven of a broader culture and a wider interest in what we may call the new humanist . Dr. Osler was a greater doctor just because of his wide culture and his great humanism , Dr. Welch declared . There is a great deal of confusion and looseness in the use of the term clinic today , Dr. Welch stated . Quite often it is used by a firm of doctors , gathered under one roof to save expense , not connected with any hospital or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused with ? clinics , he said . Osler and Ziemssen , particularly the latter , must be credited , he stated , with the first general conception of a well-organized clinic . A clinic must have a hospital , beds , a staff of assistants , and above all lab-. oratories in which to study the problems presented by the living patient . Value of Research Stressed . Now the conduct of such a clinic , Dr. Welch stated , requires the full time of those in charge of it . It I would not be possible in this , clay for a man to do justice to his teaching and to his investigation work if at the same time he also had outside interests  --  that is , private practice . Dr. Welch , disagreeing with Dr. Miller 's suggestion , said : " There are some who contend that there is a difference between the art of healing and the science of medicine ; that the good , successful family physician has certain innate qualifications that can hardly be taught . " I am of the opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice of medicine . Undoubtedly the personality of a physician plays an important part , but it is essential to possess scientific knowledge for one to become a successful physician . " A physician ' from the front-line trenches of practice ' is necessarily absorbed in his practice ; hence , what I call a modern medical clinic can not possibly be conducted by a man of that type . He may be called in for consultation , but the man in charge must be one who stands ' in the front-line trenches of research . ' Dr. William Gerry Morgan , president of the American Medical Society , declared recent criticisms of the medical profession were due not to faults in medical teaching or to shortcomings on the part of clinics or public institutions , but to indifferent service by bedside doctors , " a truly lamentable " condition which , he said , should be looked into . Extensive studies in the measurements of the growth of human embryos as compared with that of embryos of the higher primate apes were presented by Dr. Adolph H. Schultz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that his findings corroborated the evolutionary hypothesis that man and ape developed along divergent lines from the same parental stock . - Dr. Schultz stated that some of the higher apes  --  have been found to have less vestigial tail than humans . He added there were close to 150 cases on record of the persistence of tail in human beings . One boy , he said , was born with a spinal protuberance nine inches lon . , There were algso close parallels , he said , in the growth of hair in human and simian embryos , it appearing first in both species on the upper lip , chin and brow . There is a general trend in all higher primates toward a reduction of hair on the body . The anatomy of the human foot , Dr. Schultz stated , shows that the joint at the base of the big toe was once opposable and used as a thumb , as in the case of the higher apes . There is also evidence that those of later species walking on the ground are developing large toes similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human body , " Dr. Schultz concluded , " is much the best that could be adopted so far from an inherited plan of growth . Human growth is influenced , if not determined , I believe , at every step by evolutionary changes which produced the species . " Dr. White Inducted as President . Dr. S. Marx ' White , president-elect of the college , was inducted as president during the morning session by Dr. Miller , the retiring president . Dr. Francis M. Pottenger of Monrovia , Cal. , president and medical director of the Pottenger Sanatorium , was chosen president-elect for 1932 . He will assume office at the meeting next year at San Francisco .
