One night last week , as his car reached the end of its run , a San Francisco cable-car conductor heard the muffled howling of dogs . Next he investigated , traced the noise to an abandoned night club . He notified the San Francisco S. P. C. A. When Officer Al Girolo broke in , he found 34 feebly whimpering dogs chained to the silver- gold walls inside . Obviously near death from starvation , the dogs were rotting bags of bones , their teeth and gums infected , their bodies covered with shiny spots where their hair had fallen out . Two of the dogs were dead . Seven of them were eating a weaker one alive . The two dead dogs had been almost devoured . <P> The dogs ' owner had rented the house under the name of " Everall . " Arrested , she and her husband now called themselves " Mr. &; Mrs. David Brown . " " I did the best I could , " wept Mrs. Brown . " . . . We fed them every week or so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleanor Goldshur : he a philosophy instructor at San Francisco Junior College , she a student of psychology . Mr. Goldshur disclaimed any knowledge of the dogs ' plight ; Mrs. Goldshur explained that she was interested in " animal mass behaviorism . ' ' Officer Girolo said that dogs have to be " damned hungry " before they resort to cannibalism . <P> The Goldshurs ' lawyer pleaded : " For many years Mrs. Goldshur has been preparing a thesis for a master 's degree in psychology . . . . She has become so interested and so involved in this study that she has developed an abnormal frame of mind , bordering on insanity . " The judge sentenced the Goldshurs to six months apiece in the county jail , placed them on probation for four of the six months . All the dogs had to be destroyed .
