txt Calendar Reform . In his letter to THE Times R. J. M. Danley states that of the various proposals that have been made for reforming the calendar none is as simple , practical and businesslike as that of the Naohans . In 1926 the League of Nations made a detailed study of nearly two hundred proposals for the reform of the calendar . Of these they selected two which with certain minor variaations were deemed practicable for universal application . It is therefore to these two plans , namely the equal quarters plan and the thirteen equal months plan that consideration must be directed . Of these two , the thirteen equal months plan , which correlates the weeks with the months and with the year , and which has already been adopted by over seven hundred companies for their internal use , seems to be the more practicable. ?
