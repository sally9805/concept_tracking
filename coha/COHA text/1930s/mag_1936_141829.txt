A favorite pastime among pirates of the Spanish Main was to set men adrift in small boats or maroon them on desert islands . Caja de Muertos ( Coffin ) Island , a few miles off the southern shore of Puerto Rico , is supposed to be the original of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island , on which , as every schoolboy knows , pirates marooned Ben Gunn . Last week , out of the ocean near Coffin Island came reports of an amazing revival of such piratical practice . <P> The freighter West Mahwah of the Pacific Argentine Brazil Line has lately been held in San Juan , P. R. , by a crew strike ( TIME , Nov. 9 ) . One night last week it finally cleared the harbor . Few days later , into the office of U. S. District Attorney A. Cecil Snyder marched four ragged youths , three of them Puerto Ricans , the fourth a 16-year-old from Washington , D. C. named Rothwell Burke . Filing complaints against the West Mahwah , young Burke and two of his companions signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on the West Mahwah but were discovered at midnight , two hours after sailing . Furious , Captain Hansen at once ordered a few pieces of painters ' staging spliced together , gave the boys two bottles of water and a loaf of bread , set them adrift . At dawn the four castaways sighted Coffin Island 15 miles away , tried to reach it by paddling with their hands . They were still far away that afternoon when the fishing smack Desafio picked them up , carried them to Ponce , P. R. <P> Attorney Snyder appealed to the U. S. Coast Guard and Department of Justice for advice . Each began an investigation , but a Department of Justice lawyer in Washington presently announced that there is no law covering the situation . Said he : " There are many crimes on the seas for which we have no laws . If the castaways had been members of the crew the case would have been very different , but legal rights of stowaways are problemtical . " <P> Queried at the home office in San Francisco , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radioed that the whole affair was a hoax . Snorted the Line : " The incident has been grossly exaggerated .
