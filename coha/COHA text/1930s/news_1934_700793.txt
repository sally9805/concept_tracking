txt The bulls have their backs to the wall . Under the Dow theory a further decline of less than a point in the Dow-Jones rail average and of a little more than four points in the in'Mistrial average would stamp the entire period since July , 1933 , a bear market . The critical October , 193.3 , lows of 83.64 in the industrials and 33.96 ic the rails were tested under heavy selling on July 26 , 1934 , when the industrials held at 85.51 , and the rails at 34.29 . Subsequent decline in the rails on August 7 to a new low of 33.46 , which occurred on relatively low volume , was without significance under the Dow theory primarily because it was not confirmed by the industrials , and secondarily because the new low did not break the October low by a full point  --  a measure cf tolerance that has proved its value ' on many occasions , notably just before the bank holiday in 1933 , when it kept long holders of stocks from selling just before the market began one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its history . The rally which followed the July 26 low in the industrials was only the normal " bounce " from an oversold condition which might have been expected even in a bear market . The " bounce " in the rails failed to reach even the technical minimum of 40% of the preceding decline . Since August 25 ' the industrials have declined 8.88 points , losing all but a point and a fraction of their rally from the July 26 low , while the rails have lost it all , and three onehundredths of a point more . The market went " dull " at the top of the rally , and Friday , at least , picked up volume on the decline , which Is characteristic bear market action . Old traders on the Dow theory hold at least , one fact self-evident at this point : For anyone who has held stocks thus far , it is no time to sell them now , even though it may be tomorrow , or next week .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
