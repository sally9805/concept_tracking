txt Mayor LaGuardia and Borough President John J. Lyons of the Bronx called on Governor Lehman yesterday afternoon at his home at 820 Park Avenue and told him about a plan for what would appear to be a legal lottery to raise $10 , - 000,000 to $15,000,000 semi-annually for relief of the unemployed , The Governor announced that the visit had taken place at the Mayor 's request , but went on to make it clear that he was not committed to the scheme . The idea is that of Mr. Lyons , who was elected Borough President here on the Recovery ticket last Fall . Not Considered " Lottery . " The word " lottery " appears nowhere in an outline of Mr. Lyons 's plan , which he gave to reporters . The outline , headed " Lyons 's Tentative Proposal for Unemployment Relief  --  League to Aid the Unemployed of the City of New York , " would set up a corporation whose trustees would be the Mayor and the rest of the Board of Estimate , " and seven outstanding citizens not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also serve without compensation . " The officers , however , would be " selected in the same manner as jurors are chosen . 1 . e. , the names of all paid members are to be placed in a jury wheel from which names shall be withdrawn . " The " paid members , " according to the plan , would be any one willing to risk $2.50 on a chance of being selected as an officer . There would be no dearth of officers . The plan calls for a president at $25,000 , a vice-president at $20 , - 000 , nine additional vice presidents at $15,000 each , three secretaries at $10,000 each , ten sergeants-at-arms at $5,000 each , " and such other officers as may be specified , each to hold office for a period of six months from the date of their selection . The " salaries " would be for their total terms of office . Meetings would be held In high schools , at which the selection of officers would take place . Would Make Officers Work . Mr. Lyons 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mere figure-heads . " It shall be the duty of the board of trustees , " his plan read , " to limit and define the duties of all officers , i. e. , president of the league to preside at all meetings and assist in the preparation of lists of the needy . Vice presidents shall aid the president and in his absence perform his duties and possess his powers , serving in the order of their selection . " Secretaries shall prepare a ros- 4er of all members and keep ? record of the minutes of all meetings and perform such other duties as are usually exercised by this office . Sergeants-at-arms shall preserve order at meetings and perform such other duties as customarily go with this office . " After the salaries and other expenses had been paid , the remainder would be " applied to a relief fund to aid the unemployed , subject to the direction of the board of trustees . " The City Controller , serving without compensation , would " act as treasurer or custodian of the funds ? ? ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasury of the City of New York . " A letter from Mr. Lyons to the Mayor under date of March 9 , and made public in the Mayor 's presence , said : " You indicated a most receptive attitude to the proposal and stated that you thought there was considerable merit to the idea and one which you felt could be legally put in operation without delay . Since talking with you , I have discussed the matter very informally with some high ranking members of the legal profession , and they seem to concur in your view that the execution of a plan of this sort could be put into effect without any conflict with existing laws . " As you know . I am not a lawyer myself , and the roughly worked out suggestion which I am attaching hereto must be put into better legal shape and amended in many respects . " Nevertheless , It may be the basis for the development of a plan to be of great value in meeting the emergency confronting us , the chief problem of which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and balance the budget . " Says Need Justifies Plan . He argued that unusual conditions at present indicated that " unusual solutions " should be sought , and said that " we have witnessed many departures from what might normally be considered sound conservative governmental functioning in a desire to meet unprecedented problems . " Also , he urged , " additional hardships of taxation " should be avoided if possible . The idea , be continued , " although audacious , " was " worthy of some thought and consideration . " Conservative governments of the British Empire and other countries employ more brazen methods of obtaining funds for charitable purposes . " Like yourself , I am most vitally concerned regarding the humane side of our problems , but realize that in our endeavors to take care of the needy affected by unemployment , we must frankly face that financial difficulties that accompany them . " In ordinary times I would perhaps not have the effrontery to suggest a proposal which may be as unorthodox as this one . I think , however , that the serious emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unusual means of raising revenue . " The " temper of our people , " he added , would be " liberal " at this time toward such a scheme to aid the distressed . " If it were decided to undertake this suggested experiment of securing funds for unemployment relief , " he said , " I think that some appropriate legislation should be enacted at Albany , restricting the operation of such a plan to the State , or municipalities of over 50,000 , and only in cases where the entire proceeds less actual expenses were to be turned over for the benefit of the unemployed to the treasurer of the State or municipality . " The Mayor 's only comment on the proposal was to say , as he and Mr. Lyons left the Governor 's , that " we had an informal chat with the Governor . President Lyons took up a proposal for obtaining additional revenue for relief purposes . " He asked Mr. Lyons if the latter wanted to make his data public , and Mr. Lyons promptly did so . Governor Lehman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make an appointment to see him and Borough President Lyons . They came up here to advise me that certain legislation which they described to me only in very general terms would probably be introduced into the Legislature . I did not discuss the matter with them in any way and I advised them that if they decided to introduce the legislation consideration of it would be a legislative matter exclusively . " They presented no bill , nor am I familiar with the legislation which they told me would probably be introduced , save in the most general way . It is a matter with which , of course , I have absolutely no relations or connection . " He added that the City Economy Bill was not discussed , and that the Mayor and Mr. Lyons had spent only a few minutes with him . The visit occurred a little after 4 o'clock .
