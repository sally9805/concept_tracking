Peasant-born Albert Lebrun , the engineer recently elected President of France ( TIME , May 16 ) , sat owl-solemn through a Cabinet session last week , stroked his wide black mustache from time to time as Premier Tardieu formulated plans " to keep a much closer watch on all foreigners in France or entering France . " Lest U. S. , British or German tourists be scared away it was elaborately hinted that Russians , Italians and Spaniards will be the chief objects of scrutiny . <P> Meanwhile in his Paris cell Russian Dr. Paul Gorgulov , who killed President Paul Doumer three weeks ago , tried to explain away the crime that is expected to send him to the guillotine . <P> " I was mistaken , " cried Dr. Gorgulov . " I thought it was the President that was responsible for the foreign policy of France-her rapprochement with Soviet Russia-too late I have learned that it is the Premier who directs French policy . " <P> Told that this explanation made no difference , Dr. Gorgulov tried again . " A mystic force armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason at all to kill President Doumer . On the train from Monte Carlo to Paris I struggled against my idea of committing the crime . I prayed , even on the train . When I reached Paris I went to pray at Notre Dame . I begged God to rid me of this obsession . My struggle with myself lasted for two whole days . Then I drank an entire bottle of cognac . I was too intoxicated to remember what I did . " <P> Paris police , unimpressed , pointed to the slips of paper on which Dr. Gorgulov wrote in no drunken hand " I have killed the President of France ! " a few moments before doing so . <P> Deputy Edouard Herriot , leader of the Radical Socialists who won most seats in the new Chamber of Deputies directly after President Doumer 's death , remained coy to all correspondents last week , hinted that he may not try to become Premier when the Chamber reconvenes June 1 , may prefer to become a second Aristide Briand , holding the Foreign Ministry and supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Socialist . That M. Herriot is the power behind the political throne in France was shown when he and President Lebrun jointly received the Corps Diplomatique last week , as though M. Herriot were already Premier . Legally he is a mere Deputy .
