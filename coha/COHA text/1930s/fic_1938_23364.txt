n.s --  , m27n THE DIRTY WAY A STORY BY THOMAS SANCTON M HERE 'S a lot of talk going around 1 about Sergeant Kroneberg beating up Joe Corrissey and about the Register taking Joe off the run . I saw the whole thing of course and I know all about it and what caused it , but I made up my mind not to say anything about it around the courthouse , because there are a lot of detectives just like Kroneberg on the force and they 'll gang up on you every time if you give any one of them trouble . And when you 've been on night police for fifteen years you try not to get sucked into something someone else started . But let me tell you one thing . Even after fifteen years on this job there are some things you just ca n't take , and something that happened around here to-day has got me plenty swelled . I could n't get fighting mad over a nigger , like Joe Corrissey did , no . I 'd never tear into a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the same type of fellow Joe is . But I can get swelled over the rotten thing Kroneberg is doing to a white man like Joe , telling the fellows in the barroom to-day that he got something on Joe about him keeping a hustler , and that Joe just blew up when he asked him about it . That 's a damned lie . Kroneberg beat up Joe Corrissey because some pretty lousy thing Kroneberg had done got Joe so mad he tried to maul him . Joe smacked him first , all right , but it was n't in the course of friendly conversation . And it was n't anything at all about a hooker . That 's all made up by Krone-berg . It was about an old nigger . About that nigger Kelly and the five years he spent in the pen . I guess Kelly must have showed up about ten years ago when the courthouse was in the old building , and that was a good while before Joe Corrissey even hit town . I was working for the Register then , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old building . You do n't find many hell raisers these days like we used to have working on the papers in this town ten years ago . One night we all showed up for work about four o'clock floating in that boot- leg gin . The first thing we did was pick up the overnight precinct reports from the clerk 's office  --  old Peets White was night clerk then , God rest his drunken soul  --  and then we stumbled down to the press room to call them in . But the others just quit cold and folded , so I went on down to the washroom to soak my head , and that 's when I found this Kelly . Well , sir , here was this dirty , filthy old nigger lying under the radiator with his head pi/lowed on a roll of toilet paper , sleeping like a baby . Those radiators in the old building were fixed on the walls and this here one had about an inch clearance over the nigger 's stomach . It was close enough to cook him and he smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just about to come to a boil , but nigger-like , his belly was warm and he was sleeping like a baby . Well , I roared . That nigger was really a funny-looking sight . So I went out and got old Peets to see him and it set old Peets to cackling and snorting , and then the both of us went in and got some of the guys in the detectives ' office to take a look . Well , you know how those guys are . They run about one brain to a two-man team . Right away they had to start thinking up some foolishness to scare the nigger . They got a sheet from the morgue downstairs and they got old Peets to play ghost because he was good at that stuff . So Peets put that sheet over his head and held up two flashlights for eyes , and then they turned out the lights and Peets went over to the nigger and booted him a little . You should have seen that nigger 's face when he finally got his eyes open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took a quick grab for the window  --  we were on the second floor  --  but old Peets drew back his fist and motioned him to stay down on the floor . " Just do n't you look at that window , nigger , " Peets warned him . " You just sit there now and answer me some questions . Now tell me where you stole them breeches , nigger . Go ahead and tell me now if you do n't want me to bite your head off . Where you stole them , nigger ? " This here thing that looked like a ghost and talked like the law was too much for that nigger . He threw himself down on his hands and knees and started shaking his head back and forth and whimpering . " Oh , Gawd , " he sort of moaned and laughed . " Oh , Mistuh Ghost , is you a really ghost ? Oh , please do n't tetch dis nigger , Mistuh Ghost . Oh , oh , oh . . . " " You damned right I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " So now come on and tell me where you stole them pants . " Well , the nigger started to cry like a baby . He went to rocking back and forth on his hands and knees and shaking his head , like he was trying to shake off the D.T. 's . " I ai n't stole no ale breeches , Mistuh Ghost , " he whimpered . " Dat 's de Gawd 's truf , Mistuh Ghost , you can ask anybody . Ask ole Mistuh Rizum . He tell you I ai n't no bad ole nigger . Ask him . I do n't steal nuffin . He tell you ( lat . Ask him if ole Kelly what uster wuk fo ' him back on Font Street do n't steal puffin . He tell you I ai n't a bad nip : er . " Well , we were about to die . We could n't keep from laughing any longer . And then one of those goofy detectives wound it up by shouting out : " You 're a black liar and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He let go with his pistol , all six shots , right into the ceiling . The nigger let out a shriek and ups the window before any one of us could stop him and out he goes  --  right through the second-storey window . We almost died . We hung on to one another and laughed till we got knots in the side . But finally old Peets straightened up and walked over to the window to see what had become of the nigger , and he saw that the nigger had been hurt . He was just lying there , holding his leg and babbling . We ran out and picked him up and brought him back into the washroom to take a look at his leg . It was bunged up down at the ankle . The guys on the force began to get worried about the grand jury and what it would do if the nigger got real sick or something . They did n't want to take him to the clinic because the doctors would have to ask a lot of questions for the records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; all niggers are afraid of the hospital . This Kelly , all he wanted to do , he told the fellows , was lie by that radiator for a day or two . He said he 'd keep out of everybody 's way and would n't give anyone trouble and then , after a day or two when his leg got to feeling better . he 'd just go on off . But they did better than that for him . Old Peets was feeling bad that them play-ing around like that had caused the nigger to get hurt , and so were a couple of the other fellows . They got a little canvas cot and a couple of clean blankets from the morgue and they put Kelly up in a little supply room leading into the big toilet room . And they sent down and got old Doc Gullotta  --  he was the assistant coroner  --  to come up and take a look at that leg . He told us the nigger would be all right if he could lie up about a week off that foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the supply room . Peets sent out to the restaurant and got him a two-bit dinner and a pack of tobacco . And after all that attention old Kelly got to feeling downright glad he 'd hurt his leg . The nigger just about thought he had a room in the Ritz Hotel . He was dry and warm and fed and had some smokes and he was feeling about as near to heaven as he 'd ever expect to get . Of course , not even many niggers would have wanted to stay in a place like that , right oft that toilet room there and with all that powdered soap stacked up along the walls , but that was as good if not better than anything Kelly ever had . Kelly I guess was about forty then . He 'd been a bum for years , sleeping in the open or in doorways and old sheds , places like that . He 's sort of simpleminded too . He forgets things . When he hit the courthouse about all he could tell us about himself was that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Font Street a long , long time ago . But Kelly never pronounces a name right and " Rizum " might have been Roland or Robbins or Reed , or almost anything . When a couple of us in the press room tried to look the man up we were never able to find anyone that came even close to being " Mistuh Ole Man Rizum . " Kelly just took roots in that supply room . His leg got better in two or three weeks  --  well enough to travel on anyway  --  but he did n't show any signs of wanting to pull out . And by that time the boys had got around to liking the nigger , es-pecially old Peets . He was such a comical nigger and they had a picnic playing their jokes on him . And he was n't causing anyone any trouble at all . So old Kelly just got to be a part of that courthouse . Sometimes Peets would throw him a dime or fifteen cents ; sometimes we 'd cut him a little poker pot in the press room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he 'd pick up a few nickels shining shoes . Old Kelly , he 's just too ugly to describe him . He 's black as the ace of spades , and he 's dried up and skinny and he 's got a mop of hair like a wild African bushman , but it 's turning sort of white now . His nose is spread all over his face and the few upper teeth he has fit into the big gaps between his lowers . The way they fit into each other like that gives him a sort of thick , spitting way of talking . He used to sit around on the floor by the heater on winter nights when we were playing cards and just talk and talk and talk to himself . He thought no one was paying any attention to him , but there would be old Peets and the rest of us , holding a fistful of cards we could n't see for laughing to ourselves , and there would be old Kelly jammed up next to the radiator banging away a mile a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ten dollahs , Kelly , ' " he would begin to mumble . " Dat man know ai n't got no ten dollahs . Now wheah gits ten dollahs ? Answer me dat . Wheah I gits ten dollahs ? Why dat man mus ' ai n't have he good sense . Humf . All de time it ' Kelly do dis ' and ' Kelly do dat ' and ' Kelly loan me dis ' and ' Kelly loan me dat . ' Humf . Dey jis ' makin ' jokes , dat 's what . " Kelly thought more of old Peets than he did of any of the rest of us . Peets just had a way with niggers , I guess . Some mornings , when the old man and I would run out of conversation , Kelly would call out kind of softly from his cor-ner : " Oh Mistuh Peace . " ( That 's what he called Peen . ) " Mistuh Ole Peace Swipe . " " What , nigger ? " Peets would answer gruffly and then turn to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax you jis ' one question , Mistuh Peace . " " What do you want , nigger ? Come on , get it out . " " I wants to ax you ai n't I a good nigger , Mistuh Peace ? I'se a good ole nigger , ai n't I ? I do n't gib nobody no trouble around here , now does I , Mistuh Peace ? " " Why , nigger , " Peets would say , " you ai n't fit to be poisoned . Why , you the worst damned nigger I ever saw . Do n't you come around here talking about good niggerl Why , a good nigger would n't have nothing to do with a nigger like you . " Kelly would giggle to himself like a schoolgirl . He 'd bend his head down and make an awful face and throw his hands on his head in fake despair . " Now jis ' lissen to dat , will you ? Po ' ole Kelly . jis ' lissen to dat . Now Mistuh Peace , you knows l'se a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows dey do n't cotch ole Kelly stealin ' nuffin around here . Now admit dat now , Mistuh Peace . Now do n't be so hand on ole Kelly . Admit he ai n't no bad ole nigger , Mistuh Peace . " Peets would cover his eyes with his hands and shake his head and groan . I remember one night old Peets told Kelly : " Bad ? Nigger , you 're worse than bad . They ought to throw you under the jail  --  not in the jail , under it . And they ought to take that key and throw it in the river . " That 's what old Peets told Kelly , and that 's just about what happened . They took this old nigger and threw him under the jail  --  for something he could n't have thought up if you gave him a thousand years . That ape Kroneberg did it , like I told you . What Joe Corrissey could never understand was why old Peets and I and the other boys who liked Kelly ever let Kroneberg get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Joe . But it 's nouse . He 's just a downright Yankee about things like that . Joe will never get to understand why a lot of things happen the way they do down here . Myself , what I could n't understand about the whole business was why Krone-berg Iet a harmless old nigger get under his skin the way he did , and why he went to all the trouble of getting a nigger framed and sent down to the pen . If he felt that way about the nigger , why did n't he just kick him off the place ? But that 's Kroneberg for you . That was n't mean enough for him . Kroneberg got down on Kelly one day not long after the nigger came to the courthouse . Kelly had been telling old Peets the names of the men who let him shine their shoes and Peets got a laugh out of the way Kelly pronounced their names . He called Sergeant Bastrop " Sergeant Mousetrop , " and Murullo , " Mistuh Gorilla " ? and he called Kroneberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just so damned stupid that was the nearest he could get to their names . Peets knew the boys 'd get a laugh too out of those names , so he called Kelly in . But he made the mistake of joking with Kroneberg . He pointed him out to Kelly and said , " Now who 's that big fat man over there with the big whiskey nose ? " " Dat 's Sergeant Humbug , " said Kelly . Kroneberg looked up quickly , and he was n't smiling . " All right , " he said . " Enough of that now . " " Who , nigger ? " said Peets . " Say it again . Louder . " " Sergeant Humbug . Dat deah is Sergeant Humbug , " said Kelly , without any idea what it was all about . Everyone broke out in a horse laugh and that set off that crazy temper of Kroneberg 's . He tramped over to Kelly before anyone knew what he was going to do and smacked him in the jaw and knocked him down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked him in the gut . " You step out of place with me again and I swear I 'll blow your head off . " And then he walked out . A Southern gent , see ? Southern gent hell . Kroneberg is a rat . Everyone knows that he 's a killer and he 's yellow . He shoots them out on lonely roads when they try to " escape . " It 's an old trick . I guess the grand jury would have got to him long ago but for the fact he 's got political drag and he 's just a little too big in that respect to handle . That drag of his , in fact , is one reason none of the guys on the force squawked when he sent Kelly down . After what happened in the clerk 's office it seemed Kelly just could n't keep out of Kroneberg 's way . Every humbug that happened Kroneberg would blame on the nigger . Whenever he sent the nigger on errands Kelly would be so afraid of him he 'd forget what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kroneberg 's hate for the nigger grew and grew . Finally it exploded in the smart idea to send him down to the pen . The thing that set it off was Kelly burning up his new pair of shoes , and I got to admit that 's pretty aggravating . Kelly got them in a pile of shoes from the detectives ' office that had been left for hint to shine . Kroneberg 's were wet and Kelly put them by the furnace to dry . lie forgot about them and they burned up . After that nothing would satisfy Krone-berg but to fix the nigger good and proper . Kroneberg called Kelly one day and gave him one hundred and ten dollars  --  just about enough to make it grand larceny ( three to five years ) ? and he says , Kelly , go to such-and-such a used car dealer at such-and-such an address and buy a Ford roadster he 's got out in front on a little platform with a big sign on it . You see , Kelly , he 'll sell it to you cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't have much money . But if I go , why he 's going to try and sting me , understand ? And do n't say a word about Sergeant Kroneberg sending you because then he 'll know it 's me and not you that 's trying to buy the car . . . . That 's the way we figure Kroneberg framed him . Because Kroneberg reported that his money was stolen and a little while later this dealer called headquarters and reported that there was an old nigger around there with a lot of money he would n't say how he got who was trying to buy an automobile and could n't even drive it . Those dealers are on the lookout for phoneys of course , and Kroneberg knew just about what would happen when Kelly got there . So he went out and arrested him . It was air-tight . Kelly 's word against Kroneberg 's , against a white man , a detective sergeant . And there was the dealer to testify , when Kelly tried to explain Kroneberg had sent him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned Kelly a courthouse shyster who made his living off cases like that  --  small profit but quick turnover . What would there have been in it for him to win a chicken case and antagonize Kroncberg and his chums ? So he let them do damned near what they wanted with the nigger when they got him on the stand . And Kelly got three to five years . Peets and I , I guess we were the only ones who took any interest in the case at all beside Kroneberg . Just before Kelly Lame to trial we discussed the possibility of helping him without getting ourselves in a situation too big to handle . And we could n't think of an earthly way to do it . We could have gone to Kroneberg and forced him to drop the case by threatening to make a big stink about it . But then what would have happened ? One , two , or three months later Kroneberg 's friends would have put the squeeze on and we 'd have found ourselves out of a job . And we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the trial , how would that have looked ? I can see it in our papers : REPORTER , EX-COP TESTIFY FOR NEGRO CHARGE COP FRAMES NEGRO SAY KRONEBERG FRAMED NEGRO Why it would have taken an extra mail truck just to carry our anonymous threats . And I 'm not so sure but that a lot of our trouble would n't have come in the mail . No , sir , we just could n't see our way through . Even after finding out about the hell Kelly went through in the pen , even if we 'd known at the time what he was in for , I just do n't see how we could have done any different . We had no idea what Kelly was in for though . Even Peets , an ex-cop , could n't realize what Kelly was in for in the pen . I 've always wished he had n't told Kelly what a good time he was going to have there when he began to whimper about " gettin ' fro'ed in jail . " That kind of hurts even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought they were playing a joke on him . Someone said he stole some money . But around the courthouse they used to say he stole a lot of things , just kidding . Every time there was a complaint about a robbery they said Kelly did it . . . " Kelly , where the hell did you sell the piano from the First Methodist Church ? .. . Do n't lie now , Kelly , tell us what you did with the junk you got out of the house on Cross Street . . .. Kelly stole this . . . Kelly stole that . . . . " But after the trial , when they would n't let him go back to his little room , when they held him in the county jail and told him that he was going downstate to the big pen in a few days , then Kelly realized they had " fro'ed " him in jail sure enough . The day before they took him down we went to see him , Peas and I , and old Kelly just bawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out fum my little room ? " he asked Peets over and over again . " I do n't gib no one no trouble deah , Mr. Peace . Why dey done me dat , Mr. Peace ? " It got us down . It was a damned dirty shame and there was nothing we could do about it . We tried to cheer Kelly with stories of three square meals a day with turkey on all the big days , and a nice clean place to sleep without any boxes of powdered soap along the walls . But he kept whimpering that he just wanted tostay like he was in the courthouse ? " wif Mistuh Peace and de pencil boys . " And so Peets told him : " Now Kelly , you be a good nigger and listen here to me . You 've got to go down to the pen , Kelly , you understand ? We 're sorry to see you go  --  you know that . You ai n't a bad nigger , Kelly . But we just ca n't do anything about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you 're up there in the pen , why you just keep thinking all the time , ' When I get out of here , if I 'm a good nigger and do n't give no one no trouble , I can go back to my little room and old man Peets is going to give me fifteen cents and some tobacco every dayl And everything 's going to be all right . ' You just keep thinking that , Kelly . " But that was the last time Kelly and the old man saw each other . In the third year Kelly was away Peets dropped dead  --  drinking in the barroom across the street . The nigger was away five years . He was too feeble for road-gang work , so they put him on the prison cotton farm . According to the records he was a " penal farm hand , " but what he really was was a slave  --  and for five years he burned in the sun . That 's the part that gets me . Peels and I , we did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was when the nigger came back and sat by himself at night , like he used to do , but talking to himself now about how the ankle shackle hurt and about being thirsty and about the nigger next to him in the chain who " jis ' wuk hisself to dear  --  that 's when I found out what a nigger does in the pen ; that they could burn some sense and some life out of even a clod . Kelly got no time off for good behavior , and from what he told me I could easily figure out why . He just kept making stupid mistakes , losing his tools , and overturning the containers of disinfectants . And twice , by accident , he set his bedding on fire . So the nigger was away for the whole five years , and a lot of things happened in that time . OM Peels died , and I went to work for the Call , and Joe Corrissey blew in from the East and took my old job . And they put up this here new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ritz Hotel . Now this Conissey is a funny duck  --  but a hell of a fine man , do n't let me give you the idea he ai n't . Joe 's sort of like a saint from a long , long time ago that just kept living and living and picked up a taste for a little booze every now and then and for women too , and who got a hell of a lot tougher and smarter along the route but never lost that old saint desire to help people in a jam . That 's a funny thing to say about a man but if you knew Joe you 'd see what 1 meant . I 've heard fellows  --  some of the boys around the city room  --  say Joe is soft . But those boys are wrong . If you ever want to run a bluff on Joe you better be able to back it up . And you can ask the mayor himself about that because he found it out one night when he tried to scare us off a little hit-and-run story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who got shoved out of the press room , and who apologized to who . Joe 's just got the kind of courage that fools people because he 's so quiet . But Joe 's the kind of fellow that if a man comes to him worried about his wife getting sick or his kids why he 'd go on a note for all he was good for if God Almighty came down and said , " Joe , let me tell you before you sign it , you 're going to lose every cent . " It 's because he does things like that that makes some of those mugs think he is soft . And what 's got me burning is to think that bunch in the barroom would stand up and let Kroneberg lie about him like that . It was n't until the night that Kelly came back that I told Joe about the whole business and how he had been framed , and I wish to God I did n't tell him a thing . It was like showing red to a bull . Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was lying on a couch behind the lockers half asleep and Joe as usual was at his desk with a book when Kelly opened the door . From my place behind the lockers I could n't see who it was and ittook me a long time to recognize the voice . Kelly scraped his feet a little and said , " How-do , white folks . Ai n't got no call to open dis heah do ' like dis , but I wants to ax you ifn dis heah de co'thouse , please ? " Joe told him it was . " Well goll lee dam ' ! " said Kelly . " No wondah I coun ' fine dat ole co'thouse . Guess dey musta toed it down jis ' like dat man tell me . " Joe laughed and said : " What are you looking for , boy ? Nickel , dime ? " The nigger said , " No suh , fank you . Dey done gib me five dollah bills when dey tuh'n me loose and I still got t'ree of dem dollah bills lef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Well then , what are you looking for ? " " Ah lookin ' fo ' Mr. Ole Peace . " " Who ? " " Mistuh Ole Peace , " said Kelly impatiently . " Mistuh Ole Peace Swipe . You know who Mistuh Ole Peace . He de big clerk . It be awright ifn I looks fo ' him . He know me . He done tole me to look fo ' him , fo ' I lef ' . He don ' mind if I go in de clerk office lookin ' fo ' him , white folks . He let me come in deah and sit by de raziator . " " Oh , " said Joe . " You must be talking about old Peets White . " " Dat him , " said Kelly eagerly . " Wheah he at ? " " Why boy . Peets is dead . He 's been dead two or three years . " " He . . . raids " said Kelly . It was a jolt . " Oh ... Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ po ' ole soul . Gawd bless Mistuh Ole Peace ' soul . " I should have known from the funny way he called Peets ' name that it was Kelly . But you forget , you forget . Joe must have seen that the nigger was deeply moved , and he asked him , sort of soft , " You liked the old man ? " " White folks , " said Kelly , " beg yo ' pawdon but Mistuh Peace de bess ole white gencmum ebber lib . Dey jis ' ai n't no mo ' like him . And me , I sweah I don ' know what I 'm gon na do now .. . . " And for a long time he said nothing . But finally he asked : " This heah , it look like de prest room , ai n't it , white folks ? " Joe said it was . " And Mistuli Brownie , he wuk out ob town now ? " " No , " said Joe , " he 's right here now  --  back on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Here 's a boy wants to see you . " It was all coming back to me in a rush now . . . Mistuh Ole Peace Swipe .. . de prest room . . . Mistuh Brownie . " Jesus , " I said , jumping up off the couch ? " Kelly ! " Kelly had been on the road for two days , and he was a tired nigger . We had them send up a plate of dinner for him  --  just like the time he showed up years before  --  and we got him a couple of shots of whiskey . And that night we let him sleep on the couch . I began to remember how old : eets had talked to Kelly that day before he left , and what he had promised , and somehow I felt that I ought to make good for him . So the next day I went to the chief and fixed it up with him that Kelly could stay down in the engine room with the understanding he 'd keep it cleaned up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten the whole thing , and when I passed the hint to him through one of the detective clerks that a couple of people did n't want to see the nigger molested any more , why he sent back word that Kelly could live in the press room as far as he was concerned as Iong as the nigger stayed out of his way and did n't begin " stealing again . " But Kelly told me a couple of nights after he had come back that Kroneberg had stopped him in the hall . " He say , ' Nigger , you outa de jail now , but if you do n't wanta get fro'ed back dealt you jis ' keep outa my way . ' He say , ' I do n't want you around dat detective office no whicha-way and when you sees me a-comin ' you jis ' better scoot . ' Now what he mean , Mistuh Brownie ? " Kelly asked , frowning . " Is dat deah man gon na fro ' me in de jail again ? " " No , Kelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told him . " You just do like he told you , just keep out of his way and do n't go in that detectives ' office , and he wo n't give you any trouble . " But it made me uneasy . I did n't mention what Kelly told me to Joe Corrissey , because by that time Joe was steaming . By that time Joe was fixing him up a paddle to stir up a great big stink . He had started after Krone-berg . A few days later I came into the press room and found him reading over the stenographic copy of the proceedings at Kelly 's trial . He had slipped it out of the criminal record room . And then I realized Joe was thinking of reopening the case and I saw he was going after trouble , real trouble . Joe is a Yankee and he does n't understand a lot of things about people down in this part of the country , especially some of the ideas they have on the subject of niggers . Joe could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the part of a nigger against a white man  --  to stir up something like that after it had been dead and buried for five years . But I could see it . And for his own good I went to work on him . I argued and pleaded and gave him hell for three days , and finally I showed him where he was wrong . " For God 's sake , Joe , " I told him , " if you 're going after Kroneberg do n't try to do it through the courts . Joe , I know this courthouse . I 've been around here longer than you have . If you want to get Kroneberg  --  and let me tell you , boy , any way you try it you 're just spelling trouble for yourself  --  you 'll have a better chance if you go about it the dirty way . Now let me tell you what to do . Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open . That 's the first thing . Then just mosey around and talk to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get something real dirty on Kroneberg . If you can , and it ought to be easy , you just sew up some good evidence and throw it to the grand jury . But when you do you 'd better slap a peace bond on Krone-berg and a couple of his friends , and even so you 'd better be ready for trouble . " And he decided to take my advice . " O.K. Brownie , " he said at last . " But if I ca n't do any good that way , why then I 'm going to take that rat apart with my hands . One way or another Kroneberg is going to find out a man is a man and not to be kicked around like a cur dog , even if he is a worthless old nigger . " And , Brownie , I want to tell you one thing more , " he said . " I 've always thought a hell of a lot of you . But now it 's going to take me a long time to forget you sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old nigger to burn in the sun for five years . That 's the way I 'm feeling and you ought to know it . " " All right , Joe , " I said . " I understand . But now I want you to try to understand one thing for me , and that 's this : I 'm not ashamed about not going to bat for Kelly that time . I 'm sorry , God knows , about what 's happened to him . But I ca n't see it any differently now than I did then . You 're like a young preacher in a story I read once . You look at a thing and ask yourself if it 's right or wrong ; and if you make up your mind a thing is wrong , well you do n't stop to figure out all the angles . You just go plowing in , like a damned old knight of the Round Table . It takes all kinds of people to make the world , and you and I just happen not to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for a while , and then he spoke in that sad voice of his , and what he said I 'm never going to forget . " Brownie , " he said , " you 're right . I see it now . I ca n't hold that against you any more than I can blame you for the funny drawling way you talk . I guess there was a time , before we grew up , when we would have felt the same way about this Kelly thing , if we could have understood it then . But we 've come far , far , far from that time . We took a different turning somehow and traveled a long waysince then . But let me tell you this , Brownie , and you just see if it is n't true : You took the wrong turning , boy . You and Peets by yourselves , in your hearts , you 're good men  --  but ignorant barbarous bastards in a pack . Brownie , you guys kill and let kill ; you torture and burn and crucify . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You kick prisoners out of cars and shoot them in the back ; you string niggers to a tree and burn them with blow torches ; you shoot guys because they kick for better pay . You do those things because you 're afraid of the mob you run with and have n't the sense or the courage to stand off and look at a thing and say : This is right , and damn it , we 're going to see that it 's going to be right . And this is wrong , and damn it , it 's going to be wrong . " Well , I 'm not one of your bunch . When we came to that crossroads you turned onto a highway that 's so damned crowded the only way you can move is marching . The road I took is tough going but the direction is right . Battle for the meek and humble , for they get left out in the cold . That 's my religion . And if I do n't amount to much or make any money , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes you get broken up but you feel worse if you pass with your head turned aside . And sooner or later enough guys like me come down our road to wear down even a windmill . And then someone writes a bill of rights or an amendment to mark the spot . . . . " Joe went to work on Kroneberg the way I told him to , but he never had a chance to carry it out . Something happened that made him blow up , and he sailed into his windmill with bare fists . He got busted up like he expected , but I guess he really preferred to do it the way it happened . About three months after Kelly got back , Joe and I had to go into the detectives ' office one night to check on the developments of a story . Kroneberg was acting as night super . He was drinking . He was in the midst of a long-winded speech when the door opened and Kelly stepped in . Kroneberg stopped talking . He watched Kelly close the door like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nigger was frightened , and I saw that Joe was watching Kroneberg in that funny hard way of his . " Get out of here , nigger , " Kroneberg said in a low voice . Kelly did n't jump back through the doorway as he expected . Instead he began to stammer something . He had come to tell me , we found out later , that there was a call for me in the press room . But of course kroneberg did n't give a damn what he had come to say . He was only waiting for the nigger to open his mouth . Kroneberg snatched up a glass paper weight . Kelly let out a frightened cry and fumbled for the door . Kroneberg threw it with all his might and it smashed the nigger in the back . Kelly clutched at his back and fell against the wall moaning . " You lousy bastard , " Joe yelled and drove his fist into Kroneberg 's face . He had risen to his feet and the blow sent him reeling against the files . Joe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Kroneberg and smashed his face till 1 thought his head would come off . But you do n't spend twenty-five years as a cop without learning the fighting that counts . Kroneberg rammed his knee into Corrissey 's groin and kneaded him again in the face when he doubled up . I should have got in then , I guess , but I did n't . Joe had started it and I knew he wanted to finish it himself , one way or another . But with that second kick he was out on his feet . Kroneberg mauled his face . Then Joe went down and Kroneberg kicked him in the gut . That was too much . I jumped over and grabbed him and slammed him against the files . " Kick that man again and I 'll brain you , " I said . " The fight 's over . " And I slammed him into his chair . I 'm too big for most men and I try not to lose myhead , but I felt like beating him to a pulp . The nigger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the hospital . Kelly had taken an awful blow , but it was nothing to what Joe got . Two ribs and a broken nose and some deep cuts . Kroneberg got a broken nose out of it . When Joe snapped out of it in the hospital ire asked what he had done to Krone-berg . I told him pretty good . " Good , " he said . " He 'll think twice before throwing paper weights . I wish I could have got his job too but I guess I 'll have to be satisfied with this . " Joe stayed in the hospital a week . When he got out his paper put him on a job in the office right away . They never let him get back to the courthouse . In a way I 'm glad for Joe , because he might get a break in the office . But I 'll miss him out here . He was a fine man to work with . I called Joe up to-day and told him what Kroneberg was saying about him living with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he wanted to . " Hell , Brownie , " Joe told me , " I do n't care what Kroneberg says . My friends wo n't believe him and I do n't give a damn about the others . But watch out for Kelly , kid . If they give you trouble let me know and I 'll find him some place to live . " He need n't worry . I guess that fight has convinced Kroneberg that the less he has to do with Kelly the better . Kelly wo n't have any trouble . But Kroneberg will . I was n't going to say anything about the whole business at first . I 've got two daughters and alimony to pay , and I 've spent too long a time at this job to kick it over . I hope I do n't have to . But Kroneberg is n't going to get by with that stuff about Joe . I do n't care if Joe cares what he says or not . I do . That 's the way I am and I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to get that guy  --  the dirty way .
