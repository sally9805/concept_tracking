HOLY MORNING A STORY BY ELIZABETH MADOX ROBERTS r-pwo miles from the hard highway by I the way of a rough country road , and then a turn to the left along a soft lane that labored upward between two fields , and the track brings one at last to a cottage that stands before a cedar hill where the foxes have their dens . Inside the cottage an old man , Uncle Tim Wheelright , sat before a slow fire asleep . Sabina , his granddaughter , having finished her morning tasks , came to replenish the fire . She piled small pieces of wood in the grate and laid on coal , to make a quick burning . The red coals underneath caught at the wood and turned it to a yellow flame . She was happy in the lapping of the flame and happy in the swift movements of her hands as they piled the coal above the burning sticks . No sharp voices spoke about her and no demand was made . These were remembered  --  the slamming of doors that plied on double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again . " Get ready the pitchers , ham , two hams , eggs on , ham and . " Being always ready for some other , being nothing else but ready  --  she had come away from this . Now she leaned over the fire she had enkindled and warmed her hands at the bright flame . It had been four weeks since she had come . Trembling with apprehension of what she might be doing , she had told the keeper of the restaurant that she would quit the work , that she would go back home . Eyes followed her as she went among the tablesas if eyes might add some accusation to her choice . Now she stirred eyes into the bright coals of the fire and turned her body about to rest on a low chair at the right of the hearth . Another besides Sabina came and went about the room or sat at the fire . This was Patty who , being eight years younger than Sabina , was now sixteen years old . Since Sabina had come back home the sisters would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their ways of being . Except that the older girl was more firm and hearty , there was scarcely a trace of difference between them . Soft gold-red hair clung to the head in a silken cap . A light curl played here and there at the fine mesh that came to an end at the nape of the neck in a sharp point that quivered with the turn of the head , as if life itself there cast up a fin or a wing . Sabina 's skin was fine-grained and cool , and Patty 's was the same . The old man still slept . Patty found herself a chair and brought it to the right of the hearth . The coal melted above the flame of the sticks and made a soft gray smoke that went as a cloud up the chimney . Sabina was speaking happily : " Gone to town to work near eight months in a eat-place , and you 'd think I 'd be different . I felt no different , seems , while I was there , what time I felt any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Strange people to feed every day , and they 're always on the way somewhere , hurried and dissatisfied . Coffee poured out of a spout when you turn a crank . And do the same thing every day , over and over . They come in or they go out . They talk about what they care little about . . . . " " Is how you look to some other the same as the way you feel ? " Patty asked . She had brought a small mirror to the fireside and she began to study her face as it appeared in the glass . " How I look to what other ? " Sabina asked . She caught the mirror into her hand and looked from her image to her sister 's face , forth and back , in a slight flutter of distress and delight . " How you look to Luke Shaw , " Patty said , " or any other you might name . " " Luke Shaw will do to say it with . feel no different in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth dents in at the corners , and mine dents too in the same fashion . " They passed the glass back and forth between them . " The way your eyes are , what are they the color of ? " Patty asked . She looked at her own eyes to try to find the answer before she gave the glass to the other . Given the mirror at length , Sabina studied her own face again . " My eyes are the color of a little puddle of water in the pasture down against the far Inn where the shade always is . After a rain you 'll see the sky as dark blue in this puddle underneath some sticks and little dry /eaves that make waxen lines as they go by . " " Sabina , what a way to say it My eyes are that kind , but mine have got a little bloodshot place in one corner where I cried last night because it began to snow for Christmas . " " I ought to look different , seems , " Sabina said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I did when I was sixteen . The day I turned eighteen I felt older and stranger . And so staggered inside I could hardly get a clear breath of air . But I forgot about it while I slept through the night , and two days after I remembered I had n't recalled I was eighteen the whole endurentime . Then I tried to feel old and tried to feel staggered again , but I could n't . All the balance of a week I tried , but finally I forgot to try any more , and here I am , the same . " " Pass me the glass again , Sabina . I want to see has the little bloodshot place gone from my eye . " " It 's a curious thing how one that 's younger catches up with the older one . The more we seem to be just alike the more I try to go inside myself and find a difference . I 'm not Patty inside myself because I can remember a longer piece back and can recall more . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when our mother and father were alive , and how we used to have apples off the old snag tree that 's blown down , but had then a fine shape and taller than the cowshed . " " I ca n't recall a word of what you tell . " " But even that wo n't make us very different , or any different whatever . " Uncle Tim roused from sleeping . He leaned over the fire to shake down the dry ashes in the grate , and when this was performed he said : " There are two great mysteries . There is the mystery of a beast and again there 's the mystery of mankind . " " Did you dream what you say to be true while you went to sleep just now or did you know it before ? " Sabina asked . " I knew it from the time I was knee high . But I only said it now . There is the mystery of mankind and another mystery of the beasts . " " Do n't forget to remind us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow . A little brandy in the sauce because Christmas is come . " The old man looked toward Patty and smiled from thin lips and ruddy fire-burnt cheeks . The smile seemed to pass upward along his thin nose and enter his veiled eyes . The lids closed upon it and he slept again . " The way I look is the same as you look , " Patty said , " except one thing . You are a little bigger . Your mouth dents like mine , but the dents are a small so-and-so larger . Give me the glass . " " Look then and see has your mouth got a little turn in the middle of the lower lip , and see has your chin turned back to bend under your jaw after it leaves off at the dimpled place , and see if your nose is pressed in away from a point , and the eyebrows a little longer on one side . . . . " " Oh , the mirror is talken to me ! " Patty cried out . " Words say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabina ? Did you say or did the glass say ? Take it away . I am afeared of a glass that can talk . " She had flung the glass from her . It fell at Sabiva 's feet and lay unbroken against the hem of her dress . They laughed at the talking mirror , and they turned from the fire to Look from the window at the small flakes of snow that fell as drops of frost out of the sky . The snow spread level over the lane before the house where no track of man or beast had left a print . The barn lay west of the house and , like the house , faced the lane . There were two rooms to the house . These stood side by side , and each fronted on the small porch . One was known as the " west room " and the other as the kitchen . From his seat before the fire Uncle Tim could look through a window beside the chimney and see the shelters where the beasts were housed . In bad weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . He slept here many hours , but at nightfall he would take off a part of his clothing , and sleep again in a small bed at the back of the room . Sabina and Patty would tell him things they wanted remembered . He would often forget these matters , but they would bring the wanted thing to light in their effort to make him recall it . In the working season he would wake from his sleep and go out to the barn and the fields . Then he would work as if he were a young man , plowing his few rolling acres that lay at the foot of the high knob lands . He had been sleeping by the fire now the greater part of a month . Besides the bed in which he sleptanother , a fine bed , stood in the far right-hand corner of the room , near the outer door . It was dressed up with plump pillows and a bedspread of heavy crochet lace , and was offered to any who came as company . Sabina and Patty slept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended between the walls of the two lower rooms . Sabina and Patty would tend the barnyard animals each night and morning . One of them would milk the cow and the other would make ready food for the hogs and the sheep . The old plow horse would be given his measure of grain and hay . When they had dug potatoes or cabbage from the mound in the garden and brought coal and wood to the kitchen and the hearth their work would be done . Then they would prepare the vegetables to cook , or they would make butter from the cream , or carry pans of bread to the hearth where Uncle Tim slept and raise them there , all these matters being too light and pleasant to afflict them as labor . Sabina brought corn to the fireside to break the grains from the cob , food for the hens . She was pleased to be like Patty and glad that she had not been changed by her season in the town . " It 's curious now , " she said , laughing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be like some other kind you ca n't name or say . " Patty drew her chair near to the pan that held the corn and began to do her share of the labor . " If Hallie May could come to pass Christmas with us , like we planned , " she said , " we would n't seem so much alike . Whilst we sit here your hand goes into the corn pan , and then mine goes , and I take out an ear , and then you , kind for kind , alike . Or I think a thought and you think the same , and Uncle Tim sleeps the same , on and on , or he wakes up and looks out at the weather . " " If HaIlie May could ' a ' come she would ' a ' slept down here in the bed for company , with you , and I 'd go up to the loft , the same as always . Then of a morning , when I came down stairs , you 'd wake when I clattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'd all get up with a big laugh , Christmas not being anyhow the same as any common time . " " What was it made you come back ? Remember how you went away to make a heap of money while you worked for Jake Brown 's cousin that wanted a good stout girl to wait table in his hotel ? " " It was n't a hotel , Patty . It was a place called ' Eat . ' A hotel is different . A hotel is a place where you sleep . " " Tell the truth about why you came back home . I never did quite take the cause you gave for the reason why you came . Went to stay a year or always and came back home before the year was done . " " I came because home is a fine place to be in , " Sabina answered . " I just love home . Home is so pleasant . " Uncle Tim waked suddenly and shifted his body to turn his other cheek toward the fire . He spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked : " What was it we told you to remember , Uncle Tim ? " " I disremember , " he said . He looked from the window to the little brown clock and down toward his quivering knees , as if he were trying to think what the matter had been . " Was it what time Old Nan would be fresh ? I hardly think so because I 've got the date set down on the calendar . " " Has the old sheep lambed ? " he asked . " How could she , Uncle Tim ? Here it 's only December and she 's due in January the last . " " I did n't recall it was December , " Uncle Tim said . " Has Sabina come back from the city ? " " She came three weeks ago and more . " " Did she bring back a whole handful of money , riches ? " " I made money , paid into my hand every Monday , but it took all I made to pay for what was wanted . " Sabina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking his head from side to side . " Has Christmas come yet then ? I do n't recall . " " Christmas comes to-mon-ow in the morning , " Patty answered him . " We 're sorry it snowed and made pneumonia weather because Hallic May promised to pass Christmas with us . Now she wo n't come because the wet snow , it 'll make the lane so heavy she could n't get by on a horse even and would sink in the dirt up to the horse 's knees . A lady could n't come here and the weather like this . It 's Christmas though . " Uncle Tim sat forward , a hand on each knee , his thin face turned a little to one side as if he were listening . Iron-gray hair stood over his head in a shock that was thinned only near the crown . He began to speak . " Christmas night , and it 's said magical things come to pass . Nobody ever goes out to look , it 's said ; but iffen you did you 'd see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody that a little while ago , but I ca n't remember who ' t was . It 's said strange things happen . " " Was it Luke Shaw you told ? He 's the only one that 's been here except Julie and Jake Brown , and you would n't hardly speak of a strange thing to them , they 're so dried up and settled . " " It might ' a ' been Luke Shaw I told . It 's said your own beast in your own barn will oftentimes kneel down on her knees at midnight . It 's said your horse or your sheep might kneel too . All kinds kneel . But it 's said your cow or your sheep do for certain . Midnight is the time for't . Exactly at midnight rooster-crow , and you 'll see your cow or your sheep kneel down . " " Not old Nan , our own cow . " Sabina spoke out sharply . " Not simple old Nan surely . " " Same as any other . " " You like to hear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't like to hear about one that comes close at hand . Seems then as if it might do you harm . I would n't want to have old Nan kneel down midnight of a Christmas . I do n't think I could drink the milk thereafter . " " What did Luke Shaw say to what you told ? " Sabina asked . " He said he did n't think he had a cow or a sheep brute with religion enough to kneel down , like I said . " " If old Nan kneels though I 'd want to know about it . " Patty began to shell the corn again . " Or if the sheep nannies or the old rain . I do n't think I 'd mind to drink the milk from the cow neither . " " I do n't think I would . " Sabina spoke to argue with herself . " Once Christmas gets by you do n't remember it so sharp . " She was thinking of the small cup of milk that was old Nan 's scanty yield now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that two months would pass before the coming of the young would replenish the flow into her metal cup at milking time . " Having told all that he knew of the legend of the kneeling beasts , Uncle Tim had fallen asleep . The day turned to a long slow dusk soon after two o'clock . Sabina was speaking : " Home is pleasanter . But I like for somebody to come for Christmas and for the snow to ease . Summer , and all the girls on creek down the valley come here , with the boys , to play and run in the pasture down toward the woods where the trees are thick and a girl can hide till a boy finds her . " " Who came here last ? " Patty asked . " Who ? It was Luke Shaw . Came when Uncle Tim sold the hogs . " " It was n't Luke . It was Julie and Jake came last . Came Sunday near a week ago . Say what made you forget Julie and Jake . " " It 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other a smart while . " " It 's because you remember Luke in a better way . A girl remembers a boy longer . " " For sixteen you are smart , Patty . Maybe you can remember somebody that came seventeen Sundays ago , or more , and remember exactly how many Sundays ' t was . " Patty laughed , looking past Sabina toward the fire . " What is it makes Luke Shaw seem bashful of a woman ? " she asked . He comes here to buy this or thathead of stock from Uncle Tim and he sits by the fire hardly able to say what price cattle is if we come inside the door . Uncle Tim asked him one day what made him so bashful and he blew his breath in and out like our old buck sheep in October , so staggered he could n't answer . " " It 's because Luke Shaw is so curly-headed . Curly-headed men are always bashful . Always ready to hide their faces and get red in the face . " Sabina turned from the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile that always came to her lips with the speaking of this one 's name . " But you recollect the time last winter when we went to see his mother , Miss Nannie Shaw , and how he worked in the barn and would n't come anear the house until we almost had old Penn hitched up to leave ? Then he came , redfaced and pert and fresh , and he hitched the rest of old Penn up , and twisted the traces so 's we had to get out on the road and put the harness to rights . " " Luke Shaw is right full of fun . " " I believe you like to say his name , Sabina . You say it when ' he ' or ' himself ' or the like would do . " " All men are bashful , " Sabina said , after she had considered . Patty 's last speech , although she did not reply to it . " It 's not my belief Luke Shaw is bashful beyond nature . " " He 's no more bashful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not bashful worth a cent unless I 'm in a strange place . It 's my belief he 's in love somewhere . " " Oh , could he be ? Sippie Peek , do you think ? " " He 'd be a very good kind , in love , I mean . He 'd be kind-hearted and equal to our old buck sheep for the strength in the way he 'd be . But he 'd be good and careful enough on a farm , and work enough but not too much so 's he 'd be all in a hard string by the time he 's thirty . Come to study it out , he 's bashful only when he 's around yourself . Think back and see if that 's not so . " " I ca n't think , " Sabina said . " If he went with Sippie Peek and joined up with all that Peek trash he 'd go across the ridge to live . It makes me sick inside to think so . He 's too good for that Peek trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the bone . " " But say again what made you come home . I never was satisfied you came home for what you said was the reason . " Sabina looked toward the window . Her eyes swept the long line of the Knobs that stretched dimly now through the mists of snow , as a wall of white and gray lifting and falling in the blue of the sky where the clouds had thinned , toward the south . The familiar shapes came , as clear-cut , in the unfamiliar vista of snow . " I came to see Luke Shaw again , is why I came , " she said . " Like a girl hardly yet fifteen I wanted to gaze at his face , even if he never knew . Nobody I saw where I went was so hearty with life or so ready in fun . " " Would n't that be a bold reason to come back nearly ninety miles and give up a good job that paid you cash money ? Would n't it be bold ? " Was it bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ? she asked . She had waited in the garden , digging the turnips , until he found her there . Uncle Tim waked and shifted in his chair . A slow smile began to bend down his thin cheeks and to plait the corners of his mouth where tobacco stains ran among minute wrinkles . He stood up and turned twice about on the hearthrug . His feet were bare . Thin toes clung to the braids of the rug and grasped the warmth of the soft old strips of rag . He spoke as if he had not ceased to speak , as if he had not slept the half-hour away . " The moon stands past the full and hit 'll set toward midnight . Rooster-crow then , and all the cattle and sheep get up offen their beds where they slept and stand still whilst the rooster crows for the end of the other day . Third rooster-crow and all kneel down on their knees . I never saw this sight for myself , but I heard it for true . Twice or three times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth-tellen nature . " " Did you recollect what we told you to remember ? " Patty asked . " I disremember now . Did you feed the little brown cow and the nag ? " All would be remembered with hearty feedings , Patty said . " The beasts kneel down , " he replied to her , " kneel down before the son of mankind and that 's what makes Christmas . " The dusk was falling darkly although the clock on the mantel marked but four o'clock . In the kitchen Patty stirred together the little plum cake and set it to bake in the oven . " From the wild-goose tree , " Sabina said as she passed , naming the plums from their odor , and Patty said she liked the sauce to be brown and spiced with nutmeg . Sabina put on the heavy shoes that Uncle Tim wore when he went outside . Then she tied a cloth over her head and drew a cloak over her shoulders , and when she had swept the light snow from the porch she lighted a lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn the hens were huddled sullenly , waiting for their food . They ate the corn Sabina had brought them , and after their swift feeding they climbed to the top of an old manger and prepared to roost there , as if they found the low foothold more comfortable than the high perches in the henhouse . Sabina gave the cow a large armful of hay . Then she drew the milk from the cow into the cup she had brought and , stooping beside the beast to draw the milk , she wondered about the holy season and wondered why the time seemed different from any other time . While the thin stream of milk tinkled into the cup she had a sense of all as being different from the common occurrence , as if the stream itself knew that the white foam in the top of the cup and the warm fluid underneath would stand all night expectantly and be drunk the next morning . When she had finished these tasks she knotted the cloth more securely about her head and prepared to walk back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackness overhead and it danced a brief fantastic dance in the light from the west-room window . The dance having passed beyond the beam , the snow fell to the ground straightway and made a deep white fluff over the path and reached darkly off into all the unseen fields . Walking along the path with the cup of milk , Sabina heard the barking of many dogs far away to the east and the north . She stopped in the path to listen , thinking that all the hounds of the ridge must be loosed . The barking and yelping of the dogs rolled in a hollow shrill complaint , far away , but incessantly going , a hound and then another , crying a high-pitched cry of anger and searching , and all the plaints fitted together to make a continuous cry . " Why would n't Tobin and Brown , over on the ridge , why would n't they keep their dogs close to-night ? " she asked listening . The hounds were running a mile away but the sound came as near with the north wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure . She looked to the safety of their two ewes and the old ram , and she found them huddled together near the inner wall that divided the cow 's shed from the place where the wagon was kept . When the cow had eaten the last of her hay she went slowly to the place where the sheep were and stood against the inner wall as if she found warmth for herself in the brown boards . Sabina lifted the lantern high and looked about over the huddled animals . The hens and the cock were perched on the rim of the manger , sitting close together . The horse had lain down in his stall . Overhead on the rafters a few pigeons stirred softly and cooed a low gentle complaint at the frozen fields and the north wind that would search into their feathers and find their soft shrinking skin . Sabina left them when she had given the old ram one more bite of hay . All together the beasts made a gentle warmth inside the barn , with their breathing and the odorous warmth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewheres , " she said above the drowsy animals , as if she asked them to help her to find it . The cow moved nearer to the ram and when she withdrew the lantern she left them standing close together in the hay . She knew that presently they would lie down there and sleep . The pin lay on the brown scantling beside the door . It seemed evil to lock the creatures in with the fastened door , but outside the dogs were howling and running as if they ran a great course across the entire world . Sabina slipped the wooden pin through the large link of iron and bound the door fast to the doorframe . Then she went back over the path to the house , and the way was now but a vague hollow in the increasing level of the snow . At the kitchen door she shook the snow from her clothing and stamped her feet . Her hands were red and cold . " Oh , it 's good inside a house , " she said to Patty . The inside warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to her limbs and her dress . " Oh , it 's good in a house . Who first made a house for a man to go into ? " " Oh , who did ? " Patty asked . " What a thing to ask ! But now you think to ask it , I ask the same . " " Made a house for a man , but made a stable for the beasts . It 's a thing to think about . " " And made a house for a man to get horned in , but a stable for the brutes . Or out doors altogether . " " Oh , it 's cold out there . When the snow eases it 'll be cold far beyond frost . Not even old Nan 's teats could warm my hands ; they were so cold while I milked . It 's good inside a house . " Patty was taking the milk from her hand . She looked into the small cup , a quart measure , from which arose a warm odor like that from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ear . " Did you think the milk would talk or say some word ? " Sabina asked . " I do n't know . I wanted to listen . It has a sound of wind over a hayfield . Where , Sabina , is the little brown crock ? " The plum cake stood , turned from its pan , to cool on the table . A plucked fowl beside it waited for the morrow 's cooking . It was cold in the kitchen and they hurried the dishes into the press and went swiftly to the other room where the great fire burned , Making preparations for Christmas , Patty brought coal and wood to the fireside . She said that she had decided to wash her body and make herself entirely clean , and for this she brought a large teakettle of water and set it near the embers where it soon began to boil . Uncle Tim waked with the clattering of the kettle and he asked : " Had n't I better , Sabina and Patty , go out now and feed ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Tim knows everything , even when he 's asleep , and knows if we feed three cars or four or not any . " The old man stretched his limbs as if he meant to keep awake for a while , but he turned slowly from the fire and closed his eyes , smiling faintly . Patty brought a white china basin to the hearth and into this she poured some of the water . Then she took off all of her clothing and began to bathe her flesh , first an arm and then the other , and while she washed herself she talked to Sabina . " I 'm fairly of a mind to go out to the barn at midnight and see what the sheep and old Nan might do . " " I am of a mind to go too , " Sabina said . " I never once suspicioned old Nan might know when Christmas comes and kneel down . I left her ready to sleep , close to the buck sheep and the two nannies . Uncle Tim is a joker sometimes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself but believed in a firm way , no matter . Your body is just like mine , but once you used to be little and I could stand you up in a bowl and wash you . " " I 'm glad I 'm grown and like you . But there are a heap of things in life , and out of it , you never test out for yourself , but believe all the time . " " The hounds are in a mean way off on the ridge . T fastened the barn tight with the wooden pin . " " You shut Christmas inside the barn and bolted shut the door . " Patty laughedand began to wash her neck and her breast . " Sippy is a bold girl with big bold eyes . I 'm sad to think Luke Shaw might now be at her place . " Sabina leaned back in her chair to say this and folded her hands . " When he came here Iast , before he went to the garden where you dug the turnips , I said a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say to Luke about that ? " " I talked to him a considerable long while . I said , ' A person goes , when Christmas comes , to the place he most wants to be , ' and he said it was as true as truth itself , a person did so if he mortally could . " Having said this , Patty dipped her foot in the water and rubbed her thigh with the soapy cloth , covering her skin with the fine sweet lather , " When I get through there 's plenty of hot water and you could wash yourself too . It makes you feel kind of drunk to wash all over at once . I wonder could we wake up at near twelve o'clock and go out to the barn . I could have the lantern ready . " " We could set the alarm in the old clock to go off with a little sputter at a time near to twelve , " Sabina answered . " Not enough to wake Uncle Tim . Just one little sputter , and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wash myself all over . And we 'll comb our hair and put on all clean clothes . Then we 'll lay down to sleep in the spare bed and have a night before midnight , and get up when the clock makes a little sound . " While Sabina bathed herself the dark had become dense outside . The water spread over her entire body , she rubbed the lather to a froth and washed it away , and when she had rubbed herself with a towel she stood up faintly drunk with pleasure . Patty brought the lantern and tended it carefully . Then Sabina waked Uncle Tim and told him it was time to sleep in the bed . She brought an earthen jug of hard cider to set on the hearth so that it would be warm and mellow for drinking on Christmas morning . With Patty , she made up the bed for company with clean covers and lay down to sleep , thus honoring themselves and the night . " I feel all in a flutter in my skin and drowsy in my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the covers . " The clean bed and the way I washed my skin all over go to my head and make me seem ready to laugh , but on the way to sleep . " And Sabina : " I feel the same like you describe , ready to laugh and all in a flutter in my skin . Now I 'm half asleep I can hardly tell which is Patty and which Sabina or where Sabina leaves off and Patty begins . But I 've got Luke Shaw in my own self , and there I 'm myself and not any other . " " It is pleasant , " Patty said , " but outside are the hounds . Oh , hear how they scream under the bark as they go . But some of it is the wind against the three scraggly cedars maybe . " " They are a mean set , to pleasure themselves on the hurt of a sheep . " " It 's a strange world where such is the way things use . I can hear the dogs come nearer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geese , and the hounds kill the foxes . " " Then people , they kill all kinds , and even the fruit and the kinds that grow in the garden . I once , not a long piece of a while ago , had a sudden sight of a thing while I stuck a knife into a turnip . " " It was the same as if you killed the turnip with your hand . Or when you shell peas out of a pod they look at you and grin sometimes . Or say , ' These are my insides that are on the way to make more little pea vines , and you eat all down inside your big gizzard . ' " " But mankind is the only one that wars on his own kind . That 's a thing to think about surely . " " Drives his own sort away and hunts his own down off the face of the earth . Does he , Sabina ? " " Mankind does . The mankind is the only sort that so uses his own . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day after day it told about such . " " Why then would a beast kneel down to his religion if that 's the way mankind uses ? " Sabina could not answer . The dogs were running hard again , among all the fields . They swept over Uncle Tim 's hayfield and leaped the fence to howl in their flight across the snowy stubble where the corn had been . The small brown clock on the mantel began to strike in a faint metallic beat , the hammer pulsing lightly on the cracked metal , Six faintly tinkled notes fell . It had been dark since five . Patty was asleep . The alarm clock ticked in low swift rhythm . The dogs were leaving the field and were set toward the high ridge behind the house , as if they had left the sheep and gone after the foxes . They would run less swiftly through the brush and leap over the dewberry briars , and howl at the tangled ravines where the fallen trees lapped and twisted together among the deep ( hilts of snow and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift hounds were running down the world . They were begging for pity . They were wanting the sheep and the foxes that ran ahead of them through the clods and dust of a torn field . The mouths of the hounds were open to cry their wrongs , to whimper for pity and anger at the fox that would not be caught . War roared across the world . Men in thousands were made to run from land to land , and no place was left for them to be . The world was twisted and turned about , pity turning about to devour anger , and fear ran swiftly on the track of courage to devour courage in its frenzied jaw . When the swift procession had passed the warmth of her own being folded over her and she fell into a deep sleep . A little flutter of sound from the clock waked her . The hands marked the hour as twenty-five minutes before twelve . Sabina called Patty and they arose and put on their clothes swiftly . Patty stirred the fire to a fine blaze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each one wanting to be the first ready . Patty lighted the lantern with a splinter from the wood on the hearth . They wrapped shawls about their heads and drew heavy coats over their shoulders . Then they opened the door of the room and went to the porch outside . The clouds had parted and the snow had ceased to fall . The light of the setting moon fell as a red glow over the white fields . About the house the snow was trampled , as if the dogs had been running near to the house not long since . A faint flow of sound came from the barn , where the setting moon thrust a dense shadow , a sound like the whisper made by the moving limbs or wings of beasts and fowls . The cock crowed once , a weak fluting of chilled and muffled sound . Then Sabina saw that some living creature was crouched beside the doorstep . She went down the two low steps and stood , calling for the lantern , calling Patty to see . A form lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew more nearly to the wall as if it would hide more deeply there . " There is snow on its face and blood , " Patty called out . " Blood on its coat . Call to it , " Sabina leaned near to Patty and whispered . " Who is it ? " Party cried out . " Who are you ? Is she hurt ? " They were asking . " It is not a woman person . It 's a child . It has got on a light coat . " Sabina reached fearfully toward the creature and laid a hand upon it and she brushed aside the snow . It was a crouching animal . Her fingers were entangled in cold damp wool . Patty held the lantern closer and they saw the torn flesh of a sheep and saw blood dripping freshly from a wound . " What sheep is it ? " Patty asked . " It is one tormented by the dogs . It is hurt but not dead . " " She is a young ewe , hardly past the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dogs have bit her on the neck and have run her most to death . " The ewe was passive and trembling . Sabina drew it from the ground and MAGAZINE made it stand . Then Patty caught at the head and guided it up the steps . They brought her into the house and led her to the corner to the right of the fireplace where she sank swiftly down . Sabina renewed the fire and she brought a torn cloth with which to bind up the bleeding neck , but she did not know how to make use of the cloth , and so the beast lay . The head was small and the face was dark and without wool . A coat of wool lay over the creature 's back like a cloak that had been put on for a cold season . Legs that were bare of wool and dark-skinned , like the face , lay out from beneath the creature 's trunk . The wool was soft and fine ; for the beast , being very young , had never been shorn and still wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I ca n't give up yet it is a woman or a child . I got such a mortal shock to see it in the snow and see it look human . " " It is a pretty sheep . " " What can we do ? " " Oh , it is stretched out to die . It cries like a child in a terrible pain . " The ewe lay on its side , stretched out , limp and bent with pain . It cried in long wailing bleats . Then it began to pant heavily and to shake , as if a spasm were upon it , and it gave birth to a small lamb . The newborn beast was no larger than a month-old kitten , but was alive . The mother curled slightly to include the little one between her stiffened limbs and lay in a swoon as if she were near to death . " What can we do now ? " Sabina asked herself and asked Patty . " Oh , what can we do ? The mother is like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat heavily outside , as if a man were coming through the snow . The feet stamped at the door and then a slow , gentle knock sounded , to make it known that some one asked politely to be let in . Patty went to the door and when she had opened it a little way Sabina saw that Luke Shaw stood outside . He was laughing . His face was ruddy in the light of the lantern and the fire . Small spirals of dark-brown hair stood over his head as a close hood . His eyes were shining with their own brightness and with the cold . " I said , ' I see a light . ' Reason why I came , " he said . " Oh , come inside , " Patty said . She was drawing him inside the door . " Oh , look , Lukc , at what is here on the floor , and just now got born a little lamb . The mother is about to die . Come in and help us . " Sabina began to tremble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She caught her breath in deep panting sobs , like those of the bearing sheep , and she pointed to the young ewe where it lay in the space beside the hearth . " Oh , she will die . We must hurry and do . . . . " Sabina turned toward the sheep . Shaw leaned over the beast which was stretched out limply now as if it would yield up life altogether . " How did she get inside a man 's house ? . ? . A hot drink . Give me quick a little of whatever is in the jug . A hot mash of meal would be good . . . . " Shaw began to work with the ewe . They leaned over the sheep . Sabina laid the lamb on a cushion near the fire . Then she made steady the creature 's head and Shaw poured the drink into her mouth and rubbed gently on her lifted throat . Patty went away to get the meal and she mixed it with a little of the water from the kettle on the hearth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt together beside the animal . " Oh , do n't let it die , " Sabina whispered . " Oh , I am afraid it will . What can we do . Give it a little more of the drink . " " Get the cup . " They called orders to each other and leaned together above the suffering beast , pleading with each other that it might not die . " She is better , " Shaw said at last . " See how she makes herself ready to rest . Not stretched out like a thing dead or ready to die . Site 's laid down like a sheep will . She 's on the way back to life . Let her ease herself and rest a little . " " The little one might not have any milk until to-morrow . I wish it could have a little drink now before day . " " Lay the lamb close beside . . . here , close beside the ewe . She might come around faster with the lamb against her side . " Shaw took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . " She might get it some milk if she feels it against her side . " Sabina looked across at Patty who , like herself , knelt above the suffering sheep . The face was lowered to the infant lamb , as her own had lately been . Compassion bore downward on the cheeks and made firm the softly flowing mouth . In the minor of Patty she saw herself as she looked kneeling beside the faint ewe . The face was pale in the after-midnight hour of broken sleep , but the cheeks and the mouth were red from the hours spent each day outside in the glow of the cold . Herself in Patty laid a gentle hand on the ewe 's thigh and bent the lamb a little nearer to enfold the small newborn . Her hand , Patty 's hand , swayed over the lamb and met its minute bleating to draw the small head nearer to the mother 's udders . The little one lifted its face and groped toward the mother odor that spread near . " The milk is running out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few drops are already come " ? herself in Patty speaking . " See , " she said , " Oh , see , Luke Shaw , there will be milk . " " What sheep is it ? " Patty asked . " Reason why I came , " Shaw said , " is , I saw a light . . . . " Uncle Tim was awake . He arose to sit in his bed and he looked about smiling , but when he saw the sheep and the lamb in the corner he shook his head as if he had not remembered aright , but he smiled again . Outside a horn was calling the dogs . Their cries now were but the answering notes that followed the command of the horn . Shaw looked past the mirror of Patty and looked straight toward herself . " I saw a light and I said , ' Sabina is not asleep , I know . I 'll go where Sabina is . ' Is why I came to Uncle Tim 's door . Out with Tobin and Brown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' is not asleep . I 'll go , ' I said , ' to be where Sabina is. ' "
