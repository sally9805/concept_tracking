In a field near Eesen , Belgium , fortnight ago a peasant looked up from his spring radishes to see the Imperial Airways liner City of Liverpool suddenly burst into flames and crash like a meteor in a field , twelve passengers and the crew of three dying instantly ( TIME , April 3 ) . <P> <P> One of the passengers was a Dr. Albert Voss , dentist , of Manchester . At a coroner 's inquest into his death last week , the story of the disaster became stranger than ever . The body of Dr. Voss was picked up nearly two miles from the wreckage of the plane . It was not burned . Evidence seemed to show that Dr. Voss jumped from the plane . Though his 16-year-old niece Lottie was one of the killed passengers , there was a possibility that he might have set the plane afire . <P> Coroner A. H. Flint called as his first witness Dr. Voss 's eldest son , Hugo , who testified that though his father did smoke occasionally he never carried a pocket lighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Coroner Flint , " that your father deliberately or accidentally set fire to the liner , by which 14 people were roasted to death ? " <P> Answered Hugo Voss : " I am convinced he was incapable of doing such a dastardly thing . " <P> Without comment Coroner Flint called the next witness , a lawyer representing Hugo Voss 's estranged brother Albert Jr. , who told a story that set.every neck a-crane in the little courtroom : <P> Dr. Voss and his partner L. 0 . Dearden , another victim of the crash , were not only dentists but dope smugglers . Working with a former Air Force Officer named Pleass they would take frequent trips from the continent by air , drop packages of dope attached to tiny silk parachutes from the plane windows at pre-arranged spots . According to this story they knew that they were to be arrested when the City of Liverpool landed . Dr. Voss set fire to the plane , cremating his partner and his niece , and jumped on the 1,000-to-1 chance that he might escape with his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
