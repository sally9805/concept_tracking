The finest attack of nervous indigestion in all Europe descended last week upon the lean Roman abdomen of Baron Pompeo Aloisi . This hawk-eyed , hollow-cheeked diplomat who since 1932 has served Italy as chief delegate to the League of Nations , found himself rudely summoned from his Geneva apartment , plumped down in a small private dining room before a table full of Swiss food , and talked to , straight from the shoulder , by two nervous , irritable statesmen whose friendship he valued , whose ability he recognized , whose view point he could understand . It was a dreadful meal . The soup got cold , the champagne warm , the roast greasy . Every few minutes the three diners rose from the table to telephone Rome , London or Paris . Between times they kept looking at their watches . <P> Across the table from Baron Aloisi were immaculate Capt . Anthony Eden , white hope of the British Foreign Office , and swart Pierre Laval , Foreign Minister of France . Britain 's Lord Privy Seal , normally the most suave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word had come from London that important Cabinet changes were imminent ( see p. 19 ) . With luck , within a fortnight , Captain Eden might find himself Foreign Minister of Great Britain . Minister Laval had scarcely had a good night 's sleep for a month . The clatter of railway wheels rang ceaselessly in his ears . He had just traveled from Paris to Warsaw , to Moscow , back to Warsaw and Cracow for the funeral of Marshal Pilsudski , through Berlin back to Paris and now to Geneva . The French franc , the French Government , Laval 's political future were trembling in the balance ( see p. 19 ) . Yet he desired nothing so much at the moment as 24 hours in bed . <P> Because the three statesmen had been through so many diplomatic campaigns together , Messrs . Eden and Laval wasted few words . Over the consomme , they talked hard &; fast . Italy was determined to test her new army by a military campaign in Abyssinia . In normal times London and Paris would have no objection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Britain to have Italy , instead of Japan , gain the upper hand in Africa 's last independent empire . But these were not normal times . Abyssinia has been a member of the League of Nations in good standing since 1923 . In addition , curly-bearded Emperor Haile Selassie was daily proving a shrewder diplomat than anyone had suspected . He had appealed officially to the League of Nations and raised a whirlwind of sentimental sympathy throughout Europe . <P> Granted , now that they were around one small table , that the League was a feeble crutch at best , nevertheless , if Italy refused to arbitrate her border differences with Abyssinia , much more than this particular crisis was at stake . If Abyssinia 's appeal should be dragged into the open League forum and if Italy still refused to arbitrate , the same thing would happen that had happened in the case of Japan and Germany . It would turn into a squabble of Italy against the entire League and probably force Italy to withdraw from the League . With the Danubian conference in the offing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Britain and France could not afford to lose Italy from the League . Italy . Capt . Eden and Minister Laval chorused , must accept arbitration . Baron Aloisi got up from the table to telephone his boss in Rome .
