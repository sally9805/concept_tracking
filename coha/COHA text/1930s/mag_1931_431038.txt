 | I FIRST heard of Carrie Chapman Catt ' way back in Indiana . We talked of her at school , in those long discussions college girls have , which seem so youthful , so useless , but which actually ? twenty years later ? have changed the course of the world . We all believed in woman 's suffrage . Some of us even believed that a woman had a right to ambition , to a " career " ; that instead of teaching school or music in a lady-like way until " the right man " came along ? or did not ? that a woman might start out to make something of herself exactly as a man did . Once a girl even came to our town and entered medical school , but even the most advanced of us felt that that was going a little too far . It was all theory with us , however , not passionate conviction . We had never come in contact with life as an opposing force . We had never found ourselves stopped by a stone wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not for us were the restrictions and the taboos that had restricted our mothers and our grandmothers . Time had worn down the walls until we could see over them . Once out of college we were going out into the world and make our way . Only , as yet , we did not quite know what we wanted to do , where we wanted to go . We had all been brought up in the notion that we were " ladies . " As for the thousands of women forced by dire necessity to ignore caste and work in factories , they were in a world apart . We knew they existed , but none of us had ever seen one . It never occurred to us that perhaps our first duty was to them , rather than to ourselves . And then I came to New York City . And one night I stood on the steps of the great Public Library at Forty-Second Street and Fifth Avenue and watched a suffrage parade . Women ? young , old ? in spotless white , in shabby black ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching in hope , marching in despair ? but marching together as women -- first of all , and last of all , as women ? united to free themselves forever from the stigma of sex . Hundreds and hundreds of them passed , stepping along eager and alert , plodding along in grim determination . I think it was the glowing orange lanterns they carried that seemed most poignant of all ? those shining lanterns , so gallant , so wistful , swung over the shoulders of women marching through the dark . They were such tiny lights in a world of black ? and yet they shone so bravely it broke my heart to see them . And right then I knew that never again would there be another suffrage parade without me , marching with my sisters , under the leadership of the woman who was devoting her life to this crusade of women ? for women ? Carrie Chapman Catt . Even in those days it took courage to march in a suffrage parade . The police did n't much care what happened , and hoodlums thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to shout insults and jeers . One girl , standing on a box to speak in Union Square one night , had the box kicked out from under her -- and was left to pick herself up and get herself home as best she might . A college gill I met later refused a prom invitation because she " had a date to go to Washington and get arrested . " She had volunteered to picket the I hite House , and she had learned by experience that that always meant a brief stay at the police station . Think what it must have meant to be a suffragist when Carrie Chapman Catt began ! In the days when one-piece bathing suits were unheard of , when women rode in trailing skirts , when every wife 's earnings , inheritance , and children were her husband 's , to be disposed of as he saw fit . As a matter of fact , Carrie Chapman Catt began to be the champion of her sex ? and struck the first blow for it ? back in the Sixties , when she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ripon , Wisconsin , it was , where the Republican Party was born , and where perhaps some spark of daring , of aspiration , still lingered in the air . A class was called upon to recite ? boys in longish trousers and giant-cornered collars , girls ? the tiniest of them ? in fitted basques and tilting skirts ? a dozen of them lined up with toes just touching a crack in the floor . Suddenly there was a rattle ? a clatter . Every one looked ? every boy laughed . Little Mary had lost her hoop skirt , and it lay about her feet as she blushed and burst into tears of confusion and injured modesty .  | The teacher dismissed the class and picked up little Mary , hoop skirt and all , and carried her out to the woodshed , where she repaired as well as she could the damage to costume and composure . But when she brought the child back to her seat , she was still confused ? and the boys were still amused . And all the other little girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their sex . After school little Mary started home , her little friend , Carrie Lane , close at her side . The boys began jeering , " Mary lost her hoop skirt , Mary lost her hoop skirt . " One boy ? the biggest boy ? followed them down the street . Little Mary was long ago in tears , but little Carrie turned around and faced the boy . She walked right up to him . And firmly , deliberately , and with righteous conviction , she struck him in the face . It was a lesson ? but the lesson did not last long . When spring came , the great annual sport of teasing the girls with snakes began . The school yard sloped down to a marshy spot , and there any industrious little boy could always find a little garter snake to scare the girls with . Recess became a nightmare of dangling snakes and running feet . One day even Carrie 's own older brother chased her with a snake ? chased her until her breath was gone and her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her seat after recess , she knew that he would do it again , and that something must be done . Before the afternoon was over , she had thought out what that thing must be , and after school she went down in the marsh , with her soul quailing within her , and hunted for a snake . She found one ? too soon for her inclination . But her resolution never failed . Setting her teeth , she sprang forward and put her foot on its head ? just as she had seen the boys do ? and then she took it up by the tip of its tail and held it , as the boys did . And miraculously it hung there , helpless . She had conquered herself ? and she had conquered the snake . She took it home with her ? the horrible , @#  | uncanny thing ? shrinking from it every step of the way , but never faltering . And she ran up to her brother and waved it at him and threatened to wrap it around his neck , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the big boy turned and ran ? and she ran after him . The annual snake chase ended in short season , that year . She was in college when she made her next protest against sex discrimination ? in Iowa State College , after teaching for a year at twenty dollars a month . She had had visions of what that money would buy , but when she found how little it was , she met the situation by washing dishes at nine cents an hour . And in spite of washing dishes and planning her course to finish in three years instead of the usual four , she still found time and spirit to wonder why , in this land-grant college where the boys were given military drill and a General of the United States Army was in residence for that purpose , no physical education was provided for the girls , no gymnasium work , no sports of any kind . She went to the General , who had two daughters of his own , and put the case to him , and he heartily agreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He volunteered to drill them three times a week , and to get broomsticks for them instead of the guns issued to the male students by the United States Government . They organized at once bought uniforms of dark blue percale , with loose bodices ? quite a departure in those days and long , full bloomers to their shoetops , over which they wore ? very discreetly ? long , full skirts of the same length . The first day , there was an audience out ; the next the audience was smaller . In time , drill was no novelty , and so popular was it that in a modified form ? and , heaven be praised ! with a change in costume ? it persisted almost until the time when World War made military training not a sport , but a life-anddeath necessity . After college , the young girl made another departure from the established custom and entered a lawyer 's office to read law . Somehow she managed to defy popular prejudice , for at the end of the year she was invited to become principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superintendent of schools . IN 1885 she married Leo Chapman , a young newspaper man , and went with him to San 1 Francisco , where he died the following year . Left widowed far from home , Carrie Chapman met for the first time a world in which women were not wanted ? a world in which women were treated as intruders . Those clays in San Francisco fired her once and for all with the determination to work forever to secure fair and square treatment for women ? and she decided , with that keen , clear intelligence which has characterized her from childhood , that the first step was to secure the vote for women . If women were treated as citizens in their own right , then recognition of every sort would naturally follow . The years have proved beyond a doubt the accuracy of her decision . Immediately she began to work for woman suffrage , and she had the advantage of meeting all the pioneers of the preceding generation ? Susan B. Anthony , Julia Ward Howe Lucy Stone , Amelia Bloomer . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking with her , gathering from her fine , uncompromising character courage for the future in which she would be the leader . In 189o , the year of her second marriage , to George William Catt , a civil engineer , she made what was probably the first outdoor speech ever made by a woman for suffrage . With Henry B. Blackwell , a fellow worker , she had gone to a little town in South Dakota to give a suffrage program , and found that through some misunderstanding no hall had been engaged . In an old-fashioned democrat @#  | wagon , with an old-fashioned dinner bell , the two suffrage workers and their host and hostess drove down to one of the town 's principal corners and rang the bell . A crowd gathered , and then speeches were made , and the speakers drove on ? most of the crowd following in high amazement at a sight never seen before ? a young woman and a white-haired old man standing up in the back seat of a carriage , making speeches , and actually advocating that women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the polls and vote like men . From this time on , Mrs. Catt 's work became more and more demanding . And not much easier for many years . In one town where she was domiciled in a private house , she returned after speaking at a Populist rally to find the door locked against her , and all the house in darkness . No answer was made to her modest but repeated knocks . The street was dark at ten o'clock and she was in a strange place . There was only one thing to do . She went to the house at which she was assigned to take her meals , roused the family , and asked if they would give her shelter for the night . Willingly they took her in , and the next day she returned to the barred house to collect her baggage . " Why did you lock your door against me ? " she asked the man of the house . " Because no one who speaks at a Populist rally is fit to sleep under my roof , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also spoken at the Republican and Democratic rallies . Useless to remind him that if women were too delicate , too relined , to be given the vote , they were also too delicate and refined to be locked out in a strange town at an hour when all good folk had gone to bed . The young wife collected her baggage and took the train ? with perhaps one more count added to her list of injustices against women as women . IN 1900 Carrie Chapman Catt was elected I president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association an office she still holds today , after 31 years . Not many people know that the National Woman Suffrage Association still exists , but in its life it acquired too much property , too many interests , to be disposed of in a day or so , or in a year or so . Gradually , the work of winding up its affairs goes on . Some day the organization which made a peaceful revolution , which freed several million political slaves , will be no more . In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked her way aibund the world , lecturing for it . She spoke for suffrage in every state in the Union , in every important country of Europe and Asia . On the steamships of three oceans she said her word ' for women . It is easy to find some one who will do the showy work of a campaign for some great public movement . It is easy to find some one to make the big platform appearances , to play-the role of spellbinder . But it is as hard as death to find some one to do the work behind the scenes ? the dull organization work , the planning , the unseen , unpaid , inglorious toil that only devotion beyond words can enliven with the glow of gladness . Not many people who heard Carrie Chapman Catt speak ? and realized the inspiration of her purpose , the force of her clear-cut arguments , the justice of her contentions , the brilliance of her intellect -- ever knew that in the days between those public appearances she was doing the work that made them possible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would make a superb life work for any woman . The record of her unseen work , at her desk day after day and night after night , is a total even more amazing . Suffrage would have come some clay , without Carrie Chapman Catt . It was on its way , even as world peace is on its way . But without her , when would it have come ? Perhaps not in your lifetime nor in mine . By her work she cut years from the waiting time .  | I never realized what a sacrifice Carrie Chapman Catt made , in giving up her life to work for women , until I met her in her beautiful home in New Rochelle , New York ? and saw how easily , how superbly , she could have spent her life as nothing more than a wife , and a home-maker . From its book-lined library opening out on green terraced lawns , to its blue and ivory drawing room , from the green Christmas tree standing stately outside the wide dining-room windows to the curving rose beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to the exquisite taste and skill of its charming mistress . And yet , even in her seventies , Carrie Chapman Catt is still working for women , still organizing , planning , speaking for them . Her work has broadened its scope , instead of narrowing it , to include the whole world . For the greatest thing in the world now is peace ? permanent peace . Every force of her brilliant mind is directed to that end , now that her first task is done . THERE must be something about self-forgetfulness that keeps a woman young . I looked . at Mrs. Catt in her soft blue dress , her eyes sparkling , her gestures firm and decisive , her voice with its measured enunciation and resonant ring that made her one of the most enthralling speakers women have ever produced , and I could not believe it possible that here was a woman who had known Lucy Stone , Susan B. Anthony . There was no date on her person , any more than there was a date on her personality ? and her thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fine thing to be seventy , " she told me . " To have a rich , broad , varied background which only the years can give . It makes life more colorful , more full of meaning . It gives significance and power to everything you do . " More power ? can we wish less than that to this woman who , more than any single influence , has brought freedom from sex to her sex ! Who , forty years ago , had the acumen to see that if women got the vote , all else would come to them , and who had the patience and the persistence and the inspired zeal to go on and on and on , working against discouragement and despair and even disrepute , winning a battle here , losing a battle there , but always going on . . . . until Time at last set an end to her labors and women were free to be women , even as men are free to be men . If it is given to any one human being to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapman Catt see the ending of her last and greatest battle in a world united for all time to come in eternal and everlasting peace ! It is a woman 's war against the kind of war men fight . When it is won , a woman will win it . Let us hope that that woman will be Carrie Chapman Catt , who for forty years has fought a good fight , has kept our faith .
