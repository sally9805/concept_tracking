txt The voters will decide in a referendum at the November election this Fall whether the city , as Mayor La Guardia desires , is to go into direct competition with privately owned utility companies by building a municipal power system . This was determined yesterday when the Board of Estimate by a vote of thirteen to three approved the Power Plant Referendum Bill which the Board of Aldermen passed last week by a forty-eight to one vote . Immediately after the vote the Mayor set the morning of Sept. 3 for a statutory public hearing on the referendum measure . After the hearing , it is understood , he will promptly sign the bill . An active campaign to assure approval of the power plant project , which calls for the construction of a power system capable of supplying a tenth of the city 's demands at a cost of from $45,000,000 to $49,500,000 will be carried on this Fall by the La Guardia administration . The Mayor has not yet announced that he will openly campaign for approval of his favorite measure , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Be Issue , Too . The power referendum and the amendment to the State Constitution abolishing needless county offices are both slated to receive the Mayor 's active support with the hope of rolling up large majorities for them . " I have two children I 've got to take care of , " said the Mayor yesterday afternoon . " They are the constitutional amendment and the referendum . " Passage of the Referendum Bill by the Board of Estimate was forecast a week ago when the overwhelming Democratic majority in the Board of Aldermen voted unanimously for the measure . This was taken as a sure indication that the Democrats on the Board of Estimate , Controller Frank J. Taylor and Borough Presidents Samuel Levy of Manhattan and James J. Lyons of the Bronx , would go along with the Mayor 's plan . This prediction proved correct , although Mr. Levy , in voting for the referendum , announced he might campaign against it . The only members of the board to vote against the measure were Borough President Raymond V. Ingersoll of Brooklyn and Acting Borough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two votes in the board and Mr. Halleran one . An Authority to Be Asked . If the voters approve the referendum the city will ask the Legislature to set up a local Authority to build and operate the power system . This Authority will have the job of raising the necessary funds , the referendum proposal clearly providing that the power system shall not be an obligation of the city itself . Although the referendum was adopted by an overwhelming vote , most of the.members of the board insisted on explaining their stand . The Mayor , Mr. Taylor and AIdermanic President Bernard S. Deutsch , who cast three votes apiece ' for the bill , were the exceptions . Mr. Levy objected to the " apparent politics " connected with the bill . He . had , pointed out earlier that he intended voting for the measure ? on the theory that the voters were entitled to express their opinion in spite of the fact that he is  --  a stockholder in the Consolidated Gas Company system . " It does look like politics to me to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first introduced in this branch of the Municipal Assembly , especially when the Aldermen must run for re-election in the Fall , " he remarked . He added that it was his personal opinion that " the city should not enter into this activity in competition with private enterprise , particularly in view of the small margin existing at the present time between rates . " Project Held Unsound . Mr. Ingersoll , voting against the bill , held that " final responsibility rests under the law with the Board of Aldermen and the Board of Estimate . " " I can not understand , " he said , " how one can vote for a referendum without being convinced of the soundness of the project itself . I am not convinced it is a sound project . I do not believe in its working out it will be to the benefit of the people of this city . The board has a definite responsibility and it should not shirk or abdicate . " Mr. Holleran concurred in this view . Expanded Plan Rejected . Before the board voted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Lyons which would have expanded the " yardstick " power system put forth by the Mayor into a $495,000,000 city-wide system . Mr. Lyons was the only one to vote in favor of his measure . The Mayor , Mr. Deutsch and Mr. Ingersoll opposed it . The rest of the members of the board were recorded as not voting . The Mayor praised the board 's action as a " fine vote " and promised to follow through by telling the facts concerning the power project to the electorate . " We will not let it go by default , " he said . " We will not allow the power trust and their henchmen , ' the lobbyists and the people on their payrolls to do all the talking . We will be just as cagey as the power people . We will make such plans as are necessary . I ca n't say what they are now . " Told that a heavy Republican vote might be cast against the referendum , the Mayor turned serious and asked if such a belief was general . Assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuse to believe they ca n't learn with time . "
