The price of rhubarb root ( a cathartic ) last week rose to 65 a lb. , up almost 200% in the past three weeks . Ephedrine ( a nasal astringent ) , which hay fever sufferers this month are using everywhere , similarly shot up 200% to $3 an ounce . Mandrake root , which Elizabethans considered a cure for sterility and druggists now use in physics , soared to $4.25 a lb . These convulsions in the minor Oriental drug trade last week were solely the effects of the war in China . Nor were they the only commercial effects in the U. S. To the confusion of economic isolationists , U. S. businessmen in many a more important occupation had occasion to notice how commerce reacts to a first-class war . a war 5,500 miles away and still undeclared . <P> Markets 6 Exchanges-War was apparently only one of many reasons for the slump in the New York Stock Exchange ( see p. 57 ) , but other Exchange excitement could be laid entirely at war 's door .

S. price . Result- the U. S. Treasury therefore became a heavy buyer until the price differential was erased . Arbitragers promptly took advantage of the same situation , and 3,175,000 ounces of their silver last week arrived in Manhattan . On a war scare virtually all principal foreign currencies developed weaknesses against the dollar , and the tide of gold movements to the U. S. , previously ebbing , rose again : in one day $11,900,000 , $5,800,000 of it from Japan , was engaged for shipment . <P> U , S , in China . The U.

S. oil interests were ousted four years ago from Manchuria . U. S. investments in China total $200,000,000 . In shattered Shanghai U. S. investments totaling a major chunk of this were in danger of going down the drain . Sample : the $57,000,000 Shanghai Power Co. , subsidiary of American &; Foreign Power Co.
