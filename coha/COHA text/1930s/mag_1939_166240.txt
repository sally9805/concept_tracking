INTERNATIONAL Scenario <P> Last week the news from Europe took a new , odd twist . If some master of suspense had planned the week 's plot-artfully following a big speech ( see p. 20 ) with a timely assassination ( see p. 23 ) a possible conspiracy nipped in the bud ( see p. 21 ) and the Japanese , as usual , providing comic relief ( see p. 25 ) - if it all had been planned ahead of time to create the utmost mystery , it could hardly have been improved upon . As melodrama , as a spectacle-as comedy as low as slapstick , and as tragedy as elevated as the warfare of the gods-as a week of history to stand beside the week that Cortes first invaded Mexico , as a horror story terrifying enough to blur the strongest mind-in all ways last week 's news piled sensation on sensation until its followers turned away with a yawn . <P> Yet strictly according to schedule the reels unwound . In this instalment the world was to learn what the Nazi-Communist Armies ' division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 29 ) . All manner of meaning lay upon that carving , who got what , and why ; how closely Hitler and Stalin were collaborating , and for how long ; in which direction , if any , Stalin planned to go-and here was the answer , more perplexing than the problem itself . Next question : What would Hitler say after he had conquered Poland ? <P> After his last speech this leading man of World War II had dashed off into the night , vowing to conquer or die ( TIME , Sept. 18 ) . That instalment ended as he plunged into the unknown-where , surprisingly , there were many photographers planted by the Propaganda Ministry . Mighty events transpired ; Poland fell ; tensely the world waited for the Fhrer 's next speech . Last week he made it ( see p. 20 ) . He was in Danzig . He had got it . He had said he would . Again he damned Alfred Duff Cooper as a warmonger , apparently unaware that Duff Cooper had been out of the British Cabinet for twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being persecuted , first by those fearful bullies , the Jews , next by that ogre , Dr. Schuschnigg , third by that world power , Czecho-Slovakia , and now by these tyrants , the Poles . But was it for this that bombs were falling on Warsaw ? In the next instalment . . . . <P> Pacifists . Eyes turned to that other great pacifist , Benito Mussolini . The last chapter ended with II Duce dangling over the cliff , hanging on to neutrality , saying nothing . When would he rouse himself from the meditation into which the mightiest events of his time appeared to have plunged him ? Always dynamic , conqueror of many an Ethiopian and Albanian , utterly fearless in denouncing the Masons , a great fellow for jumping over bayonets at Fascist parties ( or , better still , having his subordinates do it ) how would II Duce measure up to the strain of war ? <P> He spoke ( see p. 22 ) . The world had expected him to speak for peace . He did so . But the Duce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new town outside Rome , who had stuck out his jaw and sounded off about almost every incident in Europe for 20 years- II Duce now spoke to 130 Fascist functionaries in a provincial capital , and limited himself to 600 words , 100 of which complained about attacks upon himself . The world lost interest ; the pain in Warsaw seemed more severe than the heartaches of even the Duce.
