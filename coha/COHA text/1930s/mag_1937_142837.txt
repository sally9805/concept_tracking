For Southern California it is bad enough that the northern part of the State has two great bridges , one across the Bay , the other across the Golden Gate , lately opened with two gigantic fiestas ( TIME , Nov. 23 &; June 7 ) . For Southern California it is worse that it contains a bridge which has made a lot of horrid news- Pasadena 's notorious " suicide bridge , " the long , aqueduct-like structure spanning 158-ft. - deep Arroyo Seco in which squats the Rose Bowl . According to local legend , when this bridge was built in 1912 , several workmen were buried alive in the concrete and their tortured spirits haunt the place . Certainly it has been a sorry spot : fortnight ago the 88th person jumped to death over its low parapet . <P> Last week when a 19-year-old girl made the 89th death leap , Pasadena 's Board of Directors finally yielded to newspaper demands for action . They voted to erect a 71-ft. steel fence crowned with barbed wire the entire length of the bridge . Estimated cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
