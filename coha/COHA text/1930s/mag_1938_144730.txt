In Naziland , music by Jewish composers , performances by Jewish musicians , are strictly verboten . So that good Germans may know what music and which musicians to avoid , a Nazi Who 's Who of Jewish musicians has been compiled . Its title : Judentum und Musik mil dem ABC jdischer und nichtarischer Musik-beflissener . The third edition of this witching work , which last week reached U. S. shores , showed Nazi inquisitors to be more thorough than accurate . Among the prominent " Jewish " musicians listed : Chicago 's retiring Yankee Composer John Alden Carpenter ; rotund Danceband-leader Paul Whiteman ; lusty , kewpie-faced Wagnerian Tenor Lauritz Melchior . Fumed Tenor Melchior , when informed of his nomination : " I am a Dane , without a drop of Jewish blood in me , and I am determined to seek redress . "
