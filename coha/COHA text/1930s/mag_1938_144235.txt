One of the world 's most famed places of musical pilgrimage , Austria 's Salzburg , last week appeared on the verge of losing its eminence . It had already lost its three leading artistic personalities , Italian Conductor Arturo Toscanini , who resigned ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) , Jewish Conductor Bruno Walter , who was last week safe in The Netherlands although his daughter was arrested in Vienna , and Jewish Stage Director Max Reinhardt whose two Salzburg presentations were canceled . The moment was therefore favorable for revived talk of a U. S. Salzburg . <P> A bid for that honor promptly came last week from Westport , Conn. , an arty village lying on the sluggish River Saugatuck where it empties into Long Island sound . There Author Hendrik van Loon 's Connecticut Society of Friends of Music announced plans for an initial summer season of six concerts scheduled for this summer . While this six-performance schedule would still leave Westport trailing in competition with such established U. S. summer festivals as the Berkshire , Hollywood Bowl , St. Louis Municipal Opera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grace Moore and Lawrence Tibbett hope for glamorous future expansion , to help keep American music lovers from stumping off to Europe every summer . <P> A Westport resident is Patrick A. Powers , an enterprising Irishman , onetime backer of Walt Disney , organizer of Universal Film Co. , later of Film Booking Office of America ( forerunner of RKO ) who sold out his Hollywood interests several years ago , purchased a 200-acre estate in Westport , where he built the Longshore Country Club . Sociable , civic-minded Powers spends his winters in a marble-floored palace at Spuyten Duyvil on the Hudson River , wears green suits and still sports an Irish accent . Last week he promised Westporters a great gift : he would build a $100,000 " marine stadium " at Westport , lease it to the Friends of Music for $1 a year .
