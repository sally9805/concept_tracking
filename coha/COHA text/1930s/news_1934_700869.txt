txt Excerpts From Letters on Many Subjects The Stock Exchange . Will Rogers 's statement regarding the " winnings and losings " of the New York Stock Exchange appears to be capable of creating an incorrect impression in the minds of readers . Surely , Mr. Rogers must realize that the Exchange itself neither gains nor loses . There can be little question that the business of buying and selling securities is in the worst stages of what might be called its own depression , with unemployment at its peak . Certainly this can be attributed partially to statements of the nature of Mr. Rogers 's , which , though meant in jest , are generally misunderstood by the average layman . There has already been too much jesting of this nature , and I think it 's time to call a halt , especially in view of the fact that the Exchange is now being regulated by the government . ?
