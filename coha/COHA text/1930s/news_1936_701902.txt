txt Because the Grain Futures Act of 1922 is written in the present and not the past tense , the Supreme Court today defeated the attempt of Sec-1 retary Wallace to bar Arthur W. Cutten from trading on the grain markets . In a unanimous opinion , renJ dered through Justice Brandeis , the court said that the words " is violating " any provision of the Grain Act , or " is attempting " to manipulate the market price made it impossible to prosecute Mr. Cotten .. for acts committed two years before the Secretary brought his complaint . . Today 's opinion sustained that of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals , and Mr. Cutten 's plea that , under the law , the Grain Futures Commission had no right to suspend him from the Exchanges for alleged violations committed two years before proceedings were instituted against him . The commission , composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture and Commerce and the Attorney General , issued an order and Secretary Wallace served a complaint upon Mr. Cutten for alleged offenses committed during 1930 and 1931 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission , charged with disguising transactions involving 116,000 , - 000 bushels of wheat futures worth about 00,000,000 during 1930 and 1931 . Mr. Cutten argued that he could not be barred from trading because the Grain Act dealt only with continuing and existing violations , whereas , the commission sought to penalize him for a completed transaction . Justice Brandies , in his opinion , pointing to the government 's argument that violations could not be detected while being committed , said that this " literal construction " would make the law " impractical and ineffective " in dealing ' with violators . But he held that it would be " inappropriate " for the court to discuss such arguments , because " the language of Section 6 ( b ) is clear ; and on the face of the statute there can be no doubt concerning the intention of Congress . " TEXT OF THE DECISION The text of the decision as de*scribed by Justice Brandeis was as follows : " Section 6 ( d ) , of the Grain Pa- tures Act , Sept. 21 , 1922 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides that if the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that any person ' is violating ' any provision of the Act , or any rules and regulations made pursuant thereto , or ' is attempting ' to manipulate the market price of grain in violation of the provisions of the Act , the Secretary may serve upon the person a complaint stating his charge in that respect and requiring him ' to show cause why an order should not be made directing that all contract markets until further notice of the said commission refuse all trading privileges thereon to such person . ' " The commission referred to is a board ' composed of the Secretary of Agriculture , the Secretary of Commerce , and the Attorney General , ' before whom the hearing on the complaint is had . " This case is here to review a decree of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , which set aside an order entered by the commission under that section . Certiorari was granted ( 297 U. S. ? ) on account of the novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " April 11 , 1934 , the Secretary of Agriculture caused such a complaint to be served upon Arthur W. Cutten . It recited that during the years 1930 and 1931 he was , and since had been , continuously a member of the Chicago Board of Trade ; and that by its regulations made pursuant to the Grain Futures Act he was required : ' To report to the Grain Futures Administration his net position in futures owned or controlled by him , long or short , by grain and by future , when he had net open commitments in any one future equal to or in excess of 500,000 bushels * e . ' ( And also ) ' Daily trades made by him on the Board of Trade , in futures in which he owned or controlled open commitments equal to or in excess of 500,000 bushels . ' The complaint alleged further that : " During the years-1930 and 1931 he ) conspired and colluded with various persons and grain firms of the Board of Trade to conceal his trading and position in the market from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondent made inaccurate , incorrect and false reports of his position in the market to the Grain Futures Administration , failed and refused to report accurately and correctly his position in the market and trades made by him , " &c.; " Then followed . in forty-four numbered paragraphs , specifications of Cutten 's alleged violations of the regulations and the act on dates between March 6 , 1930 , and Dec. 31 , 1931 . Appeals Court Ruling Cited " A referee was appointed to take the evidence . The hearings before him began on May 14 , 1934 . Upon the opening of those proceedings , Cutten moved to quash the complaint on the ground that Section 6(b) empowered the Commission to act only against persons who are presently committing offenses ; and that consequently , it had no au-1 thority to deny to him trading privileges for violations committed more than two years prior to the institution of the proceedings against him . " The referee , without passing upon the motion to quash , proceeded to take the evidence ; the hearings before him were concluded May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on briefs and oral argument ; and before it the motion to quash was renewed . " On Feb. 12 , 1935 , the Commission overruled the motion ; made findings of fact on the evidence ; concluded that Cutten 's conduct ' constitutes a violation of the Grain Futures Act , and the Rules and Regulations made pursuant there= to ' ; and ordered that ' all contract markets refuse all trading privileges thereon to Arthur W. Cutten for a period of two years from March 1 , 1935 . ' " This suit was brought to set aside that order . The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the power conferred by Section 6(b) is remedial , not punitive ; that it is limited to suspending a trader who ' is violating any of the provisions of this Act , or ' is attempting to manipulate the market price of any grain ' ; in other words , one who is presently committing an offense ; that at the time of the filing of the complaint there was no wrong existing to be remedied , the latest wrong-doing complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the complaint by the Secretary of Agriculture ; that , therefore , the Commission was without authority to entertain the complaint , and should have granted the motion to quash. ? F. ( 2d ) ? . Language Is Held Clear " The government argues that , since violations of the reporting requirements , by their very nature , . can not be detected during the course of commission , the literal construction thus given to Section 6 ( b ) renders it impractical and ineffective as a means of dealing with those persons who violate any of the provisions of the Act or attempt to manipulate the market price of grain . Incidents in the history of the legislation are cited to support the government 's contention . " In reply , it is argued that ample remedy is afforded by other provisions of the Act ; that these confer broad power over boards of trade ; and that the boards of trade may control their own members . It is urged that for the construction given to Section 6 ( b ) by the lower court support may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a ) . " For it authorized the Commission to suspend or ' to revoke the designation of a board of trade as a " contract market " upon a showing that such board of trade has failed or is failing to comply ' with the requirements prescribed . Attention is also called to the penalty provisions of Section 9 . " It would be inappropriate for us to discuss these and other arguments presented . The language of Section 6 ( b ) is clear ; and ' on the face of the statute , there can be no doubt . concerning the intention of Congress . As was said in Iselin ve United States , 270 U. S. 245 , 250-251 : ; " ' The statute was evidently drawn with care . Its language is plain and unambiguous . What the government asks is not a construction of a statute , but , in effect , an enlargement of it by the court , so that what was omitted , presumably ( possibly ) by inadvertence , may be included within its scope . To supply omissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may not be done for the purpose of making punishable action which , on the face of the statute , is merely to be prevented . Compare United States v. Weitzel , 246 U. S. 533 , 542-543 . " Affirmed . "
