As fiscal 1939 last week entered its final month , the necessity for carrying Relief on into fiscal 1940 loomed nearer and larger to an Appropriations subcommittee of the House . In his last message on the subject ( TIME , May 8 ) , Franklin Roosevelt asked for $1,477,000,000 to carry an average of 2,000,000 workers on WPA ( mostly manual labor ) through the coming year . For PWA ( heavy construction works ) he asked nothing this time . In the weeks that have passed since that message , Mr. Roosevelt 's hopes for an upturn in the capital goods industries have dwindled . Beside the picture of 11,000,000 idle workers has persisted a picture of billions of idle dollars . More &; more public spending , in the absence of private investment , is known to be Mr. Roosevelt 's sorcery against this old nightmare , as always before . Last week , therefore , observers were not surprised to see his Secretary of the Interior , " Honest Harold " Ickes. - master of PWA , appear on Capitol Hill before the Relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bill some months ago to give PWA another $500,000,000 in fiscal 1940 . Since then PWA has been " reorganized , " along with WPA , USHA and several other agencies , into a new Federal Works Agency ( effective July 1 ) . Not the Starnes bill , but a PWA allotment of similar size out of the money it was going to vote for WPA , was what seemed to be in the subcommittee 's mind . Two reasons , besides Mr. Roosevelt 's renewed urge to " invest " in public works , guided the subcommittee in this direction : discovery of items in WPA 's proposed budget ( the first ever submitted to Congress in itemized form ) which could be shaved or excised ; uneasiness about the efficiency of WPA 's handling of large projects and about its executive set-up ( last week the committee , having found $21,000,000 could be knocked out of WPA 's $71,000,000 list of administrative costs &; materials , talked of having the General Accounting Office audit all WPA expenditures in at least one sample past year ) . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman can point and say , " I got you that , folks . " You ca n't point to a pile of WPA-raked leaves . <P> The Master of PWA made a fine witness in his own behalf . He could report that , after allotting before last January 1 all the $965,000,000 given him for fiscal 1939 , he still had on hand 2,800 projects approved as feasible and suitable for PWA to undertake . He could report that of all the hundreds of millions loaned by PWA to States and municipalities , only $5,000,000 or 4/5% had been defaulted . Meantime , PWA had made $12,000,000 by selling at premium local bonds put up as loan collateral . Better than 80% of all bond issues proposed to local voters to pay their share ( usually 55% ) of PWA project costs , had been duly voted . <P> Applauded the committee 's chairman ( Colorado 's Taylor ) : " A marvelous record ! " <P> Lest advocates of WPA , most of whose money goes straight into workers ' pockets , think that PWA is gravy only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion to mention , in a public letter to Franklin Roosevelt last week , that in six years the workmen employed on PWA projects pocketed $1,205,452,000 in wages . <P>
