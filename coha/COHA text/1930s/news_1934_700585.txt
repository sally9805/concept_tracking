txt The program of legislation sought by the LaGuardia administration was being pushed here tonight . The measure empowering the city to impose new taxes was drafted today for submission probably tomorrow and meanwhile the Assembly , by a vote of 78 to 64 , passed the Brownell bill , which would make a radical readjustment in the lower courts of the city . The Brownell bill , passed over bitter Democratic opposition , would abolish the present magistrates ' courts and the Court of Special Sessions and create a new Special Sessions Court to which Mayor LaGuardia would have power to appoint forty new judges . One Economy BM Defeated . A setback to the city program came late tonight , however , as the Assembly defeated , by a vote of 71 to 64 , the third bill in the series of major economy measures asked by the Mayor . This was the bill that would have required the custodial and administrative force of the Department of Education to accept the salary cuts and payless furloughs set forth in the major economy bill already passed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a violation of the agreement with the Mayor . The defeat of the bill did not come as a complete surprise , although Corporation Counsel Paul Windels expressed disappointment . The other bill in the major economy series , that providing for cuts and furloughs to the teachers similar to those for other city employes , has passed the Assembly , but is still pending in the Senate . Change in Charter Plan . A sharp change in procedure for preparation of a new charter for New York City was determined on tonight after a series of conferences . While Governor Lehman had recommended that a commission be established to prepare a charter which would be submitted direct to the voters in a referendum , the new plan calls for the commission to report back to the Legislature . This plan has been agreed to by Mr. Windels . Important political implications were read into the action , as it was felt that under the new program calling for approval at Albany of any new charter for the city the legislative campaign in New York City would take on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to sit down tomorrow morning to discuss a measure creating a charter revision commission as well as the city tax bill . No definite list of members for the charter commission has been prepared , but among those understood to be under consideration are Alfred E. Smith , Samuel Seabury , Joseph V. , Norman Thomas , Joseph P. Ryan , Mrs. George N. Wyeth , William T. Featherstone , Leonard M. Wallstein and a number of others . In all about forty names are being considered from which the final dozen or fifteen will be selected . The new plan will mean a bitter fight for control of the Legislature . With Mayor LaGuardia fighting for charter changes , it is understood that his forces are planning to put in the field an entire slate of Fusion Senators and Assemblymen . I Some observers even go so far as to see in the new developments a basis being laid for a State-wide Fusion drive for control of the State Government . Tax Bill to Be Rushed . The hill to give the city administration power to fix new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared for submission to the legislative leaders , who have given assurances that they are ready to cooperate with Mayor LaGuardia on this measure . Senate Leader Dunnigan said that at conferences tomorrow the language of the bill would be examined . In all probability ? it will be introduced then and hurried through both houses . The bill will be a general grant of power and will follow the general lines of a similar grant to the O'Brien administration last year . This power lapsed in February . The measure will place all responsibility on the LaGuardia administration for the specific levies . But whereas the bill obtained by the O'Brien administration provided that receipts from local taxes must be used for unemployment relief , the present bill would allow the receipts to go into the general fund . It is thought possible that a provision may be written into the bill to insure that local taxes would not be placed on non-residents of the city . Such a provision is not yet in the draft . Up-State Republicans have taken the stand on several occasions that this policy should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Capitol most of the day with his assistant , Reuben H. Lazarus . They had several talks with Senator Dunnigan . The main discussions with leaders of both houses will probably be conducted ' in the morning . Meanwhile Mr. Windels and Mr. Lazarus were anxiously watching the many other city bills in the hope of winning support for them in what appear to be the closing days of the current session of the Legislature . The Assembly passed , the Brownell Court overAhe : vigorous , tprotesti Of the Denfiocfats ; with two Republicans , Rice of Queens and Inselbuch of Brooklyn , voting with them . Assemblyman Pack , Bronx Democrat , who made the chief argument against the bill , characterized it as " ripper " legislation , and declared it would help to make Mayor LaGuardia a " political czar " in New York City . Assemblyman Steingut , Democratic leader , also assailed the bill as " ripper legislation of the worst kind . " " This bill , " said Mr. Pack , " if enacted into law , will legislate sixty-four judges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Mayor LaGuardia an opportunity to build up a powerful political machine ; it might even make him a political czar . The Mayor says he is out of politics , but this bill shows he is in politics up to his ears . " Assemblyman Pack raised the point that this was a city bill and therefore required two-thirds , or 100 votes , for passage . Speaker ruled that the bill required only seventy-six votes for passage , but said he was inclined to agree that the measure was " on the border line . " In defending the bill Asseniblyman Brownell , New York Republican , said that it was the result of the investigation of the lower courts made several years ago by Samuel Seabury at the direction of the Appellate Division . " Shocking conditions were revealed in the magistrates ' courts and this bill is designed to correct those conditions and to re-establish in the minds of the people a higher regard for our Inferior courts , " he said . Assemblyman Brownell pointed out that 500,000 persons come In contact each year with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do more for New York City than any other bill that has come before the Legislature this year , " he added . " Also it would be the means of saving considerable money for the city . " Assemblyman Lappano , New York , Republican , took exception to the statement by Assemblyman Pack that the Mayor would appoint forty " new judges . " Mr. Lappano pointed out that the bill authorized the Mayor to reappoint any of the present judges he deemed to- be competent for the work of the new court . This aroused the anger of Assemblyman Steingut , who turned on Assemblyman Lappano and other Fusion-Republicans from New York , referring to them as " political accidents . " " This is ripper legislation of the worst kind , " said Mr. Steingut . " If Tammany Hall ever sponsored such a bill we would never hear the last of it . But , because this comes from the LaGuardia administration , it is supposed to be lily white . " The Assembly passed and sent to Governor Lehman the Buckley bill authorizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as official . referee any New York City municipal court justice who has served for one elective term . It also passed the bill of Senator Quinn , New York , Democrat , which increases to $500 the amount of money that the public administrator of New York County may withdraw from the city treasury . The bill now goes to the Governor . Burchill Bill Is Passed . On reconsideration of the vote by which it had failed of passage originally , and over the protest of the New York City Board of Transportation , the Senate passed tonight , by a vote of 28 to 18 , the Burchill Bill to impose a tax of 10 per cent during the emergency period on contracts for public works awarded to companies from outside the State . On behalf of the Board of Transportation Senator Fearon read a memorandum of protest declaring that the bill would add to the cost of equipping the city 's subways by the amount of the tax and by giving a virtual monopoly to one concern on certain articles of equipment . Senator Burchill replied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city would sustain no loss on that account .
