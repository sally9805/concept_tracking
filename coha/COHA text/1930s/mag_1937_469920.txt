CALL it " nosey-Parker " or intellectual curiosity , as you will , it is natural for a reader when he goes into a strange house to snatch at any chance to pry among the books , and from them ' a form an idea of their owner . Such from childhood has been my own habit . Why , in that case , have I for years been so stupidly incurious about that most public of libraries , the newsstand ? With the better-class magazines I was familiar , but never until lately had I glanced inside a publication dedicated to confessions or young love or the antics of artless and surprised crooks . Recently then , to mend my ignorance , I have been soaking myself in Sweetheart Stories , G-Men , True Romances , Spicy Detective , and others of the same kind ; and steadily in my mind has grown more insistent the composite picture of shopgirls , factory girls , mechanics , bell-hops , farm wives and taxi-drivers for whom these stories are written . It is not a happy picture ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are all alike in one thing , a denial of reality . Yet it is this , paradoxically , that so makes their readers come alive to one 's imagination . One gets a feeling of hot , wanting people ? wanting security , wanting diversion of a shoddy kind , cars of course , freedom from responsibility , and , above all , color in their lives . This latter , though vicariously , these magazines set out to supply , with what success is proved by their enormous sales . They do it in different ways and for different audiences . Let us first consider those rough-paper , crudely illustrated publications sold as a rule for ten cents and technically known as the " pulps . " Being edited for a mental age of perhaps eleven years , they are above all specific ? specific in title , dialogue , characterization . If the cover promises love , love you get , in such quantities as to give the effect of a strawberry soda poured down your back . There are " pulps " that contain nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the issue is seldom confused by the introduction of even minor crime and detection , and only rarely by a subordinated love interest . The attitude of the readers to the editor is of a beautiful trustfulness , never betrayed , and the contact between them is far closer than in the better-class magazines . When one of the periodicals devoted to young love inquired in its pages whether an occasional deviation from the happyending rule would be acceptable , the answer came in a torrent of pathetic , selfrevealing letters , all on the theme that " life is sad enough as it is . " These people were not arguing an abstract literary principle . They really cared . Likewise close are editor and writer . The former meets the latter halfway for several reasons . One is the limitation of choice owing to the fact that the pulps specialize so closely in one field or another . A second is that with a new writer the editor can get the work cheap ; a third , that after receiving a sympathetic hearing for his maiden efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a sense of loyalty and continue to contribute . In this he will be justified ; because once established , he can be sure , unless his work falls off badly , of continued association . And should his craft improve to the point of carrying him in a proud leap from the pulps , at one or two cents a word , to the " slicks " ( Saturday Evening Post , Collier 's , American , Woman 's Home Companion , etc. ) with their lordly scale of pay , he may still use the old vehicle for his pot-boilers . However simple the rules , they must not be transgressed . Side by side in importance with the happy ending conies the need for entire sincerity ? or apparent sincerity ? in the writing of the story ; for a patronizing tone is instantly detectible by both editor and reader , and will not be tolerated . How certain authors manage to combine belief in their handiwork with a skill in plot-construction and an ability to write graphic , if crude , English is a psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Another rule is the absence of all but really necessary descriptions . Everything must give way to the demand for action or full love passages . Oh , those love passages ! Domestic sets are preferred , and of course the hero and heroine , no matter how far afield , must be American ; but should by chance the scene be laid in a foreign country , you are merely told that this is Spain or Malaya and left at that . Credibility of detail is disregarded . The reader will swallow anything . Here , chosen at random , is a story of a pretty young typist who decides she would like a job in South America . She boards a boat and , fitted out with a very taking and expensive line of evening dresses , draws all eyes . Her own are turned on a tall dark foreigner , to pursue her acquaintance with whom she sits in at a bridge game . She loses to him and his friends one hundred dollars , all she has in the world . Since she has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would think that she was out of luck . But no . A tall , blond Amer-ican is on patrol . She owns , beside her clothes , a traveling-clock , worth five hundred dollars , which her kind aunt gave her as a good-by present . The hero , who is most chivalrously as well as instantaneously in love with her , lends her some money with the clock as security , and two days later proposes on deck . Certain of the pulps have individual taboos such as these : no character ( unless he is a villain ) may take a drink ; the hero must under no circumstances abandon his horse ; the hero must be a simple roughneck who has not gone beyond grammarschool . One may be quite sure that in every case the editor knows his public and has good reason for these prohibitions . It is an odd fact that in all the pulps I have read I have come upon few signs of worldly ambition , of the outheld hope of great wealth and social advancement , such as were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear they seem merely to be relics of the Horatio Alger days , and are uncomfortable , lifeless figures whose only function is to hire the hero to do a spirited bit of work or have daughters to contrast unfavorably with the little shopgirl . Occasionally the heroine will catch the eye of a rising young buyer or even the boss 's son , but never does the hero get an upward push by marrying above his station . Should he fall in love with a rich girl she must either lose all her money so that he can marry her creditably , or else he must himself acquire a respectable amount in some sudden fashion . It must be sudden in order to fit the demands of stories so limited in time as well as motivation that action extending more than a few days is unusual ; but I have also noticed that there is never any suggestion that money , beyond the modicum needed for living , must be worked for . There the Hollywood influence comes in . Characters are found to be heaven-created for the movies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing " blues " or singing in nightclubs . It is the twentieth-century equivalent of buried treasure . Yet , simple and indeed dingy as are many of the settings , the filling-station , the Coney Island chicken-stand , the five and ten cent stores , it is taken for granted that cars are available whenever needed , and often when legs would do just as well . One of the most heroic things a heroine can do is walk , especially in the country You are made to understand that no reward is too great for a girl who has thus taken boldly to her feet . In general the car is omnipresent . People make love in cars , commit crimes in them , escape in them , and just ride in them , on and on , for lack of something better to do . Existence without an automobile in unthinkable . II Once these broad rules are established , the variations in the pulps are many . An important group is given over to young love , and comprises such publications as Sweetheart and Thrilling Love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over twenty-five or a heroine of over twenty-two would be without interest . Many of the characters are of college age and are presented as following higher education in very strange plants of learning . Since the young-love magazines exist only to stir a public made up on the one hand of the very young , who are emotionally still in the moist stage , and on the other hand of the very elderly , who are reliving their youth in tales of moonlight and kisses , they are necessarily shorn of any " rough stuff . " These boys with sweetly buttered hair , these girls with starry eyelashes and ringlets who in the many illustrations cling together with unnerving frequency , have the unblemished ! past and mental equipment of a banana , split . Unblemished , that is , in any large way . It is almost a strict convention for the heroine to have had uncounted minor love affairs . " Darleen had been kissed before , sometimes lightly , sometimes ardently . But never had a kiss reached the sacred shrine of her heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea seems to be that a girl goes on hopefully kissing until on some golden occasion something clicks , and she knows she has found her perfect mate . Love always comes with a shattering suddenness . Two or three days are generally enough for first meeting , discovery , and engagement ; so that when one comes on a passion that endures for two months before fulfillment one feels as though one had been communing with the soul of Dante . The cause of this lies not in the tradition of love at first sight , not in the timelimits imposed by the elementary nature of the plots , but in the very pathetic demands of the readers . The seventeenyear-old factory girl is not having a great deal of fun out of living . She wants security and freedom from work , she longs for romance . Of what use is it to preach the long pull to that undeveloped intelligence ? Or to preach anything , for that matter ? In these stories she finds the hope that for her as well as for the heroine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , and that she will be carried on some immense wave of perfumed water to a land undreamed of by the sirens . How this is to happen she has not the slightest idea , but she gets some reassurance from the " sciences " that are to-day 's version of primitive magic : numerology , horoscopy , and astrology . It is not necessary for her , unless she wants to delve deeply into the matter , to buy one of the little publications devoted entirely to such subjects ; for many of the love-magazines have regular departments in which she can get advice on affairs of the heart and business according to the stars and the mysticality of numbers . For example : " Wednesday , Nov. 4 . " During the early-morning hours , mark time in employment matters and conserve your marriage-partner 's money . Between 8.00 A.M. and 9.30 A.M. you may receive employment benefits , and home affairs may he benefited thereby . The later morning hours and the afternoon hours will be somewhat quiet . Between 6.30 P.M. and 8.00 P.M. , mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your social activities . Between 8.00 P.M. and 10.00 P.M. , mark time in home affairs . Mark time in love and courtship matters . Be careful around large bodies of water . " In addition to such counsels , the reader is also , in some " port of lonely hearts , " offered a number of " pen-pals " with whom he may enter into correspondence . Their geographic range is surprising . China , Egypt , New Zealand , South Africa , as well as every corner of the United States , furnish suppliants for letters , post cards , and snapshots . The writers vary as widely as do the locations : college and high-school students , chauffeurs , lonely widowers , children from grammar school ( some as young as nine years of age ) , a girl whose hobby is " collecting match-. holders , " young married women who " have nothing to do when the housework is finished , " yacht stewards , men and women living on remote farms . Some of the letters are touching , some matter-of-fact , some absurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is one that you may classify as you will : " This is a plea from a girl in her early twenties . I am considered attractive , but because I have to wear glasses I have found life to be just one round of disappointments . I would love to correspond with girls who live in or near New York , especially those who also have to wear glasses . Maybe we can cheer each other up . At any rate , I am sure we could find a lot in common . Glimmer . " III So much for the pulps of young love . The " action " pulps , dealing with crime , sports , flying , railway and ranch-life , though even less hampered by the law of chances , are of much sturdier stuff . The " Westerns " have their own code . The heroine , though capable of extraordinary physical feats , is a much less sophisticated creature than her Eastern counterpart . In the old-fashioned way , she expects to be sought instead of beingthe aggressor . The hero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaits the dawn of love , but is as a rule too much engaged in foiling bandits , leaping from precipices , swimming rapids , and discovering gold-mines to have his attention more than briefly distracted by the softer emotions . It is all in the good adventure-story tradition , less well written of course than the doings of Richard Hannay and Allan Quatermain , but hardly less credible . There is sometimes a rather nice feeling for nature ? an element never allowed to intrude on the action of the other types of cheap magazines , all of which are sternly urban in tone . If one does not object to the merciless pace at which shooting follows shooting , and can understand the lingo talked by the actors , these Westerns are pretty good stuff . Even more streamlined are the crime stories , crammed as they arc with unintelligible action , like an exaggerated and distorted version of the more sober type of detective fiction . In one I read ? a lunatic echo of Oppenheim ? there are five murders and four attempted murders in twenty pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reader to use his wits , unless it he in simply following the plot . In several cases that feat was beyond my powers . What the author provides is a heavy mass of action with a burst of explanation at the end . Gangsters abound , especially in those tales devoted to the doings of G-men , incredible fellows who take any amount of punishment without letting it interfere with their duties . Here is one G-man who is blackjacked and thrown on his head from a moving train , lands on the roadbed in a series of bounces , loses consciousness , but soon comes to , his entire body " one mass of howling , shrieking pain , " but with no bones broken . He walks to the nearest railway station , hires a car , drives thirtytwo miles to an airport , hires a plane , chases the very train from which his quarry had tossed him , drops by a rope from the plane , and lands on the observation platform . " His feet struck wood , glass . He felt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sprawled inside the observation car in the middle of a group of terrified passengers . " After these preliminary details , getting his man was easy . Another hero , though he has been tortured by having a shoe-lace drawn tight round his throat , his gums and face burned by lighted cigars , pieces of flesh cut from under his finger-nails , and so on , until " no single inch of flesh ( over his entire body ) was unmarked , " yet succeeds in so delicately opening a box containing a bomb that , with six men in a small room , five of them " killers , " he alone escapes being blown to ribbons . Like the " Westerns " and , indeed , all the action magazines , these crime stories have a sort of juvenile innocence . There is , however , one type of crime story , remotely fathered by Dashiel Hammett , which is deliberately knowing and fruity . It is written in a style meant to be swaggering , hard-boiled , and chic . " A sour-pussed butler let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , a pair of legs came down the steps . I 'm only forty-four and I like things like that . The dame was tall but not too tall , with plenty of thissa and thatta to make a guy lick his lips . " Far from the Leabelles and Doraleens of young love are the Moiras and Glorias who undulate through these pages with a " flaunting sway of breathtaking hips . " No matter what the formality of the occasion , even in such austere surroundings as a Pullman car , they all wear either tight-fitting satin evening dresses or chiffon negligees over scraps of lace . The illustrations are in the same larking vein . The heroes , either private detectives or self-sacrificing ex-convicts , show a notable stamina in both gunplay and lovemaking . Here is a gentle instance of the narrative style : " But the war is not over yet by one hell of a long way . I squeeze my trigger again and nothing happens . My roscoe 's clip is empty . And the remaining masked gazabo is coming at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes . " And this : " Mfmah was warm enough to baste , but she kept her head . " It is not pleasant to think of the immature minds and mature appetites that feed on such stuff as their staple fodder , but there is no ducking the fact that sensationalism is the age-old need of the uneducated . The steady reader of this kind of fiction is interested in and stirred by the same things that would interest and stir a savage , only he can get it from the printed page instead of demanding real blood and pain . When we read the old English miracle plays , with their enchanting blend of pious legend and homespun detail , and reflect that such was , for the mass of the population , the entire literary diet ; when , so reflecting , we decide that the peasant of the fourteenth century was a childlike , gentle fellow of unspoiled tastes , we forget the brutal sports that delighted him on holidays , and may perhaps take some comfort in the fact that his counterpart of to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that Hodge wanted to he amused and be made to laugh . If the readers of the pulps , whether of crime or love or adventure , have any such desire , it remains ungratified , for in none of them , except perhaps in the flying stories , is there any trace of humor . No one ever laughs , except tauntingly , and no one seems to have fun out of anything but dancing , drinking , and lovemaking , all of which occupations are pursued in a grim , businesslike manner from which all gaiety has been banished . Nor is there ever a suggestion that the mind can be used as a source of pleasure . The characters have no curiosity about one another , no relish for the comedy or interest of a situation , no eye for any beauty except that of a young man or woman . If such magazines give one a true picture of their public , one 's only conclusion is that without routine their readers would be bored to death , and that it is fortunate that the economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine workers , no matter how unskilled . IV Whereas the pulps developed naturally from such old dime-novels as Nick Carter , the confession magazines sprang into life suddenly . Let Mr. MacFadden explain it in his own words . True Story Magazine was really a logical outgrowth of Physical Culture Magazine . For nearly twenty-five years , Mr. Bcrnarr MacFadden had thundered in the pages of Physical Culture Magazine a call to the American people to live more vitally , more buoyantly , through greater strength and health . From all over the United States , and indeed from all over the world , letters had come to him from men and women , relating the inmost secrets of their lives and asking him , out of the fullness of long experience , to advise them . . . Mr. MacFadden , as he read over a batch of this extraordinary snail one morning , remarked to one of his associates , " Men and women are not to be taught by precept . The only teacher whose lessons stick is the great teacher Experience . And yet it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer through experience before we learned the lessons of life . What a great amount of good might be done in this world if only the experiences of people might he passed on to others , that they might learn the lessons without enduring the suffering . " And at that moment the idea of True Story Magazine was born . This much , at least , is undeniable : True Story , the first of the " confessions , " did begin with genuine letters and , though now there is editing done and professional work bought , the flood of illiterate , exhibitionist documents continues to flow in from farmhouses , offices . suburban homes , city lodginghouses , even penitentiaries . Some are written on stationery , some in pencil on rough lined paper . I saw one scrawled on lined sheets about the size of ordinary notepaper which were held together by a large safety-pin . Another began thus : " This is a true conffession I am giving in my own words . Something I hope will prove a lesson to other wemon who are afflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started over a girl that was employed in a cafe as waitress . . .. She never seemed to have anything to say to me , but always had a Plesent word for Jack . . . I had seen them several times in long conversions . " Still another asked , as is often the case , that the manuscript be not returned " because of maritial troubles . " The author led up to the account of his shady love-affair with the words : " She greeted me with the most snuggest embrace I ever experienced . " But the problems presented in the confession magazines are by no means all " maritial . " True Story published , and continues to publish , experiences of all kinds . Not long ago , for instance , the prize in one of their competitions was awarded to a woman whose passion was centered on teaching and who wrote a simple , straight account of the lions she had met in her path . And there was another tale of a man brought up in the sea-going tradition making in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry all his life the sense of having failed . The successors of True Story , made up at first of the overflow of the parent magazine , deal , however , entirely with affairs of the heart . Though not one has gained the glorious popularity which True Story enjoys , several others have readers numbered by the hundreds of thousands : Modern Romances ( published by Dell ) ; the MacFadden women 's group consisting of True Romances , True Experiences , and True Love and Romance ; and True Confessions ( a product of the Fawcett Publishing Company ) . Fawcett also publishes several movie magazines , but these do not come into our picture . They would require a book to themselves . Given these magazines with their garish covers , their inflammatory illustrations , their preoccupation with the purple patches in the Ten Commandments , it is surprising to learn that as a general rule their readers are predominantly of the sober , church-going , backbone-of-thecountry type , and that the prejudices of these readers must always be considered by the editors . The plots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but certain definite taboos are necessarily enforced . First , and most important , is that the central character , the narrator ( for all stories are told in the first person ) must be sympathetic " : that is , no matter what the narrators have done -- and as a rule they have done a good deal ? the reader should feel they are not really to blame . They were too innocent to understand , the temptation was too great , the other fellow maneuvered them into wrongdoing . From the certain trials that ensue they may be counted on to emerge stronger and nobler characters , moreover with the right mate attached . To give an idea of the general type of plot , here is the outline of the first story in the first " confession " I read , which seems a fair enough way of drawing lots . Lured by promises of marriage and a screen career by a man who proves later to be in the pay of a ring of malpractitioners in the West , the heroine , a village girl , goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who keeps putting off her pleas for marriage , and , when she finds there is no chance for her to get a screen test , takes a job as a waitress . Learning to her horror that she is about to have a child , she is steered by Leon to the infamous doctor , but with no idea of wanting an illegal operation . The doctor , however , performs it without her realizing until afterward what has happened , and in her illness and despair she is taken care of by Bill , the hero , a high-minded young photographer . The doctor has taken all her money as well as her only bit of jewelry , a ring belonging to her mother , and has secured her promise to pay him five hundred dollars more . She is utterly in his power because he threatens otherwise to notify her mother . She confesses all to Bill , who has fallen in love with her , and he swears to expose the racket ; but before he can take any steps she manages in desperation to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus all is made right . The sinners land in jail , and the heroine , a slightly wiser and little sadder girl , is united to Bill . Here you have several of the elements common in these stories . You are meant to feel nothing but sympathy for this dear little victim of wicked men , who , if she was n't quite bright , is only the more appealing for it . Also ? and this is most important ? she had no desire to refuse her baby , inconvenient as its presence would be , for to do so would be to offend one of the strictest canons of the " confessions , " ( In another story the heroine considers an illegal operation , but is brought to better things by hearing a Christmas service , and her young man , also softened by the carols , carries her off to the nearest minister . ) A third element can only be described as self-pity . The narrators , whether they have or have not sinned , usually feel that they are put upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of martyrdom is there . The persecutors may be tangible flesh-and-blood villains or , as I have said , inexperience and sudden temptation ; but whatever happens is always the persecutors ' fault . Still ? and here is a fourth rule ? actors must suffer for wrong-doing , no matter how innocent . But while the punishment is quickly visited , one is not given the impression that it is ever lasting . With the exception of True Story , which makes its sinners bear consequences indefinitely , these magazines present the happy ending as unfailingly as do their humble cousins , the " pulps . " It may be argued that the happy-ending convention has had a serious effect on the generation now middle-aged . Before 1890 the " popular novel " was represented by the works of such writers as Gyp , Ouida , and the Duchess , which were quite frank in their divorcement from daily living . Then came the first trickling waters of the flood on the later crest of which rode George Barr McCutcheon , Meredith Nicholson , Robert Chambers , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enchantedly and clandestinely , at about the age of fourteen . Even though the heroes and heroines could not exactly be identified with our own friends and relations , the settings were as a whole lifelike enough to allow the much more exciting identification of ourselves , a few years hence , with the Stephens and Sheilas who loved so strongly and so purely . From them we deduced that a happy marriage was ensured by the engagement kiss detailed on the last page . That maintaining any agreeable human relationship requires constant hard work never occurred to us until in later years we had our noses rubbed in the mess which our own stupidity made . The serious novelist of to-day may give a most dispiriting picture of holy wedlock , but surely the sandy wastes he presents are less dangerous country for the ignorant to wander in than the cloudland to which the hero and heroine of the 1900 's retired directly after the wedding breakfast . With the " confessions , " however , time has in this respect stood still . Given the usual plot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illicit love-affair , I should say that the happy-ending convention followed in their offerings has implications more serious than in the young-love magazines , where issues and emotions are alike trivial . Symbolizing the difference is the fact that in the latter the illustrations are of the Nell Brinkley school , only ever so much worse , whereas in the former the method used is photography . To pound into empty heads month after month the doctrine of comparative immunity from the consequences of uncontrolled action can not be particularly healthy . Granted that the actors suffer for a time , as they always do , it is a very short time , and the resolving chord on which the stories end sets , or promises to set , the key for enduring happiness . The chance-got babies are always legitimized by repentant wedlock , the raffish , free-forall girl finds a devoted husband who forgets her past as completely as she does . Here is an account of a young couple who decide to be modern and dispense with the wedding service because the man associates marriage with children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so they are married , and when the baby comes he enjoys it as much as does its mother . But she fears losing him if she grows too domestic , takes a job again , and leaves the baby in the care of an ignorant maid while she and her husband fossick round the night clubs after office-hours . One evening , when they are both drunk , they arrive home to find the house on fire and child and nurse burned . A few lines of narrative serve to describe their distress , and then comes a row of asterisks , after which we begin afresh . They now have two more children , whom they both love devotedly ; the mother stays at home and gads no more , and the husband adoringly provides for all of them . One is given to understand that the burning of the first child , regrettable though it was , was merely a salutary lesson , quickly learned and then dismissed , to teach them the delights of domesticity . Well , I know a woman whose carelessness was responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome was very different from this . V Perhaps I am taking these magazines too seriously ? overestimating their power . People in real life go by the trial-and-error-method ? what works and what does n't work . I am sure that in my grown-up years it would never occur to me to do or not do a certain thing because a character in a book did or did not do it . But I do know that my thinking , such as it is , has all my life been influenced by my reading , and if one 's habit of mind does not mold one 's habit of action , what does ? It is impossible to believe that the chronic reader of " confessions " has much traffic with good books . But there may be another aspect to this . I have said that the public in question is on the whole made up of fairly stern moralists . The editors of the " confessions " are psychologically sound in their discovery that such readers like a little dirt , but that great care must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recipe calls for plenty of erotic excitement ( but it will be dust in your mouth ) , a hint of slimier vices such as the malpractitioner 's ( can such wickedness bet ) , and a large proportion of sweetness and light in the form of toddling babes , mother-love , and the magic of the home . Thus the wife of the Methodist undertaker gets a good , strong " kick , " and at the same time can persuade herself that the point d'appui is her moral sense . A deep and essential dishonesty exists in the muddled brain which would shudder away from D. H. Lawrence and yet will accept the veiled sexuality of the confession-magazine . Immaturity lies at the root of this mental confusion . To a small child , pretending is as natural as breathing , because the outlines between fact and fancy are blurred . He says , " This chair is a lion " and straightway it begins to roar at him . When in later years the mists lift , the adult sees through that fading belt of golden haze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality . If truly adult , he will make his occasional jumps into day-dreaming only as a conscious indulgence , rather absurd and lots of fun . But to the person whose mental life is set at the age of seventeen , the gulf never becomes visible , and the haze , though it has lost its gold , still clouds his perception of truth . When I think of the effect of these magazines on their readers ' lives I imagine such scenes as this . Here is a prettyish woman in her thirties , who soon after leaving high-school some fifteen years ago married a young druggist . They are driving home from a bridge-party . It is a delicious summer night , and over them hangs the same flourishing moon which is responsible for some of the highest moments in her pet romances . But instead of a voice deep with passion hymning such themes as " this thing is too strong for either you or me , " she hears the familiar nasal tones of her Albert lifted in complaint of the follies and vices of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , sees not the thrusting jaw , the steely eyes , now tender , of the born leader of men , but only Albert . It does not occur to her to compare herself to the arrowy , blazing girl who rouses such warm emotions in the current hero . She only questions Albert 's adequacy , and finds it far from striking . After a few moments he snaps at her for her indifference . She snaps back at him , and the drive ends in a sour silence . Once home and in bed , she spins idylls of someone who really understands her , and leads them on to climaxes modeled on her afternoon 's reading . Now multiply this trivial picture over and over again in the life of a single person and the result is the waste of a happiness that might have been secured by facing facts instead of running from them . I do not claim that in this legend of the druggist 's lady the confession-magazines are entirely responsible for her dismal married life ; but I do think that they feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading is frankly an escape as well as a means of diversion or instruction . Whether this is healthy or unhealthy depends on the particular avenues to which it opens the doors ? and also on whether we walk or run down them ; for a terrified flight into poetry may estrange the cultivated mind from actuality as subversively as cheap fiction does the less educated . One 's chief quarrel with those magazines , both " pulps " and " confessions , " that deal entirely with love , is with their assumption that only sex is exciting . But after one has done with one 's criticisms and moralizings there remains the conviction that most of these readers are not having much fun out of life . Divorced from the soil , deprived by machinery of the workman 's pride in what his hands have made , their minds plowed and harrowed by elementary education but as yet unsoftened by the faint , rewarding green of growing seed , how should they be other than raw and incurious ? Perhaps with better living conditions and shorter hours of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the desire to find out what there is in this " literature " of which , in grammar school , their teachers spoke so favorably . Perhaps not . I do n't know . But certain it is now that " the hungry sheep look up and are not fed . "
