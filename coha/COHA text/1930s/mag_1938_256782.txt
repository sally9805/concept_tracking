While two batches of dirty Leftist linen underwent vigorous washing last week ( see above ) , Premier Dr. Juan Negrin announced he would go on the air at Barcelona , short-waving to the world . Punctually at the appointed hour Rightist bombers , . Rightist radio interference and Dr. Negrin all spoke up . As a broadcast the speech was ruined , but cables carried Dr. Negrin 's words by dot &; dash . The Leftist Premier , seeking to ward off a peace perhaps soon to be dictated to Spain by the Great Powers which dictated to Czechoslovakia , keynoted to the world public : <P> " Listen well . We know a Fascist triumph would signify our total extermination . All right , then , before parceling Spain , exterminate us . <P> " Peace can not be achieved by trying to fix fronts or trace artificial frontiers between Rebel and Loyal zones . That never ! If any Spaniard even admitted that possibility he would be committing the crime of high treason . <P> " How , then , can peace be restored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal of the invader . Restore to us our trampled-on rights as the legitimate Government . In a few months , perhaps in a few weeks , peace will come spontaneously . " In short , without foreign intervention and with belligerent rights granted to the Government , the Leftists claim they could soon lick Generalissimo Franco . <P> Significantly , the Associated Press reported that France was on the point of withdrawing its Ambassador from Leftist Spain . The United Press reported that Dr. Negrin was on the point of resigning as Premier , perhaps to be replaced by one of the available politicians who served as Premier of all Spain before the outbreak of the war .
