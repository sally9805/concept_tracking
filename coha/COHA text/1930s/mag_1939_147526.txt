The Straw Hat Revue ( music &; lyrics by Sylvia Fine &; James Shelton ; produced by The Straw Hat Company ) . Broadway is always hoping for an intimate , brightly satirical revue as good as - or as good as they seem in retrospect - the first Garrick Gaieties , the first Little Show . It somehow never gets one . The will may be there , and even the wit ; but the paradox that a top-notch intimate revue must embody - to be slick while seeming spontaneous , fast while seeming leisurely - is a theatrical labor of Hercules . <P> Direct from a summer camp in the Pennsylvania hills the latest try arrived last week on Broadway . The Straw Hat Revue is much less ungainly than the usual country cousin . It is genial and imaginative . It has neat touches . It displays impudent , citrous-faced Imogene Coca . At its best , as in its gusty burlesque of a romantic operetta or Comedienne Coca 's take-off of jabbering Carmen Miranda in The Streets of Paris , the revue is bright as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not come down on the beat . Sketches dawdle , jokes wait around for their echo , satire goes in for italics , Comedienne Coca makes the same pert faces too often . The whole thing needs tuning up - new city clothes , a manicure , a hairdo . <P> Show Business <P> Banned from a London revue last spring as an insult to the heads of foreign states was the song Even Hitler Had a Mother , Even Mussolini Had a Ma ( TIME , April 10 ) . Last week the song was being boomed out with gusto and impunity in another London revue . Benito ( by the fortunes of war ) took the rap along with Adolf . <P> Last week in Millburn , N. J. Crooner Rudy Vallee made his formal debut as a legitimate actor . Critic Sidney Whipple 's verdict of Crooner Vallee 's acting : " Save in the hands of some virgin direct from an academy of acting , I have never seen a less animate performance of a role . " Of his lovemaking : " It was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Lady 's Book . "
