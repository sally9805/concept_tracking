Most important business event of last week was the opening of Congress and the jack-in-the-box stockmarket which it produced . Up on Franklin Roosevelt 's mild opening message , stocks flopped on the next day 's offering of his 1939 budget figures , with their near-record deficit ( see p. 13 ) . <P> That the stockmarket should react unfavorably to indications of continued pump-priming was proof of business ' confusion . Heretofore , such pump-priming talk has boomed the market , and even Wall Street admits that sharp curtailing of government largess would toboggan stock prices . Last week 's pessimism apparently stemmed from the realization that new deficits may mean new taxes . But this was one matter on which Congress gave signs of having its back up . <P> What else Congress might do to or for business was equally conjectural . First on the House list was the Patman chain-store tax bill , designed to put interstate chains out of business . Other dire legislation may come from the monopoly hearings to be resumed next week . On the plus side , business anticipates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads , pleading on bonded knees for legislative aid , seem fairly sure to get it .
