IN using the press the other day to lecture a Congress which was showing signs of plunging into an illogical and uneconomical spending spree Mr. Hoover declared that " prosperity can not be restored by raids upon the public Treasury . " We agree that prosperity can not be thus restored . We go even farther and assert that raids upon the Treasury should never be tolerated whether they come disguised as tax refunds , or as special grants to the farmers or other classes , or take the more indirect form of high tariff rates . At the moment , however , the question is not one of pouring forth the taxpayers ' money without reason , in the hope that if only enough money were spent we should all be wealthier and happier . The question is one of finding sufficient funds to finance a sensible and constructive plan for dealing with the unemployment problem . Mr. Hoover 's suggestion that this can not be done without looting the Treasury , a method that we agree must be ruled out , is wholly misleading , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grasp the magnitude and gravity of the problem before the country . The Treasury need not be raided . Mr. Hoover has means much closer at hand for obtaining the necessary funds . It is his duty to the country at all times , but particularly so just now , to see that the public finances are carefully managed . Sound and honest economy would be productive of funds much larger than the mere $150,000,000 Mr. Hoover has asked for unemployment relief , and they could be used not only in dealing with that problem , but in meeting other special situations due to the economic depression in which the government can take action . Careful financial management should begin with the new budget , which calls for expenditures in the fiscal year 1931-32 totaling $4,667,845,468.07 . This is an increase of approximately $230,000,000 over the total appropriations for the current fiscal year . It is more than reasonable to ask why an increase in government expenses is necessary in this period of depression and falling prices . Retrenchment would seem the wiser policy . Certainly the increase of $110,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this item almost a billion dollars , might be examined with a view to further economy , especially in light of the past history of this division of the government . Another questionable item is the $100,000,000 increase for the Federal Farm Board , obviously destined to be used for speculation in a vain effort to help the farmers . Similarly , the $690,000,000 asked for the military arm of the government could stand close scrutiny with a view to saving many millions of dollars . Mr. Hoover has stated that the construction of certain naval vessels was delayed pending the outcome of the London conference . There were no disastrous results from this de -- lay . Why not postpone for a few years the $170,000,000 of naval construction planned for 1931 , or still better , abolish it altogether ? But all the responsibility does not rest with the executive branch of the government . Congress , too , must watch the taxpayers ' dollars . Bills for the expenditure of $500,000 for unneeded improvements here or of $20,000,000 for ill-. timed construction there under the guise of relieving the jobless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding and flagrant example of this thoughtless waste is the proposal to convert the war veterans ' bonus certificates into cash . Senator Vandenberg of Michigan wants a full payment , entailing an outlay of about $3,000 , - 000,000 ; Representative Fish of New York has urged a 25 per cent payment , making a total of about $750,000,000 . Secretary Mellon has already pointed out what a great additional load on the Treasury , and eventually on the taxpayers , the financing of either of these proposals would involve . Moreover , the basic economic position of the war veterans would not be one whit improved by this uneconomical gift , nor should we be any nearer a solution of the unemployment problem . If Mr. Hoover , instead of stupidly closing his eyes to his own responsibilities in the situation , had presented Congress with a definite plan looking toward a sensible solution of the unemployment problem , or if he had otherwise demonstrated that he appreciated the seriousness of the country 's economic plight , perhaps he would not now be faced with this barrage of pork-barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of Congressmen are , " playing politics at the expense of human misery " ; neither can it be denied that far more of them , seeing the problem more honestly than does the President , are conscientiously endeavoring to be of some help to the country in the present crisis . They have plenty of courage ; what they Lack is leadership and guidance . Mr. Hoover has failed to supply the necessary leadership . His assertion that the small sums he has asked for represent " the extreme sums which can be applied by the federal government " toward meeting the present emergency has failed to convince either Congress or the country . If he would set forth certain concrete proposals designed to ? deal with the situation as far as it is legitimately possible for the government to go , he would win the support of the public and compel Congress to follow him rather than its own individual whims . The requisite funds could quickly be found . An examination of the budget reveals that a much larger sum than the $150,000,000 Mr. Hoover has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be done without resorting to anything that looks like a raid on the Treasury . And should this sum prove insufficient , federal taxes could be adjusted in such a way as to increase revenues without placing too heavy a strain on productive industry or on the country 's purchasing power . Indeed , an adjustment of federal taxes that will deal more equitably with top-heavy incomes and excess earnings appears in any event to be essential to a sound economy . This would bring about a more equitable distribution of income and thereby help greatly to stabilize our economic order , which in itself would serve to reduce or prevent unemployment . More than that , unless the federal government utilizes the present crisis to devise such measures for the prevention of like disasters in the future , we are little likely to give any attention to the matter in times of prosperity . It is a pity now to waste time in bickering . The End of the Chapter I.-T is a relief to know that the Preparatory Commission on Disarmament has at last gone the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiring of the headliners ' standing items will no longer have to be given a place in the news . The speeches at the final session were in keeping with the record of more , than five discordantears. , M. Lunacharski reminded the delegates that Ailey had rebuffed all the efforts of Soviet Russia to save the proceedings from " sterility , " and characterized as " fictitious " the so-called disarmament methods by which , as it seemed to him , the Powers were merely trying to strengthen , their own positions . Count von Bernstorff , who had seen most of the German suggestions swept aside along with the , Russian , hoped that the general disarmament conference , which , is expected to meet in 1932 , might be more considerate. : Lord . Cecil agreed with M. Lunacharski 's criticisms , but went off quickly on an oratorical appeal to the world to do its duty , while M. Massigli announced that doubting France would come to the conference " with the will to do her utmost " provided , of course , that the little item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished speaking he had let the tired delegates know in plain language- that their work was a great disappointment to the United States , and had dropped a disturbing hint that unless the governments came to the conference prepared to do more than the commission proposed , the last end of the business might be worse than the first . If there were any flowers in memory of the deceased , the press dispatches failed to mention them . Yet the debates of the commission have not been without their lessons and their fruits . The world knows now , better than it appeared to know five years ago , that the reduction or limitation of armaments is a difficult matter , that if the task is left to military and naval experts it will never be done , and that the politicians are fertile , only in objections . It has been made clear beyond peradventure that the KelloggBriand pact is as yet only a scrap of paper as far as aiding disarmament is concerned , and that the two governments which sponsored the pact still lead the armamentrace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , even if the years spent in making them leave the problem of disarmament pretty much where it was . Not wholly where it was , however . Bearing in mind that the commission was not expected to insure disarmament , but only to show how disarmament might be accomplished if the nations chose to undertake it , the commission has dissolved leaving something to its credit . The draft treaty which has been drawn up for the consideration of the conference does at least suggest a method , and works out tentatively a good many of the details . It commits the conference to - the reduction and ' limitation of military , naval , and air forces of all kinds , to strict regulation of the distribution of naval tonnage and the transfer of tonnage from one category to another , to the budgetary limitation of expenditures for war purposes , to the abolition of the use of poisonous gases or other substances as instruments of warfare , and to full publicity regarding armaments . To be sure , the absence of specific figures of limitation leaves the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thefigures too high or juggle them , but there is at least a prescription blank ready to be filled in . Perhaps , on the whole , this is as far as the commission should have been expected to go . The great shortcoming of the agreement is that it passes on to the conference precisely the same technical disputes that have again and again balked the commission , and with them the troublesome question of national security which the French and their allies have all along insisted must be settled before the work of disarmament can begin . The treaty itself represents only a nominal agreement on the part of the commission , for it is shot through with reservations made by various Powers , among them an extraordinary reservation in favor of the Baltic states , intended , apparently , to bring Russia to their terms . Moreover , virtually the whole treaty may at any time be suspended for any Power which thinks its security menaced , the suspension to continue until such time as the other signatories shall have met and given their advice . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . It remains for those who still believe , in spite of the small progress thus far made , that disarmament by international agreement is possible , to do what they can , in the interval of a year or more before the conference meets , to make sure that conciliation and enlightenment shall bulk larger in the proceedings of the conference than they did in the work , of preparing for it .

Censoring the Stage T HE unequivocal statement issued recently on the subject of play censorship by the Dramatists ' Guild of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone intelligently interested in the welfare of the theater . The statement , after protesting against recent attempts to censor the stage , points out that the existing law against obscene plays covers every possible angle of the situation , even going so far as to prohibit a play that will " tend to the corruption of the morals of youth or others . " But the dramatists go farther and declare : . . . the development of an adult theater in an adult civilization is dependent upon the free discussion of any and all debatable subjects , whether in the field of religion , economics , politics , or morals , and the dramatists announce their intention of resisting to the limit the forces of repression and intolerance which , under the pretense of fighting obscenity , may seek to strike another blow at American freedom . This is very handsome plain speaking and brings the issue down to its fundamentals . For it is plain that obscenity is only a minor issue in the campaign to censor the stage . There are in New York revues , burlesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without molestation from the police or anybody else , and which present frank and open smut in its most undisguised form . But let a- play discuss , from an unconventional angle , Marriage , divorce , " free lOve , " let it seem to champion birth control , let it make a jest of adultery , and the censors are hotfoot after it  --  the public must be protected against these subversive ideas . Moreover , not alone in the field of morals and social behavior must this protection extend . We must not expose our tender-minded New York public to wicked ideas about revolution , to disparagement of the United States government , to disrespect , if seriously expressed , for our national institutions . The motion-picture censorship goes so far as to frown on disrespect for the prohibition laws ! It is worth while to stop and ask who are the persons who wish to censor ideas presented in the theater . Complaints against a given play are made by an individual , but it is safe to say that the Society for the Suppression of Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic church , the Anglican church , the Christian Scientists , who are notoriously the most ardent censors , do not consider it good politics to come out in the open with a complaint . If they did , it would put the situation on a much clearer footing . For if the Catholic church stands squarely against birth control , for example , as of course it does , it might in all fairness warn its followers against plays which discuss the subject favorably ; which is a very different matter from invoking , directly or indirectly , a law which will operate against Catholics and non-Catholics alike . John S. Sumner , secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice , has recently formed a " Citizens ' - Committee for Clean Plays , " with the avowed purpose of resisting attacks upon the present obscenity laws . It is rumored that efforts will shortly be made to pass a city ordinance requiring all plays to receive a license from the licensing bureau  --  a clean bill of health , that is , from the standpoint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this effect has yet been made , it should meet with protest from all persons interested in " an adult theater in an adult civilization . " They may be warned that while the passage of a law at Albany which would extend the power of the censorship regulations requires more strength than its proponents could muster at present , a city ordinance would be much easier of passage , and obviously every pressure would be brought upon the licensing bureau to keep unwanted plays off the boards . The Dramatists ' Guild is quite right in believing that every effort should be made now to keep the censor in his place . It is right also to go farther and say that the censor has no place . The adult public is perfectly able to decide for itself what plays offend the public mores ; and by refusing to attend a play that does , it exercises the only censorship that should exist in a free state . The truth is that the public mores are changing , now and always . Especially in the matter of language , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is or is not permissible are different from what they were . We hear on the stage what we hear , not infrequently , in the drawing-room . Even our maiden aunts sit composedly by and listen to an intimate discussion of family relationships . The time may very well come when we shall see a reaction against this free thinking and free speaking . The female leg may again become a limb and to display it may become an impropriety . When that day arrives the American public will be its own censor ; mean-while it has given ample proof that it does not want one superimposed by anybody .
