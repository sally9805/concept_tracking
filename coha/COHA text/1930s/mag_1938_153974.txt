Fortnight ago , the price of domestic copper took another drop , from 10 to 9 a pound . Last week , Mountain Con , one of the two U. S. air-conditioned copper mines , and the Belmont , both at Butte , Mont. , were shut down by Anaconda Copper Mining Co . To Anaconda , world 's largest producer of copper , the domestic price cut symbolized U. S. Depression . It also marked another downswing in another copper cycle . <P> During the World War , copper shot to 27 , subsequently ranged from 12 to 17 until the boom in 1929 , when it averaged over 18 ; in 1932 it dropped to 5 . Last year , with war abroad and U. S. industry in better shape , the price rose as high as 17 . Under this lure , production in the U. S. and abroad rose to high levels . Then demand began to slacken ; prices fell ; production was curtailed . <P> Last week , with demand and prices still falling-on the London Metal Exchange copper dipped well below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the red when copper brings less than 9 a pound . Momentary relief came at week 's end when German censors , after 15 days ' delay , finally released figures on the Reich 's copper stocks. * With these in hand , April foreign copper statistics could at last be compiled . These showed that foreign stocks of refined copper were reduced during April from 197,470 to 185,916 tons ; that world refined stocks , with American production included , increased only slightly ( 1.327 tons ) in the month . Copper men had thought more was hanging over the market . <P> Thus copper , an excellent gauge of business pressure , showed foreign industry still moving under good steam . But in the U. S. pressure remained low . The latest Federal Reserve index of industrial production ( for April ) stood at 17 , down two points from March . Statisticians guessed that by last week it had dropped another point or two . Other metals besides copper reflected this trend : Scrap steel and tin were off slightly for the week , lead was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawdles over its war material figures , Japan now makes public no metal statistics at all , Russia gives out only partial data .
