AUGUSTA AND THE BREWERS ' BIG HORSES A STORY BY DOROTHY THOMAS F ORTY years ago no one could have made me believe things would ever come to such a pass that the children of those that were strongest in the Fight for Temperance would become indifferent to it . All I hope and pray is that the Lord will raise us up a few women like Nancy Carr and Mollie Brigham and Effie Short'off and maybe one Augusta Ann Fairchild . Augusta was an elocution teacher in a school in New Jersey before Mr. Fairchild married her and brought her here . Mr. Fairchild was a widower . His first wife died when her fourth boy was born , and a couple of years later Fairchild went East and married Augusta . I 'll never forget the first time I saw her . She came into church with Mr. Fairchild and those four little boys . She had on a black dress , out of respect to the first Mrs. Fairchild , I guess , because red was the color she wore most , and a hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two oldest boys on one side of her and the two smallest on the other and took off their sailor hats and smoothed their hair and patted their collars down . There was just a sigh of pleasure went over the whole church at the sight of her . She was one of those women born to have a pleasing power over people . The second time I saw her was at the reception in Fairchild 's big brick house . He owned the brickyard and there was n't a better fixed man in town . At the reception , she wore a red satin with leg-o ' - mutton sleeves and a Battenberg collar and the new gold watch and chain that had been Mr. Fairchild 's wedding present to her , with her hair in a psyche and bangs and the prettiest little curls at the back of her neck . I said to Nancy Carr that night , " What a power that woman would be if we could get her to come in with us . " But I was afraid she 'd never do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was the way Nancy was , and she walked right up and asked her if she 'd come to the W , C. T. U. meeting the next afternoon , and she said she 'd be glad to . Maybe you think we were n't pleased when Mr. Fairchild let it out she 'd been an elocution teacher , for we certainly had need of her . And when we found out that Augusta had already won the silver and the gold medal in the Demorest contests , and was eligible to try for the Grand Gold , Nancy Carr wrote in to headquarters to see if we could n't get the next Grand Gold contest held here . Augusta offered to take charge of the Band of Hope and train the children in both songs and pieces so that we could put on a really big program the night of the contest . It was plain that her heart was in it and that she meant to help for all she was worth . It was just a little Band of Hope when she started with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had upwards of fifty children enrolled , all pledge-signers , and she 'd have the meetings right in her own yard and let the children ride the iron deer and swing in the lawn-swing and give them ice cream . And how she could get those children to sing ! She 'd sit at her grand piano in one of her red dresses , nodding her head to first one group and then another , and she had them singing three-part music before she 'd had the Band two months , and the boys whose mothers could n't have dragged them onto a platform were tickled to pieces to have Augusta give ' em a recitation to learn . She had children in the Band of Hope from every part of town , and when any of them came ragged enough to be conspicuous she 'd slip off upstairs with them and bring them down in some of her four stepsons ' clothes . Mr. Fairchild thought whatever she did was just right . They kept two hired girls all the time , and when Augusta 's baby came there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were all afraid she 'd give up the Band , but she kept right on with it up to within a month of her confinement , and the day the baby was two weeks old she had a meeting , with the bassinet beside the grand piano . We all felt that Augusta had proved herself , that elegance and riches had n't spoiled her , and she would fight beside us in the front rank to the finish . We had n't a doubt but that Augusta would win the medal . She had n't given out the name of the piece she was to speak , but we knew it would be good and that she was working awfully hard on it . The contest night was set for the eve of election day . We had five saloons in town , and we 'd set our hearts , God helping , on voting them out the 7th of November . While Augusta was still in bed she sent one of the Fairchild boys down to ask me to come up . I had n't seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet it was , Augusta pulled a tablet and pencil out from under her pillow and began to tell me about an idea she had for election morning . She 'd planned a whole parade , to start at seven-thirty so that the children could be in school at nine . The parade was to go down Main Street and around Courthouse Square , the children carrying banners and singing Temperance songs . She lay there against a drawn-work pillow in a white cashmere bed-jacket , with lace ruffles around her neck and sleeves , and her hair down in two braids over her shoulders , and her eyes a-sparkle with the joy of all her planning , like a little girl who 's thought up a new game and is wild to play it . I said , " Augusta Fairchild , you 're the prettiest thing I ever saw . " She wrinkled her nose at me and tapped the pencil on the tablet and said , " Look here at this banner I 've designed . " " Saloons MUST GO ! " it said , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of a snake , the snake 's head at the top of the capital S and the last S ending in rattles . She 'd drawn it out , as good a snake as you please . For a whole week before election day Augusta held rehearsals every night after school . She sent a note to Nancy Carr , asking her to hold up the printing of the bulletins about the Demorest contest until she heard from her . Nancy was President of the W. C. T. U. but she did n't ask any questions , for she knew that Augusta would n't make a request like that without good reason , and sure enough , the next . day one of the stepsons came down with a note that arrangements had been made to hold the contest in the Opera House . We 'd held all the others in the Metho-dist Church . With the wets as strong as they were in that town , we had n't thought for a minute that there was the ghost of a chance of getting the Opera House . Augusta had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an extra five hundred bulletins printed , at her expense , to send one to each post office in the county and to station a man at our post office to hand them out to all the country people who came in . How Augusta got the Opera House , I do n't know . She said she just walked into the Mayor 's office and asked for it , and that was all there was to it . The morning of the contest day , I was making butter . We lived on the edge of town and milked eight cows , five of them pure-bred Jerseys , and I always had quite a churning . I put up more than we could use , of course , and there was always a sale for it . One of Mollie Brigham 's boys always came before school in the morning and delivered the butter for me to the people who used it . I was just pressing out the last pound when the Brigham boy came that morning . His mother , Mollie Brigham , came with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful had happened . I wrapped the butter up in wet cheesecloth squares and put it in the basket and as soon as I 'd got the boy out the door I said , " Mollie Brigham , whatever 's the matter ? " Mollie sat there and just cried and cried . At last I got out of her what had happened . It seems Mrs. Fairchild had given Mollie 's son , Otis , a piece to speak for the program about a drunkard father who came home and beat his family and then took a pair of little white shoes , his wife had washed and saved up to buy for the baby daughter , and sneaked off to the saloon and traded them in on drink . Mollie said that just the night before Mr. Brigham had stood Otis up on thekitchen table to have him speak that piece for him and had sat there , pleased as punch with the boy . And then , after they 'd all gone to bed , if the Devil did n't put it into Brigham 's head to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd been saving up to buy Otis the tasseled shoes she 'd promised him he was to have for the program . There that man had n't been drunk for nearly a month ! Mollie woke up and missed him , but he did n't get home until real late and came in reeking with the stuff and his pockets empty . I told Mollie I 'd get Otis the shoes and take it out of my butter money , and she took her apron down from her face and said that was n't the idea , that the whole thing was wrong . Her working like she was all the time , and Brigham like he was part of the time , and then their money to go to Cash Benton 's saloon . She said something ought to be done about it beside singing songs and speaking pieces . Carrie Nation had done something , and she guessed the need was as great in our town , and if I 'd go with her and get Nancy Carr and Effie Shurtleff to go along , she 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon and get her cleaning money back , if she had to take it out of the money till , and I said , " Ali right , I 'll go with you . " We found Nancy accordion-pleating a skirt for her little girl to wear in the program that night , but she slid her irons right to the back of the stove , took off her apron , and said , " Wait till I get my collar on and I 'll be with you . " Effie ShurtlefT came out to meet us when she saw us turn in at her gate , and as soon as Nancy had told her what we were planning to do , she led us right to the wood-house and pulled a hatchet out of a cottonwood block and took another one down from the wall , and laid one in Nancy 's hand and one in mine ; but Nancy insisted that she 'd get her own hatchet . So we walked down AUGUSTA AND THE BREWERS ' BIG HORSES 743 Main Street , with the hatchets hanging in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus Harper 's Hardware Store , got her coin-purse out of her skirt-seam pocket and asked for a hatchet . Gus got down one with a red handle and said in a real smooth voice , " Do n't tell me you ladies are putting on a Carrie Nation act in the program to-night ? " He meant to be polite and playful , I guess , but there was a sneer in the back of his voice that did n't fool any of us . Gus Harper was sopping wet and hand-in-glove with the liquor forces . Nancy just gave him a look , and he sobered right up and began to wrap the hatchet , but Nancy said , " I 'll take it as it is , please , Mr. Harper , " and walked out with it . Out on the brick walk Nancy turned toward the south and Mollie said , " Where 're you going ? It 's Cash Benton 's saloon that my money 's in . " And Nancy said , " We 're going to get Augusta Fairchild . " Effie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carr , " she said . " She 'll never go with us . " Mollie feathered up at that . " I 'll bet she will , " she said . " Why would n't she ? She 's been right with us all along , has n't she ? " And Effie said , " Yes , she 's been with us  --  but I know her . You mark my word , Augusta Fairchild will train children and speak pieces , but she 'll never lift a hatchet for the Temperance Cause . That 's where she 'll draw a line . " And Mollie said , " Effie Shurtleff , I can see right through you like a window pane . You 're jealous of Mrs. Fairchild . " Effie blazed up and said , " You 're welcome to your opinion , Mrs. Brigham , and I 'm willing to satisfy you . Come on , let 's go up and ask her . " The Fairchild house was at the south end of Main Street , set back with ahedge and evergreens out in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As we came near the steps , we caught sight of Augusta , standing in the parlor near the grand piano . She had on a black dressing gown with a lot of lace on it , and she was looking up at the ceiling , with her bands clasped in the neck of her dress , like she was ready to rip it off , and a perfectly agonized expression on her face . Nancy did n't stop to ring the bell or anything , but opened the door and ran right in , the rest of us on her heels , calling , " Augusta Fairchild , whatever 's the mat-ter ? " Augusta came to meet us , holding out both her hands and laughing hard . She had a laugh that was a sort of birdish trill . She said she was just practicing her piece for the contest . She asked us to sit down and she dropped down on a little red footstool and sat there , hugging her knees , rocking back and forth , and laughing . She was so pretty about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All at once she noticed the red hatchet lying across Nancy 's knees and her trill broke off in the middle . Nancy did n't waste any time . She told her what we were aiming to do and asked her to go with us . The baby was lying in her cab , and Augusta got up and took hold of the cab handle and began to wheel the cab up and down the room . After she 'd wheeled it the length of their red carpet about four times , she turned around , there at the far end of the room , and put her hands on the handle of the baby cab behind her and lifted her chin and said , " Ladies , I can not go with you . I feel that this step which you are about to take is neither right nor dignified , and I can not believe that it would further the Cause . Indeed , I feel it would hinder it . I have been only too happy to train the children and to help the little I can by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join a hatchet brigade . " Her bosom was rising and falling like a singer 's and her cheeks were pink . We all looked at Nancy , but Mollie Brigham did n't give her a chance to say anything . She walked right up to Augusta , with her fists on her hips and her jaw stuck out and said , " Augusta Fairchild , you 've sure showed your colors . All you 're in with us for is for the glory and for the pleasure of showing yourself off on a platform . You 're a whited sepulchre , that 's what you arc , and we can take and break the saloons in this town without you . " She snapped her fingers under Augusta 's nose , turned on her heel , and made for the door . " Why , Mrs. Brigham ! " Nancy gasped , with her hand over her mouth , and looking at Mrs. Fairchild , trying to think of some word to say to lessen Mollie 's insult . Nancy was a gentlewoman if ever there was one and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. I never knew her to give offence to a single soul . But Mollie Brigham turned there in the double doors and said , " Are you coming with me down to Cash 's , or are y ' staying here to have her learn you pieces ? " Effie went to her , without so much as looking at Nancy , and Nancy and I went too , though Nancy turned in the doorway and made Mrs. Fairchild a little bow and said , " I 'm sorry . " All the way back down Main Street , Mollie walked a little ahead of the rest of us , mumbling to herself and jerking down her jacket . She had on a faded bottle-green jacket , over a gray calico wrapper . Really , she looked funny , but it was n't any time to think of that . How things began when we got inside the saloon is rather confused in my memory . Cash Benton came from behind the bar , shining the back of one of his puffy hands with a dish-towel he had tied around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the men that were in there stood around , still as the grave , to hear what she had to say . She 'd hardly opened her mouth , though , when Mollie stepped in front of her and let loose with her hatchet and shivered the mirror back of the bar and reached for a bottle with each hand and sailed them after the hatchet . Somebody hollered , " Here , you ca n't do that ! " But Mollie grabbed up two other bottles and yelled , " Come on , girls , " and we all lit in . You 'd be surprised if you knew how long those men stood around before any of them came out of their daze and dared raise a hand to stop us . Nick Townsend took hold of Nancy 's arm , and she struck him a sharp one with the hammer-side of her hatchet , and when he roared out and put the wrist between his knees , she laid her hatchet down on the bar and said , " I beg your pardon , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she stopped the rest of us stopped . Things were pretty well smashed up anyway , and the first thing we knew , there was the sheriff saying he 'd have to take us up to the jail . Some of the men protested , but Nancy said , " Let the law take its course , Officer . " We went with him . There was but the one jail , the one in the courthouse . To get to it , you go up the courthouse steps , along a passage and down some stone steps and in through a grating door . Lem Davies , the jailer , came down with his keys to let us in . That place was foul . It had one grated window , on a level with the ground , but waist-high on the inside . It was coated over with webs and piled high with leaves and trash paper in between the grating and the glass . At first we could n't see a thing . it was so dark in there . AUGUSTA AND THE BREWERS ' BIG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Effie Shurtleff 's , and she felt she did n't need to stand on ceremony with him . She made him pry open the window so we could get some air , and sent him to bring a light . There was n't a place to set it . There was absolutely nothing in that room but a cot-bed and a three-legged stool and , over in one corner , a granite washbowl and pitcher . He put the light down on the floor and made for the door , but Effie stopped him . " No , you do n't , Lem , " she said . " You 're not going to leave us in such a place as this . " He started shrugging his shoulders and saying there was n't a thing he could do about it , not without written permission from the Mayor or the County . Effie shut him off , and said , " You live here , do n't you , Lem ; have your rooms right over this jail , and full of poor Susie 's furniture yet ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of warm water and a couple of brooms and a mop and some soap . " " And lye , " Mollie put in . He brought the stuff down and we all pitched in and swept that place out and , though it looked and smelled a lot better , we decided it was n't fit to sleep in and sent Lem downtown to Gus Harper 's hardware store after five pounds of whiting and a new granite wash set . The place looked a lot lighter , by the time we got the whitewash on and the furniture in . The bed was n't fit to sleep on , so we just lifted the mattress off and told Lem to carry it out . He said he had n't another one to fit , and did n't know where he could get one , and Effie said , " You 've got beds , have n't you ? And some rocking chairs , too . I think there 's a willow rocker my folks gave Susie when she married you that could come through that door . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of one of their big beds . The mattress lopped over either side of the cot , so that it looked peculiar , but when we got the blankets and a couple of quilts on it that the ladies brought and put through the window-bars to us it was corn fortable enough . Women had begun coming as soon as it got around that we were in jail , and before noon we had all sorts of donations . Food , and even flowers . One woman brought a potted geranium . We had quite a time getting it . through . Reverend Campbell 's wife brought a rug to take the chill off the floor . It was the prettiest rug there was in the parsonage . It had a picture woven in it , of a big dog saving a little child from drowning . The ladies promised to take care of our children and husbands , to see that they were all looked after and fed and the children bathed and got ready for the program that night . Nancy had quite a time with her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have us out of there before supper time , but he could n't . The Mayor was out of town , stump speaking . The Judge was on circuit , Mr. Fairchild had gone to Chicago and would n't be home until the night train , and nobody would take any action . Nancy thought we ought to fast and pray for the contest that night and the election in the morning , but Mollie would n't hear to the fasting part of it . She 'd worked awfully hard and was hungry and said we ought to keep our strength up . We pulled the cot and the chairs close up to the window and sat there with the food and flowers on the wide ledge for a table and had a good dinner . Friends were stopping outside to chat every few minutes . It was n't only friends . There were those who came to scoff too . Mollie had a word for any of them with anything to say , for she 'd been so fiery all morning that there was no holding her down ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon on his way from school , she was so pleased to see him that she cried . She wrapped a drumstick in a piece of brown paper and told him to take it home to his father and to bring back the little shirt she was working the buttonholes in for him to wear that night . . . and if the little rascal did n't tie the sleeves of it to a yard stick that Hertzmeyer 's Dry Goods were giving away that morning and carried it all the way down Main Street , gathering other youngsters with yard sticks and singing , " We were so happy , till father drank beer , " all the way . We took turns working the button . holes , and a quarter of five , I think it was , we heard a funny bump , bump , bump on the stone stairs that led down to the jail , and then came the sheriff and Lem Davies , walking backward , and fairly tumbling over themselves to be nice to somebody . And then , a big wicker baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hanging onto the handle of it was Augusta Fairchild . She had on a red velvet skirt and jacket and a little black hat with a tanager wing on it and a black feather boa that hung clear to her knees  --  and was she pretty ! She thanked the sheriff and Lem for helping her with the baby carriage and nodded for them to leave , like they were a couple of Mr. Fairchild 's brickyard men , and when they had shut the door and started back upstairs , she dimpled around at us , like she could , and said , " Ladies , I hope I am not intruding ? " After a little she told us all about it . She had not heard what had happened until she went down to the Opera House to drill the children and found a man stationed at the doorway to tell her that the committee had decidedshe could n't have the Opera House after the scandalous happening of the morning . She said she went to see all the members of the committee that were in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from all over the county to the program , that it was no ordinary contest , but a Grand Gold , that only women who had already won the Silver and the Gold could compete in it , and no other building in the town was near big enough to hold the crowd . But the men were afraid , every one of them , and put her off by saying that the Mayor should decide , and they all knew that the Mayor was out of town and would n't be in until late that night . When she could n't get their permission to have it , she stopped in at the Methodist Church to tell the ladies who were working there that they 'd have to use the church that evening for the program . It looked almost impossible . The Methodist ladies , the dry ones , had been working all day on banners Augusta had designed for the children to carry in the election parade , and they had the place all cluttered up with strips of painters ' muslin and cans of paint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they 'd start , right in to clean it up and have it ready with the banners standing , one between each two windows , around the walls , and Augusta went on home . There she found one of her stepsons , Lying across his bed , sobbing away , his clothes all torn , and she got it out of him that he 'd been fighting and was crying because it was all over town that she was a " cowardy-ealf " for not going along to break up Cash Benton 's saloon . The baby had just waked up from her nap and was all in clean clothes and ready to go out . Augusta always wheeled her every afternoon it was fit . So she had the girl help her down the front steps with the baby carriage and AUGUSTA AND THE BREWERS ' BIG HORSES 747 wheeled right straight down Main Street till she came to Cash 's saloon . There was a crowd in there , viewing the ruins . They all fell back , of course , and quit talking when Augusta swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scraping . Augusta said he looked so trusting she almost lost her courage for a minute . Then she looked around , and saw the only mirror in the place that was whole , the one at the end of the bar , with a moulting buffalo head nailed over it . She reached down in the end of the carriage , under the robe , took out a brick , one of those sample bricks with " Fairchild " graved in it , that her husband used for a paperweight , and before anyone realized what she was about , let fly , and the glass came crashing down . Well , she had to ask for it before she got arrested . And even then they did n't want to do it . You see , Fairchild was the biggest man in town . He could make or break anybody on Main Street . Besides , Augusta was a beautiful woman and a mother . The Sheriff thought he 'd get out of it by protesting that she could n't possibly take the baby to jail . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she chose to walk , and I do believe she enjoyed it . She sat there on the cot , with the red-winged hat in her lap and one hand in the baby cab , playing with the baby 's fingers , while she was telling us about it . The baby whimpered , and she took it up and was fixing to nurse it and Effie Shurtleff fairly snatched it out of her arms and said , " Do n't you dare nurse that baby while you 're all excited ! Do you want to give it colic ? " Augusta laughed and said she was perfectly calm and held out her ringed hands , with the fingers spread , to prove it . And sure enough , there was n't a tremor in them . As soon as the baby was back in the carriage , Augusta said we had work to do , so we beat on the window rods with a slipper , like we 'd been doing to call Lem , and when he came down , Augusta told him to send for her two older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and notepaper . When they brought it , she sat down by the window ledge and wrote notes to half-a-dozen people , telling them just what to do to make the program go off right . Supper was even a better meal than dinner . There was chicken , and vegetables in covered dishes , pie , and if I remember right , six kinds of jelly . Nancy was the only one who did n't eat and eat hearty . She could n't help but feel that it would have been more fitting for us to fast , and anyway all the excitement had brought on her headache . After supper the girls coaxed Augusta to lie down and rest awhile , for the baby 's sake , and if she did n't go right off to sleep , one arm up over her head and a lace sleeve draping down over her forehead . All of our children came down to the jail to show how nicely they 'd been fixed up for the program . Somebody had finished the accordion-pleating on Effie 's girl 's dress and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the back and did n't show much . Before seven , the hitching posts clear around Courthouse Square were full . Effie was all for waking Augusta to tell her that there was such a crowd already that the Methodist church could n't begin to hold them ; but we could n't see that there was anything she could do about it , so Nancy would n't let her . I said that Davies had brought us a light . It was n't a lamp , but a lantern . Mollie had cleaned the globe on her petticoat , but it was one of those sputtery lanterns , I think the oil was n't good , and it cast up the sickest flickers on those white walls . People had been coming all day , like I said , but around eight o'clock , after the train had come in that brought three of the contestants and two of the judges , people let us be , and we sat and had a good rest . I guess it 's hard for anyone , now , to comprehend what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , there was a man named William Jennings Demorest who had a fortune and he certainly was a man of vision . He started the Demorest contests , and let it be known he had a barrelful of silver and gold and grand gold medals and half a peck of diamond ones , and that when they were used he 'd get more . And there were contests all over the country . All at once Nancy jumped up and clapped her hands to her forehead like she always did when she remembered something she 'd forgotten , and I knew there was more than her headache bothering her . She said , " Ladies , do you realize that Mrs. Fairchild 's arrest has made to-night 's contest impossible ? " We said it could n't be , but Nancy was right about it . The rules were that there must be five contestants competing for the Grand Gold Medal , or the contest could n't be held . Mollie said , " Well , I guess you 'll let me wake her up now , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the granite wash bowl and took a little scent bottle out of the carriage and poured some in her palm and patted her temples with it and said she felt much refreshed . Effie made faces at Nancy and Mollie that they were n't to say anything about the contest until after she 'd fed the baby . That baby was good as gold , and I ca n't remember that it made any fuss at all until after things got started that evening , and then its crying fit in just right , as you 'll see . Augusta sensed something was worrying us , and when Nancy told her she said she 'd thought of that before she went down to the saloon . She said she felt that the circumstances warranted some varying from the rule and that when we wrote in to headquarters and explained they would think it was quite all right to have held the contest with just four contestants . Nancy suggested we have a prayer meeting for the success of the contest , and I wish I could remember Augusta 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faith into us . And then , we 'd hardly got up from those cold stones before there was a blast of trumpet , a roll of drums and a swell of music that came like a direct answer . We all crowded to the window , but we could n't more than two of us see out at a time , and really there was n't anything to see , yet  --  but plenty to hear ! Then , they came ! Reverend Campbell 's fillies came first , without saddle or harness , and the two Jacobs boys that played comets in the band astride them , tooting for all they were worth . Behind them came the Band of Hope , marching four abreast , and carrying the banners we 'd made for them to use in the parade in the morning . And walking on either side the banner bearers were big boys with pitch torches . I can see those banners yet , with the torches flaring on them : " Choose the Right Path , Papa , I Follow in Your Footsteps , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " For God and Home and Native Land . " It was " The Brewers ' Big Horses " those children had taken it into their heads to sing , tramping as they came , and singing it in three parts , the way Augusta 'd trained them . It goes like this : " Oh , the brewers ' big horses coming down the road , Toting all around old Lucifer 's load , They step so high , and they step so free , But the brewers ' big horses ca n't run over me . AUGUSTA AND THE BREWERS ' BIG HORSES 749 Oh , no , boys , oh , no ! The turnpike 's free , wherever I go . I 'm a temperance engine , do n't you see , And the brewers ' big horses ca n't run over me . Oh , the liquor men arc acting like they own this place , Living on the sweat of the poor man 's face , They 're fat and 9ssy as they can be , But the brewers ' big horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and : " I 'll harness them horses to the temperance cart , Hit ' em with a gad for to give ' em a start , I 'll teach them how for to haw and gee , For them big horses ca n't run over me . " There was more , but I ca n't remember it . The crowd was right with them . Most of the people followed behind , but some of them ran alongside . The children turned in when they came to the courthouse grounds . The fillies trotted right up to the jail window and stopped there , prancing and blowing . And the children came on and lined up there in front , and after them , the crowd , with Reverend Campbell in charge , showing them where to sit . We never did find out for certain whose idea it was for them to come down to the courthouse , but come they did . It was Mrs. Fairchild 's program , and it was just drawn to her , like tacks to a magnet . They wheeled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a pair of red portieres that came from Davies ' parlor , and the contestants were handed up over the wheel and spoke from it . The judges sat on boxes nearby , their notebooks on their knees , marking them down for " Voice , Articulation , Memory , Gesture , and General Effect . " I never heard better readings in my life . The time and the place certainly lent power to the speakers . Think of it  --  that red-draped wagon , with the stone courthouse wall rising up behind , and the torches glaring , and all the people sitting on the grass . The Band of Hope sang between the recitations , and Augusta stood up on the ledge of the jail window and directed them , starting them off with a little pitch pipe somebody had run home and fetched for her . When the other four girls had given their readings , the children started chanting , " We want Mrs. Fairchild , we want Mrs. Fairchild . " The crowd took it up , so there was nothing for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it that an exception be made of her and she be let out long enough to speak . She said she 'd speak from the jail or not at all . She sprang down from the ledge , light as a feather , and ran over into the corner of the room where she could n't he seen from the window and called Mollie Brigham over there , and told her to get out of the gray calico wrapper she had on . Why , Mollie would have cut off her hair for her . She whipped out of that wrapper and did n't say a word when Augusta tore it into shreds before she put it on . Augusta asked that a torch be handed through the window . She blew out the lantern , and by the light of the torch ran her finger in around the chimney to get lamp black to black around her eyes . Then she let down her hair and ratted and snarled it up a little and took some whiting ( there was a little in the sack , left over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . She made some lines around her mouth with the lamp black too , and , I tell you , she looked ghastly . All that time outside the children were singing " The Brewers ' Big Horses " again , weaving around in among the crowd , each one with his hands on the shoulders of the one ahead of him , shuffling and tromping , so they sounded like a train , and singing for dear life . We did n't a one of us know what Augusta was going to speak . She 'd had her name put on the program with just the word " Selected " where the name of her piece should have been . Of course I did n't get to see it from the outside , but they said that when she climbed up there on that window ledge , in that ragged calico dress , with her hair hanging all around her face and her face old and ugly and too pitiful for words , and her hands , strained like claws , grabbing the bars , there were women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a man looked on unmoved . She spoke " The Maniac Mother . " I ca n't remember it all , but it starts : Stay , jailer , stay , and hear my woe . She is not mad who kneels to thee , For what I am , too well I know , For what I was , and what should be ! I 'll rave no more in proud despair , My language Shall be mild , though sad . But yet I 'll firmly , truly swear , 1 am not mad , no , no , not mad . My drunken husband forged the tale That chains me in this dismal cell , My fate unknown , my friends bewail , Oh , jailer , haste , that fate to tell . He smiles in scorn and turns the key . He quits the grate  --  I knelt in vain ! His glimmering lamp , still , still , I see . ' T is gone  --  and all is gloom again . There was a verse or two about her old father 's bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got to : Nast thou , my child , forgot ere this , A mother 's face , a mother 's tongue ? She 'll ne'er forget your parting kiss , Nor ' round her neck how fast you clung . There were more verses , about home and young motherhood and one that ends : Oh , now I 'll drive those thoughts away , They 'll make me mad , they 'll make me mad ! And it ends up : Yes , soon , for lo , the while I speak , Mark how yon demon 's eyeballs glare . He sees rne , now with dreadful shriek He hurls a serpent high in air . Horror ! The reptile strikes his tooth Deep in my heart , so crushed and sad . Ah , laugh , ye fiends , I feel the truth . Your task is done , I 'm mad , I 'm mad ! There was n't a doubt about who won the prize . Augusta would n't hear of taking it , after winning it under those circumstances , so the medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , herself , said Augusta 'd won and would n't hear of taking it at first . Fairchild and the Mayor got in on the night train from the south , thought there must have been a fire , and jumped in a cab and drove like mad over where the light was , and got there just in time to see Effie Shurtleff lift Augusta down from the window ledge . At first Mr. Fairchild did n't recognize her , and when he did he came through that crowd like a catapult and tore down those stairs , yanked the door open , picked Augusta up , and carried her right out of there , and the Mayor waived all legal proceedings and told all the rest of us to come on out . And I think nobody was as glad as Davies to see us go . We had the parade in the morning and the Drys carried the election , in face of the Wets ' hiring up all the horses from both livery stables and those in the three closest towns , too . Reverend Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other " dry " horses in town were on the go all day , bringing in the lame and the blind and all those Drys that did n't have a way of getting to the polls . Augusta did n't come down for the parade . Fairchild would n't let her out of bed . That evening Mollie and I went up to see her . She was lying on a long chair-sofa , in a dressing gown of rose nun 's veiling , with satin fluting round the neck and down the front of it . She had some New Ideas and some Ladies Horne Journals spread out all around her . Mollie started to apologize for the way she 'd talked to her when we came to ask her to go to Cash 's with us , and to tell her how grand she was when she spoke . Augusta just waved the apology away with her hand and asked her which she thought would be prettier , a red cashmere with appliqued trimming , in the Ladies Home Journal , or a red satin with cut-work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 'd depend on what you want to wear it for . " And Augusta said she was going to have it made up to wear in the Diamond Medal contest in Topeka in a couple of weeks , and when we asked her how that could be , she said the judges had telegraphed in to headquarters explaining the situation , and they had wired back that a grand gold medal was on the way . Of course , we were mighty pleased and when Mollie had quieted down a little , I asked Augusta what she was going to speak , and she blushed and reached out and laid her hand on a little book on the marble-topped table beside her . It was a redsatin-covered book with a mother-of-pearl clasp and the name " Augusta " worked on it in white . " I think I 'll ask permission to give a poem I am writing myself , " she said . " I have this little book of them I write for my own pleasure . " NOVEMBER BY MARVIN LUTER HILL N OVEMBER is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watery rhythms go flowing through it in tumbling floods . It has a courage that it is good to remember Not fain , like April , or troubled with March 's moods . It has a lovely completeness , like some task finished ; It is grayly-golden as a full-fledged plover , And sound as a chestnut kernel without its sweetness , And has but little interest in any lover . Foxes adore it , and the dull persimmon Turns to the color of a faded ember ; 11 has a fuller bin than the months before it , And a tranquil beauty that it is good to remember .
