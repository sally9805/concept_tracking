txt JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS . Should a Detalre to Commit Battery Be Expressed From the Bench ? To Ms Editor of The New York Tiniest : I have made it a hobby , during the past several years , to cull from newspapers and legal documents some of the unjudicial utterances of our judicial . officers . Unfortunately , the supply is Quite abundant , and only the other day a Brooklyn magistrate , Sylvester Sabatino by name , delivered himself of some gems of thought when there appeared before him a 17-year-old boy accused of gathering funds for a Communist purpose . He is reported as having expressed a desire to blacken the boy 's eyes . If that is accepted as a judicial function , why do we require a period of years of training as a lawyer as a prerequisite to the holding " of a judicial position ? The magistrate is perhaps a believer in the doctrine that the end justifies the means , for his avowed purpose was to pound Americanism into the boy . I wonder , though , what conception of Americanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives when It is " pounded " into him . And suppose the theory was actually carried into execution , how long and how severe would the beating have to be before we were satisfied that the boy had at least 61 per cent of Americanism ? in him ? But the prize thought was the expressed wish on the part of the magistrate to eject the boy from the high school he was attending . It would seem to me , if I were a judge ? I am only a lawyer  --  that I would have requested the high school principal to give added instructions to this boy , and others like him , and put in charge of this class a teacher well versed in psychology and sociology , who would reason with the boys on the merits of Americanism and the demerits of communism . I have an old-fashioned , abstract conception of a judge . He must be learned in the law , deliberate in his judgments , temperate in his utterances , dignified in his conduct , sympathetic in his attitude toward all who appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general culture , conversant with the arts and the sciences , and be of an open and receptive mind . These should be the attributes of all who occupy the judicial bench  --  civil or criminal , the highest or the lowest . IRVING SWEET . New York , Dec. 30 , 1929 . " The ' Purloined Letter . " To the Editor of The New York Times : May I , , as an English novelist to whom your country and your own reviewers have been kind beyond anything that I have deserved , intrude a few words in reference to your leader on the above subject ? I agree that the tale of the document sounds ' too good for probability , but it is not without numerous precedents . In the Edinburgh of the sixteenth century murder was almost as flourishing an industry as it appears to be in New York or Chicago today , but the dautious Scottish temperament required the underwriting insurance of , a *ritten document , and the " murder bond , " drawn up in legal form , - was a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassination of Lord Darnley is still in existence and bears the signature of most of the prominent political " bosses " of the time . Then , as now , the custody of the document appeared to present the greatest difficulty in the stage management at these incidents S. FOWLER WRIGHT . New York , Dec. 28 , 1929 , Senator Borah . To the Editor of The New York Times : You hit Senator Borah off quite neatly in your editorial today . Bopah 's prototype is to be found in Shakespeare 's " Much Ado About Nothing . " There the poet has depicted a refined traveler from Spain whom one of his characters refers to as One whom the music of his own vain tongue Doth ravish like enchanting harmony . FINDLAY SACTMTT . , New York ; Dec. 25 , 1929 . REPUBLICAN OVERSIGHT . Fundamentals Seem to Be Ignored in New York Discussion . To the Editor of The New York Times : There seems to be in all , this discussion of leadership of the Republican party in New York City and of the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete oversight of fundamentals . No one appears to have asked , " What is the Republican party ? " No one appears to have formulated a local platform or declaration of principles for the Republican party in New York . So we have the usual resuit that there are vague suggestions of or negotiations for fusion . Fusion with what , or with ' whom , and to what end ? My Republican lineage dates back to the organization of the party ; my grandfather , William Jessup , was one of its charter members . He himself read the platform at the Chicago convention at which Lincoln was nominated . To his five sons he handed down a Republican heritage , . and my father did the same to his four sons ; and it is my hope that my five sons after me . can see their way , with intellectual integrity , to stay in the old party . But what does that party stand for in the county of New York ? In the Republican campaign textbook for 1924 it is declared that the party was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , to uphold American traditions and to defend American institutions . There is nothing said in any of the platf9rms for the last sixty-eight years of the propriety or duty of fusion . I am perfectly ' aware- that if the Republicans of New York County should meet in a spirit of political sincerity and should adopt for the Republican party in its municipal relations a platform ' of high political principles , e. g. , declaring it to be their purpose , so far as municipal affairs were , concerned , rto always seek , select and support the best man for the particular municipal job , whether it was executive , administrative or judicial , it could never be a party to deals nor entertain the doctrine of bargain or compromise . Of course , it would probably lose one or two elections to begin with , because such a policy would seem so ideal as to lead the average independent to suspect this movement or to think there was " a nigger in the woodpile . " But if they demonstrated their sincerity by doing it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best man for the particular job ? it is perfectly obvious that in a few years , convinced of their sincerity , the inde- pendent voters of the city would enter the party ranks . If the present Republican leader had done this twenty years ago he would have built up a simply irresise tibie force for clean and efficient government in New York County . A common adherence to properly formulated principles will bring hit the , open the necessary leadership . They are shy in professing Republidt can principles , both State and national , In the city of New York . If the party , or individuals , could ine corporate as the Republican Associae tion of New York and the charted could contain a statement of these . principles , fundamental and elastic , and such corporation were instituted under the membership law and there were a membership fee or anual dues of $1 , there would be a fund immediately provided  --  ample enough to cove er all the expenses of administration , limiting the local secretaries to Congressional districts rather than to the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the charter of thteeparty ; and by quarterly meetings , including the annual meeting , the business of the association could be transacted by its duly elected officers , and by the familiar device of proxy to an outstanding group of a dozen wen each year the Republican voters of the city could safely entrust the shaping of the policies of the party to these outstanding men , who would then be deprived of the excuse that we have heard a number of them give when asked why they did n't get into the game and oust the perfunctory , leaders barren of ideals , that " the job required more time than they could give , and these fellows were on the job all the time . " If the various secretaries of such a league were salaried men accountable to the board of directors of such a corporation , and the primary ob . feet , regardless of immediate success at the polls , were to maintain Republican principles  --  the building up of a. party with real ideals to which the independent vote would be attracted ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enroll as a Republican at a primary involves no obligation  --  costs nothing ; whereas to subscribe to a declaration of principles framed by men - who have been outstanding exponents of those principles in State and national &life; for years , to peer annual dues and to contributes to b treasury controlled . by men of that type , would give , to the ordinary Re . publican of New York County , a feeling of self-respect , dignity and perhaps of ultimate hope . In the present situation one hardly cares to look one 's Tammany friends in the face . HEN . Y W. JESSUPNew York , Dec. 26 , 1929 ,
