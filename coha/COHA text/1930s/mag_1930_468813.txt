IT DID N'T occur to the generous backers of my grand opera who sent me abroad to finish the work in peace and quiet , that I would first have to become an impresario for German conks and nursemaids and that , innocently enough , T was going to be haled before the authorities of the Republic for violating the dole plan protecting servant girls over there . How could they ? or I ? know the strange pitfalls which await the American who walks innocently into the tangles of the German servant problem ? Like every other young American mother whom fate leads to Europe to set up housekeeping for a few years , my wife fell for the idea that in Germany at last she was going to find the ideal maid-of-all-work . Furthermore , according to all that her friends had told her , one who was accustomed to toil early and late at a salary so low that my wife would n't be able to believe it ? not in her wildest dreams . I tried to curb these , for Marguerite 's friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad ; what could they know about hiring and firing servant girls , discussing Art as they did over hot chocolate and pickles , instead of at a square meal on a round plate at their own table in their own apartment ? When we were crossing to Germany , I came into our cabin one afternoon and saw six pretty little white aprons which my wife had worn while singing an operetta role , spread out on the lower berth . " What 's the great idea ? " I inquired . " I want our maid to wear these when she trundles the baby around or serves that famous afternoon coffee cake you have been raving about , " she replied . " Listen . Your French and Italian wo n't get you anywhere in Germany . How are you going to tell your maid what it 's all about ? " " I 'll let you tell her , " said Marguerite calmly . " Maybe she will have long , blonde braids hanging down her back and Iteiss Gretchen . Wo n't that he romantic ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll hire your maid for you and do all the bawling out . Leave it to me . " We landed in the Dresden Havptbahnhof , where I parked the baby and his mother until I could secure temporary rooms at one of the station hotels . To place a want ad in the morning papers for a Madehea far altes would be quirk work ; and I planned that the next day I 'd chase around in a taxi , find a furnished apartment with no radios in the building , hire a maid , move in , and get to work on ray opera . My wife had to wait two hours in the station , for an Exposition was in full blast and most of the hotels were jammed . When I returned she had hidden herself and the baby in a dark corner of the station restaurant and was nursing the young despot to keep him from yelling his head off . She need n't have been worried for there were fifty other mothers scattered about doing the same thing . We piled into a taxi with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front seat ; four suitcases , typewriter , cane , umbrella , raincoats , a steamer rug , and a box of chocolates were heaped about us . Two porters hung on to the running boards . Our hotel was only a block or so away but it took us thirty minutes to get there . Taxi drivers are brothers under the skin the world over . The hotel elevator was out of order but an army of bell boys helped us walk up the four flights . I was surprised at the baby 's philosophical quiet . Ordinarily he was like an owl : he slept in the daytime and worked at night . It was two weeks before we found a suitable apartment and during that time my wife practiced her German interviewing maids whom I had told , down at the porter 's desk , that they would n't do , but who nevertheless had gone on upstairs to speak to the gnetclige Frau . It seemed that in Germany cooks were strangely reluctant to talk business with the man of the house . We finally selected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the apartment I had rented at the corner of Wienerstrasse and Richard Strauss Platz , only a couple of blocks from the home of Fritz Busch who , as General Music Director of the Dresden State Opera , would later on tell me whether my opera was good or bad . Agnes had answered my want ad in the Srbski Stovo , the Wendish newspaper published in Bautzen , and said that she could cook and that she loved children . Her picturesque , huge Wendish headdress made everybody stare but she could n't use my wife 's little " Rose Girl " aprons because she wore long skirts . We paid her $8 a month with room and board and were charged $2.50 a month extra for herroom in the attic , this latter sum being paid to our landlady , who was a rich bookbinder 's widow with three small children and for ten months eternally pestered me for free tickets to the Dresden Staatsoper . On account of Agnes 's striking costume we took her everywhere we went and she rode first class ? particularly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pillnitz to see where Weber finished his " Freischutz . " At the end of a month she was thoroughly spoiled , to the extent that she began taking taxicabs instead of street cars when she journeyed over to the Insel to do the marketing . My wife thereupon wrote a rest in that melody and the next time we went to Pillnitz told the girl to bleiben Sie zu Haase . But it was not until about two months after we started housekeeping that we collided with the government laws protecting servants against their employers . Going to the opera one night and discovering that the bill had been changed on account of the sudden illness of the prima donna , we returned unexpectedly ? to be greeted by the baby screaming at the top of his voice and no sign whatever of Agnes . After a fifteen minutes ' search about the neighborhood I finally discovered our maid down in our landlady 's kitchen with the other servants , pitifully begging them for a handful of potatoes and telling them that we had taken the butter away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appeared that Marguerite had asked her to put the butter on our table that day at dinner and had n't dreamed of telling the girl to cut off a piece of it for her own use . Another thing , we had not yet accustomed ourselves to the European afternoon coffee habit and it had n't occurred to us that German servants must have it . The second day Agnes was with us she had turned to me and asked if this were a house without coffee and I had paused long enough in my composing to tell her that there were five pounds of it on the kitchen shelf . Our expenditure for food was recklessly lavish according to German standards and it had seemed sufficient to us simply to point to the loaded cupboard , store room , and refrigerator , wave our hands at the maid and tell her to help herself . But Agnes was being starved , and the domestic symphony was off key somehow or other as I stood there in that idiotic basement listening to a servants ' chorus . I shooed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet doors . My wife , clutching the baby , shrieked at Agnes and wanted to know what had she been doing , leaving " me-in Kind ! mein Kind ! " " There 's a whole sack of potatoes , rticht tcahr ? " I said to the servants passionately . " And eggs , butter , cheese , bread , meat , wurst , coffee ? no diamonds of course oh , what 's the use ! " The other servants looked at our maid sympathetically and said something that I did n't catch about the law being on her side . When I asked them if my wife was supposed to cut off a piece of butter and shove it down Agnes 's throat they backed away and left . Agnes gave us her two weeks ' notice then and there . The fact that she had neglected the baby during our absence did n't bother her in the least . My wife should have told her to help herself to the butter , our landlady explained to us later . " Is there any law about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the authorities side with the servant girls as a general rule and as servants are not allowed to help themselves without being specifically told to do so , in Agnes 's case you might have a hard time proving your defense if she carried her complaint into court . " As a matter of fact , food had nothing to do with Agnes 's notice to leave . She had merely seized upon that item as an excuse to get away . Her sister had obtained another job for her and she wanted to work where her sister worked . But the day she packed her bag she demanded a written " recommendation , " and I said I 'd be fried in butter before I 'd let my wife give her one , and in an hour she returned with an officer , who ordered me to give the girl a " recommendation " or explain it to the judge . We signed a statement to the effect that Agnes had worked for us for two months and had shown herself to be industrious . The wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . She had received a few packages of pancake flour from America but their maid did n't like American pancakes for breakfast , or at any other time . She had the run of the larder , of course , but decided that here was a good excuse to leave . One morning , after the family left the house , she tore a cold pancake in two and dramatically flourished it in the servants ' hall downstairs as " all the food that she had had for breakfast that morning . " When Mrs. Vice Consul returned the maid gave her notice , and as the law provides that a girl discharged , or voluntarily leaving a place , is entitled to an extra weekly afternoon off to look for another position , she started right out to hunt for another job . Another way to get out when they are tired of a position is for the maids to take a dose of something that temporarily makes them sick and then they can leave without notice on account of " illness . " We had a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attorney friend of ours he shrugged his shoulders and said : " It might be cheaper in the end to give the girl her ' recommendation ' and let it go at that . " II The next maid I hired for my wife and the baby was just an inexperienced , attractive country girl seventeen years old . Her mother brought her to us in answer to our ad , " Wanted . A Madchen fur dies , " and said that while Hilda had never been away from home before and could n't cook , she was anxious to learn , was used to children , and would he satisfied with six dollars a month . Hilda had pretty red cheeks , long blonde braids , a shy , slow smile , and an enchanting drawl ? but oh , she was dumb . Sweet and accommodating , however , even if the way she went about her work reminded us of a slow movie . The first morning she brought my early coffee into the music room she carefully moved aside a pile of music paper on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saucer and then naively sat down to enjoy it . Fixing me with her big blue eyes , she drawled : " Is n't it fine to have a job like the other girls ? " " But Hilda , " I said , " do n't the other girls eat in the kitchen ? " " I do n't know . You see this is the first time I ever left home . " " I 'm afraid there is n't room here for two cups . I have to spread my music all over the table to dry . " She got up obediently , then bent over to look at a wet page of manuscript . One of her long braids dropped on to the sheet and I let out a yell of protest . " Oh ! " stammered Hilda , " I 've got ink all over my hair ! " It took several days of patience and tact to put her in her place but she never did get over the feeling that she was my wife 's friend instead of a servant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying them on when she ran across a pair of rubber gloves . " What in the world are these ? " she inquired . My wife told her that she wore them when washing dishes to protect her hands . Holding them up at arm 's length , Hilda nodded her head . " Yes , " she said thoughtfully , " and would n't they he fine to wear out in the rain . " It was Hilda 's innocence ? as well as our own ignorance ? which nearly landed us all in jail ; it was she who introduced us to the Servants ' State Insurance problem , which has put such a burden on German taxpayers that it is little wonder the Reichstag has had to be dissolved and a dictatorship has been declared as I write this . She got us in trouble Kith the authorities in the following manner : I had taxied her over to the police station a few days after her arrival in order to register her advent . This must be done personally by the employer . The sergeant behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her and if it was paid up to date . It is called the Workers ' Invalidenkarte . She said yes , and handed it to me with her slow smile . Our landlady asked me about this the minute we returned . She said it was important ? that all employers had to pay approximately one-third of this insurance , and see to it that the jiggers that look like little postage stamps and are purchasable at any post office were properly pasted on the little printed squares provided for that purpose , and that this must he attended to each week . The dues for this insurance are rated according to the wages received ? in Hilda 's case , about fifteen cents a week . This entitled the girl to a home when she was old or disabled permanently , provided she could show properly filled cards for as long as she had been able to work . It is wise to assure yourself that this " invalid " card is kept in perfect order , otherwise you may run into the arms of the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautioned me about that . He thought it was too much bother to attend to his cook 's card , so he gave her the money instead and told her to look after it . But instead of buying the stamps she put the money in her pocket . When she left his employ she could n't produce her card at her next job and to vindicate her theft she swore she had never received a cent for the stamps in question . Against her mere word the protests of the vice consul fell to zero ; he had to appear before the proper authorities , buy a whole year 's stamps all over again , pay a big fine , and suffer a red-hot reprimand . After Hilda had been our " guest " for four months she cut her hand one day paring potatoes and with characteristic peasant carelessness washed it in greasy dish water , wrapped an old rag around it , and said nothing to my wife until her hand began to swell alarmingly and keep her awake nights with the pain . I sent her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sent the girl back for me . I stopped composing and went over to his office . He eyed me sternly . " This girl tells me she is not entered at the bureau of the State Sickand-Accident Insurance Benefit Company ! " ( In German , the Krankenkasse . ) " I do n't see what that has to do with me . If her hand needs lancing I 'll pay for the medical treatment , naturally , since she hurt herself in my employ . " " It has a great deal to do with you , " said the doctor accusingly . " Are you aware that Germany does not allow its working classes to be treated inhumanely by employers ? Are you aware that by not registering this girl at the main office of the State Krankenkasse you are liable to arrest , as well as a heavy fine ? " he thundered . " No , " I said . " I am a foreigner and know as little about such a rule asthis girl does herself , evidently . " Why did n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to register her at once . Meanwhile I must , of course , report you to the proper authorities . " Then he lanced Hilda 's hand and I paid the bill . Three days later I got an ominous summons from the Krankenkasse Bureau and I hot-footed it over to the American Consulate . " Well , " said the Consul General , " we 'll have to do something about this at once . This German Republic is rabid about protecting the worker from his employer and ignorance of the law is no excuse over here any more than it is in the States . I 'll telephone to the Bureau at once and see what can be done . " Then he asked me to step out of the room for a minute ? I suppose to spare my feelings while he ' phoned the officials that I was just a composer and did n't know anything about laws , other than the ones governing harmony and counterpoint . He made an appointment for me the next day and told me I must take Hilda along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? one as scared as the other . But our consul must have put up a strong talk for when we arrived the police were all smiling . I pleaded guilty to the charges as set forth in the indictment . Then , after a stern reprimand to us both ? Hilda being apparently as deep in the mud as I was ? I was let off by merely paying up four months ' back dues for the time Hilda had been with us . " Ach Gott , " whispered Hilda in awe as they were making out the receipt , " will we have to go to jail ? " Now the law specifically states that the servant must pay two-thirds of the dues out of her earnings , thereby being educated in thrift and providence , but when I mentioned that fact ( having read up on the law the night before ) the head official waved his hand and said yes , but that the girl was young and was n't getting much anyway , and that it would n't mean anything to a " rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances . Then he demanded Hilda 's lnvalidenkarte , but he could n't catch me that time for I had been smart enough to stick it into my pocket with my passport , birth certificate , marriage license , and the baby 's vaccination card , before we left the house . " Wait a minute ? these stamps are not dated ! " he exclaimed wrathfully . " Not dated ? " " Each and every one of these and subsequent stamps must be dated from week to week by you personally , in pen and ink . For not having done this you are again subject to a fine . " " I pass , " I said weakly . " But you 've taken all my money already , unless you are willing to have the girl go back in a street car instead of in a taxi . " " Rich , " he muttered ; " rich , these Americans . " Then , " Oh , go over there in a corner and date them now . But do n't forget it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed calendar , I sat down and dated sixteen stamps ? " 1/9/27 to 8/9/27 " and so on ? in the German fashion with the day ahead of the month . Thereafter , and as long as she worked for us at least , Hilda was entitled to free medical attention and hospital service if necessary . III We were to have another and still more interesting experience with German laws for the protection of housemaids after we moved to the little mountain village of Kipsdorf thirty miles outside of Dresden . The ' Ace we took was a summer cottage called Villa Idylle by its owners , an old couple who were obliged to rent it because they had lost all their money during the inflation period . Perched on a hillside in a grove of pines , with amountain brook hurrying through the garden , its six little furnished rooms and bath were a bargain at two hundred and sixty dollars a year . Only an hour 's bus ride from Dresden and a two-minute walk to stores , it was a haven of godlike peace and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lamented . I drove Hilda out there a day ahead of time to put the house in order . The pipes were frozen and the March air crisp at that elevation but she was country-bred and knew how to melt snow for water with which to boil the coffee . The next day a truck deposited our trunks , the piano , two canary birds , besides my wife and the baby , and my box of manuscripts . My wife was in ecstasies and the baby chortled with glee . Our new neighbors across the street , four cultured women who conduct a modern and efficient kindergarten , told my wife that she was lucky to get a loyal nurse girl for thirty marks a month , which we were paying Hilda by this time , but pointed out that for ten or fifteen marks more one could probably be found who could also cook . Hilda had never graduated from her first lesson in that respect . After we were settled her mother sent word to us that her daughter must have another raise in salary . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues were rated higher and I found that if we had moved thirty miles further it would have cost us still more , inasmuch as these insurance rates vary in practically every district . In Dresden the budget for Hilda had run as follows Paying all the insurance dues for eight months had therefore amounted to about 120 marks , which was four months ' extra salary . If the girl had paid her legal two-thirds stipulated by the government of Saxony , she still would have been three months ahead of the game each year . In other words , she was in reality getting forty marks a month instead of thirty , besides full insurance against illness , accidents , disability and old age , as well as free hospital service and free medical attention whenever necessary . This was clear as mud to Hilda , however , so when she demanded another raise and my wife said " Not this week , my dear , " I sent her over to the burgermeister 's office for enlightenment . She returned chastened , for they had found my figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , I celebrated by calling up Erich the touring-car man , and drove the whole family up to Altenberg on the Bohemian border where they skin cats and sell the furry hides as a cure for rheumatism . The next day the burgermeister told me privately that even if the State of Saxony decreed otherwise , it was customary , to save argument , for the employer to pay all of the servant girl 's insurance and let it go at that . Our neighbors at the kindergarten told my wife that another way to placate her maid would have been to give her five marks a month extra as a present , with the understanding that she pay her share of her insurance dues . Thus , from three sources ? the police station in Dresden , the burgermeister in Kipsdorf , and four representative German housewives ? it was admitted that this government intention of inculcating in its working classes a sense of financial responsibility for the future by forcing them to save a part of their wages , is a flat failure . Domestic servants all hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is theemployer who has paid all the dues ? not the servant . Unable to gain her point and getting the argonaut-urge , Hilda ate something that did n't agree with her ? American pancakes maybe ? got sick and said her half brother had married and left her father without any help on the farm so she guessed she would have to go back home and milk the cows . We secretly hated to lose her for she certainly Was good to the baby . Our next maid was also seventeen , neat , quick as a flash , but cinema-conscious . She developed a habit of sneaking out of the house after supper without permission and if we wanted to go down the hill to the Halali there would suddenly be no use to stay at home with the baby . She belonged to the class of young German girls who apprentice themselves to some first-class housekeeper , usually the wife of a hotel or restaurant owner , and so get practical training in domestic science while finishing their last four hours a week in continuation school . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stand for . In this point at least it backs the employer to the hilt . We gave Ilse a furlough and forgot to put a limit to it and six months later heard that she had gone to St. Louis with her mother and because she had learned a little English from the baby had had no difficulty in snapping up a job as nurse girl at ten dollars a week . Enter our last and most significant Madchen fur alles , Gertrud . Iv She was twenty-seven , a splendid cook , a good nursemaid and seamstress , careful about the marketing ? thoroughly reliable . To crown it all she was silent as a ghost about her work . As she was the first woman I had ever seen who would n't talk , I got to mentioning this fact at odd intervals until my wife threatened to fire her . By this time my opera was finished and produced , and as my wife now knew enough German to manage the household I began writing another . We paid Gertrud forty-five marks a month , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and fifty marks a month . But she was worth it . It does n't make a particle of difference , we now found , what a girl costs you for her up-keep . The State Krankenkasse decides that and the more salary you pay a maid , the higher the room and board is rated . For instance , supposing her wages are ten dollars a month and bread is five cents a loaf . If you increase her wages fifty per cent the Krankenkasse boosts its estimate of her food and lodging expenses accordingly , so that , in effect , your share of her increased insurance dues is then rated at nearer seven or eight cents a loaf than five . If we had paid Gertrud a hundred marks a month straight salary , the Krankenkasse would probably have classed her living expenses at Hotel Adlon rates . A portion of these Krankenkasse dues are doled out to the workers in time of non-employment and we were now to witness an example of how this protective process works out , where we could watch it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when two huge sight-seeing busses drew up in front of one of the hotels in Kipsdorf and deposited seventy-two young men and girls with their bags , skis , snowshoes , and other paraphernalia . They were part of the German army of jobless workers taking a vacation under the auspices of the Krankenkasse . Their paid-up dues now entitled them to support during their period of unemployment . They ranged in age from eighteen to twenty-two . To say that they were utterly care-free and indifferent to the future would be putting it very mildly indeed . They had just spent two weeks in the Weisse Hirsch suburb of Dresden , were now here in Kipsdorf on the same mission for another fortnight , and were later to be sent to a hotel in the porcelain town of Meissen ? and so on ? until jobs could be found for them or until the exchequer of the Krankenkasse was empty . The proprietor of the Kipsdorf hotel told me that he was obliged to take them in at a rock-bottom rate that left him practically no profit , crowding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morning coffee with rolls and butter ; a second breakfast of coffee and cake ; a hot dinner of soup , meat , vegetables , a sweet , and black beer at noon ; afternoon coffee ; and a cold supper of sausage or cheese , bread , and beer or coffee at night . In addition to this the Krankenkasse allowed each " worker " fifty pfennige ( fifteen cents ) a day for spending money , and double that amount on Sundays and holidays . They had their own dance orchestra with them made up of their own members and consisting of a piano player , violin , flute , ' cello , cornet , and drums . They danced , gave private theatricals , and before they left Kipsdorf staged a big ball and variety entertainment to which , however , the public was not admitted . During the day they played all about the village and surrounding hills and spent what money they had freely enough for chocolates , cigarettes , and picture post cards . But the town was up in arms until they left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these argonauts . " Do you think those young people care if they ever get another job or not ? " they complained . " Why should they care , so long as the government supports them ? It is people like us , us tradesmen , the middle-class proprietors and tax payers , who have to foot the bill . " Still another resident told us that the expenditures for such benefits were out of all proportion to the cash on hand for that purpose and that already the government was facing the necessity of using funds from the budgets of other State departments for this purpose or else the Krankenkasse must declare itself bankrupt . Furthermore , that instead of arousing a spirit of economy and preparedness for rainy days , the system was merely breeding indifference and callousness on the part of the younger generation and building up a race of spendthrifts . Our worthy neighbors across the street , who like most cultured and independent women of to-day are intelligent students of the labor question , hit the nail on the head , it struck me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to the Forestry Department ? " they protested . " There is always plenty of clearing and planting to be done . Or send them to industrial schools where they could take an intensive course and so fit themselves for more advanced positions when they are finally re-employed ? " In the interest of science I corralled a few of the " vacationists " and by the easy introduction of borrowing a match ? they were invariably accommodating and courteous ? asked them how they were getting along . " Nothing to worry about . Say , if there was only a cinema in this dorf it would be grossartig , nicht wahr ? " " When do you expect to go to work again ? " They shrugged their shoulders . " Why worry about that ? We 'll be ready when the time comes . " While we were participating in a three-days ' impromptu barbecue tendered us by the village on the eve of our departure for America , Gertrud reminded my wife that she was supposed to notify the Krankenkasse that on account of our breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then entitle Gertrud to a daily dole while she looked for another position , without dipping into her savings . " But I thought you were going to get married ? " said my wife . " I do want to , " replied Gertrud , " and I have been engaged for two years . But we ca n't get a place to live in , in spite of the fact that our application for the right to rent two rooms and kitchen has been filed with the Housing Bureau ever since we have been engaged . The waiting list is so big , and as the government naturally gives preference to already-married couples with children , unless we can get a pull it may be two years longer before we can start housekeeping . " Two days later the Stearns trio stepped into the bus for Dresden and the Boys ' Trombone Band flourished a farewell chorale . Parting handclasps . . . Auf Wiederseh'n . . . Auf Wiederseh'n . . the gears meshed . . . and we glided down the friendly valley beneath a sickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was one consolation : we were saying good-by also to the Krankenkasse.
