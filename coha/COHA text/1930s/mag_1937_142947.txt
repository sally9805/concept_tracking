On file at the Department of Justice in Washington are the fingerprints , photographs , aliases and nicknames of 7,052,061 U. S. malefactors . Surest of these four keys to the identity of criminals are fingerprints which differ even in identical twins , but even fingerprints are not foolproof . The late John Dillinger had a plastic surgeon mutilate his fingertips with acid but failed to obliterate their prints because the job was poorly done ( TIME , Dec. 16 , 1935 ) . The finger prints of another recent murderer , John Hamilton , proved useless to police who found his body a year after his death . Identification of Hamilton was effected because his teeth , most durable part of the human body , were still in his head and because he had been to a dentist who had preserved a chart of his mouth . <P> Last week a onetime president of the Chicago Dental Society , alert &; articulate Dr. Edward James Ryan , offered Hamilton and the children who were burned beyond recognition by the New London , Texas school explosion as cogent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Justice 's files . Such charts might valuably supplement the Department 's four means of identifying criminals , prove even more useful as a means of identifying unknown corpses . <P> Dr. Ryan , 38 , is editor of a highly profitable 136-page magazine called Oral Hygiene , sent free to 68,000 dentists each month* and of a 58-page monthly called Dental Digest to which 22,000 dentists subscribe . Instead of using his own magazines to present his Plan , and thus risk offending the profession , Dr. Ryan used the Journal of Criminal Law &; Criminology , issued last week . To implement his Plan he required a chart of the human mouth which all dentists in the U. S. might understand . None of the 38 dental schools of this country had such a chart . So Dr. Ryan designed his own . On a grey background the 32 teeth are shown 1 ) as they look from the front , with their roots outlined , 2 ) as they look from the inside of the mouth . On that design dentist or layman may clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bridge or plate in every mouth . Lest one human peculiarity escape attention of dental identificationists , Dr. Ryan pointed out that the shape of the face , roof of the mouth and the two upper front teeth usually correspond . A squarefaced man will have square upper front teeth , square mouth roof . <P> Mouth habits leave permanent and identifiable marks on the teeth , observed Dr. Ryan . He listed some-Nervous habits : toothpick biting , fingernail biting , grinding teeth , clenching the jaws in sleep , thrusting the tongue against the teeth , lip biting , biting on the ear pieces of eyeglasses , biting paperclips , pencils , fountain pens ; Occupational habits : thread-biting in sewing , pin- &-needle; habit ( dressmakers ) , holding nails in teeth , biting the tips of cigars , clarinet and tuba playing , holding cord between teeth ; Miscellaneous habits which mark teeth characteristically include : pipe smoking , using.cigaret holder , chewing cigars , opening tops of bottles with teeth , cracking nuts , chewing bones ( Dr. Ryan fondly gnaws the meat out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange sucking . <P> *A profitable competitor also sent free to dentists each month is Dental Survey , edited by Dr. Elmer Best .
