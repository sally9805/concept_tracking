The most generally accepted and widely quoted single figure on the rise and fall of U. S. business is the Federal Reserve Board index of industrial production . In this index the normal 100 is Calculated on the years from 1923 through 1925 . Since that time the population of the U. S. has increased 13%. and living standards have presumably advanced . Disregarding the advance in living standards , Cleveland Trust Co. ' s famed Vice President Leonard P. Ayres recently declared that " we shall not be much in error if we consider 113 to be normal now . " The latest Reserve Board figure ( April ) was an even 100 . In 1929 it touched 119 . <P> In the past three months U. S. business activity has continued to mount . The New York Times 's weekly index , which does make allowance for longtime upward trends , has been above 100 for several weeks . Power production last week was the highest on record , exceeding even the previous high set last December when nights were long and there was no daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , 21% more than in the same week of last year . Steel mills were operating at 74% of capacity , and even U. S. Steel Corp . was expected to show appreciable earnings for its common stock in the June quarter . Automobile production for June may reach 450,000 units , about 100,000 more than early estimates . <P> Meantime the stockmarket has gradually moved up to its old New Deal high made last April . At that time a general reappraisal of the business outlook seemed in order and stock prices subsequently suffered their first serious setback in more than a year ( TIME , May 4 ) . Significant to market chartists , nevertheless , is the fact that the recent recovery has not been a strong enough to carry the stock averages through their old tops . <P> Even a flock of favorable dividend actions last week failed to spur the market over its previous high . Westinghouse Electric raised its annual rate ( $3 to $4 ) . Young Walter Paul Paepcke 's Container Corp . declared a 25 payment , its first in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment , its first in more than eight years . Harry Ford Sinclair 's Consolidated Oil went on a regular 60 annual basis with promises of extras . U. S. Smelting &; Refining raised its periodic payments from $1 to $2 . <P> Some of this dividend rush was attributed to the new tax law penalizing undistributed earnings . Chrysler Corp . was whooped to a new high since 1929 ( $112 per share ) on talk of fatter payments at the next dividend meeting . But while the tax law would evidently tend to liberalize dividend policies , its long-range effect upon stock prices was no clearer than the law itself . The prime factor in stock prices remains earnings , not dividends . <P> But . What concerned the stockmarket most last week was the imminence of a more than seasonal summer slump . Automobile production is bound to taper off as motormakers prepare new models for November showings . Iron Age was pessimistic on steel operations after the July 4 shutdowns , reporting : " Heavy consumer buying from a number of sources is admittedly prompted by fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as by higher third-quarter prices . . . . It can not be denied that a large proportion of production during June has been borrowed from July and August . "
