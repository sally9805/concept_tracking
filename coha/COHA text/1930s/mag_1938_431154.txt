" GLASS is a nonconductor of electricity . " Mighty few people would ever dream of questioning that ' statement . And it is true ? usually . But the fact remains that you can make electricity run right through a strand of glass , and light a lamp , in your own home laboratory . Other easy experiments will show you that water is not always wet ; that a widely held belief about the way that soap cleans things is all wrong ; and that , with the advantage of an amateur laboratory at your disposal , you can afford to be a little skeptical about unqualified statements that many people accept without question . Take glass , for example . Insulators are made from it . Certainly it must be an electrical nonconductor . It is one of the best , in fact , if you add just a few qualifying words ? " at ordinary temperatures . " What happens when glass gets hot will be interesting to test . For a source of electricity , the regular 110-volt house supply will do nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate any flow of current , and will keep it within reasonable bounds . Attach a short length of electric wire to one of the terminals of a lamp socket . Connect the other socket terminal to one of the pair of wires of an extension cord having an attached outlet plug . This will leave two free ends of wire . Remove the last two inches of insulation from each one , leaving the copper wires bare . Then thrust the ends into pieces of glass tubing , which will serve as insulating handles , so that the cleaned end of one of the wires extends from the end of its glass tube . Plug in the extension cord and screw the lamp bulb in the socket . Hold the exposed wire tip against the outside of the tube enclosing the other so that only a single wall of glass tubing separates the copper tips , and apply heat with the flame of a Bunsen burner or an alcohol lamp , preferably the former . Presently you will observe a yellow glow in the glass separating the wires . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by electric current flowing through the heated glass . Now you can remove the tubes and wires from the flame . The current will continue to arc through the molten glass at the gap between the two wires . The experiment also works if both ti ; are enclosed in their glass tubes . Then you can try pulling out the softened glass , like taffy , a fraction of an inch . The glass remains molten and the current keeps flowing . Though the indicating lamp bulb grows dimmer as the at : is lengthened , it stays lit , showing tha : hot glass will conduct electricity . Either direct or alternating current may be used for the test just describe The arc is a brilliant one and it is bee : to shield your eyes from it with sun glasses or tinted goggles . An interesting side light of this experiment is the fact that the copper wires are electrolytically destroyed and unite chemically wit : the glass . When the tubing has cooled , look at the part where the arc occurred . You will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coloring agent . Repeat the experiment with wires of other metals than copper , and you will be able to produce glass of different tints . How does soap clean your hands and clothes ? Here again , a little healthy skepticism about widely accepted ideas is in order . Many people , including chemists , have long believed that soapy water removes grease by dissolving it . A strong alkali would certainly do so . But tests have shown that any alkali existing in soap would be so dilute that it could n't possibly dissolve a grease spot . What actually happens when clothes are rubbed with soap is that the soap forms an " emulsion " with the grease . In other words , the soap penetrates the grease and breaks it up into minute droplets ,  | with which it forms a cohesive mixtur e . Separated from each other and from the cloth by soapy water , the droplets of grease are easily washed off . As for the way that soap removes solid particles like soot , that is anoth er story , which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flasks with a capacity of 250 cubic centimeters , about a glassful , apiece . Half-fill each flask with water and add to it several grams , or about a spoonful , a sooty material such as lampack or very finely powdered charcoal . Jeweler 's rouge , which consists of ferric oxide , can also be used ; you n make it for yourself by heating ferrous sulphate in a porcelain evapating dish or crucible , or in the lid a tin can , until the preparation becomes entirely red . To one of the flasks , only , a gram two of soap powder or a smallpiece of soap should now be added . Shake both flasks for half a minute . Then filter half the contents of each flask , through separate filter papers aced in funnels , into test tubes . The filtrate from the flask containing soap will contain some of the soapy materials , while the filtrate from the soapless flask will be clear . Let the remaining fluid in each flask stand for half an hour . At the end of this time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the liquid in the other flask will clear and transparent , the soot having settled to the bottom . All this becomes understandable when you realize that soap forms a " colloidal " solution in water . That is , part of the soap is not dissolved , but is suspended in the water in the form of tiny solid particles . Evidently the soap particles and the soot particles stick to each oth er so strongly that the soot goes through the filter with the soap instead of clinging to the pores of the filter paper . The theory is confirmed when you find soot particles still suspended in soapy water , after half an hour , while in clear water they settle to the bottom . It is this cohesion between soot and colloidal particles of soap that overcomes the tendency of the dirt to cling to other surfaces , such as your skin or clothing . Thus soap really has two distinct actions ? it emulsifies grease to make it easy to wash off , while colloidal soap particles stick to the soot and carry it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining demonstration . A familiar version is the parlor trick in which lycopodium powder is sprinkled on the surface of a bowlful of water . Then you can thrust your hand right into the water and withdraw it perfectly dry . A little film of air , adhering to each grain of powder , effectively prevents the water from reaching the skin . Shop workers encounter the same effect when they try to form a paste by adding water to certain kinds of powdered glue , or to the so-called " iron-cement " powders . At first , the water simply refuses to wet the powder and is shed in drops until the mixture has been forcibly ground together for some time . A simple short cut , however , is to add a drop or two of alcohol to the powder before mixing it with water . The alcohol displaces the film of air and allows the water to come in contact with the solid material . A little experiment in physical chemistry , illustrating the same phenomenon , shows strikingly that some substances are much more easily wet than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charcoal or lampblack , taking care to protect your face from flying particles of glass . This may be done by covering the mortar during the grinding with a rather heavy cloth about eight inches square , having a hole cut in the center for the pestle . From a small sieve or beaker , sprinkle the resulting charcoal-glass mixture upon the surface of water in a tall vessel such as a graduated cylinder or beer glass . THE transparent particles of glass will separate magically from the charcoal , instantly sinking through the water to the bottom of the vessel . Floating on the surface of the water , the charcoal remains behind . The glass is readily wet , while the charcoal clings to a film of  | air that supports it in the water . In the course of ten minutes or so , however , the water will slowly displace this air film and wet the charcoal , which eventually will sink to the bottom of the vessel with the glass . Not only do scientists frequently have to revise their ideas about how familiar things work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly well-understood reactions and industrial processes . Still awaiting thorough investigation is a curious " firefly glow " produced when oil is cracked or broken up by heat ? a striking effect that does not appear to have been discovered until recently , but one which you can easily reproduce in your own laboratory . FIRST you will need a piece of glass tubing about three eighths of an inch in diameter , and a foot long . Heatresisting glass may be used , but is not essential , since the tubing will not be heated red-hot . Mount the tube at a slant of about forty-five degrees , and keep it heated at its center , with a Bunsen burner , to a temperature below red heat . A flame-spreading attachment for the burner is desirable , to distribute the heat along several inches of the tube 's length . From an oil can or medicine dropper , let a drop of ordinary motor oil run down the inside of the heated tube every five seconds or so . When the oil meets the hot part of the glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will occur . Any part of the oil that is not decomposed will drip from the bottom of the tube , where it should be caught in a tin can or other noncombustible container . Within the tube , the decomposition of the oil produces a variety of gaseous products . Combustible gases like methane , or marsh gas , are formed , and carbon dioxide is also produced by a process of partial oxidation . A white cloud of the vapors will be seen hovering in the tube , or carried up it by the draft of warm air . DARKEN the room , while this is proceeding , and at once you will observe the strange luminescence . Several inches of the tube will glow with the peculiar light . Evidently it is produced by the partial oxidation of the hydrocarbon vapors , much as the oxidation of certain organic chemicals produces the light of the firefly . Oil from many sources has been reported to exhibit the remarkable phenomenon , including linseed , cottonseed , and olive oil . After tests with vegetable oils , dispose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube by burning it , to avoid any possibility of its spontaneous combustion elsewhere . You can admit oil automatically to the " cracking " tube with a small reparatory funnel . This is attached with rubber tubing to a medicine-dropper tip suspended in the top of the tube .  |
