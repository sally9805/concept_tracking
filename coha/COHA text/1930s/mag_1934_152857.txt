Six years ago a sadly disillusioned French girl packed her meagre belongings , said a bitter good-by to New York , took the first boat home . She had been in a Grade D . Shubert show . Its run was short . No one took much notice of the songs she sang . Basso Feodor Chaliapin and La Argentina , the dancer , were equally unfortunate on their first U. S. visits , but both had sensational comebacks . Last week luck had changed for Lucienne Boyer . <P> She arrived on the Ile de France with a manager , a pianist , a violinist , three maids , 23 trunks , 50 pieces of hand luggage , a 12th Century Buddha and a $6,000-per-week contract . Awaiting her were a Sherry-Netherland penthouse , a show called Continental Varieties , a brand new night club on the 65th floor of the R. C. A. building , Rockefeller Center . Producers Arch Selwyn and Harold B. Franklin congratulated themselves when , a week before the Varieties opened , every $8.80 seat in the house had been sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its high glass walls overlooking the city , its mirrored stage , its color organ which plays a design on the ceiling , its revolving dance floor which goes two speeds in each direction . <P> But Lucienne Boyer was neither amazed by the splendor of Rockefeller Center nor awed by her first-night audience there which included Rockefellers , Astors , Blisses , Harrimans . Gibsons , Fields , Charles Hayden , Mrs. Dodge Sloane , Paul Drennan Cravath . Places cost $15 apiece , * the best champagne ( Mot et Chandon Imperial Crown , 1921 ) $10 per bottle . Lucienne Boyer was unconcerned . In Paris ever since " Parlez-moi d'Amour " her songs have sold champagne . <P> Before 1929 her way was hard . Her father was killed in the war . Her mother worked in a munitions factory . Lucienne Boyer 's first job was as stenographer to a theatrical producer . When he dictated his first letter she confessed she knew nothing about typing , wanted a part in his play . The part was insignificant but one day his assistant heard her singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'Amour " was a simple , fragile tune but the Boyer version was so expertly tender that she became the talk of the town , the chief attraction to many a wealthy tourist who bought drink after drink and fancied that she was singing for him alone . <P> Boyer enthusiasts have failed to analyze her charm . The voice is cool , remote , essentially Gallic . But a bewitching personal note persists whether she sings of love or hate , boredom or jealousy . Each song has a finely chiseled pattern , an unmistakable mood built from a variety of inflections . Like Helen Morgan she likes to sit on the piano , flutter her hands . But she is as likely to pace the stage , act out each phrase . Like Libby Holman she can get her voice down to a guttural bass . But for finesse this Parisienne , now in her early 30 's , has no peer among U. S. torchsingers.
