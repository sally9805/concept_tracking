txt Paramount Publix Corp . will report in July the largest second quarter earnings in its history , but the increase over the We period of last year will by no means approach the 86% gain in profits for the first quarter . This for the reason that the big movie company was in big production of sound pictures a year ago as it was not during the first quarter of 1929 , and in the second place warm weather and business depression naturally tend to cut down somewhat current theatre receipts . It it a curious fact that the movie business is at first stimulated by a business depression . The experience of Paramount , which controls the Detroit theatre situation , during the Ford shutdown is a case in point . At the outset of this industrial disturbance and for some months receipts moved steadily upward , but after the Ford plants resumed business dropped back to normal growth .

Present indications are net income for the first half of 1930 will be between $9,000,000 and $10 , - 000,000 . Meantime , as a result of theatre expansion , more especially the acquisition . of Famous Players Canadian . Ltd. , there presently a ill be outstanding 3,256,479 shares , a factor that inevitably will dilute temporarily the per share balance . The six months ' per share figure will therefore be about $2.75 to $3 , against $2.30 for the 1921 period . Paramount Holding Its Preeminence That Paramount has no intention of losing its dominant position as the world 's leading producer , distributor and exhibitor is manifest from the fresh burst of expansion in the theatre field . The Canadian purchase gives it about 200 theatres with a seating capacity of over 200 , - 000 ; the Netoco Theatres half-interest purchase adds 30 outlets in New England . While the management is chary about furnishing exact information concerning the number of theatres controlled , the total is believed to be In the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is likely that before the year is out , half of Paramount 's income w ill be from its theatre ownership , the proportion has been steadily adancing With something like 30 ' ) of its business abroad , Paramount has taken the m the production of talking pictures in foreign 1. mguages .
