AT FORTY , as I take stock of myself , I see a woman who , in the vernacular of casehistory taking , is well-nourished and welldeveloped ; who has a mop of healthy chestnut hair , a skin of good color upon which the years have set their mark with crow's-feet at the outer corners of the eyes , a trace of heaviness under the chin , and lines setting a course from the nasal folds to the corners of the mouth . Looked at from the point of view of health insurance she is still a good bet : her blood pressure is normal , she is neither over- nor underweight , she has no organic disease , and her resistance to respiratory infections is good . Considered in the light of endocrinology she gives evidence of normally functioning glands of internal secretion , which , doctors would have us know , bear not only on the condition of hair and skin but more particularly on the personality and reactions to stimuli from without , that is , our reactions to life as we meet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that , strangely enough , with forty years behind her she is just beginning to live , that life has suddenly become full of mystery and a charm hitherto unknown , though not unguessed . It is as though she had been a perennial whose early life was concentrated upon the business of taking up , from the soil around , those food elements conducive to a strong and healthy growth , after which rose the bloom to stir the imagination . In other words , the preparatory period is over ; physical development is left behind ; and the spirit is coming into its own . MONEY - FOR WHAT ? THERE IS too much talk in these times about the material needs of human beings . In my personal experience money , as such , has had no bearing upon my contacts with others , particularly in the forming and holding and enriching of friendships of whatever description . It is nothing less than silly to feel , for example , that the beauty parlor is a necessity , or even an aid , to the promotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampooed perfectly well by oneself , and if one lacks the money for one of the artificial waves plastered upon the heads of women , well , then one will be one woman who does not look either like an Egyptian image or like all the million other heads which seem to have been cut by the same die . Every well-informed person knows that the sole function of cold cream is to keep skin soft and that not by the widest stretch of the imagination can any of the vaunted lotions or creams or foods or oils nor all the pattings and massagings eradicate wrinkles , which may be either the mark of time or the results of an undernourished or overnourished skin . Furthermore , there is something repulsive about a middle-aged woman attempting to shake off ten or fifteen years ; in the end , it can not be done . But the main point is this : that with this focusing of attention upon the outward appearance all sight of the inward woman is lost . And life has failed in its function if by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace the perquisites of youth . The years are supposed to bring experience and , through this , understanding , insight , spiritual knowledge . Youth has only its youth . That is as it should be . But age has better things . That , too , is as it should be . A precocious understanding in youth is as offensive as a lack of it replaced by fictitious youth in middle age . It remains for us to recognize the wealth that is ours for the taking and which will enrich to untold measure the years that remain . Money , as such , has meant little to me . I do n't believe in keeping money hoarded in savings banks or any other place , as money . As soon as a bit has accumulated it has gone , either in hard times or in the purchase of something I wanted more than the actual cash . Money means to me only what it can do to help me reach whatever goal I happen to set . Thus , since nineteen I wanted a piece of this sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of thirty-five I bought just that , with money that was burning a hole in my bank account . I can be happy that I did this , for when depression came upon us it gave me a place to live . More , it gave me the opportunity of a reawakening . " Thrift " is another word which is not allowed in my vocabulary of finance . As a word , it is pleasant only in its connotation of something very lovely growing in my garden and tossing , contrary to its name , a wealth of beauty to the sky . No doubt there will be some ' who will rise up and say , " Oh that 's all very , well , but you have a house and some land , so you are all set . " It might be as well to reflect that even land and houses in the country are taxed by the state ; that interest has to be paid on mortgages ; that insurance is a necessity on personal property ; and that if one expects good fruit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first be expended on them before one gets a return . Furthermore , my bank account at present writing totals the munificent sum of forty dollars . But , looking about me , I do not admit for a moment that I am one whit worse off than many another who had money and lost it or who still has money , even millions of dollars . In fact , I am better off than those who have lost , for I have nothing to regret . I do not envy those who have money , for no amount of it could make me any happier than does my bit of earth and little house . THE MISSION AND THE MATE SO MUCH for money . As for a mission in life , particularly what is known as woman 's mission ? that of having children ? there are more facets to this dark jewel of unknown merit than one can see from a single side only . Fundamentally I am made like any other normal woman , with a core of passion and an instinctive desire to give ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so simple a creature now as he was in the dawn of his history . Spiritual and mental factors now complicate the simple physical business of perpetuating the species . As I look into myself I can see that this purchase of a piece of earth and a house is only another way of expressing this urge . It is analogous to the perennial instinct of nestbuilding . I had no one to build the nest for me or with me , so I built it myself . Of course , there is no mate in it nor offspring , but here exactly is another of these facets I mentioned . It is easy enough to get married , to bear young . But the richer her inner life , the deeper her spiritual needs , the less likely is a woman to compromise with anything less than the perfect fulfillment of herself as she has come to feel and recognize it . There are entirely too many people in the world already ; there are entirely too many being born every day . As I look about me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wonder where all these poor infants of poor heritable backgrounds will go . They are in the greatest majority the result only of the urge to perpetuation . The fatuous argument that one never knows when another Edison or Beethoven may be found leaves me cold . No genius is worth the incalculable wastage of human material that is being thrown up on the shores of life ; the millions and millions of buds that sprout so unintermittently from the human tree and which cover this earth with an encrustation of mediocrity the extent of which it has never before experienced . Furthermore , no genius ever will arise out of an inferior background . Not even talent appears but what there are found , on close inquiry , parents or parents ' parents of potential talent or capacity or spiritual worth , even though these talents and capacities were never brought to the surface and developed . Why , then , so much agitation about the ultimate function of woman ? I say that , for myself , I would rather continue sterile to the grave than add by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a biological urge in me which can better be diverted into more constructive channels . Simply to have a child for the sake of having one is egoism . It were better to give a thought to the child itself and what equipment is given it for its way in life . Here , then , lies the crux of the matter ? the proper mate for the particular woman . The male lives and has his being in the life of the mind ; the female lives in the spirit . It is the combination of the two that gives the impetus to the development of all that is best ; that quickens the streaming consciousness to a creative life . The more highly developed a woman may be spiritually , the greater are the demands she makes on her potential mate . And vice versa . The male , living as he does more in the mind , is of slower development . It is for this reason that , as women of mature years marry , they marry men much older in years than they would have chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the understanding . So far as the possibilities of marriage at these advanced years are concerned , Rachel need not sit down upon an ash heap . Life does not end at forty . There is possibility of marriage not only at forty but also at forty-five , at fifty , if not later . All desirable men are not tucked away into the untouchable precincts of other women 's homes , any more than that all good women are already other men 's wives . After all , there is a man 's side to the argument , too . Turning from the eugenic aspects of childbearing to that of mere mechanics , there is not as much cause for mental agitation about the dangers of childbirth at forty as the headlines would have us believe . Women with a potentiality for high blood pressure and all that it implies have as serious complications with pregnancy and delivery , and are more seriously handicapped for after-life , when it takes place at twenty-five as at forty . Pregnancy in the presence of an organic heart lesion can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pelvis can be as seriously obstructive to delivery at twenty-five as at forty . As for Cesarean section , this operative means of delivery is being resorted to according to other indications than mere age . Given a healthy body , functioning in normal rhythm , and a normal psyche , which grows in importance as a woman approaches the end of the reproductive period , pregnancy at forty need be no more complicated than it might be at the earlier age . As for living long enough to care for the child until it can take care of itself , barring accidents such as intercurrent infections like pneumonia or automobile or similar fatalities , parents of mature years in good health are very likely to see their child grow through adolescence . And after that , if he has been given good training on the basis of a good heredity ( which should be considered before he is started into the world ) he will very likely be able to look after himself . This view is based on personal experience . My mother was forty-five when I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , subsequent to an accident . My mother died when I was not yet eighteen , after the savings of a lifetime , with which she intended to equip me for my own life , had been wiped out in a financial panic . This distortion of what is fondly called " normal " youth did not throw me off center nor handicap me for a rich personal life . I sometimes think that it did me more eventual good than if the economic path had been made easy for me . Many years before , my mother had begun to set me on my feet . As a result , with her death the props were not taken out from under me , for she had given me my own on which to stand . MATERNAL MASOCHISM CHILDREN are individuals , a view one often hears expressed but seldom finds heeded . And the " suffering " and " anguish " and " unhappiness " which children , growing up into entities , inflict upon their parents ( according to the parents ) are merely the masochistic orgies of parenthood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is primary in the mind ; but the child as a piece of the personal ego . Birds do not worry over fledglings once the latter can manage their own wings and hunt their own food . Then why this swaddling of children ? All too often women turn into perpetual mothers , which is not at all in accordance with the intentions of nature . A woman is a mate first , or should be . She is a mother , or should be , only so long as the offspring is helpless . Once a child is able to look after itself she should be able to shed it and return to her mate without these disruptions of the psyche which one sees too frequently . In the quality of the parents ' mutual relationship lies the quality of their personal life . The children have their own to make . That is the intention of nature . The fact that this normal course is not followed in the vast majority of unions one sees about one is based on a mischoice made too early , when the biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . All the more reason why , at forty , with the faculty of exercising the privilege of choice , a woman should not run amuck in a sudden recrudescence of primitive instincts . True , the reproductive period in a woman is not apt to last beyond forty-five ; in spinsters frequently not so long . But after all , the bearing of a child is not , in the end , the whole of life . It is only the biological end of life , designed for the perpetuation of the species and not for personal aggrandizement . Of course , love ( and I use the word in the highest connotation of its meaningLnaturally wants to see itself reproduced , but with a difference . It is here not the glorification of self but a glorification of the beloved , rousing in the mind and soul a species of incredulous wonder at sight of this duplication , drawing one closer to the original . And this puts an entirely different complexion upon the matter . For , given such love , even though children have become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sex life , which is only a gateway to a richer spiritual life of the two individuals concerned , does not end with the end of the reproductive period . The old fears and taboos and superstitions have long since been relegated to the haunted corridors of an ignorant past . And , because by the time maturity is reached woman ( and man ) should have attained a richer rather than a poorer spirituality , union in these late years with a personality complementing one 's own can bring a glamour and depth of experience undreamed of in youth . But suppose that , after all , there is no " man " for the woman of forty ? Life still does not end . Why should it ? Of what use has been the long trail if we come to the end blind and with a bitter taste in the mouth ? The whole of existence , of which the human animal is only a small part , is based upon a compensatory scheme . Suppose I do n't have a child before I die ? What then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't experience in full measure the perfect union ? Well , it would be a loss , but neither of these would stop in a single degree the continued growth of my spirit , which is sending out new pseudopodia , new tentacles every day ; contacting new aspects of my existence , new experiences , new facets in its miraculous jewel we call life . There is still April rain washing away the frost of winter and uncovering the first shy buds of awakening nature . There is still the sun climbing higher every day , the wheeling stars at night ; and as I stand in the deep , wet grass of a fecund earth , with a pellucid dome overhead , I sense about me an invisible presence ? imperturbable , impersonal , dispassionate , and everlasting ? of which I , as a single unit , am an infinitesimal part . Life ending at forty ? I have just discovered that it begins . And what a wealth of discovery lies still before me !             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
