Hoofs clattered in the distance . A small cavalcade trotted down a dusty road . A startled douanier , standing in the door of his office stared up into the square faces of grey-coated horsemen riding past . <P> In remembrance of these grim events , bells tolled mournfully last week in every Belgian village . It was the 23rd anniversary of Aug. 4. 1914 , the day when the first patrol of German Uhlans crossed the Belgian border at Gemmenich . Old Field Marshal Graf von Schlieffen 's 19-year-old plan to crush France at a single blow by a wide sweep through Belgium was at last being put to the test . The Treaty of 1839 guaranteeing Belgium 's territorial integrity had become a scrap of paper . A four years ' holocaust had begun . <P> While Belgian peasants harkened one morning to the sombre ringing of bells , Londoners were being wakened by the sound of guns . From Hyde Park and the Tower of London 41 thundering discharges shook the metropolis and Londoners hardly turned a hair . They barely recalled the 23rd anniversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the 37th anniversary of another event , the birth of a girl child- her ninth-to the amiable and motherly Countess of Strathmore &; Kinghorne . It was the birthday of England 's new Queen Elizabeth . <P> Night before , the royal family boarded their private railway coaches , bound for the traditional six-weeks holiday at beautiful Scottish Balmoral Castle . At Aberdeen , kilted King George , his Scottish Queen , and their two little princesses , decked in royal Stuart tartan , received a rousing welcome from thousands of sturdy Aberdonians , drove fifty miles along the Dee River to Balmoral Castle . <P> On the Balmoral luncheon table lay birthday gifts for the Queen-a diamond and emerald bracelet , linked together in a design of Tudor roses and Scottish thistles , from the King , other presents from the little princesses , Queen Mary , and members of the royal family .
