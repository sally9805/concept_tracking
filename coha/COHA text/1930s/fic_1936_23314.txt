NIGHT ON THE STILLS A STORY BY PAUL SKELDING r : EN when he first went to work as a greenhorn at the refinery , David Craig could tell that the stillmen were different  --  different and superior . He did n't know why it was and , for some reason , he did n't like to ask about it . You asked about pipes and valves and pumps but you did n't ask about refinery etiquette and social standings . Things like that came only with time and experience . As a matter of fact , he doubted whether the other men could have explained it if he had asked . Like himself , they understood it ; that was all . They knew the stillmen were superior . They accepted and respected the fact and let it go at that . Dave tried to reason it out for himself by a process of elimination . The stillmen were veterans , of course ; they were the highest paid of the workers , and they were tower-men . These facts gave them standing in refinery circles but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other men were veterans too  --  Tom Montgomery , George Watson ; plenty of them ; Old John Bonnelli , one of the filter-house men and a particular friend of Dave 's , had worked there over twenty years ; but none of them rated with the stillmen . The matter of pay was just the established scale , and all of the main departments were run on towers . Of course the tower-men were more important . They worked on the regular eight-hour tow-ers  --  seven to three , three to eleven , and eleven to seven  --  taking their lunch when they could and keeping their departments running night and day and seven days a week . It was only the yard gang and the office men who worked the day shift from eight to five with an hour for lunch and Sundays and holidays off ; and everyone knew that they did n't count for anything . But the stillmen were different . They called the superintendent , " Mac " instead of " Sir " or " Mr. McLaughlin , " and the superintendent seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were rather grave men and acted older somehow . They were nice fellows and popular with everyone but they stayed together and a little apart . You could fool and kid with the other men but you did n't feel like fooling with the stillmen . They seemed to be busy with really important thoughts and you did n't disturb them . Even the tail-house was exclusive . There were no orders about it . The tail-house was the stillmen 's domain , that was all , and everyone else kept out . And then Dave began to understand it . That was later when he considered himself a veteran . He had graduated from the laboratory and the compounding department . He had started his tower work as clay-burner and then he had been a filter-house man and a wax-house engineer . Long ago his overalls had been scrubbed and his lunch box battered to the state that shows long service . He could chew tobacco and spit with the best of them , pull the peak of his engineer 's cap down over his eyes and peer scornfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke in the refinery . But , even then , he knew he was n't solid like the stillmen and , by that time , he had begun to see why . All the tower-men had important jobs ; they were n't stuffed shirts like the office force ; but no one had responsibilities like the stillmen . Other departments finished oil  --  picked it up where the stillmen left off  --  but the stillmen made it . They were the heart of the refinery . They took the crude oil from the Pennsylvania hillsides and distilled it into gasoline and wax distillate and cylinder stock to feed the other departments , and one slip on their part could ruin thousands of dollars ' worth of oil or blow the refinery and all its works into the Ohio River . The other men 's jobs depended upon the stillmen . No one said anything about it , but the other men knew it , and that is why they respected the stillmen and the stillmen knew it , and that is why they had that quiet look . Dave had figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning of it until he had been promoted to the stills department himself . Then he got into the tail-house and saw the names and dates written in pencil on the white painted walls . " Them 's stillmen , " Howard Trimmer explained , " and the date they was killed . " There was risk in every man 's job . All the older workers were more insistent about observance of the " No Smoking " signs than were the bosses themselves ; but Death was the exacting boss of every stillman and the bond that held them together . Of course Dave was n't a stillman yet . He had had only a short apprenticeship really , and he expected that weeks more of training would be required of him before he would be considered capable of taking a tower as a full still-man . But already he considered himself capable and , what was more important , he had gained in the eyes of the men the prestige of the stills department . He was on the stills payroll ; that was enough for the other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident that got George Schultz , way was made for him to the front where Howard Trimmer was standing . This was a stil/man 's affair , and Dave was in that department ; and so , with the same evidence of respect which he himself had felt for the still-men , the men moved aside and let him through . He had n't seen the accident . It had happened about midnight the night before , and during his training period Dave was working the eight-to-five shift . In the first heavy sleep of night he had n't even heard the fire siren . He knew nothing about it until he came to work at eight . There was a strange Sundayish hush over the refinery that morning and the yard seemed deserted except for the close knot of men who were gathered , like a congregation , near the stills . Dave moved through them when they stepped aside for him . Number 1 Steam Still was a contorted fold of iron ; quiet and futile like a liner helpless on a reef . It looked strangely unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rust where the paint had chipped at the folds . " It was n't no fault of George 's , " Howard explained to him . His voice sounded dull and , Dave thought , a little stupid . " The vacuum valve stuck . She 'd been charged with benzine , you know , steamin ' off the light ends , and was down and George was pumpin ' her out . He was standin ' here , right in front of her , when the vacuum valve stuck  --  musta stuck  --  and cut off her air . Anyway , that old still just crushed in like a egg and shot out that naptha like as if you was squeezin ' a rubber bulb . It started to burn , acourse , jest as soon as that hot stuff hit the air , and the boiler-house fireman pulled the siren . Funny you never heard it . Was n't a helluva fire , at that . The burnin ' naptha run down the ditches some , and a coupla them tank cars with the covers off begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shove and let ' em roll down the sidin ' outa the way . Funny how that naptha acted . It was jumpin ' round the yard burnin ' in the air like witches . They got her out quick enough . Was n't a helluva lot /eft in her , at that . But when that blazin ' naptha sprayed out it caught poor George square  --  him and them two guineas that was standin ' here too . All three of them run blazin ' , clear to the river an ' jumped in . When they come out they was burned that black you could n't tell nothin ' . They walked all the way up to the office on the stumps of their feet but they was done fer . One of the guineas lived quite a while though at that . " Howard Trimmer stepped over and picked up the wrench that was lying by the stop-cock of the suction line  --  still lying where George Schultz had dropped it the night before . Dave looked at the disabled still , at the rivets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy iron had caved in . It was from that seam that had come the boiling naphtha which had caught George  --  George and the two guineas . When he turned with the older still-man and walked back through the crowd he knew that the men  --  old friends , all of them  --  were looking at him with curiosity and a little awe , asone looks at an actor who has stepped from his stage and is walking through the audience . The other men had set him apart from themselves . For no clear reason the responsibility for the accident seemed to Dave to rest upon his own shoulders . He felt self-conscious , serious , and a little shy . At that moment he realized that he understood the mystery of the stillmen 's position among the men of the refinery . The crowd was dispersing by this time and the plant was resuming its normal tenor . Pumps were coughing and emitting salvos of steam from the bare sides of buildings . The blare of riveters came from the new crude tank . Heat waves shivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wire poured a tiny , tinkling trill from its swelling throat . It affected Dave strangely . He had always associated that song with the first green of spring . The bird seemed lost , battered , a little disreputable in this world of heat and steel . With Howard he followed the cinder path past the little , brick-bordered circle where Tom , a wax-house engineer , nursed a few sickly geraniums . They crossed the black expanse of yard , over the railroad siding , under dripping steam pipes , between the hissing boilers and the droning , churning stills , past the condenser boxes steaming overhead and then , climbing iron steps that clung to the side of a small tile building , they entered the tail-house . It was cool in the tail-house . A breeze came through the windows that lined one side and looked down upon the rows of squat run-down tanks . The coolness , the shade , the damp of the concrete floor , and the sparkling streams of distillate pouring through the glass-topped look boxes which , with the maze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the place something of the atmosphere of a spring house . Dave seated himself at the stillmen 's desk and watched Howard Trimmer add , " George Schultz  --  August 27 , 1919 " to the pencil marks on the wall . He watched too while Howard , astride the greasy bench , opened his lunch box and bit off a mouthful of sandwich . Howard had been working since midnight when he had been called to take George 's place . There was nothing to do for the moment  --  ten minutes before the hourly gravities . They were both thinking the same thing , Dave knew , but he waited for Howard to speak . At last the stillman looked up . " It 's jest like I keep tellin ' you , " he began , " you ca n't never be too sure . That old steam still was safe alongside of the fire stills , but you ca n't never tell . You think you got it all down till you ferget somethin ' and , in this job , it jest do n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferget only jest that one time . " The door opened and McLaughlin , the superintendent , came in . Recent army training made Dave stand up , but Howard kept on with his lunch . " Apple , Mac ? " he said . McLaughlin did n't answer . He stood there looking at Dave . Then Howard too looked at Dave . Dave felt uncomfortable . At last the superintendent spoke . " How 're you getting on ? " he asked . Dave shifted a little . " Fine , " he answered . Yesterday he would have said it more quickly . " Think you could run the stills ? " " I think so  --  sure I could . " Again the superintendent fell to studying him as though an answer to his problem were to be found on Dave 's grimy cap . " I 'm shorthanded , " he explained . " George 's death leaves me in a hole  --  a stillman short . Howard and Bill will have to work twelve hours as it is . " " I 'm all set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can swing it . " " You ought to have more time . " McLaughlin was thinking aloud . " But I hate to bring in a stillman from outside . He 'd have to learn the lines anyway . What do you think , Howard ? " Howard had been studying Dave as doubtfully as had the superintendent himself , but now he spoke without hesitation . His smile was a mouthful of sandwich held in by yellow teeth . " Dave 's all right , " he said heartily . " He 's picked it up fast . He can take a turn . He wo n't make no mistakes . " McLaughlin continued to consult Howard . " I thought of the night shift , " he suggested . Howard nodded . " That 's right . Things is quieter then . " " All right , " said the superintendent , " we 'll give you a chance . You 'll be a stillman now . You can start to-night ? eleven o'clock . Better go home now and get some sleep . I 'll notify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lunch he went to bed , but he did n't sleep . To-morrow , after he had run the stills all night , he might be able to sleep ; but to-day he lay awake . Hot sunlight framed the rectangle of the wavering blind . A fly , moving in jagged arcs , complained fretfully to the ceiling . David , lying on his back , followed its flight with unseeing eyes . He was catechizing himself desperately on the special warnings of his stills apprenticeship . " Have your condensers cold for benzine and hot when you 're runnin ' heavy oil . If you plug your coils with wax and make a back pressure somethin 's got to go , and it might not be the safety , valve , Start your fires slow ; there may be water in your charge . Wear gloves when you sample your still-bottoms and keep workin ' the valve  --  do n't let that hot stuff get away from you or you 'll have a fire . Do n't , fer God 's sake , give ' er steam too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water with the steam , the whole dam ' plant 'll take a ride . . . . " So it went on , over and over in his mind , while the fly strove against the ceiling and the sun settled behind the blind . It was still broad daylight when he dressed , but he could n't help it . He could n't lie there in bed any longer . Throughout the long evening he wandered restlessly from room to room or walked about the streets . He thought night would never come . Most likely by eleven o'clock he 'd be getting sleepy ? just when he 'd have to start his work ? his fist night on the stills . At 10:15 he was through waiting ; he was going to start to the plant anyway . He picked up his lunch box and walked to the street car . The night was hot and dark . Heat lightning flared in the west . At Kelly 's Corner he climbed down and waited for the trolley to pass . Behind him rose steep hills ; before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river in the distance ; and , over all , the night pressed down  --  an inverted bowl overhead . The refinery was a cluster of pinpoint lights and distorted shapes that sprawled on the bank of the river . Dave crossed the tracks and followed the long dirt road . He shivered a little , though it was so warm . At the entry he stamped his time card ? it was 10:35 ? then he stepped into the yard . In the distortion of night the refinery was a place transformed , unfamiliar ; a circumscribed area of light and security from which blind passages led into boundless spaces of shadow and mystery . The office building was deserted and completely dark except for the passageway where he had punched the time clock and where the watchman had his desk . Even the yard was desolate . There was something furtive about the occasional worker that moved on the fringes ; and the diffused glow that warmed the area seemed to be of itself  --  independent of the tiny lights that spotted the darkness . Wisps of steam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard and climbed the tail-house stairs . A single lamp , swinging a little in the breeze , lighted the stilImen 's desk where Bill Knox , cleaned up and ready to go home , sat waiting to be relieved . For some reason Dave whispered when he greeted him . Bill , dressed in a clean blue shirt and the edges of his hair curled back from a recently accomplished part , smiled at him . " So you 're runnin ' ' em to-night , hunh ? Howard told me . Think you can make out all right alone ? " " I think so . " " Sure you can . It 's an easy night . " He put on his steel-rimmed spectacles and bent over the stills sheet on the desk . " Number 2 's away light yet ; she 's runnin ' naptha , " he interpreted from his own report . " So 's Number 3 , only she 's about ready to cut over . Number 4 's runnin ' P.D. , makin ' 32 neutral . Number 5 's crackin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number 7 's makin ' 600 stock ; she 's to be pumped over to the filter-house . She 's about down . Charge her with dark crude when she 's out . Eight 's runnin ' water-white . Nine 's in wax ; she 'll want steam at midnight . Number 10 's out ; she 's to be charged again with that light crude . " A line was drawn clear through the column marked , " Number 1 Still . " Dave did n't pay much attention . He could read the report himself  --  even Bill Knox 's writing . He was concentrating upon collecting a poise that would reassure both Bill and himself . He tried to be hard-boiled . " Hell of a lot of pumping you 've left for me , " he grinned . " Well , what the hell . Night man alus does the pumpin ' , do n't he ? About all he 's got to do . " But Bill was n't fooled . " You 'll get along all right , " he urged , as Dave accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a easy night and things is quiet . Jest do n't lose your head . See you 've got your stops set right when you 're pumpin ' and watch your fires . Do n't let that stock in 7 get away from you and mind how you let the steam in 9 . You 've got nothin ' very tricky to-night  --  nothin ' only that steam in 9 . Do n't take no chances . You know the ropes . " And Bill started toward the time-clock gate . Yes , Dave knew the ropes  --  or at least he had known them when he 'd had a stillman working there with him . But alone ? It might be better for him to start on the day shift when things would seem clearer . He had a moment of panic . " Bill , " he called , in spite of himself . " ' Dja call me ? " Bill , almost at the gate , stopped and looked back . " Want somethin ' ? " " No  --  no , nothing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-night then . " And Bill was gone . Alone , Dave turned and faced his charges defiantly . The battery of big stills stood ther e  --  a long picket of harnessed elephants ; docile enough when under control , but terrific forces of destruction if one should get out of hand and infect the others with a surge of their powers . Under them the fires flared and roared behind the brick fronts and the churning contents of their vast interiors thumped and boomed . An awfully thin layer of iron separated the fires from those explosive contents . But they were under control  --  just now anyway  --  and as he watched them Dave felt his confidence returning . He started back to the tail-house . " Hey , Dave . " He turned and saw John Bonnelli outlined in the light of the open filter-house door . John summoned him with a commanding jerk of the head . " You runnin ' the stills to-night ? " he asked when Dave had come up to him . " Yep . " " All ' lone ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with you , Johnny ? " " Wat 's amat ' a mel I ai n't wanta die ayet ? ' ats awat . I see nuffa lasta night . " " You 've got nothing to sweat about ? away over here in the filter-house . " " ' At 's alla right . I tink , by God , I hear sumpin leta go , I get outa here aplenty dama queekl " " You 'll have to go quick  --  and give me plenty of room or I 'll run you down . " Dave jerked the cap down over Johnny 's eyes and went back to the tail-house . It was eleven o'clock  --  time to get to work . Start with something easy . He 'd take the gravities . From each look-box in turn he filled his sample can and , when the hydrometer , in the flask , had stopped bobbing , he read the figures under the electric bulb . He noted them down on the hourly report sheet on the desk . They were all right to run as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . It was heavy , too heavy to run longer in the naphtha tank . She was ready to cut into water-white . He went to the manifold of valves and , with his wrench , closed the one that was open  --  the one leading to the naphtha run-down tank . The stream of distillate from Number 3 Still quickly flooded the glass look-box but immediately returned to its normal level when Dave opened another valve  --  the one to the tank for water-white kerosene . The first step had been taken . Simple enough . Just cut the stream from one tank to another . There was no chance talaivAighivitni for mistake . The valves on the manifold were clearly marked . But Dave breathed easier when it was done . Number 7 was making stock , the chart said , and was nearly done . You did n't test that at the stream ; you had to take a sample from the still-bottom . " When you test a still-bottom , wear your gloves . " But Dave was in a hurry and was nervous . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the tail-house desk lay his heavy gauntlets ? forgotten . He approached Number 7 Still gingerly and held out his bucket toward the tail-pipe . The still was terrifically hot . It was hissing and booming and little drops of steaming oil gathered on its side and fell with a pssst to the ground . But the handle of the stopcock was cool . It did n't remind Dave about his gloves . He held the bucket under the tail-pipe and cautiously opened the cock  --  just a little . A cloud of oily steam surged about his face and there was a cracking and sputtering as the scalding oil trickled into the pail . Quickly Dave shut off the cock  --  then opened it  --  then shut it  --  working it carefully back and forth . " Keep working the stop , " he remembered . " Fer God 's sake , do n't let it lock open on you . " He had enough in his pail and shut off the stop . And then he remembered his gloves . He nearly fainted . If something had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen on his hand and he had jerked back and let that scalding stream get away from him ! But nothing had gone wrong . The stop-cock had n't got away from him . The stream was shut off . There was no fire . Only his knees were wrong . They were trembling violently . He swore to himself and promised to forget nothing more that night . Sample bucket in hand , he walked to the office and switched on the lightin the lab . No chemists worked at night . He 'd have to test the sample himself . From his bucket he filled a flash cup and set it over a Bunsen burner . Then he hung a thermometer in the oil and waited , tiny gas torch in his hand . At every five degrees ' rise of the thermometer he passed the torch over the oil . At last something happened . A blue flicker of flame jumped over the surface of the cup and went out . " Flash , " said Dave aloud , and noted down the temperature . He continued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flashes grow stronger . At last a flash caught and held and burned steadily . The test was finished . Dave blew out the flame and read the temperature . " 595 Burn . " The oil was done . Time to cut off the fire under the still . She 'd be 600 by the time she was out . He switched off the electric lights . Let the chemists clean up the mess in the morning . He was a stillman . Back at Number 7 Still lie turned off the gas . The great flame popped and went out . Through the openings he could see white worms of glowing carbon crawl over the hot bricks . " Hey , Johnny , " he yelled through the filter-house door . " Set your lines . I 've got some 600 coming over in a minute . " But first he must charge that still that was empty  --  Number 10 ? charge her with that light crude . He opened the stop on the charging line at Number 10 Still and the right stops on the suction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steam and started a pump coughing . When it was running smoothly he ran to a big crude tank and , climbing to the top , pulled up the cord until the swing-line was well off the bottom . He would take no chances of pumping water from the bottom of the tank into that empty still that was still hot . Last , he opened the valve on the suc-tion line at the tank and put his ear to the pipe . The throb-throb of the pump down the length of pipe and the gurgling within assured him that the crude was flowing to the pump all right . But was it being pumped to the right place ? He thought he had set his lines right but he was taking no chances . Wildly he raced back to the still and held his ear as close as the heat would allow . There was no sound . Then came a plop  --  a splash  --  and then the regular drone of liquid pouring against iron . It was all right : the crude was flowing where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to take the hourly gravities in the tail-house . It was midnight  --  time to turn the steam into Number 9 . He dreaded that job . In the bottom of that pounding still were coils of steam pipe punched full of holes . When he opened the valve , steam would shoot from those holes into the boiling contents and , by agitating the oil , would keep the layer on the bottom from burning . But suppose steam did n't come through those holes ! Suppose the damn boiler-house men gave him wet steam , as they so often did , and he shot water into that molten furnace . " Easy when you give her the steam , " he had been told time after time . " Go awful easy at first . You may get water and give the whole place a ride . Jest crack the valve at first . " A piece of string was tied around the top of the perpendicular spoke of the steam valve . That piece of string was the stillmen 's marker . Dave knew that the valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bit of twine stood " about five minutes after . " " About five minutes after " had been definite enough when Dave had located it under the eyes of Howard Trimmer . But it was most indefinite now that he was alone , and the possibility of error seemed enormous . Well it was mid night . The oil in that still must have steam and he must turn it in . Keeping his body as far from the stilt as possible , he stretched his arm to its limit . Carefully , timidly , his treco , tiling fingers tried the hot wheel , it was tight  --  would not move . " God , who shut off this valve ! " Dave knew that he must just crack it . But how could you crack a valve shot as tight as that ? When it did let go the string would probably jump to " quarter past " at the first break . Dave lowered his hand to ease his straining arm and studied the valve that looked so innocent yet could work such havoc . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be turned . Once more he stretched out his arm  --  pressed tighter with his fingers  --  and then the valve let go . There were sharp pounding cracks and a smothered roar from the great belly of iron . Dave leaped away and watched the still , trembling . But the pounding had stopped and the roar had changed to a gentle hum . There was only the thumping of his heart , The valve moved easily now and he gave it a " minute " turn more . That , he thought , as the hum grew louder , would be enough for a little while , He 'd ease the tension of his nerves . " Your lines set for that stock , Johnny ? " he yelled . " Leave ' er acome . " This from somewhere in the filter-house . Once more , in the pump-house , he set new stops and started a pump going ? the stock pump , this time . Then he went back to the still and opened the suction-line stop . A trail of smoke ran down the greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flowed on its trip through the line . Dave ran for the long gauge pole and , with It , pushed up the arm of the vacuum valve on top of the smoking still .

Johnny That w as was responsible for the filter-house lines being right . But maybe he 'd better go see . Inside the filter-house he was greeted by the sound of plashing and he could see the steaming oil tumbling from a pipe into an open tank . Dave felt a great surge of pride in that oil . He had made it in his stills ; he had tested it and had pumped it to Johnny 's tanks . There was great satisfaction in it all . " That 's beautiful stuff , Johnny , " he yelled ; though all he could see was dark , smoking liquid pouring into an open top tank . Johnny only grunted . He 'd seen stock pour into that pan for the past twenty years . Stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter . Dave watched the oil fall and the bubbles foam to the top . It was pleasant in the familiar filter-house where he had worked so long  --  cheerful and safe ; and there was comfort in the knowledge of Johnny 's presence . He 'd like to stay there longer . But he was a stillman  --  couldn ' t be soft before Johnny . He went out again into the dark . The night was wearing away . Dave wondered why he did n't grow sleepy . He was n't sleepy . His eyes felt wide ? like open windows in his head , and his mind was alert and clear . He did n't think of the strain . Number 10 must be full by now . He 'd better take a look . It was nearly full . He might as well light the fires  --  start it slow at first . He went to get the torch  --  apipe handle bound with a bunch of waste . He dipped the waste-swathed end in a puddle of oil and held a match to it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burning mass through the bricks and , with his free hand , turned on the gas . There was a blast under the still . Flames burst through the bricks and then raced back along the still bottom to lick up the gas in the far corners . Dave adjusted the valve until the fire wrapped the iron tank in a steady flame . Then he went to the pump-house to stop the flow of crude . Number 10 Still was charged and ready to run again . In the tail-house , Dave wrote it down on the chart . The hours passed . Gravities were taken and noted down . Number 7 Still was emptied of its stock and was receiving its fresh charge of dark crude . The tanks , the buildings , and the tall boiler stacks loomed like stage pieces ? outlined against a pearl-gray sky . Day was breaking . Dave stood in front of his stills and watched the mist rise from the river . He was waiting for the indicator on 7 to show full . He began to relax with the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , a warm glow lighted the yard round him . It was as though electricity had been turned on to replace a failing twilight . It was vaguely comforting to Dave and , absently , he rested there in the glow  --  minutes , it seemed to him later . Then he realized and , horrified , looked up . He stood as if transfixed . The safety valve that branched , with the great vapor Tine , from the dome of Number 6 Still was hidden in a swirling mass of flame . Dave 's immediate impulse was to fly for his life , but his legs were paralyzed . He could n't move . When his mind began to function again thoughts crowded one another in bewildering disorder . He must give the alarm . No , race for an extinguisher and do what he could himself . Every thought of action was stopped by the overwhelming urge to save himself . But , over it all , was the persistent , subconscious command , " Keep your head , keep your head  --  you must keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was stillman . This was his job . Why start the siren for a little thing like this ? And then , for no good reason , he thought of John BonneIli . Good old Johnny ! He knew the refinery . He was only a filter-house man , but he 'd been there twenty years . Dave raced for the filter-house . Then he forced himself to walk  --  made himself be calm , collected . Do n't let Johnny know you 're scared . " Say , Johnny , " he said calmly , " can you step over to the stills with me a minute ? There 's something I want you to look at . I 've got a little fire there . " John looked at him quickly . He was reassured by Dave 's quiet manner but he did n't linger . He put down the wrench he had been wielding and went with Dave to the stills . Together they looked at the blaze . Then John spoke . " I no think that'sa nothing , " he said . " Justa the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what I thought , " said Dave . " Do you think we ought to  --  uh  --  try to put it out ? " " No . Let him burn . You can'ta reach up there , only with the biga foam machine . Let him burn . She taka care of himself . " Johnny went back to his filters and Dave was left with his blaze . He felt quieter , a little reassured ; but not entirely so . Johnny was a veteran refiner , a good practical man . But Dave knew the theory of the stills . He knew that dome was filled with gases that poured through the vapor line to the condenser . Those gases were highly explosive and that blazing valve was right beside that dome . But Johnny seemed sure . He 'd seen that happen before . Johnny was a dependable fellow . No use giving the alarm just . yet . He 'd wait a while and see . He would n't make a fool of himself  --  not on his first night on the stills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 7 ! Quickly he ran to the pump-house and shut off the power . Then , when he had closed all stops , he raced back to his fire . It was burning quietly , innocently ; flaming under the halo it cast , like a flare under a circus tent ; burning quietly enough  --  next to that line of explosive gas . If only it would hold till Howard came . Suppose it should burn through  --  melt off that safety valve ! Dave was fascinated by the blaze . For some reason he felt compelled to stay there and watch it . But it was time for the six o'clock gravities . When he climbed the steps to the tail-house he was trembling so that he supported himself by the rail . Quickly and nervously he took the gravities and scribbled down the readings . He must get back to the stills  --  keep his eye on that fire . But when he 'd poured out the last sample and was about to rush out again he saw his own face  --  saw it in Bill Knox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was tense and pale ; his eyes wide and shadowed with fatigue . Dave stopped and grinned at himself . " God ! " he said aloud . " I 've got to let down . No sense in being a damned fool about this . To hell with the old still . If she 's going to blow , she 'll blow . My watching wo n't help . " He forced himself back into the tail-house and deliberately took the last gravity reading over again . Then he thought : " Might as well wash up  --  freshen myself a little . Howard 'll he here before long ; might come out early this morning . My dirty work 's all done anyway . " He filled the tin basin and scrubbed himself at the sink . Again and again he soused his head in the cold water . NIGHT ON To hell with the damned still . Let it wait . It 'll wait for a while . But it had waited . He 'd been away a long while now . He dried his face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was broad daylight . The yard lights , still burning , looked drab and sickly , like tinsel that shows its tarnish in the morning . Smoke from the boiler-house stacks rose , straight and black , to merge with the river fog . The blaze on Number 6 burned steadily , quietly  --  less fearsome in the daylight . It flickered a little , as Dave watched , flickered and suddenly went out . It was gone , and there was the battery of stills droning quietly  --  a picket of great beasts securely chained . And then Dave sat down . A great weariness overcame him . A prop , it seemed , had been removed and he folded limp on the ground . But he sat for only a moment . The gate-house door slammed and there was Trimmer coming across the yard . " How 'd you make out ? " " Fine . " Dave hoped Howard did n't notice that his voice was shaky . " All right . " They climbed the tail-house steps and Dave spread out the chart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " Dave ran down the list . " Number 9 stands 500 . Number 10 's just started to run . " Howard nodded . " O.K. , Boy , I got ' em . You go on home to bed . " Dave picked up his lunch box and started off . At the door he paused . " Oh , by the way , " he said casually , " the safety on 6 is leaking . Burned some up there last night . Guess she 'll need a new gasket when she 's down . " Then he turned and , with a last call on his legs , walked firmly down the tail house stairs .
