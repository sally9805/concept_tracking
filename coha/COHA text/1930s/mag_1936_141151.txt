Fortnight ago a gang of WPA workmen were placidly sandpapering the features of a marble George Washington in Philadelphia 's dark old City Hall . Suddenly a hoarse , poodle-haired Italian swept among them , seized their abrasives , roared : " Halt ! Halt ! " The impulsive newcomer was Sculptor Giuseppe Donato , the Philadelphia Municipal Art Jury 's most mercurial member , who well knows that sandpaper is not good for the texture of marble . Sculptor Donato forthwith ran to the office of Mayor Samuel Davis Wilson , puffed out his complaint . No art expert , Mayor Wilson gave Sculptor Donato authority to complete the cleaning of the two-ton Washington statue his own way . <P> Last week Sculptor Donato was again compelled to sally forth in defense of Philadelphia art works when he heard that another WTA crew , furbishing up for the forthcoming Democratic National Convention , was busy scraping down the bronze statues in City Hall Plaza to make them " look like new . " Such treatment would remove the bronzes ' cherished patina , which comes only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droppings . Tearing off his blue smock , Sculptor Donato dashed from his studio shouting : " This time I am going to give them hell ! " <P> Sculptor Donato arrived at City Hall Plaza in time to save Civil War Generals McClellan and Reynolds , but the bronze statues of Locomotive Manufacturer Matthias William Baldwin and John Christian Bullitt , grandfather of Ambassador William Christian ( " Bill " ) Bul litt , had been thoroughly scraped , oiled and polished . Sculptor Donato again sprinted for the Mayor 's office , there met with fur ther bad news . A third WPA crew , he was told , had got at a bronze Washington in front of Independence Hall , holy-stoned away every trace of its treasured greenish mold . The WPA ducked further trouble with aroused Sculptor Donato by announcing that it had no more time to devote to scrubbing statues . <P> Born 55 years ago in the Italian province of Catanzaro , white-maned Giuseppe Donato has long enlivened Philadelphia with artistic disputation . In 1915 he sued Chocolate Tycoon Milton Snavely Hershey for refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had ordered for a fountain on his front lawn . A jury awarded Sculptor Donato $25,000 . Mr. Hershey persuaded the City of Harrisburg to take the Donato fountain . Cried he : " I do n't want this damned thing anywhere in Hershey ! "
