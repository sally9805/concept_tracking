An ambition dear to Bolsheviks ever since their Revolution has been to obtain such A 1 credit rating that they could borrow millions from the very capitalist powers their busy agents were frankly seeking to undermine . From Berlin some thumping big loans have been made to Moscow , but these scarcely counted since Germany 's credit rating itself was notoriously low . Last week Moscow made good as world headlines read : FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BRITISH LOAN TO RUSSIA IS ANNOUNCED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS . <P> This was substantially accurate , although Bolshevik bonds will not be offered to British investors . The 10,000,000 is in the form of an issue of five-year notes at 5% . Repayment is guaranteed by the British Government . Lloyd 's Bank will handle the paper to put a cash deposit of $50,000,000 at the disposal of the Bolsheviks . <P> Since Bolshevik credit hitherto has been such in Britain that 11% interest has been paid by Russia , last week 's deal was in fact a complete reversal of highest British financial policy .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
