THE WANDERER or LIVERPOOL-John Masefield-Macmillan ( $3.50 ) . + The first book John Masefield has written as England 's Poet Laureate is appropriately a book about an English ship : the steel four-masted barque Wanderer of Liverpool . The Wanderer has already appeared in enterprising Publisher Hearst 's Cosmopolitan . Not all the book is poetry , but even Masefield 's prose descriptions of his heroine have often the ring of verse . <P> The Wanderer was built in her owners ' ( W. H. Potter &; Co. ) yards in Liverpool , launched in 1891 . She was the biggest sailing ship yet built , over 300 ft. long , of nearly 3,000 tons . " She was of a full model , wall-sided , rather hard in the bilge and with a flat floor , though she grew somewhat sweeter aft . Above the waterline , she was lovely . . . . She was the last achievement in sailing-ship building and rigging : nothing finer had been done , or ever was done . " But her very first voyage started with disaster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickened rapidly into a hurricane , parted her from her tug and left her riding helpless . The storm whipped her new rigging to shreds . Some gear swinging loose killed her captain . The blow over , she limped back to Liverpool for repairs . <P> There Masefield saw her . " I have seen much beauty , but she was the most beautiful thing . She was so splendid , and so distresst : she was also moving as though she were alive . " In all , the Wanderer made ten long voyages , but never one without some accident . " Men fell from aloft and overboard from her ; others died , or broke bones , in her ; she lost some spars ; she took charge of her tugs ; her cargoes shifted ; she was on fire once and ashore four times . " Finally , on April 14 , 1907 , at anchor in the Elbe River at two o'clock in the morning , a German troopship ran her down and sank her . Her officers and crew got off without loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the wreck still lies , in 24 ft. of water . <P> In two long poems Masefield tells of her first voyage and her last ; in many shorter lyrics sings the praises of the Wanderer and her vanished kind . Always a competent narrative poet , the ageing Masefield embroiders fewer purple passages , forges no mighty lines . But he can still write a chantey which cries for music . The first verse : <P> In Liverpool where I was bred , A long , long time ago , They taught me how to heave the lead . <P> ( Chorus ) And across the Western Ocean We 're bound away today . <P> They 'll give me a donkey 's breakfast , When I sign away my pay ; And across the Western Ocean We 're bound away today . <P> <P> The Author . John Masefield was a poor boy , is not a rich man . Born in Liverpool , he went to sea at 14 . As every Masefield devotee knows , he once worked as handyman in a New York bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liking the looks but not the taste of wine . He lives with his wife and daughter on Boar 's Hill , five miles from Oxford , where his melancholy mien and rusty , plunging gait are a perennial peripatetic phenomenon . He founded the amateur Boar 's Hill Players , who acted now Shakespeare , now Masefield ; he himself once played the ghost in Hamlet , hinnying like a snipe . <P>
