txt A five-hour series of secret conferences Thursday afternoon and evening in Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau ' s offices , was attended by Treasury and State Department economic and monetary experts . At the close of the conferences . Secretary Morgenthau smilingly- told The Wall Street Journal he could make " no comment " on any question asked him about the sessions . Other participants , ' who included Herbert Fein. ** adviser to the Stat- Department , and Archie laochhead , manager of the V. S. StabilimiLion Fund , likewise declined to discuss the day 's developments . It was learned , however . that international currency matters were the leading topic of discussion . With the franc crisis the most obvious topic in all foreign exchange circles , : t was assumed that this occupied a considerable portion of the time spent by the conferees . It was apparent also that one group of Treasury experts was engaged in drafting some sort of a statement for some unannounced purpose . Other Monetary Leaders Present In addition to the Secretary . Mr. Feis and Mr. Lochhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treasurb Herman Oliphant , general counsel ; Dr. Harry D. White . monetary specialist of the Treasury 's research division : Dr. Jacob ' Vizier , special economic adviser to Secretary Morgenthau and Clarence V. Opper , assistant general counsel in charge of monetary affairs . Among the problems which might face the Treasury if France left the gold standard , even temporarily , would be that of changing its regulations which do not now permit export of gold to non-gold standard countries . One Treasury official , while refusing to say whether that problem was discussed yesterday , nevertheless gave assurances that any such amendment in the regulations , it made , would be published . Such an amendment would permit the British exchange control to stabilize the pound by operations in New York . when and if the gold fulcrum in Paris ceased to be available .

" Even were the outflow of gold over a few months to be heavy . " the Secretary wrote , " it would not affect the adequacy of our credit base . " Although official comment on foreign currency developments seldom emanates from Treasury quarters , it is known here that Administration advisers have always kept in close touch with authorities abroad . It would not be difficult , therefore , for either the British government or the French government tr both to lay any proposals for American cooperation they had in mind before the proper officials on this side of the Atlantic . Some government officials have privately expressed the view that such " reasonable " devluation of the franc would correspond roughly to the devaluation of the Belgian currency unit . This was cut 28% and compared with a reduction of slightly more than 40% in the old gold content of the United States dollar . Recent indications have been that ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later and at least a passive willingness not to be an " obstacle " to a " reasonable " realignment of the French money unit has been expressed .
