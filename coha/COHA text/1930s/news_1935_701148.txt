txt Amid an atmosphere reminiscent of mountaineer feud days , Democratic leaders worked overtime tonight to calm the strife that sent the Legislature into another week . The two houses will convene again tomorrow night , when members had hoped they would be far away from Albany . Conflicts between Governor Lehman and John J. Dunnigan , Democratic Senate leader , and between the latter and Speaker Irwin Steingut of the Assembly , as well as new battles over New York City transit legislation , caused the delay . Meanwhile , new elements in the fight on reapportionment which Tammany Hall has been waging against Governor Lehman and the national leaders of the party threatened unexpected developments . With enough Tammany Democrats bolting the Governor to kill both legislative and Congressional reapportionment and with the end of the session in sight , the " Hall " felt that its victory over Governor Lehman and Postmaster General Farley had been achieved . In fact , James J. Dooling , the leader of Tammany , took a plane for the South for a vacation . Republicans Consider New Tack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discharge the committee in the Assembly from consideration of the Fitzgerald bill embodying the Republican reapportionment plan of 1931 . This measure was introduced early in the session by Assemblyman Maurice A. Fitzgerald , Democrat , of Queens , merely to have a lever in case reapportionment by his own party was blocked . It would add considerably to the Queens delegation and for that reason might win the backing of the Queens legislators . This would put the bill over . Democratic leaders aware of the danger are making strong efforts tonight to hold the Queens members in line . The members of both parties had considered the reapportionment battle over on Saturday , but now that the session is prolonged and the leaders are in a turmoil the members are in a mood for anything . The Assembly leadership and a large portion of its membership are bitter against Senator Dunnigan . The members contend that if it had not been for the Senate leader 's insistence on a $600,000 appropriation for the utilities investigating committee , of which he is chairman , everybody could have gone home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was confident that the session would end by Tuesday . On Wednesday at sundown the Jew- ish holidays start and some of the members must be at their homes in New York . City Issues Coming to Fore . Senator Dunnigan 's dispute with Governor Lehman over the $600,000 committee appropriation was still raging this evening , but there were signs that in the near future some solution would be found for the deadlock . The Governor wants further data about the work of the committee before , as party leader , he assents to the appropriation of so large a sum . The La Guardia administration will have representatives here tomorrow to oppose strenuously the inclusion in the main unification bill of an amendment which would put city-owned transit facilities under the same laws as privatelyowned facilities . Governor Lehman will strive to heal the wounds of the party conflict . He feels that up to these closing days the Democrats , in control of the two houses , have made a fine record . He does not want this marred by open battles at the very end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bills approved by the two houses . including such measures as the Feld bill , sent to him by the Assembly last night , which would restore about $6,000 , - 000 to $8,000,000 to the 36,000 school teachers in New York City in thei form of restoration of salary cuts made in 1932 .
