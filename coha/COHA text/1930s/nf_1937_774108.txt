txt  | class and lower middle class , and therefore it deserves a passing attention . It was mildly Radical in its views , but in foreign affairs it was no more Radical than Tory : it was merely irresponsible and ill-informed . Its attack on Prince Albert was not really an expression of considered policy , however unwise ; it was rather a reflection in decorous language of the ancient injunction : " ' E 's a blinkin ' foreigner ; ' eave ' alf a brick at ' im . " When it instructed its readers on foreign affairs its endeavours to be Radical resulted in hideous muddles . Take , for example , the following leader upon a minor question of Christian missions to China which appeared in the middle of the crisis ( January 4 , 1854 ) . Its prophecies are incorrect . Its Radicalism consists in suggesting that all Foreign Offices are scoundrelly , but it obviously has no idea of what it is writing about . It has no policy to suggest , and has to fall thankfully back on praising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offend nobody : If , however , Nestorianism in the Northern parts of China early became totally extinct , we must confess that the success of the Protestant missionaries is wonderful and richly repays those pious Christians who liberally contributed the means . That the result will be a large accession to the civilised world , there is no room for doubt ; but he would be bold who should speculate on its political consequences . As to those hostile interpositions by the Emperor of the FRENCH , because the Chinese Christians in their iconoclastic zeal , have destroyed both Romish and Buddhist images ; by the Russian CZAR , in hostility to civilisation ; and by the British QUEEN , to enforce the chewing and smoking of opium , they are each fully aware that the United States of America have already evinced an intention to participate more largely in the commerce of this part of the world . By the time each of those three powers have settled their own quarrels , a new and powerful Government may be firmly established in China .  | The CZAR has shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we very seriously doubt that he has anything more than a nominal sovereignty over the fierce Tartar hordes of the Steppes and forests between him and China ; and as to the transport of European forces , in sufficient numbers , it is out of the question . NAPOLEON III has probably as much regard for Papist images , and the POPE , as NAPOLEON I. He will use them while he thinks they are serviceable to his interests , but he will not rashly enter into a doubtful war on any such account as the good bishop surmises . It is cheering to find , in the religious books of these neophytes , doctrines entirely free from the presumptuous dogmas , debasing puerilities , and grosser superstitions , which disguise Christianity in our part of the world , and if we really owe this surprising movement to the Protestant missionaries , we can not be too grateful to those heroic labourers in the greatest of causes . Meanwhile the Times , like the Oxus , floated majestically on : its intention was to inflame public opinion until war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaders reached their goal . It forthwith , in its peculiarly pontifical manner , rearranged for its readers the order of foreigners to be praised or blamed . The German Powers , who had declined to be involved in the Crimean adventure , in which they were not in the least interested , were ranged upon the shelf reserved for " Objects of Contempt " ; the French Emperor , on the other hand , was recommended to British affection by having ascribed to hind the one quality it was universally agreed he did not possess . On March 25 , 1854 , the Times wrote : Had it not been for the deliberate and honest policy of this country , and for the no less straightforward and disinterested conduct of France , the affairs not only of the East , but of all Europe , would unquestionably have been settled without asking  | the German Powers for their assent or their opinions ; for we have it from the lips of the Emperor NICHOLAS himself that he considered the interests of Austria to be identical with his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had either of the Western Powers consented to sacrifice the interests of Germany on this question , can it be doubted what would have been the result ? Germany must either have engaged in a desperate struggle on both her frontiers , or she must have succumbed to a policy which placed her at the feet of Russia . But what return is Germany prepared to make to the Western Powers ? What acknowledgment does Prussia give for this respect of her existing territorial rights ? She sends at this moment a confidential envoy , General LINDHEIM , to St. Petersburg , to tender , no doubt , fresh assurances of neutrality and confidence to a Power which announces that it will return no answer at all to the summons to the Western Cabinets , and thus gives the signal of war ... . We do not hesitate to declare that the conduct of the Emperor Louts NAPOLEON in this transaction deservedly raises him to an honourable position in Europe , and gives us reason to hope that all his dealings may be regulated by the same strict observance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman ? On the whole , they seem to have been . The Whigs ? this is the age of Palmerston ? were at least as deeply involved as the Tories . A small section of what were beginning to be called Liberals expressed a lonely opposition to war in principle , but they received but little support . There can be few cases , even in British history , of a war entered into so stupidly and unnecessarily , or approved so indolently and so universally . The very best case that could be put up for it reads feebly and drearily . Hear the Times itself on March 28 , 1854 : Although every step in these complicated and protracted transactions has been so minutely canvassed at the moment  | when it came to the knowledge of the public that little now remains to be said on the earlier stages of this quarrel or its successive incidents , it is important that the country should have before it as clear a notion of the causes and objects of this war as the nature of the case admits of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage confessedly in order to protect another State from unprovoked aggression , and not for the purpose of repelling or punishing insults or injuries directly inflicted by the Emperor of Russia on this country , or on subjects of the British CROWN . But , in order to complete the case on which HER MAJESTY is about to proceed to hostilities against that powerful empire , it is essential to show , as was well observed by MR . ROEBUCK one night early in the present session , that the designs and the aggression of Russia are inconsistent with those interests which we are especially bound to defend in preference to all others . That is the conviction which animates at this moment the moral and physical resistance of all Europe to Russia 's ascendancy , and it is impossible not to see that if we or the French government had receded by a single foot in this dispute , the advantage gained by Russia in the East would have enabled her , not only to complete this dissolution or subjection of the Turkish Empire , but also to hold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have even now in liberating themselves from her ascendancy , though they have long since declared her to be in the wrong , is the strongest proof of what their position must have become if Russia had been once more permitted to lay the Ottoman Empire prostrate at her feet . No foreign events , after the war was over , stimulated any memorable expression of English opinion till 1859 , a year that presented a pretty problem to both Left and Right sympathizers in England . The Emperor Napoleon went to war with Austria , in alliance with Sardinia-Piedmont , for the cause of Italian freedom . The object was one which all English democrats highly applauded . The champion was a person whom , for excellent  | reasons , which we have already seen , they detested above all others . Their difficulty was , reversed , exactly that of their Conservative colleagues . The two sides , as so often later in history , found their chief spokesman in the Times and the Manchester Guardian . At first , in its issue of February 2 , 1859 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foreign observers , seems the most unvarying characteristic of British political writing : Time was , no doubt , when we wasted millions upon millions , and we have now to pay the penalty of our folly , but it is preposterous in the present day to charge us with a warlike mania , and to send us for instruction to economical and peace-loving America . The Americans are infinitely more ready for war and extravagance than we are . They are actually in difficulties and they seem always on the verge of some public quarrel without the least symptom of dissent on the side of any public party . We , on the other hand , only " drifted " into the Russian war despite all that a pacific Ministry could do to escape it , and now when the war-cry pervades Europe , there is no country , notwithstanding the appeal made to our notorious sympathies , where the cause of peace is more boldly or promptly supported than in England . By April 16 , however , it was compelled to be more specific , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of " horse sense . " Certainly its predictions were not wholly fulfilled , but its suspicions were very reasonable : So far as we know the minds of our countrymen , we should say that there is certainly no more probability of the Emperor NAPOLEON finding sympathy , or applause , or assistance from England than there is that we should go to war for the sake of Austria . It is true that , to a certain extent , the policy towards Italy avowed by France , and that approved by England , are one and the same . If we had full and entire confidence in the singleness of purpose and the moderation of all those who profess to  | seek the well-being of Italy , we might perhaps be content to join in putting pressure upon Austria to compel her to be merciful . But our difficulty is with our ally . How can we tell whether his objects are our objects ? How can we say what may be the ultimate result when the plains of Lombardy and all the fortresses of the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all England a roomful of enthusiasts so credulous as to believe that the Emperor NAPOLEON is in this matter altogether disinterested , or that his views are bounded by the desire that Italy shall be free and independent . All men see that while the Emperor NAPOLEON is talking the language of the Carbonari he is acting out the old policy of the Bonaparte family . If we judge by what he is doing rather than by what he is saying , France , under his guidance , is now again seeking to become an Italian Power . She has got Piedmont within her grasp , and , as Tuscany and Modena must fall if the Austrians are beaten in Lombardy , we may not unreasonably suspect that our liberty-loving ally sees as a possible contingency of the restoration of the Kingdom of Etruria and the accession of Prince NAPOLEON and the Princess CLOTILDE tO that throne . But , as is the case with all political journals , its instinctive sympathies led it to misread the military news . Here , on the eve of complete Austrian collapse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 23 , 1859 ) : Austria is , as we have said , at this moment mistress of the position . She has an army on the Ticino before which , if put in motion , the forces of Sardinia must melt away into the fortresses of Alessandria and Geno , or must be hopelessly scattered . Miracles do happen undoubtedly now and then : 40,000 men have beaten 200,000 men ; but sane men do not reckon on the repetition of such incidents in the 19th century , and between regularly disciplined European troops . It would be fanatical to suggest that Sardinia can hold her own for a week against  | the host about to be let loose upon her . The flood of spoilers will sweep over the land . Next week ( April 28 , 1859 ) it went further : it urged the Piedmontese to fly from their powerful ally , and began to hint that perhaps some reason might in time be found for support to be given to Austria , despite the principles it had itself already laid down : Perhaps Count CAVOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how the fathers of the present Frenchmen treated the people they then professed to liberate . The forced contributions from Milan and from Modena , the confiscations at Venice , the storm and sack of Pavia , the shooting of the magistrates of the great cities in cold blood and the slaughter of the peasantry by French Dragoons , the spoliation of the master-pieces of Art ? all these things have their records , and now must force themselves upon the memory of those who might have remembered them at an earlier and more useful season . It is now , in all probability , too late ... . These are strange prospects suddenly revealed , and they offer us no very promising future . Still , we adhere to what we have already said ? that so long as the war is confined to Italy , or to the invasion or preservation of the Italian territories , we need take no active part in it . If , however , the tide of agression should roll nearer home , if France and Russia should attack Austria in Germany ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe , ? or if Prussia should be laid under a contribution of territory , then , indeed , the design of these Treaties of offence would become no less than a partition of Europe , and the first principle of self-preservation would compel us to consider whether we can better defend ourselves on the Continent of Europe or at our own homesteads . These are serious topics ; but , although in England we are all unanimous in desiring to keep clear , if possible , of these Continental complications , we are also profoundly convinced that the existence of a great German power is essential to our own safety .  | The Manchester Guardian was slower to show its hand , but by May 12 had decided that the unassailable rightness of the Italian cause required it to give a hypothetical and unhappy support to the French Emperor : The EMPEROR 'S arrival may therefore not improbably be the signal for the commencement of active operations , and we shall then see what stuff he is made off sic . Apart from his military career , if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and magnanimous , and in short all that his former acts proclaim him not to be , we might anticipate for him a glorious career ; for , if he would really attempt to give liberty to the Italians , and discarded all sinister designs , he might , like the Emperor AUGUSTUS , atone by the good deeds of his later life for the evil he has done by the crimes of his youth and manhood , and possibly the world might be brought in time to forget the perjuries he committed in order to wade through blood to a throne . The progress of the war put the Liberal journal into greater and greater embarrassment . It was annoyed by what it called " the English peace party , " but , while declaring the pacifists ' views absurd , proclaimed itself an adherent of peace . It saw nothing but universal confusion resulting from the Emperor 's activities , and the leader in which it declares this well reflects the confusion in its own mind ( June 20 , 1859 ) : If we required additional proof of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it in the proclamation of General KLAPKA to the Hungarians , and in the announcement that M. KOSSUTH , the latest pet of that sagacious body , the English peace party , has gone to Italy with the sanction of the French EMPEROR , and for the avowed purpose of stirring up another civil war in the Austrian empire . True , NAPOLEON III told Earl CowLEY , a month ago , as our readers have seen , that he would " give no countenance to any attempt at revolution . " But  | circumstances alter cases . It would undoubtedly weaken Austria to have a Hungarian revolution on her hands while she is fighting against the French in Italy ; and so promises are set aside : the Hungarian standard is raised at Genoa ; refugees , deserters and prisoners flock round it ; and their commander , General KLAPKA , circulates an anti-Imperialist proclamation among the Austrian troops . " Hasten , then , " he says , " to the standard which we have " raised for you . At the same time , war will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and the King of " Piedmont have recognised the holiness of your cause , we " possess their sympathy ; the Italian soldiers will join us , and " so do you join yourselves with them . " We have here , then , the programme of a new revolutionary war ; and probably , when Russia 's designs are matured , and the Austrian empire is in utter confusion , we shall next see a rising of the Christian population of European Turkey to gain their freedom with the aid of the two despotic Emperors . No one can be surprised at the proposed extension of the war to Hungary . It was the misfortune of those Knight-errants who made it their business to succour virtue in difficulties , that they soon found there was no limit to the number of distressed damsels who were kept in durance by terrible giants , and that they either had to give up philanthropy in despair as an unprofitable profession , or were obliged to go on from one adventure to another , each more dangerous than the last , till at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with our modern knight-errant , Louis NAPOLEON . Moved by the woes of Italy , he chivalrously advances to free her from her oppressor ; but no sooner is he seen approaching than all the oppressed sister nationalities run to meet him , cling to his garments , and implore the protection of the powerful liberator . Of all the sensations there is none more delightful than that which one feels in patronising people when it costs one nothing : and so the great Sovereign who keeps his troops at Rome to put down revolutions in the Papal States to the West , while he encourages  | revolution in the Papal States in the East , of the Appennines , simply because it is his interest to keep on good terms with that worst curse of Italy , the Pope , cheerfully extends sympathy and encouragement to the Hungarians , reckless that by his fair words , which perhaps he does not mean to support by arms , he exposes Europe to the danger of a general war of opinion . The war proceeded to its end : Napoleon III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The distressing problems at length ceased to vex the editors , and the Times , with a sigh of relief , was able to draw the moral its readers expected , of the superiority of British Parliamentary institutions over all foreign devices ( March 7 , 1861 ) : The affairs of Italy have now attained a point at which very little good can be done them by Debates in the British Parliament , however spirited and entertaining . No doubt , such Debates have , upon the whole , rendered Italy very considerable service . The consistent assertion and final triumph of non-intervention depended very much upon the support which the policy of Lord JOHN RUSSELL has received from the representatives of the nation . The Powers of Europe have at last comprehended that the assertions and the opinions of an English Minister are worth very little unless they are backed by the sincere and hearty concurrence of a Parliamentary majority . It was the want of this which rendered utterly impotent the well-meant efforts of LORD MALMESBURY to preserve the peace of Europe ; and it was the certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish with so much ease , against the will of the Government of France , which was perpetually urging its violation , the right of the Italians to settle their own affairs in their own way . Another great advantage which Italy has received from the discussions of Parliament has been the encouragement of the Moderate and Constitutional Party and the utter depression and almost extinction of the Republican Party .  | ELOQUENT VICTORIANS ( 1861-70 ) The end of the Italian war and the quite temporary quiescence of the French Emperor enabled the English to turn their attention to events which were , in those days , so far distant in space that they could seem less important than the extinction of Italian duchies . In March 1861 Abraham Lincoln 's Inaugural called the world 's attention to the imminence of the American Civil War . The Times was not impressed , and offered both literary and political criticism on March 18 : The speech concludes with these words , which we may be forgiven for thinking are scarcely conceived in a vein worthy of the occasion : ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriot grave to every living heart in this broad land will yet swell a chorus of union when again touched , as they surely will be , by the better angels of our nature . " We read this piece of fine writing with some impatience when we consider the momentous matters to which it is the epilogue . Mr. LINCOLN 'S expressions are studiously cautious and moderate , but they really amount to this ? that he will enter into no negotiation with the South ? that he will hold so much of the property of the United States Government as is still in his power , will " possess and occupy " ? that is , recapture , the citadels , arsenals , and other property of the United States which have fallen into the hands of the South : and , further , that he will collect the revenue from the seceding States , which , if done in the mildest manner , implies a very strict blockade . In making these announcements President LINCOLN may be doing nothing more than his duty , but we  | can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nor less than a declaration of civil war . The next day it elaborated its thesis , underlined its contempt , and explained its belief that the Border States would join the South by a Conservative adaptation of Marxist historical materialism : The struggle may be a painful one , but we fear that it will be decided rather by interest than by sympathy and that Mr. LINCOLN 'S constitutional lectures will avail little against the considerations suggested to the Border States by the high price of manufactures and a good market for slaves . On the same day the Manchester Guardian offered kindlier remarks on Lincoln 's speech , but was no more convinced that his well-meant effort could be successful . Its analysis of the attitude of the South was considerably more acute than later historians have allowed : Unfortunately it can not now be believed that the difficulties of the practical problem are amenable to this sort of treatment . The reason that all argumentative attempts to allay the fears of the Secessionists are likely to be in vain is that they never seriously feared anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the hollow pretext under which they have sought to mask the execution of a long-entertained design of treason . In fact , the hearts of those states which have taken the lead in the present movement have never at any time been in the Union . They put up with the restraints which it imposed on their aggressive impulses , and with the humiliation to which they modestly conceived that it subjected them , for a season only , and on one condition . That condition was that they should have the virtual supremacy in the government which has been enjoyed by them for a series of successive administrations .  | The division of opinion in England over the American Civil War is well known . The North supported the North ; the South supported the South . The cotton operatives , and even many of their employers , thrown on the streets of Lancashire towns by the stopping of the cotton trade , remained immovable in their support of the anti-slavery forces . But the more elegant circles in London , and those who depended on them , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans had frequently enough writhed under the sneers of the same people because they had tolerated slavery so long : they were naive enough to believe that once the question of slavery had been raised the opinion of England would be undividedly on the side of the North . They were undeceived rapidly . Like calls to like : the division between Lancashire and London was a class division . The cotton-weavers felt a unity that they would have been puzzled to explain with the black slaves ; London Society felt a similar sympathy which it had some difficulty in explaining with the owners of slaves . The Daily Telegraph , at that time a rather unscrupulous organ , similar in politics , as in other matters , to the Daily News , but " more gushing and versatile , " made the most notable endeavour to rationalize this sentiment in its first leader on May 24 , 1861 : It is important for the clear understanding of the present dispute in America , that the English reader should know specifically the grounds of the conflict ; and it is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misrepresented . We have no need to tell our own readers that we are not " against the North . " We are more for the North than are the people of the North themselves . We believe that certain citizens of the commonwealth on the other side of the Atlantic would have served their country better , would better have promoted their own views , if they had faithfully adhered to their constitution in letter and spirit . We are not " against " any part  | of the Union ; we are only against the present headlong move , anent in the North , because we are for the law . Nor need we assure the public that we have not acquired any new favour for the institution of Negro slavery . We regret that it was ever forced upon the Southern States of America by the British Government . We regret that it has not been extinguished by this time . We are as strongly imbued with those feelings as HENRY CLAY himself , and we believe so beneficial a movement in the social condition of the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now rampant and dominant in the North . Whatever their opinion on particular points , the citizens of the Union were bound to accept their institutions as they found them , or to amend them only by regular course . Such a course is laid down by the constitution itself . The proposal must be brought before Congress , either by " two-thirds of both Houses " or " by the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several states , " and the amendments must be " ratified by the Legislatures in three-fourths of the states or by conventions in three-fourths thereof . " In that way the constitution has been amended several times : and we believe there is no part of the original statute that could not be thus altered . Instead of adopting that course , the party , which , by a fortuitous circumstance , has placed its own candidate in the chief command at Washington , unreservedly declared its intention to prevent the introduction of slavery into the territories of the Union . This directly violated the constitution , which distinctly , though impliedly , recognises " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the citizens of states in respect to every kind of property . By the constitution of the Union , slaves are property . A settler moving westward from South Carolina has as much right to carry with him two black slaves as a settler from Massachusetts moving westward has to take two black boots . The party which has obtained the dominant position for the day in the United States has violated both the constitution and the law of property .  | It returned to the same question in its second leader : the matter was disquieting it considerably . The more popular ? that is to say , the less subtle ? expressions of any attitude upon foreign affairs ( or home affairs , no doubt ) almost always show clear traces of yielding to a temptation to distort facts to support opinions . It is not that the writers require to change the facts of history to suit themselves ; they generally believe honestly enough that they have based their opinions upon truth ; but they can not resist believing also that right is already triumphing over wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same date : The prospect in America continues to darken . In every sense the news from the North is worse ? save in the sense that the very pressure of the calamity into which the Federal Government has precipitated itself and the Republic may bring the National Party of the North to its senses . The Southern forces are still advancing , and they have increased the number of the successes with which they opened the contest . Men and money appear to be forthcoming for all needful purposes , and confidence has not declined in Montgomery , Charleston , Mobile , New Orleans , or indeed , any of the Southern cities . That the Virginians had taken possession of the heights on the Maryland side of the Potomac was an important fact , politically even more than strategically , for the Government of Maryland was inclined to trim , while the people are supposed to be heartily with the South , and the repeated boast in the northern papers and letters that the communications through Baltimore are kept open implies a constant apprehension that they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side . The cutter Harriet Lane has seized a privateer , and a brigade of Missouri militia has been captured by Federal troops . But some of the Northern reports are manifestly unsustained ? such as the negro insurrection in Kentucky . This is evidently an a priori notion , and it is more than gainsaid at present by the general quietude of the black population in the  | South . In some States we see very fairly authenticated reports that the negroes are buying the public stock of the seceding State ; and more directly within our own information we have reports of blacks asking to form volunteer regiments to defend the Southern flag . If there is unanimity in the North , there appears to be quite as broad and as strong a unanimity in the South . The war proceeded ; Southern victories gave way to Northern ; the slaves were liberated . The constitutional darkness gave way to a plainer question . Yet not for that reason would the proslavery Press give way to the anti-slavery . The tactics and opinions of both sides are shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , 1864 , enshrining a quotation from the Times . The Morning Star was an important venture in its day : it was an endeavour to provide at the low price of Id . a regular and well-informed Radical service of information . It was praised by the Saturday Review as " neither vulgar nor imbecile , " but after a useful life of under twenty years was overwhelmed by rivals who were both , and disappeared in the embrace of the Daily News . At this date it was among the most powerful of the supporters of the North . ANOTHER FALSEHOOD OF THE " TIMES " The Times of yesterday contains the following statement : " From Mr. Lincoln 's message to Congress it appears that the total number of slaves the Federal armies have liberated is 100,000 . This is the whole result of three years of war in the name of abolition . And at an awful price it has been obtained . For every negro thus freed it is calculated that three white men have been killed in the contest . If the four millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , the calculation becomes something terrible and the feelings of humanity will be appealed to on behalf of the superior race . The worst  | ELOQUENT VICTORIANS evil that has grown out of the system of slavery is the war carried on to extinguish it . To be successful , the conquest of the Southern territory must be complete , and after all the waste of life and money most of the task has still to be done . What has been effected in the work of abolition is even less in proportion . The war has liberated one hundred thousand negroes , leaving the condition of millions of slaves unaltered . " The Times must be terribly hard up for arguments when , in order to depreciate the results of the President 's emancipation policy , it makes so flagititious a misrepresentation . What Mr. Lincoln said in his Message was as follows : " Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the Rebel " lion full 100,000 are now in the United States military serv " ice , about one-half of which number actually bear arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking so " much labour from the insurgent cause , and supplying the " places which otherwise must be filled with so many white " men . " It will thus be seen that Mr. Lincoln , instead of stating " that the total number of slaves the Federal Armies have liberated is 100,000 " simply quoted these figures as representing the number of emancipated blacks who have entered the military service of the United States . It would have been bad enough for the Times to commit so unblushing a perversion of the truth on its own authority , but to make Mr. Lincoln himself responsible for its malignant invention is carrying effrontery one step too far , even for the misleading journal . Our contemporary knows well enough that since the issue of the President 's proclamation nearly six hundred thousand slaves have been liberated in the Southern States . The Morning Star could have written even more strongly if it had been aware how far the Times was actually going in its dislike of the Northern cause . It had sent Mr. W. H. Russell to  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for describing the battle of Bull Run in terms which suggested a sympathy with views not those of his employers . It had in New York a sufficiently docile correspondent in Charles Mackay , whose derogatory descriptions of the Northerners it printed continuously for three years . But even he was not always sufficiently rude to the Yankees to please the Times . Substituting his own survey for that of the expelled Russell , Mackay wrote of the earlier period of the war that the battles so far had no effect upon the course of the war , and that " they proved nothing but the courage of the combatants . " The Editor himself , on receiving the dispatch , altered the word " nothing " to " anything , " correcting what he considered could only be a slip of the pen . The simple change aroused more annoyance in New York than anything since the days of George III , and Mackay was lucky not to be lynched . But the perverseness and obstinacy of the Times were not enough to satisfy the more reasoning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which made the question blankly one of slavery or no slavery , and the course of events , which made it improbable that the South would win , compelled this class slowly to change its mind . The opinion of those who wished to be thought moderates was very intelligently voiced by the Saturday Review on February 20 , 1864 : The paradoxes of slave owners and the extravagances of philanthropists include an element of truth . Although it is absurd to suppose that the coloured population of the Free or Slave States have attained to European or American civilization , subjection to a superior race has probably raised them to a condition far removed from their original barbarism . It is equally unreasonable to pretend , with the Edinburgh Reviewer , that they are equal to the whites who have oppressed them , and to acquiesce in the perpetual slavery to which they are doomed by Mr. Stephens . The Confederates have , in the  | course of their great struggle , exhibited almost all the highest political qualities , in their capacity to command , in their readiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their indomitable resolution . They might have commanded universal admiration , and they would probably have rendered their enemies powerless , if they had also possessed sufficient wisdom and courage to exchange slavery for predial serfdom . The state from which the Russian peasants are even now emerging would be a great and beneficial advance to the Southern negroes . The undisputed political supremacy of the whites would enable them to provide against the economical failure which has partially discredited West Indian emancipation . It would have been no hardship to home-loving negroes to remain attached to the soil , and under wiser laws the value of their labour might have been not only maintained , but largely increased . The partial experiments of free labour which have been tried by Federal Generals and Commissioners are insufficient , and they may probably be found illusory . The emancipated slaves feel that they are on their trial , nor have they yet had the opportunity of living in idleness on their own provision grounds . The south would , under any circumstances , have remained subject to the hatred of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equitable opponents they would have escaped the moral isolation to which they are at present condemned . If they are finally defeated , their Northern successors will probably introduce a system of regulated coercion which will display many of the features of villenage or predial servitude . But the illusions still persisted . On April 30 , 1864 , well into the year which saw Sherman 's march and the smashing of the Confederate power , the same journal estimated the forces of the opposing powers in terms which showed a firm belief that the South could not be conquered : General Grant , who now commands the Armies of the Union in right of his rank as Lieutenant-General , has recently occupied himself with the re-organisation of the Army of the  | Potomac . It is said that most of the drunken and incompetent officers have been dismissed , and the troops are now thought to have attained a thoroughly efficient condition . According to the latest accounts , all furloughs have been recalled , the idlers have been sent to the rear , and it is generally believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The Confederates declare that they were never so strong as now , and their enemies echo and adopt the boast . As a belligerent is fully justified in exaggerating his forces , it is impossible to judge of the truth of Northern or Southern allegations . Both parties naturally avoid details which might supply a test of their assertions , for , while it is certain that the Federal Government recruits from a larger population , the Confederates can rely on a more unanimous loyalty . The North from time to time exhibits symptoms of weariness , but the seceding States have apparently never modified their original enthusiasm . They have some reason to hope that , if they can maintain themselves through the approaching campaign , the worst part of the war will be over . Deeper levels of prejudice were stirred as the Federal troops closed in . There have always been circles in England which have latent or open the same colour prejudices as the white Southerners , and the same sexual apprehensions . The following article of the Saturday Review of June 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer known to what particular indiscreet female effusions ( if any ) it refers : Many may have been the illusions raised by the conduct of both parties in this murderous conflict . But there is no illusion more strange that that of the people who believe that any respectable party or body of Northerners honestly proposes to put the negro on a perfect level with white men . Foolish fanatics and preachers may declaim ; shameless women may indite , and more shameless women may recite , a cento of obscenities thinly veiled by the gloss of humanitarianism ; young girls who ,  | if they have no other grace or beauty , should at least have the grace and beauty of modesty , may address to their negro warriors language which would be deemed more than sufficiently warm if used by the girlhood of Venice and Rome to the soldiers of Italy . All this may happen and happen again ; but we are convinced that neither sober American citizens of the North , nor sober Englishmen who have visited English settlements in the West Indies , will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social equal of the white man , and encourages the dusky pets of the platform to aspire to a matrimonial alliance with white women . But during all this period the American Civil War was only one of several entertainments staged for the amusement of the English . That is the correct way to consider them if we wish to look at them through contemporary eyes . For if a few ardent lovers of freedom enlisted in Garibaldi 's Red Shirts no Liberal or Radical ever seriously considered that Britain should take any part in the struggles for liberty ; no Conservative would have enlisted in defence of any reactionary monarch , let alone sent a British ship to support him . Sometimes , as in the case of Denmark 's dispute with Prussia , the failure of foreigners to appreciate this purely Platonic character of British interest led to tragedy . If the enthusiasts of the whole Continent had read the leader of the Morning Star of January 8 , 1864 , they would have been spared disappointments Abyssinian in their bitterness : A manifesto recently issued by GARIBALDI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping nations at peace . The Italian hero yearns for an attack upon Austria . His ardent and chivalric nature thinks nothing of odds , and with the generous miscalculations of a noble mind he counts every Italian as another GARIBALDI . But in order that Italy should be free to plunge into a frantic war he demands that the Parliament shall be closed and a Dictatorship vested in  | the KING . This , we all know , is a favourite Garibaldian scheme . Some years ago , when Italy was in her great crisis , the hero made a similar proposal , which was met by a letter of Count CAVOUR 's , a model of calm , statesmanlike and patriotic argument , full of that deep confidence in the principles of political liberty which was so vital an element of the great Minister 's character . But we are content to accept GARIBALDI 'S plea and make it an argument on our side . We admit that the Italian Parliament stands between its country and a rash war . So , too , with all its deficiencies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parliament of Austria ; so , even in its present passion , does the Parliament of Prussia . Need we say that the English Parliament will surely seek no war just now which it can safely and honourably avoid ? A patriotic German paper speaks scornfully of England , and bids Germans not to heed her remonstrances , because her hampered and powerless Government can make no war without the consent of a Parliament composed of all manner of unchivalrous and cold-blooded manufacturers , country squires , and merchants . It is ever so . The English Parliament does still meanly retain to itself the practical right of deciding for war and peace . On these conditions our hopes for the future are grounded . The Germans may be sure that however our national or political sympathies may go we will find no cannon shot for the treaty of 1852 . If Germany and Denmark will fight they must see the quarrel out for themselves . Believing that at least the French and the Italian Parliaments are in the same pacific and practical mood as the Parliament of England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any conflagration beyond a local burning out . Both Left and Right , Radical and Conservative , considered foreign events as a spectacle . They differed only on whether the play was a comedy or a tragedy . For the Liberal-minded the misadventures of liberty were a tragedy ; for the Conservatives they were only fresh instances of the farcical troubles into  | which foreigners naturally fell , not being Englishmen . The Saturday Review , which counted itself Liberal , surveyed the European and Mexican scene in this spirit on January 9 , 1864 . ( The Archduke Maximilian , it may be remembered , was about to be made Emperor of Mexico with the aid of the troops of Napoleon III . ) To correct or to guide the ambiguous utterances of the oracle of nationality , French ingenuity has invented the still more accommodating device of universal suffrage . In Naples , in Savoy , and in Nice , the majority of the entire population has been supposed to ratify the decisions of war and diplomacy ; and the Archduke MAXIMILIAN , acting under French inspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor of the Mexican branch of the Latin race . . . . It would , however , he idle to enter into a serious discussion of an absurd and impossible contrivance . No accident of force and fraud , or of the hereditary descent of princes , is as mischievous as the confusion which would make national existence contingent on the popular caprice of a single day . Where national independence has really been achieved , the necessary efforts and sacrifices have in almost all cases been undergone by an elightened minority . It would be intolerable that the fruit of their labours should be confiscated by the irresponsible voice of a factious or deluded mob , nor has any excuse ever been assigned for the absurdity of making a single vote conclusive of the fate of a whole generation and of an indefinite posterity ... . Nationality and universal suffrage , taken together or separately , mean , in the intention of their advocates , little more than the universal dictation of France . The clever journalists who abstain with habitual care from all study of foreign opinion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iteration , that Europe , or the world at large , longs for the presence of French armies and for the undefined ideas which they are supposed to carry in their train . The enterprises of the first NAPOLEON still form the ideal of visionary projectors . It  | is true that the great conqueror knew and cared so little about nationality that , after over-running every country within his reach , he informed his disciples at St. Helena that Great Britain and Ireland were , like his own Italian Island of Corsica , destined by nature to be a portion of France . If his prophecy were likely to be accomplished , his admirers would easily surmount the difficulties of separate nationality , adopting perhaps , in preference , the auxiliary machine of the ballot-box to sanction the decision of arms . For the present , their hopes are more modest , and they would be content with Belgium because it is French in language , and with Rhenish Germany because it is interposed between France and the river . If either country were once captured and occupied , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coveted district would have the same liberty of choice with the parishioners of Knocktarlitie , when they gave a harmonious call to the nominee of the Duke of ARGYLL . " The Captain , " said DAVID DEANS , " assures me that the call is unanimous on the part of the parishioners ? a real harmonious call , REUBEN . " " I believe , " said DUNCAN , " it was as harmonious as could be expected , when the tae half o ' the bodies were clavering Sassenach , and the tother skirling Gaelic , like sea-maws and clack-geese before a storm . Ane wurd hae needed the gift of tongues to ken preceesly what they said ? but I believe the best end of it was , Long live MACCULLUM MORE and Knockdunder . ' And as to its being a unanimous call , ' I wad be glad to ken fat business the caries have to call onything or onybody but what the DUKE and myself likes ? " The analogy is the more perfect because the parish of Knocktarlitie , like the Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt that , whether the voters claver in Spanish or skirl in Indian , the best end of their shouts will be " Long live NAPOLEON III and General BAZAINE . " If the Archduke MAXIMILIAN should require additional satisfaction , he may profit by the further answer which his prototype received from the arbitrary Captain of Knockdunder . " Nevertheless , " said Mr. BUTLER , " if any of the parishioners have any scruples , which sometimes happen in the mind of sincere pro- fessers , I should be happy of an opportunity of trying to remove " " Never fash your beard about it , man , " interrupted DUNCAN KNOCK , " leave it ' a to me . Scruple ; dell ane o ' them has been bred up to scruple onything they 're bidden to do .

" The Emperor NAPOLEON is perfectly welcome to be the MACCuLLUM MORE of Mexico , but when it is proposed to introduce the same system of harmonious calls on the Continent of Europe , England may without discourtesy abstain from sanctioning , by presence or by discussion , the new system of international law . In earlier years England had not , in the opinion of the Press , shown sufficient independence of foreign Governments , but the arrival of a report of an attempt on the life of Napoleon III enabled the Morning Star to comment that things were now very different from the days of Orsini and his infernal machine . It wrote on January 9 , 1864 : The report , true or false , revives memories strangely mingling up the horrible and the ludicrous . It recalls to recollection the fearful crime which ORSINI debased his generous and gallant nature by planning and striving to execute ? the fearful scene which took place in the Rue Lepelletier when the bombs were flung , and amid the wild shrieks of the crowd , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maddened horses , the consternation , the confusion and the darkness , the EMPEROR himself showed a calm courage which Mr. KINGLAKE might have acknowledged . It recalls the events which followed in Paris : the trial , the eloquent defence , and the final act in the bloody drama in which , if mere bravery and dignified composure could have redeemed any of the horror of such a crime , FELICE ORSINI would have seemed a being not unworthy of sympathy . But the event also reveals to the recollection the frantic nonsense talked by the French colonels , the  | foolish complaints against England , the ludicrous denunciations of a debating society in a Fleet Street public-house , the unlucky Palmerstonian Conspiracy Bill , and the frank and manly way in which the nation rose against that most obnoxious and hapless piece of attempted legislature . Since then we would fain hope that the French EMPEROR and the French people have learned better to know the English nation . We feel confident that the Moniteur will publish no offers of an English invasion from French Colonels this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had anything more to do with the plot of the men just arrested than Paris had to do with RAVAILLAC or DAMIENS . Other people , too , have probably learned to know the English nation better , and we shall assuredly have no Conspiracy Bill introduced with the name of Lord Palmerston on its back this time . At the same time expressions of British sympathy , in the highest and lowest circles , were encouraging a small nation to rush to disaster . The King of Denmark owned the two duchies of Schleswig and Holstein , which were mainly German in population . Bismarck , with the reluctant and suspicious aid of Austria , was determined to conquer them . Misled into the belief that British sympathy would be translated into military aid , the Danes were unreasonably obstinate , and plunged headlong into a war in which they had no chance of victory . The Morning Star on January 19 , 1864 , in vain begged for an honest statement of English intentions : It is quite time that England should declare itself upon the subject . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the idea of England 's going to war in such a cause appears too monstrous , too utterly incredible , to call for any national repudiation . But we warn the English people not to be lulled to sleep by any such delusion . If they do not speak out in time they may find that they have been fatally compromised by a false confidence . It  | is the settled conviction of Denmark that in going into a war with Germany she has an assurance of English aid . It is the fixed belief of ninety-nine out of every hundred Germans that the English Government has positively pledged the right hand and the sword of England to the cause of Denmark . Were it but as an act of justice and good feeling towards Denmark with which unquestionably England sympathises , the British people ought to speak out plainly and announce its decision . No one can say how far the expected support of Great Britain may not have operated in urging the Danes to a course of uncompromising resistance . Let us not allow the delusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unequal war on the faith of a co-operation which the English people never promised and never had the least disposition to afford . It unfortunately happens that the very obscurity of the Danish question , the very apathy of the English people regarding it , are but stronger reasons for dreading the possibility of either England or Denmark , or both , being made the victims of diplomatic delusion . Certainly , if we are not to shut our eyes and mouths and allow ourselves to be led blind and dumb on the edge of the precipice , the hour has come when the people of England should look before them and declare the course they mean to take . A little more of passiveness and apathy and we may find ourselves too far advanced upon the dangerous way to draw back either with safety or with honour . If England is ready to enter on an entirely new course of policy ? if she is prepared to declare herself the guardian of continental order and the policeman of Europe ? if she is determined to compel every party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sword ? if she is willing to open up for herself a career which CHARLES XII would have declined as imprudent , which DoN QUIXOTE would have condemned as irrational ? then at least she ought to announce her resolution in some national form of expression . If she is not prepared for such a course , then she had better lose no time in declaring against it .  | Among the performers in the amusing and rather disreputable non-stop circus which Napoleon III provided for the entertainment of Europe was one figure which pleased Englishmen particularly . The Emperor 's relative , Prince Napoleon , was very indiscreet , very eloquent , and professed the loudest democratic sentiments . On February 16 , 1864 , the Morning Star felt bound to comment on his fear that England might conceivably interest herself in the Suez Canal ; The English people , however , have no particular reason to feel aggrieved by the Prince NAPOLEON 'S vehement rhetoric . If the Prince disparaged the English Government he warmly eulogised the English people . It is but justice to Prince NAPOLEON to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right side . He is the partisan of Italy and of Poland ; he is the champion of Liberalism and popular rights everywhere ; he is an avowed sympathiser with the cause of the Federal Government of America against the Southern seceders and slave-owners . Princes who entertain such sentiments , and who can express them in language of thrilling eloquence , are not to be met with every day ; and the English people would probably overlook a little indiscretion and even a little national and traditional prejudice in one who possesses so many political recommendations . As regards the Suez Canal project , Prince NAPOLEON is perfectly right in supposing that any English Government which attempted to drag England into a war about the Suez Canal would fall beneath the contempt and ridicule of the English people . But why does he seem to attach any importance whatever to the absurd notion that any English statesman contemplated such a policy ? Surely one who knows our language and our country , understands our institutions , and is acquainted personally with most of our public men , ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Premier Consul , otez cette folie hors de votre tete " said Charles James Fox in his droll English-French to the First Napoleon , when the latter talked about British Governments  | encouraging assassins to murder him . So we beg leave to say to Prince NAPOLEON ? Get that nonsense out of your head . No English minister , be he never so old , has any notion of setting on a war directly or indirectly to interfere with the Suez Canal . It may be that some of our Ministers do not like the scheme , and do feel some secret dread and jealousy of it . There are still in London as well as in Paris representatives of traditional policy which might well have been buried and forgotten long ago . But even they do not contemplate making war for their ideas . There are probably not a dozen Englishmen alive who feel any dread or misgiving with regard to the Suez Canal project , except a doubt as to whether it will work , and whether it will pay . Many Englishmen may think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scrupulous care . So do many Frenchmen ? among the rest some close political colleagues of Prince NAPOLEON himself . But if the Canal project prove a success it will be welcomed by the English nation with a cordial satisfaction , untainted by any tincture of national jealousy or fear . Any lingering objection founded on political suspicion which may remain in the bosom of any British Minister is only a dim departing ghost , and may , when the canal is complete , be fitly laid in the Red Sea . Only make the canal a success and we shall be all glad to avail ourselves of its advantages , and shall be ready to accord to French enterprise and perseverance the full glory of having achieved it . England has no more political jealousy or dread in regard to the development of the Suez Canal than she had in relation to the Mont Cenis tunnel or the Boulevard de Sebastopol.Since the Canal has come to our notice , let us jump a few years to 1869 and observe the opinion of a body of persons whose views are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Disraeli was to purchase this canal , and this purchase has been ever since celebrated as a stroke of genius . It is inter- esting to find what was the verdict on the Canal of what was presumably the best-informed section of the English public . A little explanation is necessary to introduce the Queen 's Messenger , the short-lived journal which has , perhaps for the only time in history , expressed in public the uncensored views of the Service . It was run by the cleverest journalist on Vanity Fair , Grenville Murray . This unfortunate and brilliant man started this paper to expose grave corruption which had worked itself deeply into the Service . He did his work too well : he excited dangerous enemies . He was unwise enough to add personal parody of the aristocracy to his columns : he was first horsewhipped and then driven abroad by a threat of prosecution for perjury . Here is his article of April 8 , 1869 : THE SUEZ CANAL A curious feeler has been recently put forward by the persons pecuniarily interested in the magnificent blunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really open throughout its length between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea , as anticipated , by next October , it appears that the advantages to be derived from it are limited to few . There will be a saving of distance to India as compared with the Cape route , and passengers to Australia will gain something ; but the enormous sum of money sunk upon this enterprise will have no adequate return in the shape of substantial profits . The commercial prospects of the canal are more than doubtful . It will prove almost worthless except as a postal and passenger route ; for no sailing vessel bound to India or Australia will ever take the way of the canal , because it would have to be towed by steamer the whole distance from Gibraltar to Aden , an expense which the goods ordinarily transported by such means could not bear . Moreover , the navigation of the Red Sea is so difficult that probably a small coasting trade between Greece , Italy , and Egypt will be the sole increase of traffic by sailing  | vessels likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Its failure as an investment may be considered certain ; and therefore it is now demurely suggested that the British Government shall buy up the shares and hold them as a political advantage . Against any such proposal we presume very distinctly to protest . The best thing which can possibly happen for the interests of the British empire in this direction is , that the Suez Canal should be choked up and forgotten as a means of transit to India . It has been from first to last a French project designed to injure and undermine our power in the East . On the one hand , Lord Palmerston was as strongly opposed to it as wide and mature experience could make him ; and , on the other , there is no doubt that the whole scheme was originated and supported by the Emperor of the French with a view of obtaining paramount influence in Egypt . The speculation , though daring and unusually hazardous from a pecuniary point of view , has been throughout its whole progress extremely popular in France , and its completion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national pride . Numerous colonies of Frenchmen have already taken up their abode in Egypt , and it is not unlikely that if their concerns prosper they might prove formidable foes in critical times , not the less dangerous because unthought of and uncounted . Returning to the year 1864 , we find the Press considerably exercised , as ever , over the condition of Italy . The war with Austria had left the Pope head of a small ill-governed state in the centre of free Italy , the Roman Campagna . A French garrison alone prevented the new Italian state putting an end to this anachronism : the moment the French were withdrawn there would scarcely be a single Italian subject of the Pope 's to object even formally to annexation . The Morning Star commented in these words on March 16 , 1864 : But Rome may now look with good heart and hope to a political future . While her own Government is only a myth ,  | a strong , genuine , national power is arising all around her . Rome is , indeed , threatened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible that united Italy can grow up strong , national , free , and prosperous and this wretched , decaying disorganised State of Rome remain an isolated fragment in the midst . In one sense at least the conditions which existed in the days of PETRARCH are now reversed . Miserable and ungoverned as Rome was then , yet it was positively a haven of refuge from the utter anarchy and lawlessness of the country all around . Now Northern Italy , with its maturity of freedom and prosperity encloses it on one side ; Southern Italy with its growing vital power , its new representative institutions , its trial by jury ( trial accorded just now even to the most infamous of the assassin bands ) , its roads , its railways , and its telegraphs , grows up to the Roman frontier on the other side . A State with a medieval government , or rather a mediaeval anarchy , can not long exist in the centre of a free , civilised , and prosperous kingdom when the population of State and Kingdom alike desire and claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself at least settle the Roman question . In the early times to which we have more than once alluded , a Pope , seeing that Rome was fast sinking into ruin , bethought himself of where his duty lay , and transferred his seat from Avignon back to the old and sacred city . Thus if some sudden event do not sooner solve the question , some Pope yet wiser will probably see that his source of power should be an Italian spirit , and not a French garrison ; and offering himself to the confidence of his country will effect that reconciliation between Rome and Italy which the Emperor Napoleon professes so ardently to desire . The same month Garibaldi paid a visit to England . For years afterwards his reception was remembered . If contemporary accounts can be trusted no such welcome was accorded to any person , royal or commoner , in that century ? or , for that matter , in the present century . The manufactured enthusiasm over film  | stars , the organized loyalty to home or foreign royalties , are dimmed by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hospitality and enthusiasm showered on him that he had to cut his visit short for the mere sake of his health . The Government ? because Garibaldi was in disagreement with the Italian Ministry ? could not or would not arrange official celebrations , but this only threw into a stronger light the spontaneous welcome of the citizens , from the smallest Radical Republican working man 's club to the Conservatives of the City of London . The horizons were scanned for the sails of his ship ; reports were telegraphed by the new electrical machine from port after port ; before his arrival the Morning Star , commencing its leader in capitals which violated every canon of Victorian reticence , expressed the universal sentiment ( March 23 , 1864 ) : GARIBALDI IS ON HIS WAY TO ENGLAND . He has left Caprera on a steamer which is expected to reach Southampton one day next week . The intelligence can not fail to excite the warmest interest throughout the country . By all classes and by nearly all parties , his arrival will be eagerly anticipated and cordially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italian liberation . He is the embodiment of the cause of Italian unity and independence . He is a man whose career is of romantic interest , whose character is of faultless nobility , whose patriotism is of the purest integrity , whose politics are those of every true Italian throughout the world . He is a soldier without ambition , a conqueror without pride , a captive and an exile without humiliation and bitterness . . . . From end to end of the island ? if he should be able to travel so far ? and he has promised to go as far north as Newcastle ? he will be greeted with such enthusiasm as will put to utter shame the calumnies and insults which faction heaps upon Italian patriotism . From every town he will receive invitations , ? and , wherever he may go , he will be laden with tokens of enthusiasm hardly to be exceeded even in the  | country of which he is the liberator . It would be superfluous to urge preparations for an event which is its own sufficient herald . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reception . The people will go out to meet the hero of freedom , the deliverer of his country , the friend of mankind . May no mischance delay his coming or blot the splendour of his welcome ! The affairs of another recently liberated nation were treated with considerably more levity . The Danubian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia , now better known under the title of Roumania , had but recently been wholly freed of the Turkish yoke . They possessed a constitution , a Parliament , and an ambitious Prince . The Assembly was elected by the propertied class alone , and the Prince dismissed it . His intentions were in reality far more reputable than those of Napoleon III , but the British Press declined to treat him except as a subject for levity . The Saturday Review commented on June 4th as follows ; THE DANUBIAN PRINCIPALITIES When M. VICTOR HUGO wrote his Napoleon the Little , he considered it the height of sarcasm to paint a little man imitating a great one , playing at empire , and pretending to fill shoes a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced since those days . NAPOLEON the Little is at least a successful man , and now he too is imitated and there is a Little NAPOLEON the Little . Prince COUZA has had the honour of getting up a coup d'etat in exact imitation of the famous Second of December . It was conducted under the distinguished patronage of the Author of the December coup d'etat himself , who directed it personally by telegraph , and whose experience ensured success . Everything was complete , and now ALEXANDER JOHN , by the Grace of God and the will of the people , is ruler of the United Roumanian Principalities . Universal suffrage , conducted under proper military supervision , has rati- fled his act , and out of eight hundred thousand voters considerably more than seven hundred thousand have shown that the will of the people is on his side . Probably the usual Te Deums which are at the command of any Government , of any creed , have also testified that he rules by the grace of God . The earthly instrumentality which he employed to anticipate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a strong party of soldiery . He had quarrelled with his Assembly , who wanted to get rid of his Ministry . He was hesitating , it is said , whether he should keep the oath of his Constitution , when a dispensation arrived by telegraph from the Tuileries , and he was told that his Constitution and his oath were at an end . The Assembly was accordingly called together , and the PRIME MINISTER came down with two messages from the Prince in his pocket . The mildest was produced first , and informed the Deputies that they must either pass the laws recommended by the Prince or none . But this was too mild an attack . The Deputies simply passed a resolution that the message was unconstitutional , on which the PRIME MINISTER took out of his pocket the other message , dissolving the Assembly ; and , apprehending some unpleasantness , immediately ran off without his hat , and got safely into his carriage . The soldiers streamed in , and the Constitution of Moldo-Wallachia was among the things of the past . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the window ; others of a bolder spirit invited the soldiers to cover the PRINCE with infamy , by killing right and left . Forthwith a proclamation was issued by the PRIME MINISTER , and another by the PRINCE . In his manifesto the PRIME MINISTER said that " the Prince of the Roumans has , after great long suffering , complied with the wish of the country " ? a phrase which we may guess no one in Moldo-Wallachia could have invented , and which came direct from the Tuileries . The Minister went on to say that " ALEXANDER JOHN submits this step to the judgment of the nation and the opinion of enlightened Europe , " and then ALEXANDER JOHN began to speak for himself , to decree a new electoral law , to fix a day for the ratification by  | universal suffrage of his proceedings , and finally to terminate the liberty of the press . Nothing more remained to be done . The day after the decree , all the Liberal papers were stopped in the Wallachian Post-Office ; and a few days afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes of universal suffrage , pronounced that the overthrow of the Constitution , the dispersion of the Assembly by soldiers , and the term at last imposed by the PRINCE on his long suffering , all met with their very heartiest approval . All the formalities of a Napoleonic coup d'etat have now been complied with , and the two rulers by the grace of God and the will of the people may telegraph to each other with much sympathy and confidence . No serious divisions of opinion were caused in England until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War , but one event can not be passed over , in view of later history ? that is , the invasion , conquest , and evacuation of Abyssinia , begun in 1867 . The odds were something similar to the odds in 1936 , except that the English possessed no weapon similar to poison gas , which enabled the Italians to break through . It was therefore with considerable interest that the papers were searched to find what was contemporary English opinion upon this feat of arms , which seventy years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . It was with some disappointment discovered that the whole affair was deemed scarcely worthy of comment ; and when comment was discovered phrases about heroism , glory , Roman valour , admiration of the world , or similar sentences were totally absent , and an incomprehensibly flippant attitude was assumed . The staid Spectator , in a quite secondary position in its columns , wrote as follows on August 31 , 1867 : The preparations for an invasion of Abyssinia have begun in earnest . Sir Robert Napier , the Commander-in-Chief in Bombay , has been selected for the command , with Sir Charles  | Staveley as second , and the " expeditionary force " will include two Queen 's regiments , eight regiments of Punjabee infantry , six regiments of cavalry , two kinds of mountain guns , two batteries of Royal Artillery , and at least twenty thousand followers of sorts . An extra medical staff will be organised of picked men , the commisariat is to be entrusted to the Indian Department , which has never failed yet , and immense purchases of mules and camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London at very heavy rates , ? 1,200 a month for each 1,000-ton ship , and all appearances indicate an expedition of some historical moment . Everybody who has ever been in Africa is writing to abuse the blacks , and the country and Englishmen in general are quite delighted with the little break in political monotony . If Theodore surrenders the prisoners now , he will disappoint everybody except the Chancellor of the Exchequer . . . . The great difficulty of the expedition will probably be water . Dr. Beke says there is none , and even if that is an exaggeration , mountain water in the tropics is always bad . If the Government will send out a few thousand gallons of some cheap yin ordinaire , and prohibit any drinking of " pure " water , they will save hundreds of lives . The Sikhs will drink anything which even seems to be liquor , though they like over-proof whisky with chillies in it best , and the Mussulmans will call it vinegar and be quite contented . Until his fall , however , the activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . But already some dissent was beginning to make itself heard from the conventional view that every occurrence abroad proved the superiority of English institutions . Reynolds 's Illustrated News was a periodical which had been founded in the last days of Chartism , and by this time had secured a following among the intelligent working class which was equalled by no other organ at all , except , perhaps , Bradlaugh 's National Reformer ( which hardly ever mentioned foreign affairs ) . Its comments , after so much unctuousness , are  | refreshingly direct and honest . In April 1870 a disreputable relative of Napoleon III , Prince Pierre-Napoleon , was tried for killing a journalist named Victor Noir , ostensibly in a duel , but actually in circumstances that were very close to murder . He was , of course , acquitted , and the acquittal was made the occasion for fresh rhapsodies on the beauties of English justice . Reynolds 's compared this trial with a recent trial in which the Prince of Wales ( Edward VII ) appeared ? a trial which created an immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? in these words ( April 3 , 1870 ) : Prince Pierre Napoleon has been acquitted of the charge of manslaughter brought against him before the High Court at Tours . The verdict seems to have taken everybody by surprise . The circumstances of the case , the character of the man , all led to the conclusion that he shot Victor Noir before that brave but unfortunate youth had struck a blow . The English press seems astonished at the verdict . We are not in the least surprised . All the time princes and peers are tried by exceptional tribunals , comprised of notorious sympathisers with , as well as actual members of their own order , such outrages on justice as the farce of Tours will of course occur . In England , it would be the same as in France . When a peer is tried by peers , he is pretty certain of acquittal , never mind how conclusive the evidence against him ? as in Lord Cardigan 's case . Our contemporaries affect to think that such a farce as that just played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We join issue with them at this point . The Times says : ? " The unexpected moderation of all the judiciary officials connected with the trial at Tours , and their evident leaning towards the accused , are a public scandal , not in themselves , but when compared with their usual bearing towards private citizens . " The Daily News observes : ? " The verdict of the grand jury is , however , in a certain sense not strictly in accordance with the evidence . Indeed , to us accustomed to our English mode  | of procedure , the proceedings in the High Court of Justice must seem in many ways little better than ridiculous . " Now with the recollection of a certain cause celebre fresh in our minds , and with the remembrance that the mode in which it was conducted met with the hearty and cordial approval of the journals from whence these extracts are made , we can not refrain from thinking of the Scriptural story concerning the beam and the mote . Did the judicial authorities in the Mordaunt divorce case treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary " private citizen ? " The Daily News , and most other papers declared that the circumstance of the Prince of Wales appearing in the witness-box , and swearing that he never had had criminal intercourse with Lady Mordaunt , settled that question , and entirely exonerated the Prince . Prince Pierre swears positively that Victor Noir struck him , and that he only fired in self-defence . Why should not one Prince be believed as well as another ? Accustomed as we are to " our English mode of procedure " in cases which concern high personages , the proceedings at Tours seem a precise reflex of what has occurred , and would doubtless occur again , at ' Westminster .  | WAR AND CLASS WAR ( 1870-71 ) When the war of 1870 broke out between France and Prussia English public opinion had little suspicion of the truth . It was universally believed that the French Emperor had deliberately forced war upon an innocent and harmless neighbour . It was generally believed that the French forces were superior and would probably be the victors in a war which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lower middle class or working class was mildly friendly towards Prussia , sympathizing with nationalist aspirations and having old acquaintance with the tyranny and aimless bellicosity of Napoleon III . Many years of Victorian Liberalism , had now passed , and its tenets had gradually become accepted almost as a religion by the thinking section of the people . Their views were expressed , if we leave aside the more decorous papers for those which were truly popular , in such papers as Reynolds 's , frankly Radical , or the Morning Advertiser , which from Radical had become Whiggish , and was soon to become Tory , and then nothing whatever . Reynolds 's was read by the earnest , republican , passionately moral free thinker ; the Advertiser was kept in every public-house for his more bibulous and less serious-minded friend . The difference between their views is instructive : it is the difference between the opinion of the workers when drunk and when sober . Reynolds 's wrote on July 17 , 1870 : THE DECLARATION OF WAR War has at last been declared between France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , sharp , but bloody , conflict .  | The first feature of the campaign will be the march of a French army towards the Rhenish provinces of Prussia , where it will be confronted with a Prussian force of , doubtless , great numerical strength . Louis Napoleon has staked his future upon the hazard of the die , and the fortune of war will determine whether he stands or falls . The French nation , as usual , are enthusiastic in the cause of " glory , " and the cry is " To Berlin . " Whether the French army will ever get there , or a Prussian army enter Paris , a short time may decide . The Prussian is a splendid army , and its officers the most scientific in the world . Spain and Italy will probably be threatened by the French forces , and , maybe , Belgium occupied by them . England must remain neuter ; we have no national interest at stake , and dynastic considerations must give way to public good . The first conflict between the Prussians and French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has yet witnessed , and its results will of course exercise great influence on those of the war . On the head of Louis Napoleon rests the tremendous crime of embroiling Europe in bloodshed . The war is purely one of a personal kind , in order to conciliate the tiger-like bloodthirstiness of the French soldiers who at the last plebiscitum made signs of disaffection . The war will probably throw Europe back twenty years ; but what cares the diseased , decrepit despot how much blood is shed , so long as he may prolong his lease of power , or do something that he believes calculated to ensure his son 's succession ? We hope and trust , and we think it very probable , that the legions of France will be beaten back by those of Prussia , and that disaster and defeat may lead to the dethronement of a man who seems to have all the worst passions of hell concentrated in his breast . The Morning Advertiser , at this time keeping step with its contemporary , regarded the fall of the Emperor after Sedan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed to consider this as in some way its own work , and as- sumed a magnanimity that after closing-time seems inexplicable ( September 5 , 1870 ) : The end has come . It has come at least so far as the Empire is concerned , after a life of nineteen years it is dead . It only remains to be buried ; and the funeral ceremony will soon be performed . No one will regret the close of its career ? none , we mean , save those who have been benefited by it . Their name , it is true , is legion ; but no one will share in their selfish sympathies for its decease . They will be the sole mourners . Our readers know with what untiring zeal and undeviating consistency , amid many reproaches and misrepresentations , the Morning Advertiser has laboured , ever since the perpetration of the coup d'etat , for a consummation which we so devoutly wished to witness , and which now is a great historical fact . We have today received our reward . But now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the remotest chance of its resurrection at any future period in the world 's history , we shall not indulge in any undue exultation , nor shall we load the Imperial prisoner with any reproaches in the introspect of his enormous mistakes . He needs no heavier punishment for his misdeeds , great and manifold as they have been , than he must find in the position in which he is now placed . In his altered circumstances he claims our commiseration ; and no generous mind will withhold it from him . Henceforth , now that he is a fallen man , we shall no longer speak of him in the same terms as we never ceased to do while his Imperial rule was that of an iron despotism so far as regarded his own subjects , and a scourge to some nations , such as Austria and Mexico , and a terror to all the countries of Europe . The definite announcement of the Republic produced far clearer words from Reynolds 's , and aspirations which are perhaps pathetic , but are at least plain and genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our contemporaries being little else than the mouthpiece of the moneyed and aristocratic orders , will , in  | all likelihood , shortly begin to decry the young Republic , and endeavour to bring the brave , pure , noble-hearted men connected with it into ridicule and contempt , as they essayed to do in 1848 . We admit that Imperialism and Republicanism being so widely different , it is difficult to comprehend how journals accustomed to bespatter one with their greasy , fulsome praise , can have a word to say in favour of the other . It is to be hoped , however , that the Times and its jackals will not bring down upon this country the ire of the French nation by abusing its Republican institutions , in the same way as they excited the wrath of America , some years back , by reviling the government of that country . The people of England must keep a steady and stern eye upon the proceedings of their aristocratic Government and Court . Of course , both nobility and royalty hate and fear the very name of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , however , Republicanism can maintain itself for a few years in France , all Europe will certainly become Republican . Then the oldest thrones of the earth will totter and fall to the ground ; crowns will be thrown into the place best adapted to receive them ? the gutter ; peace and plenty will prevail ; people will obtain their rights : and even nations that now seem wedded and welded to the monarchial system , may be spared the shame and scandal of being ruled by drunken debauchees . Indeed , this event brought Bradlaugh 's very powerful National Reformer to make , on the same date , one of its extremely rare pronouncements on foreign affairs : The third French Republic has been achieved without the loss of a single life in Paris ; every one admits that the salvation of the country can alone be secured by its establishment ; the people of all nations stretch out the hand of fellowship to the thrice-risen child of Freedom . Monarchical institutions are tottering everywhere ; the Popedom , in spite of its " infallibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so long supported  | by French bayonets , is , by that very France , about to be restored to the Italian people , and a French Republic , in whose name the darkest despotism was upheld , will be its liberator . Then let every patriot unite to secure its triumph , that it may stand as a beacon to light the Nations to liberty . AUSTIN HOLYOAKE Such declarations of principles were not to the taste of the Morning Advertiser . It turned its attention to subsidiary aspects of the war , on which it could offer opinions sure to be echoed in every public bar . One heaven-sent occasion came on September 22 , 1870 . The French troops had had to leave Rome , and certain Catholics had demanded , rather absurdly , that British should take their place to keep the city for the Pope : Rome is now , we suppose , a part of the kingdom of Italy . The troops of VICTOR EMMANUEL have entered it , and the POPE is no longer its Sovereign . This may seem a light matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTONELLI and the Jesuits are now deposed . In a few weeks the law of Italy will be the law of Rome . If distributors of the Bible , if preachers of the Gospel , wish to carry on their work , Rome will be no longer a forbidden land to them . The Pope-King is deposed . He may go where he will ; but in Rome he is a mere bishop , and no more . This news is the great fact of this month , September . Its vital import is shown by the fears of the partisans of Rome . Among many other wonderful things , in this wonderful age , that which strikes us with the greatest astonishment , is , the call , loudly made by many devoted Romanists , that England should interfere to help the Italians out of Rome , and to maintain what is called " the independence of the Sovereign Pontiff . " That " independence " has often been used , when Rome was strong , to harass and annoy England and England 's Sovereigns . Our great Queen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were commissioned , by the Vatican , to post up in our public places , Papal decrees , removing  | On the same day it summarized the position of the French Government for its readers : very rarely can a journal intending to be friendly have given , by irrelevancies and endeavours to jest , so completely insulting an impression . The subject , it may be said , is a proposed mediation by Britain : It may be taken quite as highly and indignantly by struggling France that she should be asked to bring her blighted and depressed fortunes to the arbitration of a general Conference , as the foolish cry about her yielding after Sedan was slighted by her aroused and angry resentments . After building a golden bridge across the Atlantic , over which an iron army marched to her assistance , after making the Paris boulevards a howling wilderness , in which hardly anyone can get a tolerable dinner : and still more seriously , after calling a whole population to arms to drive out the ruthless invader , we can hardly expect at our unauthorised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , France will eat humble pie at a Conference at St. James 's . If that were the nature of our nearest neighbour , it would have saved us many anxious days ? many fevered nights . Why should the vapourings of French colonels of old , or the intrigues of Imperial courtiers , have roused our blood or enlisted our volunteers ? France has almost admittedly no government at present , and M. FONVIELLE , after one airy passage , almost took as high a flight when he seemed to reproach us with not acknowledging an Administration which hardly acknowledges itself . At present M. FAVRE and his honoured friends remind us in their humble , hard work of a former Prince of Wales , who economically mended the roads at his country seat at Richmond , or of Mr. BRUNEL pulling at a rope when he found he could not get the Great Eastern afloat . But we have no doubt they have done the best they could , and there are jealousies of a mob-elected Ministry in France as there is distrust of them beyond its limits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government more than the pretentious dwarf his great master 's coat of armour , and perhaps France has long suffered  | from a failing of the kind in her most recent Administrations . But we regret that any failure to acknowledge the budding Republic has occurred anywhere . We may regret that the sturdy infant has not known how to claim every possible faculty , and has not aspired to send for the time fully qualified ambassadors to every country which would admit them . The war proceeded to its inevitable end of a German victory . It was succeeded by an event , the Paris Commune , which raised a series of new and very unpleasant questions in the minds of Victorian commentators . But before we proceed to describe these there is one leader which imperatively calls for quotation . It is , of all the writing which has come under our eyes , the most typical of the Victorian Radical , who was , it should be remembered , a very powerful person . Because it appears in Reynolds 's it is phrased with a plainness , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speech and barred from print . The preoccupation is one that dominates Victorian opinion during nearly the whole reign . It may seem improbable that the expenditure on Victoria 's rapidly increasing German relatives should have appeared to reasoning persons the chief " foreign problem " that deserved discussion , but outside Court and Society circles it was so . The working classes ( to use the phrase in Reynolds 's sense , as including employers and traders who actually worked ) were not Socialists , but they objected to what they considered waste and theft ; and the prevailing political philosophy encouraged them to consider that this objection was the foundation of all morality and political progress . Here , . then , is Reynolds 's leader of March 19 , 1871 : THE APPROACHING INAUSPICIOUS EVENT Our readers are aware that , whenever any frousy old German duchess , or trumpery German prince , related in the  | remotest degree to our German royal family , visits this country he or she , as the case may be , is brought here and taken back at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likewise paid for by us . There would be an awful sputter at Court if any delay happened to , or inconvenience was experienced by , these serene nonentities . Not so , however , when visitors who may be of some use to this country are subjected to insults and indignities which are a stigma on our national character . We allude to an incident brought under the notice of the House of Commons the other evening by Mr. Powell , relating to the scurvy treatment vouchsafed the envoys of Prince Kassa by the English Government . This Abyssinian prince rendered good service to the English army on its march to attack King Theodore . He assisted us in every way , and expressed an ardent desire to cultivate friendly relations with this country . In proof of his sincerity , he despatched two envoys to England with presents to the Queen . On arriving at Alexandria they fell short of funds , and on application being made to the English Government for assistance , a reply was forwarded to the effect that the presents might be sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay the expenses of those who brought them . The presents have come , and been valued at ? 1,500 ; and now it remains to be seen if the Queen will accept them . We all know that large fish , like the miser Neal 's legacy , are eagerly snapped up by royalty , but that small gifts are politely declined , with an intimation that it is not customary for the sovereign to accept presents from subjects . At all events , the shabby treatment these well-meaning Abyssinians have experienced contrasts most unfavorably with the alacrity displayed by our Government in conveying backwards and forwards , and entertaining , at the people 's cost , the petty , penniless Germans that so often inflict themselves upon us . What else can be expected at the hands of a Ministry whose head is nothing better than a cad to the Court ? The British public is the much cow of both English and German royalty . We are told we can not afford to spend a few hundred  | of pounds in treating with becoming hospitality the representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rendered us really good service , but we are rich enough to put thousands of pounds in the pockets of the " young couple " to be married next Tuesday people who have no claim whatever upon us ? never have and never can render us any return for the money so wasted . True , we are told by our contemporaries that the marriage of an English princess with a " distinguished " young nobleman is an event that ought to be hailed with satisfaction by all men . In the first place , we should like to know how is Lord Lorne distinguished ? General Moltke is distinguished as a military commander ; Bismark as a statesman ; Calcraft as a hangman ; Park and Boulton after their own peculiar fashion ; but the Lord only knows what distinguishes the Marquis of Lorne from the most ordinary common-place person . All we know of him is gathered from frequent paragraphs in the papers like the following , which we extract : ? " The Marquis of Lorne honoured the London Stereoscopic Company with sittings on Thursday last at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained . " For the life of us , then , we can not comprehend why a whole nation is expected to rejoice at the marriage of a man who seems to do nothing else than sit for his photograph , with a princess few have seen , and few can care for . The chapel where the marriage is to take place is being fitted up at an enormous expense to the country , for the purpose of accommodating as witnesses to the ceremony that host of worthless carrion called the " privileged few " ? those , in short , who pauperise the nation . Thus , the working classes will not only supply out of their hard-earned wages the dowry , etc. , of the princess , but they will have to pay for providing accommodation for the persons present at the ceremony . Indeed , they will have to pay for everything . Claremont , which was laid hold of by the Queen when King Leopold died , is to be fitted up in a costly manner as the residence of the newly-married couple , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have  | to pay , either directly or indirectly , for the breeches Lord Lorne is married in , provided he wears such a garment . Let the working classes show their contempt for the concern , and their indignation at being mulcted of their money by persons whose parents ought to supply them with the means of subsistence , by steadily and resolutely refusing to participate in the " rejoicings " that many fat-sided mayors and aldermen are endeavouring to organise for the occasion , in order to get up something like a display of loyalty , even if it comes forth only from the belly . Let the toilers show their aversion to being plundered by idlers in so unmistakable a manner that Royalty will be ashamed of again sending round the begging box on behalf of its order . Let Tuesday next be black-lettered in every working man 's calendar , as a day wherein bread was taken out of the mouths of himself , his wife , and his children , by those whose parents can calculate their incomes and their acres by tens of thousands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the first news of the scuffle in the Paris streets which led to the short-lived Paris Commune . Ostensibly the Commune was no more than an attempt by Paris to secure for itself somewhat more extended municipal rights than before . Reduced to those terms , which are legalistically correct , the conflict has no sense and is inexplicable . Why should the Thiers Government attack the new municipal authority ( quite honestly elected a week after the Montmartre conflict , and as legally as almost any body in that distracted country ) for its claim ? Why should it bombard it and slaughter the prisoners with a fierce energy never shown against the Germans ? Why should it celebrate its victory by a massacre so horrible that the civilized world of all classes and politics was genuinely shocked ? The answer is , of course , because for the first time since , maybe , Spartacus this was a revolt of slaves : it was a class war ,  | and class wars are bitterer than any others . It was presumed on both sides that the new Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic exploitation of man by man . How exactly it would do this it was by no means clear itself , but the reigning French bourgeoisie had no intention of letting it try . The majority of the Commune was Blanquist , and the minority was International . Now , Blanqui ( whom the Government had safely in prison ) was the advocate of the theory which was revised by Lenin into " proletarian dictatorship " ; the directing brain of the International was Karl Marx . The other members of the Commune could have been at best classed as " Jacobin " ; and the memory of 1793 was not pleasant to the National Assembly , which actually contained a majority of monarchists in principle . In these circumstances the French governing class had no reason to inquire further : it knew what it disliked and proposed to destroy it . But a class division such as this almost always means partisanship in other countries . It can not be ignored or treated with the genial and contemptuous comment that " foreigners do this sort of thing " on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised are domestic questions , merely expressed in foreign terms . In such conditions class division begins to override even genuine devotion to Liberal principles . But in 1871 a plain appreciation of the facts came quicker in those journals not troubled with Liberal principles . The Morning Post has never ( so far as the writers of this are aware ) varied from a belief that civilization requires the lower classes to be kept in their place by the upper . Instinctively and rationally it has always believed in the class war ; but it happens to be on the side of the rich . Such certainty brings clarity . Just as Lenin was able to discover and denounce incompetence , bureaucracy , and official arrogance in the party ranks , so the Morning Post did not hesitate to de- nounce its own class in France for cowardice in face of the foe when it found that the Government had fled from Paris as a result of the insurrection of a few battalions of the National Guard ( March 22 , 1871 ) : What are euphemistically termed the well-disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather ashamed of themselves ? and well they may . They have brought themselves into contempt in the eyes of the whole civilised world . They have loaded themselves with ridicule , and ridicule is the weapon which of all others they most fear . There are about two hundred and fifty thousand enrolled national guards in the city and of these not more than twenty-five thousand , if so many , declared themselves against the Government . Yet such was the inconceivable cowardice of the remaining two hundred and twenty-five thousand that sooner than strike a blow in maintenance of their own liberties , and for the preservation of their own property , which if the Commune is established is in no little danger , they slunk away to their homes , took off their uniforms , laid down their muskets , and indulged in maudlin nonsense about not steeping their hands in the blood of their fellow citizens . It is scarcely too harsh to say that such men are unworthy to possess civil or political rights , and it would only serve them right if they found themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless greatly maligned , are not overburdened with earthly possessions . Elaborating the same thesis two days later , it did not fail to do its best , in the common cause , to excite hatred against the insubordinate leaders of the lower classes ( March 24 , 1871 ) : We have been too slow here in recognising the gravity and full meaning of the situation In France . The strength of the insurrection lies not so much in its component elements as in the weakness and incapacity of the Power which should restrain them . The Commune proclaims its force in this very fact , that " it gives to the city a national militia ( read roughs ) which  | defends citizens against power instead of a standing army which defends power against citizens . " These rogues , who wish to do away with the army and the police , are composed of the scum of the great city . They are , first of all , the cowards of Belleville who ran away from the Prussians , who were disbanded by CLEMENT THOMAS for poltroonery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris , with its vast organisation of depravity , no less than twenty-five thousand wretches who live on the prostitution of women . These ignoble scoundrels with the pick-pockets and other scum of a great city , are the men who fired on the unarmed demonstration of the Rue de la Paix . They never should have had weapons in their hands . But when peace was made M. THIERS had a weakness to prefer disarming the army to disarming these men , because the army , from the instinct of discipline , would give up its arms , whereas he feared to attempt persuasion with cowards and cut-throats . The reasons why Paris was the seat of what the Socialist and Labour movements afterwards recognized as the first workers ' Government lay in French history . The population of Paris since 1789 had been accustomed to taking the lead on behalf of the French nation . The city had been the centre of government far more than London has ever been the centre of British government . Hence the city itself became an object of hatred . Another paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West End News , wrote on March 25 , 1871 : " PARIS SHALL BE ERASED FROM THE LIST OF CITIES " Such were the ominous words of the Deputy Isnard in the convention of 1793 . " If Paris wished to usurp authority over France , then Paris should no longer be the capital , and seat of the legislature . " These just , but ill-timed observations cost the lives of the patriotic , amiable and philosophic Girondists . " Oh ,  | Liberty ! " exclaimed Madame Roland , " what crimes are committed in thy name ! " All the evils with which France has been afflicted for the last eighty years have sprung from that accursed system of centralization which has made France a web , and Paris the spider in the centre . May we , as Englishmen , never be reduced to the disgrace of being governed by London .... Paris drags France into a war . This war terminates disastrously and disgracefully ? because Paris is France ? and Paris would not fight ! Paris turns out Napoleon : establishes a gouvernment a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in a balloon from Paris to rule France ! Cowardice , incapacity , and treachery do their worst . France is overrun by her enemies , and Paris falls , yes , falls without a struggle ! And now that an old man , ? one of the worst enemies of England ? the vascillating cause of the downfall of Louis-Phillippe ? the underminer of the throne of Napoleon ? this man , to save Paris from destruction , enters into a treaty of peace , the provisions of which are impossible of fulfilment , and Paris agrees to them , to the detriment of the French nation . No sooner are these hard terms agreed upon than Paris repudiates them , rises in open rebellion against all authority , and renders it impossible for France to obtain credit in the money market , so as to buy off the invaders from her soil . Why ? Because Paris is France , and France will have no stable government , no repose from her sufferings until " Paris is erased from the list of cities . " As these organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynolds 's felt a natural affection for it . On March 26 , the day on which the Commune was formally elected , it wrote as follows : The Parisians demand the Commune ? that is to say , the election of the Mayors of Paris by universal suffrage , who will form the governing body , with one elected as their president for the time being . With such a government , Orleanist and Bonapartist intrigues could not succeed , And it is for this  | reason it is so hateful to the upper orders in France . However , the people have shown their power : they have obtained the upper hand ; the army even is with them . The men who seized the reins of government are honest men and true patriots . Those who dismissed Gambetta and all his democratic followers were rendered impotent for more mischief on Saturday week , when the soldiers fraternised with the people . The reds have been masters of Paris , and yet the city has not been delivered to pillage and carnage ! No ; the world will learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who with crowns upon their heads plunder and murder in God 's name , and in that of " order . " But advocates of the Commune , or even those who could judge it temperately , were rare in the English Press . The natural current of dislike ? natural because , then as now , most newspaper proprietors were well-to-do persons ? flowed into channels which were generally empty of political liquids . The Weekly Budget , for example , was a highly popular " news summary , " which brought to a great number of housewives a selection of the more interesting criminal cases , an instalment of a romantic novel , advice on household problems , and similar matters . On April I it found it necessary to explain the French crisis in the many small houses which it visited weekly : The necessities of the defence of Paris had placed arms in the hands of the most dangerous class of that city ? infamous above all other cities for the number and strength of that class ? and directly the enemy disappeared the real character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they knew not what . They demanded a Republic ; but to all intents and purposes this had already been established . What was the government recently elected by the voice of the people but a Republic ? But this was not what they wanted . It must be a Republic of the " red " stamp ? an assemblage of demagogues , of the enemies of order ; of bloodthirsty and unscrupu- bus wretches who regarded society in the light in which Pistol regarded it when he said , " The world 's mine oyster , which I with sword will open . " They wanted , not government , but rapine ? not principles , but plunder . It is only with a feeling of contempt that we can regard the enactment of this miserable farce of a Revolution , breaking out at the close of the great calamity which has overwhelmed France , and standing in the way of its return to peace and tranquillity . That there should be men found even in Paris capable of prolonging her troubles and adding to her sorrows in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said of a population which tamely yields itself up even for a week , to a set of miscreants whose chief engines of rule are terror , murder and plunder ? Reynolds 's was almost alone in opposing to these explanations accounts from another point of view . But if alone , it was far from discouraged : its leaders are vigorous and well-informed , and anticipated much of the exposition that Marx wrote later under the title of the Civil War in France , and even drew a moral for home affairs . This , for example , appeared in its issue of April 2 , 1871 : Perhaps it may be as well to say a few words in explanation of this so much abused commune , and those who advocate its adoption . The commune signifies a community governed by itself , and by its own laws . Paris has elected to become a selfgoverned city , and invites other large places to follow its example . Those who were elected as communal councillors on Sunday , will , in fact , govern the city during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refuse to have any soldiers of the regular army within their walls , they can levy taxes , and probably will put a heavy impost on the rich , and revise the disposition of property . One of the fundamental principles of the commune is that no citizen shall live in idle superfluity whilst others want the necessaries of life . This is a god-like , a thorough Christian doctrine . We can , therefore , readily com- prehend why and wherefore the commune or its advocates are denounced , vilified , and reviled by the flunkeyish press of this country . Under a commune there certainly will not be found any dowried or salaried specimens of royalty , any sinecure colonelcies , or hosts of homeless persons , willing to work , but unable to obtain it . The sympathies of the English working class should be , and doubtless are already , strongly enlisted on the side of their brethren in France , now struggling to emancipate themselves from the odious and tyrannous fangs of royalty , aristocracy and capital . This , again , issued on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit any Marxist : Of course , " society " is outraged ; it is impertinence to dare to disarrange all the agreeable fetes and the whirl of Parisian gaieties upon which society had set its heart . It is dreadfully inconvenient for vulgar thinkers to set up principles when " society " wishes to dance and flirt , to give parties , and to get up a festive season . The gay world was thinking how soon a king might be installed in the Tuileries , but these rude people have made monarchical government impossible . Two hundred thousand National Guards will never submit to have a king forced upon them ; and the temper of Paris will make it necessary to give a very stern air of reality to the Republic . " Society " does not wish this ; even so long as a Republic lasts , it should be the creature of the upper classes ; and M. Thiers is just the man to make the machinery of a Republic do the work of a monarchy for " society . " In fact , this contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who work , and the men and women released by the artificial regulations of life from labour . The easy classes wish to restore the Paris of old , of the Empire , and they would dance whilst the people starved . It is quite idle to talk to the working classes of the ruin brought upon Paris by the present state of things . When Paris is gay and prosperous in the old way , there is no place for the poor to live within the barriers ; for the Empire raised rents to  | fabulous rates , and made Paris , as a home for the industrious , a dream . It is nearly so in London , where railway companies , and corporations , and boards , " improve " the people off the face of the metropolis . But , whilst " society " looks on deprecatingly , the polite world is staggered by the facts and principles of the Revolution . M. Thiers is at his wits ' end ; and all he can do is to compose telegrams assuring the world that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very soon . The most intelligent and relentless opponent , the Morning Post , on April 26 , 1871 , explained in language of equally admirable clarity from , its point of view the exact dangers which its readers ought to apprehend from the Commune and the effects which it was having over here : Troubles in France have generally led to agitation elsewhere ; and at this time , when the means of inter-communication are so great , and when trade and political societies of a revolutionary character have so increased in numbers and so perfected their organisation , the influence of what is done in one place is likely to be more immediately and more forcibly felt in others . Such is , indeed , the case at the present time . The outward aspect of things in England is unchanged , and those who avoid the disagreeable sights and shut their ears to the disagreeable sounds beyond their own immediate sphere of observation are unconscious of anything that calls even for attention , much less for apprehension . Nevertheless , it is a fact that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous spirit , which is being silently but surely fomented by agitators and enthusiasts , and which , if not prudently dealt with , may break out in a lamentable manner . The discontent is of a kind new in England . It is not political , but of a social and material character . It is that the poor have begun to call in question the whole scheme of society as it exists , to cast covetous eyes upon the property of the rich , to adopt the belief that a portion of it ought to belong to them , and to talk of the means whereby they may get that portion . It is not necessary  | for us to show the fatal nature of such ideas ; nor are we concerned at present with their merits ; all we say is that they have spread and are spreading among the lower strata of society in a way and to the extent which few suspect . Those who entertain them are , for purposes of communication with the other classes of the community , practically dumb , nor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak or to print their meaning . Yet it comes out occasionally , in an incidental manner , with a vigour that is quite startling . Those who have attended the various " demonstrations , " almost all ostensibly of a political character , made during the last few years , must have been struck by the fact that all the speakers invariably leave politics at once in order to treat the ever-recurring question of rich and poor . These men are watching eagerly what is being done in France , and , while others are rapidly becoming wearied with the Commune and its acts , they feel daily a keener interest in them as representing an effort , which has at any rate had a certain success so far , to carry out their visions ? visions , be it remembered , not of disorderly individual robbery , but of a general recasting of the social system , in order to get a new distribution of property upon a systematic plan . What the particular plan is to be few of them could say . Even Communism proper has few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or St. Simonianism would fail entirely to enlist their sympathies . They have not arrived , in fact , at the stage of having a plan . But they are thoroughly persuaded that they suffer a wrong in being poor and miserable , and that the wrong arises from an unjust appropriation by those richer than themselves of an excessive share of the earth 's fruits . One symbolic action taken by the Commune was to pull down the Vendome Column . This ugly erection commemorated the victories of Napoleon I over foreign armies , and its pulling down was intended to symbolize the abandonment of imperialist policies by France for ever . The decree was passed on April 12 , but not  | executed till May 16 . In the meantime there was ample comment in the English Press . The Times took the opportunity to explain the character of internationalism . Though it is confessedly puzzled by recent politics within the International , its outline is undeniably very true ( May 5 , 1871 ) Paris , as we have been always told , is France ; the Commune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a decree of the Commune now proscribes the destruction by French hands and amid French acclamations of those very trophies which but a few months ago it was considered impious for the Prussians even to threaten in the inevitable course of war . More astounding than all is the reason given for this effacement of monumental history in one of the most historic cities . The Vendome Column , like the Arch of Triumph , commemorates the victories of France , and with them , of course , the defeats of other nations ? especially of that very nation still encamped within cannon shot of the capital . This commemoration is now regarded by the government of Paris as offensive to people who , in the spirit of cosmopolitan philanthropy , should be looked upon as brothers ; and so the fiat has gone forth , in deference to the supposed susceptibilities of those who in times past proved inferior to Frenchmen in the field , and who may not wish the presumed humiliation to be eternally and conspicuously recorded . Such an explanation might well appear incredible , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole case will be clear . In a few words , this act of Vandalism expresses simply the spirit of the International Association ? an organised body of working men affiliated to similar bodies in other European capitals , and formed for the purpose of establishing a " solidarity , " or community of interests among the working classes all over the world . In its origin it was nothing more nor less than a comprehensive Trade Union , designed to prevent labour in one country from being undersold by the competition of labour in another ; but many of its members entered deeply into projects of political and social reform , and it has been a  | current belief that this society succeeded by virtue of its organization and activity in determining , as far as Paris was concerned , the elections to the National Assembly , and in seizing afterwards , under the title of the Commune , supreme power in the capital . There is much that is obscure in this matter , for , as far as we can see , the prominent members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have since been proscribed or imprisoned by the rulers of the capital . The founder of the society was an artisan named TOLAIN , who has lately been expelled in disgrace , and one of its chief agents was Ass ' , who was incarcerated the other day by order of the Commune . Moreover , the Committee of Public Safety , just now representing the final phase of Parisian opinion , and therefore the authority by which this act will be done , does not include a single name connected by current reports with the International Association . Nevertheless , it is clear from these proceedings that the spirit animating the Commune , or Committee , or actual government of Paris , whatever it may be called , is the veritable spirit of the International ? a spirit which professes to ignore patriotism in favour of universal fraternity , and which makes light of historical monuments in comparison with social creeds . Reynolds 's did not come to the defence of the decree until the Column was actually down , on May 21 , 1871 : JUSTIFIABLE VANDALISM The celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French monument has been razed to the ground . It will , therefore , no longer attract the eye or win the approval of either the Frenchman or the foreigner . Many will prove but too eager to condemn this act of destruction , branding it as wilful and wicked . Few will reflect sufficiently to pronounce in its favour , and honour a deed both politic and heroic . . . . The Vendome Column had a tendency to pervert the existing national sentiment . What the working classes of France  | desire is peace ; but so long as Bonapartism was constantly flaunted in the eyes of the people , war would always be imminent . Napoleonism means war , despotism , and extravagance . Its originator has now descended from his lofty pinnacle , and his bronze nose fell into a heap o ' ? dung ! Possibly , a section of Englishmen may entertain much the same regard for the York Column in Carlton House-gardens as the enemies of the Commune had for the Vendome monument . But suppose that it was decided to overthrow that unsightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscription , to the second son of George III , would all Europe condemn the deed , pronounce it wanton vandalism , and pour forth lamentation on that account ? The idea is absurd . Nay , there would be rather cause for joy than grief , if not only the York Column , but several of the ugly statues erected to miserable monarchs were swept away with one fell stroke . For , in the first place , we should thus not only get rid of needless obstructions , but remove from sight memorials which certainly are productive of no refining , elevating , or moral effect . The Weekly Budget , however , would have none of these arguments . Its readers , in the parlour on Sunday afternoons , were given plain statements , in which no nonsensical discussions were allowed . On May 13 it informed its patrons as follows : But of course these Communistic doctrines will not hold water . Paris is in the hands not of philosophers , but of roughs , with the garbage of the more advanced schools on their lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have voted God out of the universe , and , of course , have hunted the priests like vermin , while they have altered the churches into discussion halls . They have crushed out opinion , the Press which groaned under the Empire now suffering from a tyranny ten times more implacable . " Society " is at an end ; that fell when aristocracy was denounced , and , unfortunately , with it fell the trade of Paris , which is simply strangled .  | The unhappiest position in such conflicts as these is always occupied by the conscientious Liberal . The Daily News was torn both ways . It found itself unable to take sides , and could only print hopes that things might not grow worse and speculations on the strength of the two sides which showed how admittedly uncertain it was of the facts . For example , on May 18 , 1871 , it said : Paris , indeed , considering that it has for two months been at the mercy of a band of insurgents who include in their number the lawless mobs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just run the gauntlet of two sieges , and the destruction it has suffered has been almost wholly confined to the south-western districts , where the Versailles artillery have been shelling for the past fortnight . Among all the men who have come and gone as the directors of this wild escapade in favour of Socialism and Democracy there has not been one to advocate pillage . Private property has been respected in a singular and admirable fashion by the professed disciples of PROUDHON and SAINT-SIMON . But whether this condition of affairs will obtain during the last stages of the conflict between the Government and the Commune it is impossible to say . The mob may get the upper hand of those leaders who through all these troublous times have somehow managed to get their own authority and that of the law of France respected . The more exasperated and reckless of that small band may , in their extremity , resort to measures which the more reasonable and prudent would disown ... . It may be that the citizens do not much like M. THIERS or the Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony of observers ? that they like the Commune less . Yet they do not stir , although the Government soldiers are at their gates and M. TRIERS has implored them to lend him their assistance . The peaceful inhabitants of Paris ? outside the ranks of the National Guard ? are biding their time in a somewhat apprehensive mood , speculating on what signs and wonders will accompany the downfall of that great city .  | On May 27 , when news came that in its last desperate defence the Commune had fired large buildings and destroyed much property , the Daily News definitely made up its mind . The Communards were " ruffians " : With all these deductions , nevertheless , the amount of damage which has been effected by the ruffianism of the Commune is enormous . Indeed , it can not as yet be estimated , in however rough a way ; for it is not yet at an end . When we first heard of the conflagrations that had broken out , the spectators at Versailles could only guess that here and there this or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building devoted to the flames ; and the popular and direct conclusion was that Paris would ere long be a city of ashes . Fortunately , the fear , which obtained up till so late an hour as Thursday evening , need no longer disquiet us . It appeared to some observers that the flames began to subside yesterday morning . Even then , however , the lurid glare that rose up in the pale dawn told what a disastrous and deadly work was going on within that great city ; and not for many a day to come will France know all that she has suffered at the hands of her own children . . . . They have been driven back into the quarters from which they issued scarcely ten weeks ago ; and what a disastrous period have these ten weeks formed for France ! The effort to put in operation some impracticable theories of social right or political decentralisation degenerated into a wild endeavour to separate Paris from the rest of the country , culminating in a monstrous determination to destroy that which the defeated rebels could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for this more than barbaric act of futile revenge ? What section of all the Central Committees , Committees of Public Safety , and Military Commissions which the Commune invented , is responsible for a crime which needed elaborate preparation for its execution ? Have these various governing bodies been resolved into their primary elements of conspirators , malcontents , and dreamers , who may now be chiefly anxious to get out of France and disappear into the crowd of  | some one or other of the European capitals ? The arrest of FELIX PYAT , DELESCLUZE , and CLUSERET , is not confirmed , and was , to begin with , improbable . It is possible that they did really escape in one or more of the balloons which were certainly seen to leave Paris a few days ago ; but , unless their balloon-voyage was a remarkably straight one and a remarkably long one , it would not carry them out of danger . Many others of the leaders are said to have been shot ? among them JULES VALLES , RIGAULT , AMOUROUX , DOMBROWSKI , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amid the indignation and wrath which this firing of Paris has naturally caused , they would have run but little chance of being treated as merely political prisoners . Much that might have been said for them , both by their own countrymen and by impartial spectators elsewhere , dies away from the lips in view of the desperate and unavailing crime which must be laid to their charge . Reynolds 's was not shaken from its consistent support . In its issue of the next day ( May 28 , 1871 ) it wrote : Three weeks ago we forewarned our readers that Paris would be set on fire . We had seen a letter from M. Felix Pyat , the ruling spirit of the Commune , saying that the city was soaked and undermined with petroleum . M. Thiers must have known this also . But he obstinately refused to listen to any overtures , and would not hear of the slightest concession being made . The catastrophe we foreboded and confidently predicted has come to pass . The finest buildings in Paris are in ruins ; treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal , bloodthirsty soldiery of Versailles , who scarcely dared face the Prussians , after deluging the city in blood , find themselves masters of a heap of ashes ! The Commune has made Paris another Moscow for the victors . The paper which gave the opinion of the West End has already been given ; the most influential East End organ can be compared with it . The Eastern Post ( still existing ) had the largest circula- tion of any paper east of Aldgate Pump . It was read by numerous republicans and Radicals , and printed regularly the minutes of the Council of the First International . But by the end of the Commune , after some trimmings and hesitations , it definitely joined in the chorus of denunciation . It said on May 27 , 1871 : But these men were not democrats . They sought not the establishment of a Republic in which all people should have part according to their talents and their works , but the supremacy of a class , or rather of the dregs of a class . As in the feudal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King was the State , so these innovators wanted to bring about a state of things in which conspirators by profession should alone bear rule , and for the accomplishment of that end they appealed exclusively to the feelings of the working class , and sought to enlist its aid by playing upon that jealousy of all who are not working men which is its bane . The body of the working class is , however , too sound and too generous to be led away by egotistic promptings , and as a result the professional conspirators have been able only to associate in their projects the very worst , the most unreflecting , and violent and unprincipled , so that to control them or guide them was of course out of the question . To this is directly attributable the spectacle which has raised a cry of horror from humanity . A real Republicanism is the very opposite of this principle ? if principle it can be called ? of the domination of a class or portion of a class . A true Democracy is the negation of class domination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the transference of that domination from the aristocracy to the mob-ocracy . Until this be well understood the fewer revolutions that are attempted , and the more sparingly barricades are built the better for the People everywhere . They have nothing to gain , but all to lose by orgies such as that which has just submerged Paris in a sea of blood and fire . The Commune was now sinking : its setting was in blood and fire . It burned several great buildings in its last efforts at self  | defence , including the Hotel de Ville . The Versaillese , as the troops of M. Thiers were called , shot their prisoners systematically as soon as they had entered the city . This practice had begun earlier on in the siege . The Commune had stopped it sharply by a decree announcing that it would take reprisals on the hostages it controlled unless it ceased . Now certain Federals ( Communard troops ) , with an order from Ferre , member of the Commune , executed as a reprisal sixty-three of the hostages , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Thiers ' troops did not stop . They were extended until they became a massacre . Anyone who was suspected of sympathy with the Commune , or whose hands or clothes had powder-stains , or whom individual spite or caprice pointed out , was shot . The use of the individual rifle became too tedious : the victims were lined up against a wall in Pere Lachaise cemetery and mowed down by machine-guns . The figures of the dead exceeded 20,000 , and possibly even 30,000 . The slaughter was not the result of an unbridled soldiery breaking loose ; it was directed and encouraged by the generals in command . Their policy was definite and logical . Paris had been for a century the organizer and head of revolt ; Paris must therefore be so crushed that it would never be that again . The only way to crush it was to kill off all the people who were responsible for these seditious habits . But even class hatred does not , or at least does not always , overcome common humanity . The atrocity of this reasoned policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , as soon as the facts were reported to it by its correspondents , dealt with them emphatically and clearly ( May 29 , 1871 ) : It sounds like trifling for M. TRIERS to be denouncing the Insurgents for having shot a captive officer " without respect  | for the laws of war . " The laws of war ! They are mild and Christian compared with the inhuman laws of vengeance under which the Versailles troops have been shooting , bayoneting , ripping up prisoners , women , and children , during the last six days . We have not a word to say for the black ruffians who , it is clear , . deliberately planned the utter destruction of Paris , the burning of its inhabitants and the obliteration of its treasures ; but if soldiers will convert themselves into fiends in attacking fiends , is it any wonder if they redouble the fiendishness of the struggle ? Fury has inflamed fury , and hate has embittered hate , until all the wild passions of the human heart have been fused into one vast and indistinguishable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been nothing like it in history . The siege of Jerusalem may afford some parallel , but Roman soldiers never so utterly lost their self-control as the Versailles troops appear to have done . Our Correspondents are beggared for words to describe the scene , and exclaim that it is hell upon earth . It is nothing less . There are all the physical and all the moral accessories . Fire and brimstone , storm and tempest , torture , insult , hatred , despair , all forms of malice , murder , and destruction , have been raging in Paris during the last few days . Women forgetting their sex and their gentleness to commit assassination , to poison soldiers , to burn and to slay ; little children converted into demons of destruction , and dropping petroleum into the areas of houses ; soldiers in turn forgetting all distinctions of sex and age , and shooting down prisoners like vermin , now by scores and now by hundreds , ? all combine to enact on civilized grounds , and within sight and hearing of their fellow-men , scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prophets and poets . This is what human nature is capable of : for Frenchmen are men , and we shudder for our race . The reference to " petroleum , " it should be explained , is due to a universal belief , spread by no one knows what propagandist , that Communard women and children went about with petrol setting fire indiscriminately to houses . One Versailles newspaper  | even explained that enough combustible material to fire a house was carried in a sardine-tin ; another that the firemen filled their hoses with petrol to play on burning buildings . There is no evidence whatever for this ; the Communard defenders fired in a wholesale manner many buildings to aid their defence , but that was all . The sole effect of this delusion was to include women and children in the slaughter , and to cause a general massacre of firemen . By May 31 , 1871 , the Times felt the occasion had come for a general survey of the Commune and the principles on which it was founded . It detested them , but appraised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man should wish to die for them : The Paris commune never found much sympathy in this country . Their enormous crimes are the theme of universal execration , and no one would dare to plead extenuating circumstances in their favour . There is no doubt they are bent on doing all the evil in their power ? no doubt that the fiends who had evidently planned the destruction of the whole City only failed because they lacked strength for the accomplishment of their purpose . Their regret must be that their work was only half achieved ? that they had Paris at their discretion , and were , after all , as unable to effect the utter ruin of the City as to dispute its possession against their adversaries . For the leaders of the Commune we would ask no mercy . But what was the Commune ? Throughout the Civil War we were assured that Paris was tyrannized over by a mere handful of ruffians . Today we hear from the Versailles Government that from 25,000 to 30,000 prisoners have fallen into their hands , to say nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts , or of those who fell in various actions in defence of the outer suburbs , of the Forts , of the line of walls , and of the barricades . Between the slain , the captives and the fugitives it is clear that the Commune must from beginning to  | end have mustered at least 100,000 combatants ; while the evidence of our correspondents leaves no doubt that of all the remaining population , if there were any who were not with the Commune , there were none to the very last moment who stood up against it . Must the whole of this deluded and fanatic multitude be looked upon as " the Commune " ? Must they all be deemed equal in guilt as their leaders ? ? treated as accessories in all their atrocities ? Must we believe that Paris harboured in its bosom 100,000 incendiaries or cold-blooded murderers ? ? that all of them are responsible for the fire at the Tuileries and the cold-blooded murder of DARBOY ? . . . " The people of Paris believe not in any god , nor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , for which they are ready to die . That religion is the faith that capital and its holders must adapt themselves to nobler uses , or they had better cease to exist . " We take these words from an article published in the last number of the Fortnightly Review , and signed " FREDERIC HARRISON . " We reprint them because they tell the plain truth about that Revolution which has horrified the world by its catastrophes , and because they convey in a narrow compass the history of the movement from beginning to end . The reader to whom the signature is familiar will not need to be told that the description comes from no hostile hand . It is inspired , in fact , by admiration , and is intended for eulogy , but it is absolutely true . By the " people " of Paris we must understand an organised body of about 100,000 Parisian artisans , who on this occasion have been reinforced by outlaws from all parts of Europe , and supported with more or less willingness by certain other classes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from first to last were the Socialists of the International Association , and they plotted , and rose , and fought , not for any Republican forms or political rights of any sort , not for any species of civil or religious freedom known to the world , but simply and solely for the chance of adapting capital and its holders to those " nobler uses " which they had conceived in their distempered brains . . . .  | The catastrophe is astounding , if measured against the cause . Men do die , and have died in all ages , for religion , but never for a " religion " like this . No Goo , no man , no faith , no hope ? nothing but better wages and more pleasures . The principle of the Revolution now quenched in blood was not a bit grander than that of a tailors ' strike . The men of ' 93 had their visions of universal happiness and equal rights ; the men of ' 71 dreamt only of taking from all other classes what they have got , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to emancipate the working classes , but to enthrone them : indeed , we can hardly suppose from the facts of the case that the actual lot of these men was any harder than that of labouring mankind . Neither their doctrines , their aims , nor their acts were those of people oppressed , downtrodden , or ignorant . They had educated themselves after their own fashion ; they had elaborated theories of new worlds in which all should be their own , and when chance brought them the opportunity for which they had long been sighing they organised the government , the defence , and ultimately the destruction , of a great capital with a promptitude and success which told much for their abilities . In fact , it has been the boast of many of their partisans that they were no ruffians or brigands , but well-taught and intelligent men , with strong purposes and sincere convictions . Yet all their purposes and all their convictions are expressed in the text at the head of these remarks . Of one man only ? DELESCLUZE ? are we told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phrase which we take as signifying that the poor benighted creature still retained some impressions of religion . The rest believed in neither Goo nor man , and died for their unbelief . Not contented with the extermination that had already taken place , the French Government made requests in Brussels and London for the refugees who had escaped to Belgium and England to be returned to them to be shot . A member of the House  | of Lords was found to support this request . Reynolds 's commented as follows ( June 4 , 1871 ) : Of course we no more think of comparing the writings and sayings of such a man as Lord Elcho with those of Victor Hugo , than the braying of a jackass with the roar of a lion . Nevertheless , when the former ignoble animal is in a mischievous and vicious mood , its stealthy kick may inflict as much or more injury than the bold and open attack of the nobler beast . It is for this reason , then , that we condescend to notice the demand made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who may seek shelter in England . He would have us deliver these men over to the tender mercies of a soldiery that has bathed its bayonets in the blood of women and children ? and this at the demand of a pack of discredited statesmen , who wish to conceal their incompetency and renegadism behind a pile of corpses , composed of the bodies of abler and more patriotic men than themselves , and to assuage the bloodthirstiness of a lot of disgraced generals , who , having lost their military reputations when fighting against a foreign enemy , are desirous of redeeming them by the perpetration of deeds at which humanity shudders . We have every reason to believe that the English aristocracy would meet Lord Elcho 's demand with a favourable response ; but we believe better things of Mr. Gladstone . Lord Elcho in command of a volunteer brigade at Brighton may be harmlessly and supremely ridiculous : as a legislator demanding the abrogation of one of our most cherished laws and customs , he is decidedly mischievous . If the Communists had slaughtered the Archbishop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thiers massacred in the most barbarous and brutal manner , Federal prisoners that fell into its hands , then there might be a groundwork whereon an accusation of murder could be laid . But it is very certain that this was not the case . The Versaillists commenced the slaughtering of the prisoners , and the Communists made reprisals . We deeply deplore they should have followed  | so unworthy an example . The execution of the hostages we look upon as a grievous act ; but , considering the circumstances under which it occurred , most assuredly not a crime to which the extraditionary laws apply . The prisoners were not , in fact , handed over : digust at the massacre was too general .  | From the early seventies down to the closing months of the century , when English public opinion began to awake reluctantly to the realization of the fact that in a world of " power politics , " alliances abroad , however distasteful , might be a necessity for self-preservation , a complete generation in England lived in the belief that " splendid isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . The existence of a potential enemy , Russia , might be recognized ; enthusiasm for humanitarian causes , such as the liberation of Turkey 's oppressed minorities , might be evoked ? albeit deceptively ? by Mr. Gladstone 's eloquence ; always the progress of imperial aggrandizement , notably in Africa , was steadily continued . But , throughout , a certain air of lofty detachment from foreign troubles is discernible in most Press comment . Conscious of rectitude , unalarmed by serious threats of aggression from abroad , England concentrated in the main on England 's interests . The note of self-complacency , undisturbed by the criticism of foreigners , was struck at the outset of this period by the Press reception of the Geneva award in the Alabama case , mulcting England of 15,000,000 dollars for her part in permitting this famous commerce raider to fit out in England for Confederate service in the American Civil War . The Times ( September 14 , 1872 ) , observed : It is permissible to retain our conviction that we were not morally culpable in respect to the escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by misfortune we did suffer an injury to be inflicted on the United States for which it is not unreasonable that we should make some compensation . We venture to say that on the whole such a judgement bears remarkable testimony to the genuineness of our neutrality . . . . We may confidently maintain in the face of such facts , not to mention our subsequent concessions in point of principle , that the accusations of unfriendliness levelled against us in the American case are all proved to be flagrantly unjust . The Liberal Manchester Guardian ( September 16 ) commented in much the same vein : The award , calculated as it is to wound the national susceptibilities , does not come upon us as a surprise . An adverse decision on one or more points was seen from the first to be inevitable . The offences we were alleged to have committed were to be tried by an ex post facto law which could not have been more effectually framed with a view to securing a conviction against us if the negotiators of the Treaty of Washington had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been commissioned to execute . The circumstances under which we went before the tribunal render protest or demur on our part impossible . We deliberately acquiesced in this method of settling the dispute which had sprung up between ourselves and the United States , and with our eyes open we assented to the principles ? some of them new to us ? embodied in the three rules which were constructed for the occasion . We loyally submit to the award , and there is no danger , we hope , that anything will be said or done in England to weaken the force of this great experiment in international arbitration . With these comments ? expressive , each in its degree , of a nobility wronged yet too noble to protest ? Anglo-American relations retire temporarily into the background . English eyes are turned rather towards Europe . The possibility of a Russian threat to India begins to become an obsession with the extreme  | Right . By 1875 , when Disraeli had succeeded Gladstone as Prime Minister , Russophobia is already loud in the Tory Press , as exemplified ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By degrees the truth is coming out regarding the Russians in Central Asia . Point after point that has been foreshadowed in these columns has been verified by actual facts and occurrences . We have always contended that the " civilising " theory is a mere blind . In view of the execution of a policy highly menacing to our interests , it was a duty to speak out plainly and to call a spade a spade ... . The very obvious plan that was being carried out did not harmonise with Russian professions and we said so . But it was all to no purpose . Russia was merely " civilising " Central Asia ; we were firm friends of civilisation ; the time was even to be welcomed when a great civilised and friendly power should be next door to us instead of barbarous hoardes . However , of late years many circumstances have happened calculated to open the eyes of all not wilfully blind to what has been going on really . The failure of the Russians to further their plans to retire from Samarcand ; the annexation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Caspian ports to Mery and Herat ; and now the revelations as to the actual character and influence of the Government of Russia in her Central Asian conquests ? these one and all show the aims and tendencies of Russian policy in these regions . The madness of the " Russophobists " is gradually being proved to have been but very ordinary commonsense ? nothing more , in fact , than letting facts speak for themselves . Meanwhile both Tory and Liberal circles in England had been watching with attention , detached , yet not oblivious of the dangers of a Teutonic hegemony in Western Europe , the development of Bismarckian policy in Germany . The Entente of 1873 between the Emperors of Germany , Austria , and Russia had occasioned little comment in England , but in the winter of  | 1874-75 the feeling grew in London that Germany was becoming aggressively overweening , and that the centre of Continental power had been transferred too decisively from the Paris of Napoleon II to Berlin . Rumours were current that Bismarck contemplated the absorption of the Low Countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semi-official Berlin Post , threatening a " preventive " war in consequence of the measures taken in March by France to reorganize her Army , brought matters to a head . The Liberal Press urged Germany to be reasonable . According to the Daily News of April 10 , 1875 : The French army is being reorganised . But Germany knew , when it named the conditions of peace , that France would endeavour to build up her military force at the first opportunity . . . . But the German ministerial journals do not stop here . They represent the French Government as actually contemplating war and preparing for it . . . . There is positively no ground for these apprehensions of danger which the ministerial journals of Germany have striven to excite . It may be that by this time so much as this has been perceived at Berlin and in that case we shall soon be reassured . But , in the contrary case , ? that of the continuation of the publication of articles like that we have discussed ? the only conclusion to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately formed at Berlin to force a war upon an unprepared neighbour . The sympathies of the Tory Press were still more emphatically with France . Criticism of Germany was astringent . On April 12 the Morning Post expressed the hope . . . that the article in the Berlin Post on the political aspect of Europe was , as a prominent financial authority in France announced it to have been , a mere " Bourse manoeuvre . " . . .  | It is the political views as well as the political aims of Germany that are so menacing to peace , so conducive to war . Suspicion denotes distrust and Germany is suspicious to a degree . There is offence or mischief in the sayings or doings of all around her . Three days later the same journal observed : Whatever may happen between Germany and France , the latter country will have the sympathies of the world in general . . . . The world can not think that France is to blame when , left without any defensible frontiers , she seeks to provide against attacks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be debarred from regaining for ever her lost position among the Powers . The crushing-down and keeping-down principle is abhorrent to it . The policy that would keep it in actual war or anticipation of it is felt to be intolerable . Of course the master of many legions , trained deliberately for immediate action , may at his sole will attack a neighbour and plunge Europe in war , but he ought not to be able to do so without incurring the profoundest reprehensions , at the very least , of the whole civilised world . The change in the Tory attitude when France , twenty years later , absorbed Tunis in her colonial empire is , as we shall see , a startling reversal of sympathy . But , for the moment , Liberal and Tory alike were inclined to back France ? the weaker Power . The storm blew over . It is doubtful whether Bismarck seriously considered at that time the idea of another war with France , and his reply to a demarche from Disraeli was conciliatory and reassuring . By midsummer Germany had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous rattler of the sabre . In Tory eyes Russia had assumed the position of " English Enemy No. 1 , " but the " Russian menace " was too remote to cause real popular alarm .  | Then , in November , came Disraeli 's coup de main ? the acquisition of control over the Suez Canal . The Times ( November 20 , 1875 ) was jubilant in a gentlemanly , disinterested way : We may be sure that the KHEDIVE has done better in dealing with a first class Government than in negotiating with this or that combination of continental speculators and it will probably prove no misfortune to him that , instead of mortgaging his property , he has sold it outright . . . . The purchase must be looked upon primarily as an act prompted by the very natural desire to take a share , when offered , in a very useful enterprise which promises to be profitable in itself , and which is beyond a doubt of the highest importance to British commerce . . . . This is the foundation of our interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East we could not but desire to have a position of greater security . . . . We have no desire for an extension of territory , we do not covet the land of the Nile . . . . When Egypt was conquered by our old Continental rival , we wrested land from her only to restore it to its former owner . Our policy is not essentially changed since that time . We contend that Egypt should retain its present connection with the Ottoman State , and the ruler of that State continue in a position to exercise suzerainty . . . . But should insurrection or outbreak bring a political as well as a financial collapse to the Turkish Empire , it might become necessary to take measures for the security of that part of the SULTAN 'S dominions with which we are most nearly concerned . . . . Interest in the Suez Canal , an interest which must inevitably tend to increase , will lead the Government and people of this country to concern themselves habitually with Egypt ; and we trust the effect will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few Liberal organs were doubts expressed as to the eventual political implications and liabilities of this new commitment . Thus , on November 27 , 1875 , the Saturday Review observed :  | England has bought the vassalage of Egypt , and the great Continental Powers will ask how the purchase affects them . There can be no doubt that in the old days of French glory and pre-eminence France would have strongly remonstrated against the purchase as irretrievably deciding the long debated question whether Egypt was to be a tributary of England or France . As things are now , France may be rather glad to see the purchase made . She may be pleased to contemplate England in the embarrassing position of a shareholder in a French company , and may rejoice in thinking that England is committed to opposition to the Allied Emperors , whose alliance is calculated expressly to keep France in fetters . We shall soon hear what these Emperors think of the purchase . Perhaps they may not much regret it . They can not in any case control Egypt , as between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy can act freely . They only lose what they could not have got , and they may hold that this loss entitles them to claim what they would like to have . In dividing the spoils of Turkey they will know that they will have to reckon with each other ; but they will expect not to have to reckon with England . They will say that England has got what she wants , and now they must have what they want . The " spoils of Turkey " were soon to become a matter of moment . The prelude had , in fact , already begun with the insurrection against Turkey in Bosnia and Herzegovina . Liberal opinion championed the rebels , and criticized Disraeli for declining to associate England with Russia and Austria in intervention to stop the conflict . The line taken by the Daily News on May 30 , 1876 , was strongly anti-Turkish : The country will be slow to believe that this Government has so far misconceived the whole trend of public opinion as to have permitted itself to appear as the patron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Porte is engaged at one and the same time with two sets of antagonists . The Central Powers are calling it to account as having  | become disturber of the peace of Europe by its misgovernment . It might be able to show in reply that by one at least of those Powers the charge could not be made with candour and justice . But no answer which it could make to neighbouring Governments can avail against the charges which are made against it by its own subjects in Herzegovina and Bosnia . If any misgovernment can be deemed gross enough to entail a forfeitures of the right to rule , the Port would have lost those Provinces many years ago . . . . We can not help them , so it seems , by our diplomacy , but we must not desert them in their struggle for liberty . . . . We are not called to approve of the assistance thus rendered by Russia and Austria to the Christian subjects of the Porte , but neither are we called to condemn it . We have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures which in our judgement are calculated to precipitate the fall of Turkey , we at the same time preserve a perfect neutrality . The Bulgarian massacres in May moved even the judicial Spectator ( June 3 ) to a fine fury of righteous indignation : It is a war of barbarians . In Bulgaria they are the brutal Bashi-Bazouk , the cruel Tscherkess , as merciless as the Red Indian , and frenzied with a fanaticism which the Red Indian never knew . Roused by the atrocities of the " unspeakable Turk , " Liberal opinion in England became increasingly hostile to Disraeli 's supposedly pro-Turkish policy . Here is an extract from the Spectator of June 17 , 1876 : Not satisfied with resisting the designs of Russia , the Government has proceeded to restrain the Servians . . . . Of course , the Turks are exultant . . . . They believe that England will always protect them , and cheer and cheer the wife of the British Ambassador as she passes through the streets as if she were not an infidel .  | But the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities in Turkey , was by no means to the liking of the Tories . When Russia , encouraged to some extent by Gladstone 's anti-Turk campaign , massed troops on the Turkish , frontier English enthusiasm for the oppressed victims of the t Porte tended to cool ; and when Russo-Turkish relations neared breaking-point , in April 1877 , Tory opposition to Russian aggrandizement was vehement . The Morning Post , in its issue of April 24 , 1877 , stoutly championed the cause of the Crescent against Russia 's " criminal " intent : We hope that . the Russian Government will be urged to pause before it engages in war which is a crime . . . . The Porte is energetically carrying out reforms . It has made Peace with Servia and is very willing to come to terms with Montenegro . It is anxious to disarm . . . . For the first time in history a Sultan of Turkey will fight at the head of his armies for constitutional Government and civil and religious freedom , against a despotic aggressor who seeks to sweep away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Poles . . . . If this infamous war is forced on the Ottoman Empire , there can be no doubt as to which side English sympathies will incline . War was declared on that day , and next morning the same Tory organ observed : This proceeding of Russia is a direct attack upon England and English interests , for both in Asia and Europe it will be attempted to interfere with our route to India . The Daily News of June 19 was even ready to contemplate the dismemberment of Turkey : No one whose observance of facts is unobscured by diplomatic fictions can believe in the permanence of Mohammedan rule in Europe .  | Finally , on the following day : The perfidious mask has been cast away by the common enemy ; the destruction of Turkey is on the lips of the Russian invaders , but the humiliation of England is in their hearts . Liberal opinion , red-hot six months ago for a Crusade against the Crescent , was now neutral , pained , and concerned chiefly to deplore the results of British diplomacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pained and regretful : The Russian declaration of war speedily followed the acts of war which were declared yesterday . The Emperor 's manifesto to his subjects , which will be found in another column , is couched in that tone of lofty disinterestedness and humanity for which every nation gives credit to itself and which every nation denies to its neighbours . . . . In Russia this language will doubtless be hailed as that of a righteous enthusiasm . In some quarters abroad it will doubtless be hailed as that of a diabolical hypocrisy . In truth , it is neither . It is that of political convention , and is no doubt as sincerely employed in the present instance as by other nations making other declarations of war . The fanatics who believe in a Holy Russia of pure disinterestedness and the fanatics who believe in a devilish Russia of unmixed malignity are alike incapable of being argued with . We have to deal with a Russia in whose policy better and worse motives mingle . Unfortunately , the action of our Government has been such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more ignoble and self-seeking ones . At every critical moment when the European concert promised to become something more than a name , when the question arose of giving effect to it , England . . . refused the necessary guarantee . Joint action with the other European powers would have been action in the interest of and for the common objects of Europe . The solitary action of Russia will almost of necessity be action primarily for the interests of Russia . Lord Derby 's diplomacy has failed in every point . Its first aim  | was to preserve the peace of Europe . The peace of Europe is broken . Its second object was to maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Turkey . Both are threatened . The third , and incidental purpose , was , if possible , to improve the condition of the Christian subjects of the Porte . Their country will presently he the scene of a war only less cruel than the massacres to which they have been subject ; and their best hope is the poor one of transference from Turkish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governmental view , but the opinion of solid , upper-class England , was pontifical in its attitude of detachment . Seldom has " a plague on both your houses " been more loftily expressed than in its editorial of April 27 : We may lay aside sympathy for either of the belligerents . As to Turkey , even if her present condition had not been brought about by centuries of misrule , she would have forfeited the good will of Europe by the infatuated obstinacy with which she has defeated every attempt to put her in the way of safety . . . . But it does not follow that we can spare any admiration for Russia . She has broken loose from the European concert with a wrench ; she has taken the law into her own hands ; she has brought immense risks upon herself as well as Europe ; and the Provinces which she declares she is going to liberate may soon be the scene of havoc and carnage far worse than the effects of Turkish fanaticism . . . . It is sometimes assumed that Constantinople might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is one of the strongest places in the world , and , while the Turks control the Black Sea and the Bosphorus , they might hold it against the Russians singlehanded . The Russians know that fact and perhaps it adds emphasis to their assurances that they have no intention to seize Constantinople . At all events , it gives sufficient rebuke to cries of undignified alarm and undisguised appeals to ignorant passion . This country can afford to look as calmly on  | the present contest as it looked on the war between France and Germany , for the simple reason that it will be perfectly well able to defend its interests if , and when , they should be attacked . By the winter of 1877-78 , following the fall of Plevna on December 10 , the Turkish resistance had crumbled . On January 31 , 1878 , when the Russo-Turkish armistice was signed , we find the Times concentrating on the need for preserving British interests in the Near East from damage through excessive Russian demands : The Government . . . will be expected to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as territorial points . It will of course pay more attention to the interests of this country ; that is a subject about which there can be no controversy . It will necessitate that Russia shall not annex any part of European Turkey , that she will not permanently occupy Constantinople , and that all the Powers shall be upon an equality as regards the navigation of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles . Such are the only British interests at stake . Russia still had some Liberal defenders , however , against the " unspeakable Turk . " Gladstone 's eloquence had not been wholly in vain ; and in its issue of February 2 , 1878 , the Spectator was at pains to distinguish between " the peoples of Turkey " and the ruling " Ottoman caste " : Not one single demand of any kind does Russia make upon Turkey . Her demands are without exception on behalf of the peoples of Turkey , and are hard , if hard at all , only upon the Ottoman caste , which oppresses them , and in Europe is no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation by themselves . You might as well say the Act of Emancipation was very hard on Ireland .  | But in Tory eyes , as exemplified by the Morning Post in its leader published on January 31 , the Russian bogy was once more filling the Near Eastern horizon : Do the English people desire the amelioration of the Christians in the Mohammedan Provinces of Turkey , or do they desire the aggrandisement of Russia ? The whole question before the country is summed up in these two points . But can there be any doubt as to the answer ? A handful of hysterical sentimentarians and unscrupulous office-seekers excepted , the British nation is unanimously in favour of a permanent improvement in the condition of the Turkish population of all creeds and races and just as unanimously opposed to the further extension of the overgrown demands of the Russian Empire . The Times ( February 4 ) was more judicial in tone , but hardly less emphatic that Russian expansion at the expense of Turkey would be inimical to British interests : Hitherto a large part of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly agitated by the fear that this country might be ranged on the side of such a country as Turkey . But that dread may now be dismissed . The Turk is no longer a possible ally . Nor would any Government think of trying to restore the administrative arrangements which have perished under the shock of the Russian armies . . . . Liberals are as little in love with Russian rule or influence as Conservatives , and they will give the Government hearty support in so far as it resists any attempt , direct or indirect , to place the liberated Provinces under the protection of the CZAR . The demonstration by the British fleet in the Dardanelles in mid-February was warmly applauded by the Morning Post as evidence that England would be " able to give a good account of herself to any nation with whom we may have to cross swords . "  | When the terms of the Treaty of San Stephano became known Tory indignation was strong . By that Treaty , signed on March 3 , Bosnia and Herzegovina were declared autonomous ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoils with Bulgaria , whom she proposed to make her vassal in the Balkans . The Liberal Spectator declared that " the terms ( of the Treaty ) are moderate and do not impinge on the interests of Great Britain . " But this view was not shared by the Morning Post , which declared on March 9 : We have sufficient knowledge of the terms of the peace which Russia has imposed upon the PORTS to be able to understand at least this much , that unless they are so modified so as to preserve the position of Turkey as an independent power , it will be as absolutely under the control of Russia as the miserable autonomous provinces which in the late war acted in servile obedience to the CZAR 'S dictation . . . . If we allow the SULTAN to become the vassal of the CZAR , the protection of British interests in the East may in the long run , and perhaps before very long , become impossible . Austria took the lead in protesting against the terms of the Treaty , and called upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathies were pro-Turkish and who was keenly apprehensive of the Russian " menace " to India , co-operated willingly with Count Andrassy . Russia was subjected to heavy diplomatic pressure , and was induced to take her seat at the Berlin Congress which opened on June 13 , 1878 , to " revise " the San Stephano terms . The Spectator 's comment on the assembly in its issue of June 15 was ironic : The Congress at Berlin would have seemed as strange to our ancestors as a Parliament at Hawick , and if the assemblage is remarkable , so also is its object . The men who sit there , if they could but agree , have the power to carve the world . . . .  | The dreams are all dreams . There will be struggles over details , trumpery little questions of fortresses and frontiers , and triumphs over minute victories such as that the Turks still remain on the Aegean or that the Bayazid is not Slav , and Turkish bonds will be raised to 30 , and Mr. Disraeli will be a Duke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anarchy and decay . And who are we , flat-nosed barbarians that we are , that we should complain when the descendant of an unmixed people has so decreed ? The Spectator minimized the importance of the issues which the Congress of Berlin was destined to settle . Lord Beaconsfield 's diplomacy ( exercised largely before the Congress met ) resulted in a serious reverse for Russia , who had to cede the bulk of the gains which she had thought to secure by the Treaty of San Stephano . England , by the acquisition of Cyprus , reinforced the " all red " route to India ; between Russia and Germany a breach ( never again wholly closed ) was opened . The Liberal Press in England were doubtful of the wisdom of assuming such great responsibilities in regard to Turkey 's territorial inviolability , but the Tory Morning Post was jubilant ( July 13 , 1878 ) : Today the Treaty of Berlin will be signed . . . . We have had the pain of witnessing the great bulwark of our Eastern possessions shattered in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When , however , it comes to be known that England , setting her face against the great Russian invasion ? which beat at last against the very walls of Stamboul ? has done away with the Treaty of San Stephano , which would have rendered the SULTAN a subject of Russia , and have inflicted on his people the sufferings and horrors that accompany Russian despotism ; when it is known that her plenipotentiaries have restored the line of the Balkans in Europe , and have drawn an inviolable cordon in Asia ; and when it is proclaimed that Cyprus , commanding the route to the East , is  | held by British and Indian troops , and that QUEEN VICTORIA has entered into an alliance with the SULTAN making his Empire safe for ever from future aggression , is it too much to suppose that the Ottoman nation will rejoice at the prospects of peace and security which are guaranteed to them ? While England thus undertakes duties which will surely add to the rapid progress of civilisation , she confers no small benefits upon herself ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India and the East . Aware of the sense of grievance aroused in Russia by Germany 's siding with England and Austria at the Congress of Berlin , Bismarck endeavoured in the summer of 1879 to draw England into an Anglo-German-Austrian alliance . Beaconsfield , with the Zulu rebellion on his hands , had no mind to depart too far from " splendid isolation " in Europe . He would not go further than a promise to see that France should not attack Germany if Germany became embroiled with Russia in the Near East . The result was the bilateral Austro-German alliance of September 1879 ? an alliance hailed with satisfaction by practically the whole of the English Press . The Times ( September 24 ) declared : It is manifest that an Austro-German alliance , whether definite or partly conditional , signifies that both Powers are prepared to make common cause against a common enemy . Neither Power is by nature aggressive , while each has very much to defend and a great deal to lose . Italy is jealous of Austria , France of Germany , and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aggressive aspirations of the other three , and from this point of view we can not but regard it as a fresh guarantee for the maintenance of the peace of Europe . . . . It has little direct influence , perhaps , on the immediate interests of this country , but , as our interests are always those of peace , as we have nothing to gain and a great deal to lose  | from disquiet or disturbance in Europe , we can not but regard with satisfaction an understanding which makes on all sides for peace and furnishes in more than one direction a security against aggressive impulses the existence of which it would be blindness to ignore . The Morning Post , in its editorial columns on the same day , was equally certain that a strong Germany would be a factor making for peace : Long before Germany became a united and powerful nationality , it was the settled policy of English statesmen to desire and promote her unity as a safeguard and bulwark against the aggressive spirit of her neighbours on either side . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations , but they saw that Germany in her full strength would be a guarantee for the peace and security of Europe . France on the one side had repeatedly shown how her aggressive spirit could be roused by strong adventurous rulers ; Russia on the other was remarkable not so much for periodic impulses of aggression as for a settled and fixed policy of advance . France has now won the respect of Europe by a wise moderation and forbearance under rulers who know how precarious is their gain and how certain is their loss from any disturbance of the public peace ; but the experience of the late war has reminded Europe that the traditional policy of Russia is still unchanged . If , therefore , the understanding established between Austria and Germany comes to be regarded in Europe as in the main a safeguard against the aggressive policy which Russia has consistently pursued , we can hardly be much surprised . Even the Liberal Manchester Guardian ( September 23 ) felt that " Panslavonic propaganda " required to be held in check : Years have now passed since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther east , and it is in that direction that her destiny is manifestly carrying her .  | The German Chancellor recognised the importance to all Europe of her steady development in a quarter where an effective counterpoise to the Russian Panslavonic propaganda is so much needed . . . . But the compact will undoubtedly be a great gain to Austria , and in its general bearing on the Eastern Question England , at all events , can have little reason to regard the policy of PRINCE BISMARCK with jealousy . Thus reassured by the establishment of a strong GermanAustro-Hungarian bloc between Russia and France , England was free to pursue quietly her mission of imperialist expansion outside Europe . On October 6 we find the Times thus moralizing , in the tone of parcere subiectis , on the successful end of the Zulu war and the " submissive " demeanour of captured King Cetewayo at Capetown : In his general demeanour there is more of the child and less of the savage than might have been expected from a man of his race and antecedents . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when he witnessed the disciplined manoeuvres of the blue-jackets on board the Boadicea . It is impossible not to be touched by this naive submissiveness , this frank acknowledgement by CETEWAYO of the power of his victors . Even if it were not our duty as well as our desire to be merciful , the demeanour of the vanquished king in his captivity would suffice to disarm our resentment , and is certainly entitled to our respect . . . . We regret to observe that public opinion in South Africa seems to be strongly opposed to the scheme devised by Sir GARNET WOLSELEY for the settlement of Zululand . The progress of British imperialism was not destined to escape setbacks . In April 1880 Beaconsfield 's administration was defeated at the polls , and Gladstone became Prime Minister . In July there came trouble in Afghanistan : Ayub Khan heavily  | defeated a British force at Maiwand . Tory England , through its mouthpiece the Morning Post ( July 29 ) , was insistent that dignity and prestige must be restored : We hope that Her Majesty 's Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will at once turn their attention from the petty claims of Greece abroad and their onslaught on hares and rabbits at home to the Imperial question of the safety of India , and the instant necessity for recovering our damaged prestige . . . . As matters stand , a disaster of important and threatening character has befallen us . Sir Frederick ( afterwards Lord ) Roberts carried out his famous march from Kabul to Kandahar and ended the Afghan war ; but worse trouble was to follow . The Boers , believing that the Liberal Government was favourable to the independence of the Transvaal , broke out in open insurrection on December 16 , 1880 . The Liberal Press endeavoured to hold the scales of justice fairly . Thus , on December 22 the Daily News still hoped for a settlement by compromise : Mr. Joubert does not appear to offer a mere stolid opposition to all compromise . . . . It is a pity that some means can not be devised by which the legitimate aspirations of the Boers could be satisfied without unduly injuring any substantial British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too late to try conciliatory measures . The Times , on the previous day , had been inclined to minimize the danger of serious trouble : It is probable that the party of agitation among the Boers , convincing themselves , or believing that they can convince their ignorant followers , that the resources of the British Government in South Africa were strained to the uttermost in the  | Basuto war , have succeeded in fanning again into a flame the expiring embers of hostility to the QUEEN 'S authority . The menace of revolution at such a season adds , no doubt , largely to the troubles of our Administration , but we have little fear that the menace is serious . It must not be forgotten that the wave of dissatisfaction among the Boers of the Transvaal has ebbed and flowed very distinctly in proportion to the prospects of success which the promoters of the agitation have fancied they discerned . Nor must we overlook the extreme ignorance of the community so swayed . It is easy to understand how a cleverly designed agitation may mould minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its purpose , and it is probable that the astute leaders of the Dutch population in the Transvaal , who are keenly observant of the opportunities which circumstances offer them , have conceived that the present occasion is one of such trial to our strength that they have a chance of securing by the revival of hostile demonstrations some concessions to their demands ... . The resources of the Cape Colony are severely taxed , no doubt , by the growing burden of war , but so far the circumstances of the contest , little favourable as they have been to the colonial cause , disclose no evidence upon which the Cape Government would be justified in thus early proclaiming its incompetence to enforce tranquillity . The Tory Morning Post ( December 21 ) was righteously indignant at the ingratitude of the Boers for English efforts to advance the Transvaal 's prosperity : The Boers have now broken out into open revolt . . . . They have established a Republican Government . . . . The situation is a very grave one and although it can not for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to a revocation of the Act which annexed the Transvaal to Great Britain on the 12th April , 1877 , yet it may entail considerable trouble and expense on our part to reduce the country once more to order , When we annexed the territory it was in a state of  | anarchy , liable to be overrun by the natives who had just defeated the Boers . ' We rescued it from that condition and have done much since to advance its prosperity . A large body of the Boers have appreciated our efforts and have gladly welcomed our rule , but they are cowed by the more demonstrative of their countrymen who object to the British regime ; and these latter have , as in the case of Ireland , at the present time , completely overshadowed those who would be loyal . If assistance be required from England to suppress the outbreak it will have to be accorded . But until fighting began the Press took the view that this was a case of the mouse challenging the invincible British lion . The Morning Post of December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and doubtless a very large proportion of them have a strong objection to the restrictions that are imposed upon them by the British rule , but nevertheless it is impossible to consider their wishes alone , and it is out of the question that their independence should be regained by armed opposition to the British Government . They have now avowed their intention of pursuing that course . Their leaders are not ignorant men . They know England , have visited this country , and must be well aware that there is not the slightest hope for them in a contest with England . It may be that they are under the delusion that a strong demonstration on their part might operate with the Government at home as an inducement to recall the past and to restore what was taken from them . . . . The Boers need not think that we shall have any hesitation in using the full force at our command to crush an insurrection in a territory that is under our own direct control . The " strong demonstration " of the Boers shook this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post 's leader-writer , the 94th Regiment had already ( on December  | 23 ) been badly cut up between Lydenburg and Pretoria . Even the benevolence of the Liberal Press was altered by the tidings . On Christmas Day the Daily News declared : The report of the General commanding at Natal observes that this materially alters the situation ; as indeed it does very materially . The Boers are at one stroke committed to armed rebellion and encouraged to a formidable resistance . They can not turn back if they would ; and after this success , they would not if they could . They will now be inflamed with the highest hopes . They have killed and murdered a large number of our soldiers ; they have succeeded in surprising and completely overwhelming a British force ; and they will , for the hour at least , be filled with the belief that they can carry all before them . . . We know what must happen now . The resistance of the Boers must be crushed . Their one victory will cost them as dearly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring little satisfaction to the Englishman to feel that the Boers are certain to be defeated and crushed before long . England has really no heart for this petty , although sanguinary and costly , struggle . We have been drawn into it , all but betrayed into it . No one here any longer feels any sympathy with the policy which provoked it . There will be no triumph in the success when it comes . In a military sense it would almost seem that these small wars , mostly with barbarous tribes , were telling upon the efficiency of officers and men alike . Such has in history been a common effect of bush-whacking , as we may call it , of enemies far below ourselves in the scale of civilisation . The Boers never showed much of military strength or military skill in the irregular struggle which they carried on against their enemies among the native tribes before our ill-omened annexation of their territory . On the contrary , their incapacity , as it clearly seemed , to maintain themselves against the South African warriors was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .  | Yet it can not but add something to the pain and grief with which the news from the Transvaal will be received in England when it is borne in mind that this humiliating defeat is inflicted upon British arms by men who could hardly hold head against the South African savage tribes . The " crushing " of the Boers was not to be accomplished on this occasion . After the defeat of Sir George Colley at Majuba Hill in February 1881 a compromise peace was patched up by Gladstone , securing a limited independence to the Transvaal Republic under the Queen 's suzerainty . The Liberal Spectator ( March 26 ) commented : The settlement with the Boers will do , if it works well . . . . It is not a perfect settlement . . . . There is nothing whatsoever in the terms dishonourable to the British flag . It was impossible with due regard either to justice or public feeling in this country , to treat the Boers as rebels . . . and the course adopted , to treat them as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expedient compromise quite in harmony with British history and usages . . . . The Boers would not have liked us a bit better for having beaten them . . . . Politically we get all we want , and it is far better to get it without more useless loss of life . Even the Times , somewhat chastened by Majuba , was inclined ( March 23 ) to consider the peace the best way out of a bad business . What had been denied in 1880 to justice must in 1881 be conceded to " fatal marksmanship " : The announcement made yesterday in both Houses of Parliament , that the Boers have substantially accepted the conditions proposed by the Government will be received by the country at large with a distinct sense of relief . . . . It is now generally agreed that the annexation of the Transvaal was a mistake at the outset , committed , no doubt , with the best intentions ,  | but attended with the most untoward results . . . . We have little sympathy with the view that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable terms of peace . If we had determined to conquer the Transvaal and hold it at all costs , no sane man can doubt our power to do so ; but as it has been agreed on all hands that the Boers are in the future to be left to themselves as much as possible , the sooner the miserable dispute was brought to an end the better . It must be frankly admitted that we have been grievously mistaken and misled throughout the whole course of the matter , from the time of the original annexation , when we were told that the Boers acquiesced in our rule , down to the outbreak of hostilities , when we were asked to believe that they could and would not fight . It is mere justice to the Boers to acknowledge their personal bravery , their skill in irregular warfare and their fatal accuracy as marksmen . Meanwhile , in Europe , Gladstone 's antipathy to Austria had led to strenuous efforts by Bismarck to improve the relations between the two Central Powers and Russia . This phase of Bismarck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May 1881 the French occupation of Tunis led to an outburst of violent Francophobia in London . The Morning Post ( May 16 ) was vitriolic : The unprincipled ambitions of the French Republic and the permanent interests of the British Empire are face to face on the shores of Tunis . . . . We do not pause to demonstrate the perfidy , the unblushing falsehood , the more than Muscovite duplicity of the successive protestations and explanations , with which the French Republic has apparently deceived and betrayed the ear of our Radical Cabinet . Doubtless it was hard . . . to manipulate our Foreign Office to anticipate so sore a disillusion at the hands of the enthusiasts of " Fraternity , Liberty and Equality . " It is not the first time , however , in the history of the French Republic that the preservation of the rights of man has turned  | out to be equivalent to the spoliation of all other men but the Gallic wearers of the bonnet rouge . . . . Yet nothing is more easy than to clip the wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent and just commotion . From end to end of the Peninsula it is felt that the very life of the Italian community turns on foiling the people which has placed French bayonets over against Sicily , and which will make the harbour of Bizerta a constant menace to Italian independence . The French Republic may believe that it can scorn the just indignation of solitary Italy . The union of Italy and England presents a combination which will shatter the insolence of the Palais Bourbon . Even the Liberal Spectator ( May 21 ) was constrained to admonish France for her procedure , though Liberalism was persuaded , as always , that the motives of the peccant nation were not wholly evil : That France has behaved badly in the matter , and set a most dangerous precedent , is unfortunately undeniable . Her conduct has been hardly better than our own in Afghanistan . She has intended . . . to acquire a " position " just as we sought to acquire a " frontier " ; and she has done it at the expense of a Prince weaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve either to fight or fly . That her conquest is for the benefit of the world may be admitted ? we admit it most fully ? but her methods of procedure , the false assurances by which Italy was lulled , the professions of friendship by which the Bey was paralysed , the tricky Treaty under which France takes all power in Tunis , are all cruel injuries to the European system , which can not work unless statesmen will keep decent faith . The Spectator then proceeded to argue at length the serious consequences that would ensue for England if she had " dangerous and lasting differences " with France . The Channel fleet would have to be doubled , and the Army enormously increased .  | The position of " splendid isolation " would be seriously jeopardized . The storm blew over , but the estrangement of Italy from France remained . On May 20 , 1882 , the first Triple Alliance between Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Italy was signed . England , so far as its Government was concerned , approved ; public opinion paid little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , where Arabi 's military revolution was threatening the authority of the Khedive . Both the Liberal and Tory Press were unanimous that Arabi Pasha must be " liquidated . " The Manchester Guardian ( May 30 , 1882 ) said : Pretensions that the movement of Arabi Pasha is of a popular character , or one undertaken in the interests of native independence , must henceforth be seen to be truly hollow . Nothing now remains but that the brute force relied upon should be met by superior force , and agreement among all concerned has already gone so far as to decide that the task must be committed , in the first instance at least , to Turkish troops . We must not , however , attempt to conceal from ourselves that this necessity is only to be faced with extreme regret . The Times ( May 27 , 1882 ) was equally emphatic : It is plain that ARABI PASHA will yield to nothing but force , either actual or potential . He has defied the authority of the KHEDIVE for months and no one can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in Egypt is at the disposal of his Ministers . It is easy to rail at his weakness but no man could be strong in his position . If ARABI is to be disposed of ? and until he disappears there can be no peace in Egypt ? the only course now open is to overhear force with force . Partial force was applied when the ships of war appeared at Alexandria . The guns were then cast loose , so to speak , and it was hoped , no doubt , that ARABI would yield  | to the demonstration . As he has declined to do so , the next step will be to load the guns . The English fleet , acting independently of France , bombarded Alexandria in July . Sir Garnet Wolseley landed at Alexandria in August , and Arabi was defeated at Tel-el-Kebir on September 13 . With a chorus of unanimous Press approval , England became the effective ruler of Egypt . The partition of Africa by the Berlin Conference later in the year was equally blessed as part of the white man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1882 ) : That the total result of the partition of Africa will be i neficial to mankind we can hardly doubt . The chance that the peoples of Africa could advance without contact with the vigorous white race and temporary domination by them , is incalculably small . . . . We can not , therefore , regret the invasion of Africa , though we hope Prince Bismarck , like Sir Edward 1Ialet , will insist as strongly on the lenient treatment and freedom of the natives , and the formation of some Council which can at least report authoritatively on abuses , as he undoubtedly will on free navigation , free trade and freedom for Europeans . From the point of view of popular reactions to foreign affairs the remainder of the eighties can be briefly summarized . Tension between England and Russia was renewed by the clash between Russia and Afghan forces at Penjdeh in March 1885 . The Tory Press called for " courageous action , " and suggested that the British fleet should attack Russia via the Dardanelles ( Morning Post , May 26 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to India , English susceptibilities were ruffled both by Germany 's annexation of New Guinea , the Cameroons , and Samoa and by French rivalry in Egypt . The Tory Morning Post on May 27 , 1885 , urged its readers to realize that " not  | hostility to England but superior affection for Germany " governed Bismarck 's policy , while the Liberal Press tended consistently to be guardedly Francophil . But , on the whole , the newspapers of England were indifferently neutral to European relations . Preoccupations with Empire were considerable . South Bechuanaland was annexed in 1885 , Upper Burma in 1886 . The Chartered Company to administer British East Africa was set up in 1888 , and a similar regime in Mashonaland and Matabeleland established in 1889 . England 's " place in the sun " was being steadily enlarged and fortified . In 1890 , however , popular attention was attracted once more to Europe by a dramatic development . Bismarck had resigned . The removal of PRINCE BISMARCK from the helm ? we will not say of German , but of Continental politics ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have cause , as we have , to realise his immense service to the peace of Europe can look upon it without a feeling almost of dread as to what may follow . He can have no real successor . Can anyone be found to hold in check the vast , the awful forces which even he at various times of crisis has hardly been able to restrain ? . . . It must be borne in mind that German diplomacy will , in any case , be weakened for some time to come by the loss of PRINCE BISMARCK 'S prestige , the long tradition of his victories , the accumulated stores of his experience . . . . The prospect of a serious enfeeblement of Germany , both in respect of her internal unity and her influence over her neighbours , would be alarming if there were not a widely spread belief among the German people that the impact of the EMPEROR 'S will at home and abroad is a force almost equal to that exercised by PRINCE BISMARCK . This belief must be tested by time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 19 and 20 , 1890 ) . The fear that Germany might be weakened to the detriment of British  | interests was echoed by the Liberal Spectator in its issue of March 22 : We can not but think that Prince Bismarck 's resignation will prove , on the whole , and perhaps by degrees , unfavourable to continued peace . . . . The effect of the event on the enemies of Germany must be considered first of all . They may believe that the Triple Alliance will be weakened , and they may be right in that belief . . . . They will certainly consider that Germany guided by Prince Bismarck was a more dangerous foe than Germany guided by an Emperor whose judgement is as yet doubtful , while his intense energy is often accompanied and discoloured by a desire to monopolise the attention of the world . The first post-Bismarckian development in Anglo-German relations was the agreement of June 1890 whereby England ceded Heligoland to Germany in exchange for Zanzibar . The Morning Post ( June 26 ) hailed the treaty as cementing England 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Germany has been dictated by considerations of infinitely greater moment to both Empires than the precise amount of territory secured to either of them in Africa . In that vast continent there is ample room for every one , provided England and Germany are content to live as it becomes good neighbours to do . Under a state of affairs involving constant recrimination and suspicion scarcely the smallest outpost could be held with permanent advantage . Greater , therefore , than any other territorial advantages must be reckoned the establishment of good relations between this country and her natural ally . To make this complete and effective only one thing was required , and that was to present Germany with the tiny island which is of no use to us , but which is possessed of big value in German eyes . By so doing LORD SALISBURY has consolidated in Europe the amicable arrangement begun in  | Turkey , and has placed the friendship of the Teuton powers on a broad and lasting basis , to the immense gain of both alike . The idea of any serious conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign policy , and on April 14 , 1891 , we find the Times urging Italy , for her own good , to renew the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria : The question which interests the world , however , is . . . whether the Triple Alliance will be renewed . . . . The Italian Premier knows that the Triple Alliance means the status quo in Europe ; no change in Alsace Lorraine , and continued attention to the Italian army and navy , especially to the latter . What is the alternative ? Is any Italian Minister prepared to see the European equilibrium overthrown in order that any one of these conditions may be changed ? We venture to doubt it . It may be said , indeed , that Alsace Lorraine is not an Italian interest , and that Socialism can be combatted at home without foreign alliances . But if , on either of these grounds , Italy were largely to reduce her army or swerve from her resolve to become a great naval power in the Mediterranean , she would at once become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past nine years has been a continual provision . Costly as it is , we fear that there can be no doubt that Italy 's interest lies in an alliance with the Central Powers . But though Anglo-German relations were excellent , it is interesting to note the cordiality with which the Times commented on the visit of the French fleet in August 1891 ? a moment when France was concluding with Russia an agreement for the maintenance of peace and the European balance of power : Today the visit of the French fleet comes to an end , and the ships leave British waters , we fear , in very bad weather , more worthy of November than August . But good ships and good 212  | sailors can face a gale of wind , and we trust that not even the worst tossing in the Channel would make the recollection of the past week other than pleasant to officers and men . On the British side we are sure there is only one feeling ? that of regret that our guests are obliged to leave us so soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international policy as one of " friendship but no alliances . " France may now be inclining to change that policy ; but the words exactly express the traditional policy of this country . Alliances imply corresponding antagonisms , and , with our interests touching every corner of the world , it would be madness to provoke those antagonisms , at least while we are strong enough to look after our interests ourselves . " Splendid " isolation might be nearing its end , but it still had its exponents . In the early nineties , however , the first real signs of strain in Anglo-German relations became visible . German protests against the Anglo-Belgian Congo Treaty , followed by Franco-German understandings with regard to the Congo , created friction between London and Berlin ; Germany drew closer to Russia ; and in 1895 , when Germany , France , and Russia forced Japan , victor in her war with China , to abate her terms of peace , England somewhat ostentatiously dissociated herself from the intervening Powers . The Liberal Spectator treated the matter with cynical scepticism ( April 13,1895 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baser side of it . . . and the terms they offer China are , if correctly stated , drawn with exceeding adroitness . . . . The change in the general tone of the English press the moment the terms were known is almost comical . We were going to make a compact with Russia and France to limit Japanese demands . . . and above all to forbid any annexation of any portion of the mainland of the Chinese Empire . The offer of a new trade has , however , acted at once as a lubricant ; and the  | journals agree that , as Japan has in this respect been so magnanimous , the remaining clauses of the Treaty can furnish no ground for European interference ... . In truth , the central point in the situation is still hidden from us . We do not know , that is , whether Japanese ascendancy in Pekin will be a source of strength to the island Empire , or a huge burden upon its resources , and until we know that it is useless to decide upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes or they may be an effective counterpoise to that aggressive spirit of Russia in Central Asia which up to today has seemed to English statesmen the most formidable of all the dangers of the future . The attitude of the Times ( April 23 ) was more revealing : When we are asked or are challenged by the continental press to intervene or to insist upon a revision of the terms agreed upon between the victors and the vanquished , we are called upon to pause . . . . We make no pretence to measure the interests of Russia or France or Germany in the far East ... . If those Powers or any of them consider that they are called upon to meddle in the negotiations between Japan and China they will do so on their own responsibility and at their own risks . . . . The permanent result of the war which is most serious for England ? the rise of a great naval power , whether it be friendly or hostile , in the waters of the far east ? can not be altered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . We are decidedly of opinion , therefore , that the Government have acted wisely in refraining from participation in any pressure upon the Japanese . The necessity for alliances had not yet become apparent to English Press opinion . Events in 1896 were destined to shake au fond the belief in the practicability of perpetual " isolation " from Europe ; but before we come to that year and to Dr. Jameson 's disastrous escapade reference must be made to the Anglo- American dispute over Venezuela . Lord Salisbury , the then Prime Minister , had declined to submit to arbitration the question of a disputed boundary . In the name of the Monroe Doctrine the President of the U.S.A. claimed the right to decide the points at issue . The Times ( December 23 , 1895 ) observed : Our position is perfectly clear . Both HER MAJESTY 'S present advisers and their predecessors in office have indicated the limitations of the controversy with Venezuela which this country is willing , not as a matter of right , but for the sake of peace to submit to arbitration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , whether they dislike us or not , are hesitating to break the peace of the civilised world for such a contemptible cause of quarrel as the Venezuela boundary dispute and in vindication of claims that are repudiated , not only by Great Britain but by all the nations of the old world . The PRESIDENT 'S manifest incapacity to understand the effect of what he was doing when he sent his warlike message to Congress has shattered the confidence that was felt in him as a pillar of sound finance and a mainstay of public credit ... . The blow that has been struck has produced widespread disaster in business centres all over the world . The Americans themselves have suffered most severely . The Liberal Spectator ( December 28 ) was equally confident that England could justifiably feel immune from criticism : If the world were governed by common sense as Mr. Gladstone suggests it ought to be , but as it too seldom is , the idea of a war between the United States and Great Britain would be scouted as preposterous , because , while both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything solid to gain from victory . . . It is wholly contrary to the national character to ask for money ; and as for respect , we desire from people of our own blood nothing but what we already have . . . . Our masses . . . P 216 read American diatribes against the Britisher with a feeling that is not far removed from positive enjoyment . Eventually an arbitration tribunal was set up , and its award , issued in 1899 , was favourable to most of the British contentions . Venezuela caused no lasting breach in Anglo-American amity . Much more serious were the consequences of the 1896 troubles in the Transvaal . The refusal of the Republic to grant the franchise to alien residents had long been a sore point with the English in South Africa , and on New Year 's Day , 1896 , Dr. Jameson , the Administrator of Rhodesia , invaded the Transvaal with a force of six hundred mounted men . The Tory Morning Post next day applauded : The course taken by DR . JAMESON , although so strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we rightly interpret the feeling of Englishmen generally , many excuses can be made . . . . DR . JAMESON thought his presence in the Transvaal with an armed force at this juncture might do more to mend matters in a peaceful way than any amount of negotiation . The Daily News ( January 3 ) was filled with righteous Liberal indignation : Dr. Jameson has not merely done his best to justify the charge of wanton aggression so often and so groundlessly raised against Great Britain , he has brought wanton humiliation upon the British race in South Africa . The raid was immediately and conclusively defeated ; but from the point of view of future European relations the congratulatory telegram sent by the German Kaiser to President Kruger was more important than the fate of Dr. Jameson . The Daily News ,   expressing the Liberal view , insisted that " there is nothing hostile to this country in the Emperor 's words , " but the attitude of the Tory Morning Post was frankly bellicose . In its issue of January 4 , 1896 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war by Germany on England : The GERMAN EMPEROR 'S telegram to PRESIDENT KRTJGER which has so greatly surprised and distressed the people of England must be read in its context . It is not a sentimental effusion but a deliberate political act . . . . The EMPEROR considers war with England as something to be prepared for , and he yesterday settled with his Admiral the necessary preliminaries with a view to that event . . . . Nothing is more unlikely than that Germany single-handed should seek a quarrel with Great Britain . . . . Is it possible that the French could so far forget their hostility to Germany as to co-operate with the Germans in a war against England ? . . . To speak quite plainly , it is impossible to survey the world at the present moment without seeing that Great Britain stands alone and that the attitude or the policy of four of the great powers are such that each or all or any of them may at any moment become her enemies . There followed in the Morning Post a campaign for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be maintained it must be " sword in hand . " The estrangement between England and Germany was greatly deplored by Italy , whose ill-starred campaign in Abyssinia ended with the disaster at Adowa in March 1896 . The Times , commenting on the battle , expressed England 's " profound regret . " The Morning Post ( March 5 ) urged the advisability of aid to Italy , possibly with the idea of detaching her from the Triple Alliance : The hour of trial has come for Italy and it behoves England in the moment of her supposed isolation to show her generosity   and her sympathy . . . . The danger which the defeat of Adowa may precipitate is that of a revolution . . . . Such an upheaval would be a calamity for Europe . . . . There are several ways in which help can be given . . . . For her own sake as well as for the sake of peace Great Britain ought to help Italy in her hour of trial ; a declaration of policy such as that already suggested would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial aid such as England has in the past so often accorded to far less deserving or useful friends . Nevertheless the English attitude of detachment from all foreign issues not immediately involving patent English interests still lingered on . In the Spanish-American War of 1898 the Tory English Press for the most part maintained a tone of lofty impartiality . Thus , the Times ( April 26 ) commented on the outbreak of hostilities : The two nations are at war . That is the fact which concerns the world , not the motives they express or the internal distribution of responsibility . Those who regard war as a spectacle devised more or less for their amusement are likely to have to put up with a good deal of disappointment . Noble efforts have already been made by foreign correspondents and news agencies , in the way of rumours and denials concerning the capture of passenger boats and merchant vessels , to produce the illusion of a thrilling drama . We venture to think that the public will be very weary of all this long before news of real importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even under the direction of Congress , is not likely to be immediately fertile in striking incidents or sensational horrors . The recently founded Daily Mail was frankly pro-American . In its leading article of April 21 this creation of Alfred Harmsworth 's erratic genius declared : The Daily Mail , as our readers know , deplores this result of America 's efforts to see Cuba freed from a Government that was a Government only in the sense that it provoked incessant   revolution . But while we deplore the result , we have nothing but praise and approval for the spirit that has led our cousins across the seas to make an end of an undeniable scandal ... . The blame is on Spain if it can not be done peaceably . . . . The time must have come in any case when America would have to bring Spanish rule to an end . It is immaterial what has made it so sudden now . . . . America may have a hard and a costly task , but the cleansing of Cuba is a piece of scavenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exemplified by the Daily News ( April 22 ) , was critical of the necessity for the war , but applauded also the civilizing motives of the U.S.A. : The world at large is confronted with a horror of a great war . . . . It remains an open question whether the freedom of Cuba might not have been obtained without war . . . . But criticisms such as they have been , refer only to the occasion of the war . The cause of the war is another question and here our sympathies are all with the United States . . . . If John Bull had been situated in the case of the United States , we feel confident that he would have found occasion to intervene in Cuba a long time ago . Meanwhile a dangerous situation was developing in Egypt . Aided by two British brigades under Sir Herbert ( afterwards Lord ) Kitchener , the Sirdar defeated the threatening dervish army of the Mandi at Omdurman on September 2 , 1898 , and occupied Khartoum . At Fashoda , 300 miles up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the Liberal Spectator was moved ( September 10 ) to bellicosity : Khartoum is in our hands . . . . What is to be our future policy as regards the Nile above Khartoum ? . . . In our opinion there can be no doubt that the first thing to do is to press on up the main stream of the Nile . . . . In regard to the alleged French expedition stationed at Fashoda there can be no   difficulty . If , as we expect they will , its members allow us to treat them as a scientific expedition , they are most welcome and will do us no harm . If , however , they claim to exercise sovereign rights they must at once be bundled out of Fashoda without further ceremony , and France must decide whether she cares to fight the matter out in the Channel . After ticklish diplomacy between London and Paris France climbed down . The tricolour was removed from Fashoda , and Major Marchand was recalled to Europe ; but the Anglo-French tension of that autumn influenced Chamberlain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Anglo-German alliance in defence of British interests . This endeavour on the Colonial Secretary 's part was destined to be unsuccessful ; and he failed once more in his move on similar lines a year later . Germany , at this juncture , was apprehensive lest a rapprochement with England should embroil her with Russia in the Far East . In Berlin the possibility of an Anglo-French Entente was not unnaturally scouted as an impossibility , and an understanding between England and her traditional enemy , Russia , seemed equally improbable . But though Chamberlain 's approaches to Germany had no positive result , they are significant as marking the end of splendid isolation ' from the point of view of official diplomacy . Public opinion had not yet reached the stage of realizing the vulnerability of England without allies ; the country had been for so long immune from serious hostilities that the fear of losing the Empire had not begun to stir in the popular mind . The self-complacency which had been the real basis of " splendid isolation " was soon to be shattered by the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventies had begun , with Russia still the popular bogy in Britain . Not until the Japanese war had dispelled the menace of Russia and Germany 's expansionist aims had made a real impression on the Englishman " in the street " did the final pre-1914 orientation of England 's foreign policy take shape .   PRELUDE TO CATASTROPHE ( 1899-1914 ) In order to appreciate the psychological effect of the impingement in the Boer War on the Englishman " in the street " it is necessary to remember that since the hostilities in the Crimea English troops had not been matched for over a generation with any formidable adversary . When the Boer Republics delivered their ultimatum in the autumn of 1899 we find the Daily Mail ? " written by office boys for office boys " ? contemptuous of the threat . It observed ( October 9 ) : " As for their threats , we may dismiss them with contempt , for ere long the much delayed Army Corps will be at sea , and with it will come , as sure as fate , the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , when war was declared , the Daily Mail was still more vainglorious : The superb expansion of the British Empire and the dwindling of the Dutch throughout the world have proved that , brain for brain , body for body , the English-speaking people are much more than a match for the Dutchman , despite the superior trickery and cunning of the men of the Low Countries . .. . Doubtless at first we may suffer , but we have suffered before , and in the end the Boers , their shareholders , company promoters , German and Celtic hirelings , will receive the punishment which their insane attempt to perpetuate an almost barbaric system of Government in the 19th century most thoroughly deserves . The Morning Post , which warned its readers ( October 11 ) not to cherish " illusions as to the seriousness of an armed conflict   ENGLAND GOES TO PRESS for supremacy in South Africa , " was almost alone in anticipating the prospect of a struggle which would tax British resources ; and even this realistic Tory journal , always well served by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Boers " will in the end be compelled to agree to the British terms . " As to the rights and wrongs of the struggle , the British public had little doubt . The small pro-Boer minority led by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had what a later generation would call " a Press flop . " The Times on October 7 gave the lead : Fiat voluntas Britannica , fiat iustitia . Unless the man in the street possesses a good deal more intelligence than SIR HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN seems disposed to credit him with , he will be considerably puzzled to extract from the Right Honourable gentleman 's speech at Maidstone what he really thinks about affairs in South Africa . He begins by saying that the man in the street can not answer the question ? what is it that we are going to war about ? His acquaintance with the man in the street must be select and exclusive , otherwise he would know that the answer is usually given with great emphasis and promptitude . . . . The people of this country are aware that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you please ? is deliberately and openly defied and attacked by the Boers . They know that this authority is indisputable , necessary , and based not upon an accident of a few words in a Convention , but upon the necessary circumstances of the nature of the case . It is to maintain this authority which they know makes for peace , civilisation and good Government that they are ready to go to war if the corrupt and tryannical oligarchy which has for years been undermining it can not otherwise be compelled to withdraw its pretensions ... . The race hatred can not be made greater than it is , nor can it ever be made less until we assert our necessary and indisputable authority to enforce complete equality between the two nationalities . When neither can oppress the other the cause of hatred will disappear , and the hatred itself will die out . Except by   the assertion of our authority no equality can ever become possible . The Boers are in too backward a state of education and civilisation ever to grant it unless they are compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the UITLANDERS shall win no political rights save over his dead body . When war officially began , four days later , the Times carried on its " leader " page a poem by Swinburne referring elegantly to the Boers as " clogs agape with jaws afoam . " The accompanying editorial was succinct : Now that the Transvaal has irrevocably chosen to put the differences between us to the arbitrement of battle ... Englishmen of all parties and all shades of feeling will be unanimous . . . As Mr. Swinburne says in the vigorous and characteristic sonnet he sends us this morning , the sons of Cromwell and of Blake will cry " Strike , England , and strike home . " It is the old cause . Even the Liberal Press , so soon as war was seen to be inevitable , took the line of " my country , right or wrong . " On October 11 the Daily News had announced that the object of England was " to protect British subjects from oppression , to establish the equality of the two white races and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this typically euphemistic Liberal definition of aims it passed rapidly on October 13 to a rousing call for unity , in order to secure a " mercifully " rapid victory : The " closing of the ranks " to use Lord Rosebery 's words , is the feature of the political situation at home . Mr. Asquith in a speech to his constituents last night again gave eloquent expression to the national sentiment . Now that war has been declared against us the duty of every loyal subject of the Queen is to assist in the formation of an " unbroken front " so that the Queen 's Government may be able to proceed with the promptitude and energy which will secure the most rapid and therefore the most merciful end of the campaign .   The appointment of Sir Redvers Buller as Commander-inChief was hailed by the Daily News on October 16 with remarkable unction : Among the qualifications of Sir Redvers Buller for his present task we may include his breadth and elevation of mind . There is much that is very petty and unworthy of a great nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .... Sir Redvers Buller may be trusted to do his duty without flinching and with all the necessary thoroughness . But assuredly he will neither despise nor yield to his enemies . On the contrary he is well know to entertain a high opinion of the Boers . He has seen much of them and he likes them . He means of course to beat them . But he is not likely to underrate them during the struggle , and in the hour of victory he may be relied upon . Rarely can the attitude of the English parent who flogs his children because " he likes them " have been more revoltingly expressed . But the self-complacency of England in entering on this war was to be disturbed at the outset by the discovery that Europe ? France , Germany , and the rest ? was inclined to side with the Boer Republics . The Times ( October 12 ) was righteously affronted : We can not unfortunately count upon the good will or charitable judgement of the foreign press , which is shouting in chorus the familiar charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance of the facts , or a determined objection to make them known . It is probable that some of this outcry , as our Paris correspondent hinted yesterday , is not altogether disinterested , but abuse of England , no matter what the controversy , is always a sufficiently congenial occupation to be followed with hope of reward . The present outburst re- minds us of that which greeted the Americans in their contest with Spain and nothing more is needed to mark its bitterness and its futility . It is odd , however , to see some French journals simultaneously admitting that the Boers must be beaten , applauding them for courting defeat which they could easily have diverted , and abusing this country because the Boers insist upon war . More odd still is it to reflect that the French imagine themselves a pre-eminently logical race . The realization , however , that the Continent did not applaud England 's determination to assert her authority finally in South Africa was of little moment in comparison with the discovery that English generals could lose battles against an enemy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As typifying the alarm and consternation occasioned in England by the defeat of Lord Methuen on the heights of Magersfontein and the reverse suffered at Stormberg by General Gatacre on December 10 we select the following " lead story " ( as it would now be called ) from the Morning Post of December 14 : The news which reached us last night will make every Englishman close his lips with a certain grimness of expectancy and determination . But it may do more . We learnt with a measure of ironical contempt that the Boers had appointed a day of national humiliation . Sincere or insincere ? We are so far out of touch with the Boer character that we can not decide ! But there are worse things than the announcement by a nation that it would purge itself of pride ... . Face to face with a nation in arms , a nation confessedly brutal in many of its dealings , but brave , strong , and united , we have discussed as a conqueror the terms of settlement , we have divided as a victor the spoils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people we have not followed what is we hope our custom as individuals , and left boastfulness to the man who takes off his armour . That was the habit of the men who held these islands before us , and if we have forgotten their example it is  | perhaps because like Jeshurun of old we have " waxed fat and kicked . " Well , we have had our day of humiliation appointed for us . Let us accept it humbly and soberly , and be the better and the stronger for the lesson it has taught us , the lesson of a silent unboastful determination to prove ourselves worthy to hold the Empire which our fore-fathers have won ... . This last reverse will make us the butt of Europe . That is of little consequence . Europe has laughed at us before , but we can show in our time of trouble a front of united resolve , a people of one determination . It takes trouble to make us of that one accord , but trouble has never yet failed of its effect . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there never was a more apt occasion . But let us renounce all boastfulness , our schemes for governing what we have not won , our depreciation of a people whom we have not beaten . The day is still before us , but it must be won in a spirit different from that in which it has begun , in a spirit of resolved humility ; less assertive but no less determined and no less assured . These reverses , followed swiftly by the defeat of General Buller on the Tugela river , roused the Government to a real sense of the gravity of the situation . Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener were sent to take command ; immense reinforcements were dispatched ; with the surrender of Cronje at Paardeberg in February 1900 the issue of the war was virtually settled . Having gallantly , if unwisely , challenged the British Empire , the Boer Republics passed into history . But in their passing they drove England to think in terms of foreign alliances . Not at first in Europe . Here the alignment of forces was still obscure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to India had not yet been forgotten , and France ( severely critical of England in her Press comment on the Boer War ) had just renewed her Entente with Russia . Germany had reached agreement with England , after some friction , in the   matter of Samoa ; and the Tory Press was inclined to be Germanophil . Here is an extract from the Morning Post ( November 9 , 1899 ) : The more thoroughly Great Britain and Germany understand one another 's policy , the better we imagine would be the relations between the two Governments of the nations which they represent . For we have never been able to discover that there is anything in the main purpose of either nation which is inconsistent with the main purpose of the other , and such small matters as have occasionally led to friction were never worth the noise that was made about them and the trouble they have sometimes caused . Nevertheless Germany ? her policy guided by the Emperor and Billow , both insistent on a " free hand " ? responded coldly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no belief in the advantages of an Anglo-German Entente ; the man in the street ' was inclined to dislike equally Russia , Germany , and France . He was content to believe that no immediate menace to England on the Continent could be discerned . On February 13 , 1902 , his morning newspaper informed him that England had entered into an alliance with Japan . If he was a Liberal reader of the Daily News he was urged to regard the alliance with caution : We desire to be friends with all the world ; but do we desire to be chained to anyone ? The traditional policy of England .. . has been . . . " Splendid Isolation . " There is much to be said for that policy . The Daily News went on to raise doubts lest England might be embroiled with Russia in consequence of the alliance , and said in conclusion : With the most friendly feelings to the Land of the Chrysanthemum . . . we yet more than doubt whether there is any   Power in the world to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ( still Liberal ) Spectator entertained similar misgivings in its issue of February 15 : We can not profess anything approaching satisfaction with regard to the agreement with Japan . Indeed , the more that alliance is studied . . . the more it seems to us fraught with danger and difficulty . What Japan gains is , of course , clear enough . What we gain is far from manifest . We object to the treaty , not only because it is an open declaration of hostility to Russia ? of course this is officially denied , but the public opinion of the world has at once accepted it as aimed at Russia ? and because it places our relations with Russia and France at the mercy of Japan , but because , even if we accept the view that our and Russian interests in the Far East are necessarily antagonistic , it meets the case in the wrong way . Even if we held that Russia were the enemy and could never be the friend of this country , we should protest against the formation of an alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have departed on insufficient ground from our fixed policy of not making alliances , and that we should have acted far more wisely had we remained unpledged in the Far East , and so been able to hold aloof from any diplomatic complications which do not directly and vitally concern us . . . . Japan at any time during the next five years has it in her power to light a flame of war which will burn in the English Channel , in the Baltic , in the Mediterranean and wherever Russia , France and England are in contact ... . Japan has too lately become a civilised Power , and has too lately been endowed with political institutions , to make it possible to say that her Government is one which can wisely be trusted so absolutely as we have trusted it . We know far too little about Japan to make it safe to commit ourselves unconditionally to her lead in the politics of the Far East . . . . We have only one more word to say on the subject . That is to   express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of Englishmen , that we should have abandoned our old policy of doing without alliances and the splendid freedom of action which that policy secured to us and have adopted the contrary course . The Tory Press , however , welcomed the alliance wholeheartedly . The Times ( February 12 ) had no doubts as to the battle-worthiness of England 's new comrades in arms . It declared : The country will receive with great satisfaction the important agreement between Great Britain and Japan . . . . The object of this contract is to secure the fulfilment of the wish common to both powers that the integrity and independence of the Chinese Empire should be preserved . . . . This is a policy which threatens no one . . . . It makes for the preservation of peace in the Far East and all over the world . Should , however , untoward events defeat the pacific intentions of the two contracting parties we can look forward with the utmost confidence to the results which may be expected from this defensive alliance between the two island Empires of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficiency and the humanity displayed by the naval and military forces of Japan during the recent operations in Northern China justify the assurance that should the necessity ever arise , the KING 'S soldiers and sailors will find in their Japanese allies comrades with whom they will be proud to fight shoulder to shoulder . The Morning Post , next day , with greater realism , admitted that the alliance meant the end of " isolation , " and regretted that the conception of " power-politics " had not been made to function more " comprehensively " ? i.e. , in England 's relations with the Continent : The signature of the Treaty of the 30th January 1902 , between Great Britain and Japan is an event the significance of   which can hardly be over-estimated . To begin with , it marks the disappearance from British policy of the too long prevalent prejudices against treaties of alliance ... . More security for the moment might have been obtained had the treaty now announced been one of a complete system of treaties covering the whole field . That , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government and of public opinion to a comprehensive view of policy than was in any degree probable . In these matters the great difficulty lies in the first plunge ; that difficulty has been overcome , and the step taken can not but lead to such a review of the whole situation as will in time produce a complete and consistent policy . The situation was , indeed , destined to be " reviewed , " but not until one point of obscurity had been cleared up . Was Russia a real menace or not ? The events of 1904 answered that question . In February of that year war was declared between Russia and Japan . All sections of opinion in England were pro-Japanese . The Daily Mail ( February 8 ) declared : Japan is fighting for her very existence . Like David she goes forth to meet Goliath with no proud boasting , with no spirit of contempt for her terrible enemy but with the stern resolution to conquer or perish . . . . There is every hope that the conflict may be localised through the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Morning Post , on the same day , was even more emphatic : The conduct of Russia has been like that of the wolf in the fable . That of Japan has hitherto , at least towards Russia , been as blameless as that of the lamb .... Russia will be fighting for her position in the Far East and if she wins will be mistress of Asia . . . . The success of Russia would be the end of British influence in Asia . . . . Great Britain is morally bound to support Japan .   The Liberal Daily News was more judicial , but the operative wish was identical . Its editorial of February 10 observed : Public feeling in this country undoubtedly runs strongly in favour of Japan . She is the smaller , and , we think , the weaker Power on land , where the real struggle must take place . But we do not understand the argument that because Russia oppresses her peasants , her Jews and her Fins , that therefore we should rejoice at her discomfiture . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bureaucrats at the head of affairs , against whom our indignation should be levelled ? but the poorer people with whom we sympathize . It was left to the Spectator ( February 12 ) to voice apprehension as to the possible extensions of the conflict ; but even in this journal 's columns the hope of Japanese success was not disguised : What concerns Englishmen now that the war has begun is its probable result . Clearly the first British interest to be considered is ? how are we to keep out of it ? The nation does not want another war , and a war which must certainly set the whole world on fire . But it is clear that , considering our obligations , the risk of our being involved is much less if Japan wins than if she loses . Should Japan be beaten and her existence as a State be seriously imperilled , or even weakened , it would be difficult for us to resist an appeal from her for assistance , either direct or indirect . On the other hand , if Japan beats Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need , and indeed no excuse , for her to appeal to Britain . She will prefer to keep that complete control of her own policy which independent action gives her . British people , therefore , whatever they may think of the ultimate effect of Japanese dominance in the Far East , should such dominance ever come into existence , can not but hope that Japan will be the victor or at any rate will not be beaten .   The first news which indicated that the Russian giant had feet of clay made a profound impression in England , as witness the Daily Mail ( February 10 ) in its editorial column : The Japanese fleet has struck . . . . The moral effect of these successes will be prodigious . They will remove any uneasiness that may have been felt among the Japanese as to their chances of victory . . . . The deeds of the Japanese fleet remind the world that England has shown true foresight in recognising the high qualities of the Japanese . She has allied herself , not as a certain continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys , " but with a brave , determined , civilised nation . To this strophe of self-gratification and relief add the Morning Post 's antistrophe three days later : The vast extent of the Russian Empire on maps made according to Mercator 's Projection no longer dominates most minds . It shrinks to its normal proportions and influence of her power is seen at its natural size . In the following October the Russian fleet on its ill-starred voyage to the East fired during the night on English trawlers near the Dogger Bank . The Daily Mail ( October 24 ) voiced popular indignation : A fresh and absolutely indefensible outrage has been offered to the British flag by the Russian Baltic squadron on its way down the North Sea . . . . As to the action which should be taken by this country , there can be little doubt . If the Baltic fleet fired by accident , such a fleet is not to be trusted on the high seas where its presence will endanger every vessel under our flag . If it did not fire by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak and wanton act which will be condemned by common judgement of humanity as a crime unparalleled in modern history .   The " unparalleled crime " was expiated next May in the battle of Tsushima ; the Dogger Bank incident had no permanent effects on England 's relationship with Europe , save that suspicions were aroused that Germany had in some way been " behind it all . " Much more important was the Entente concluded with France during the previous spring . Delcasse , the French Foreign Minister , Anglophil and Germanophobe , had worked hard for an understanding , and on April 8 , 1904 , his efforts were crowned with success . No longer afraid of Russia , England agreed to bless French supremacy in Morocco ; Egypt became England 's unchallenged vassal . The news occasioned somewhat surprising reactions in the English Press . The Liberal Daily News ( April 9 ) commented as follows : We report today with unqualified satisfaction the news of the signature of the colonial treaty between France and Great Britain . . . . It is hard to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with France for the possession of an African swamp .... We see in the treaty a guarantee of the reduction of armaments as well as a crushing blow to the antiforeign party of this country who have been preaching the noxious doctrine that national success is only to be won at the expense of the foreigner . As an afterthought , two days later , this expression of Liberal benevolence was amplified by the reminder that Because there is general satisfaction at the Treaty just announced , it must not be assumed that British policy will henceforth be adverse to Germany . . . . There is not the slightest reason why all possible causes of difference between ourselves and the German Empire should not be removed by the same kind of diplomacy which has removed the differences between ourselves and France .   The Spectator ( April 16 ) was more reserved : it deprecated " gushing , " but was still approving : We have no inclination to gush over these arrangements , though we welcome them with a most hearty cordiality . . . . There never was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation has rendered it difficult for Great Britain and France to work together . The two nations have now nothing substantial to quarrel about and they certainly neither hate nor despise each other . They each have lines of expansion along which to advance without even casual interference with each other 's gain and we may , therefore , without expecting too much , hope that they will remain cordial friends . By way of contrast , the Tory Morning Post ? afterwards the strongest supporter of Anglo-French military co-operation against Germany ? objected to the terms of the Entente on the ground that they represented a bad bargain for England ( April 11 , 1904 ) : Amazement is the only word which expresses the feelings with which we have read the account ... of the Agreement between the British and French Governments signed yesterday . ... Never in our recollection has Great Britain given away so much for nothing . If the idea is that France will be hereafter grateful for the advantages she has reaped by the Agreement , we can only say that gratitude between nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that is the calculation it condemns the Agreement . For if the Agreement were a good Agreement , gratitude would be equally due from Great Britain to France . The Entente was the turning-point in Anglo-German and Franco-German relations . After 1904 the alignment of forces for the holocaust of a decade later was set . From that year onwards the Anglo-German race in naval building began . But   much was to happen before the idea of English intervention in a European war became a " live " topic of English discussion . The drift to catastrophe was gradual . How far from universal was Germanophobia in 1905 can be seen from the Morning Post 's ( March 31 ) leader on the eve of the Kaiser 's visit to Tangier : The GERMAN EMPEROR is to arrive this mdrning at Tangier where he will have the same friendly reception as he has often had in this country . . . . The mere announcement of the intended visit caused a flutter in the political dovecotes . . . . Just before he left Bremen he made a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The Emperor said that as he had inherited from his mother a drop of good sea blood that had perhaps given direction to his conception of his task . The Empire of which he dreamed was to consist in the new German Empire 's enjoying on all sides the confidence given to a quiet , honourable and peaceful neighbour ... . We fail to see . . . any ground for offence . . . . The uneasiness caused by the GERMAN EMPEROR 'S movements is due to the fact that he represents a nation which is very strong on land , so that none of its neighbours would care to quarrel with it , which is creating a great navy and which , as its statesmen have preached to its people , thinks itself entitled to a full share of the good things of this world ? among them , trade , shipping and colonies .... The Germans are only anxious that righteousness , as they see it , should prevail and for that end they send their young men to barracks . . . . For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a feeling of aversion . ... The people of this country , whose feelings towards Germany had for centuries been those of uninterrupted goodwill and who had towards Germany an absolutely clear conscience , were as much surprised as they were wounded by the display of German hostility . They feel both insulted and hurt . . . . We have spoken plainly of the sentimental relations between this country and Germany because they account in large part for the suspicions with which German policy is regarded by many of our countrymen .   On the day these words were published the Kaiser made a speech at Tangier , and declared that Germany had " rightful claims " in Morocco . Commenting , next morning , the Daily Mail was pro-French , but not immoderately anti-German : The Kaiser yesterday paid his anxiously awaited visit to Tangier . . . . In a speech to the German Colony he laid emphasis on the integrity of Morocco . Probably the real aim of the Kaiser 's visit has been , as we have already suggested , to test the solidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless she shows greater deference to Germany , Germany will place serious obstacles in the path of French expansion .... On the present occasion , it need scarcely be said the sympathy of England is entirely with France ... . In the circumstances it is probable that the Kaiser 's visit will result in little more than a few orders for German firms from the Moroccan Government , but we should make a great mistake if we did not remember that our support of France will add to the prevalent feeling in Germany of unreasoning and unreasonable hostility towards England . A close understanding with France , however , is worth even this price . It would mark the official abandonment in Europe of the policy of " splendid isolation " which for so many years has damped the efforts of British statesmanship and which was terminated three years ago in Asia by the great alliance with Japan to which this nation still firmly holds . The Spectator ( April 8 ) , less emphatic about alliances , nevertheless agreed that France was behaving well and Germany badly : It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor in making all that fuss in Tangier was to give the French a very sharp snub . . . . It can not be denied that French opinion was both annoyed and alarmed by the demonstration at Tangier , but the mode adopted of displaying those feelings was unusually calm and dignified . . . . The French in fact were as placid and as firm as Teutons and Englishmen suppose themselves to be .... The main reason is this , they can trust the   Republican Government to do precisely what they wish and are consequently free from the fidgets which attack nervous nations as well as individuals . Uncertain how far England would support her in war with Germany over the question of Morocco , France agreed to a conference on the subject . The English Press grew increasingly critical of German diplomacy , as witness the Daily Mail of October 5 , 1905 : No sane Englishman will ever dream of attacking Germany and all must hope that war with her will be avoided . The feeling which exists between the two countries is important , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part . . . . Englishmen can not ignore the fact that an enormous German fleet is being created and massed in the North of Europe ready for instant action and that the movements of that fleet at the time of the North Sea incident i.e. , the Dogger Bank were most equivocal . These incipient suspicions in England of Germany 's intentions were fully reciprocated in the German Press of that period , and when England and Russia " buried the hatchet " in 1907 Germany 's fear of " encirclement " began to grow acute . But before that England had to take note of the December 1905 rising in Moscow . Here is the Spectator 's comment ( December 30 ) , expressing the Liberal idealistic viewpoint : In Moscow during the week a war has been raging between the revolutionaries and the Government which has had no parallel since the barricades of 1848 . . . . So far , the Government have had the better of the contest , but there is something terrible in the dumb , hopeless and yet unwavering courage with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead at between twelve and fifteen thousand . Many of the leaders are boys and women . They seem to have no fear . They are  | certainly only half-armed and yet they suffer themselves to be shot down with ironical scorn of death which must be taken as at once a proof of Slav fatalism and a measure of their wrongs . . . . We do not say that a policy of armed repression may not be successful . . . . But the tragedy of the thing is that many of the revolutionaries fight . . . for an honest ideal of civil liberty .... It has been assumed that France is the Power who has most to lose from anarchy in Russia , but for ourselves we think Germany likely to incur greater danger . Her Empire may gain a temporary advantage from the paralysis of the Dual Alliance between France and Russia but she must feel that a State in revolution is a dangerous neighbour . " Armed repression " did succeed ? for twelve years . Germany had to wait for the coming of Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a neighbour dangerous from the aspect of revolutionary propaganda . For the moment Anglo-German rivalry was the real issue in Europe . In 1905 England renewed and strengthened her alliance with Japan , and began conversations between naval staffs on " co-operation " with France in the event of European war . The German Navy Bill of May 1906 helped to arouse English mistrust . The Daily News ( May 25 ) endeavoured to pour oil on the troubled waters : When malicious attempts are made to breed suspicion of the German people , it is well to remember the relative power of the fleets . . . . If figures mean anything at all , they mean that our Navy is to the German navy as three to one . . . . Nor should it be forgotten that the strong position of this country in the friendship of the world is practically secured for a decade . Nevertheless official England was not reassured . The Channel Fleet was augmented ; the naval base at Rosyth planned ; and on August 31 , 1907 , England strengthened her defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influ- ence in the East . The Morning Post ( September 2 ) hailed the agreement as a welcome move in the anti-German game : The Agreement with Russia , following at no great interval of time the Agreement with France and the Treaty of Alliance with Japan , marks an advanced stage in the development of a new order of ideas . . . . The prejudice against Treaty obligations which dominated British foreign policy during the Gladstonian epoch has been succeeded by so strong a re-action in favour of Agreements that the original alliance with Japan , its renewal and extension at the close of the war , and the Agreement with France were received by the public with satisfaction . . . . It is the modern growth of Germany in population , in territory , in trade , in industry , in organisation for peace and war alike , that has brought about the change above noted in British sentiment . There is a vague feeling that Germany may in the twentieth century play the role that Spain played in the sixteenth and France in the seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ready to welcome any negotiations by which co-operation with other Powers for a common defence in case of need might be facilitated . The Liberal Daily News of the same date was critical , not because the Agreement might provoke hostility in Germany , but on account of the anti-democratic nature of Tsarist rule : We have never concealed our opinion that any extensive agreement with Russia at this moment is unnecessary and undesirable . Our relations with a Government at war with its own people ought to be as guarded and as limited as possible , not hostile but not intimate . . . . We should all welcome a friendship with Russia as intimate as our friendship with France as soon as Russia possesses like France a Government which has the confidence of the people it governs . Till then we should regard any intimate friendship as a treason to liberty .   It was not until a year later that the European " line-up " became , as we now see , finally settled , though at the time the development did not attract much attention in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bosnia and Herzegovina . The Spectator ( October 17 ) , with great prescience , underlined the significance of this step : It is curious to note how little attention is at present being paid to the influence of the Slavonic question on the Near East crisis . Yet no close observer of the facts can fail to realise that sooner or later this problem must play a large , perhaps a predominant , part . It is not merely the question of the future development of Turkey that is at stake , but the future political development of the Slays . Those Powers who take this fact into consideration , and shape their policy wisely in view of it , may expect to find their way out of the labyrinth . Those who ignore , or what is worse , misread the problem , may land themselves in untold difficulties and dangers . It is hardly necessary to point out that our words apply with special force to AustriaHungary . Since some 40 per cent . of the population of the dominions of Austria-Hungary are Slays , and since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a " seething pot " of Slavonic aspirations , and further since Austria-Hungary has raised the Slavonic problem in its acutest form by the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina ? their population is almost wholly Slavonic ? it is of vital importance to her to make no false step . Yet she has roused Slavonic animosities in a very acute form both within her own dominions and outside them . Not only is the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina deeply moved , but Servia and Montenegro have been driven to adopt an attitude of anger and suspicion . No doubt both these Powers are weak , but owing to their geographical position , and the possibility of their making common cause with Turkey , the situation she has created on her SouthEastern frontier is by no means pleasing for Austria-Hungary . Next , she has touched Russia at a very vital point and given   that Power grave reason for an enmity which can not but be a source of anxiety . The most remarkable fact about Russia since the close of the war with Japan and the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is once more getting back into the position of the champion of the Slav races , and therefore has been greatly stirred by the action of Austria-Hungary . In a word , Austria has set the whole Slavonic world by the ears , and yet she is the Power which could least afford to do so . The Spectator failed to attach sufficient importance to the fact that Austria-Hungary was acting with German support , but the warning that trouble might arise east of Vienna was prophetic . With England , France , and Russia aligned against Germany , Austria , and Italy , the stage was now set for the eventual conflict . The remainder of the prelude to catastrophe can be summarized briefly in terms of growing Anglo-German tension . On November 12 , 1910 , when the Tsar visited Potsdam and Germany was suspected in England of trying to buy Russia away from the Triple Entente , we find the Spectator ( now no longer as Liberal in tone as of old ) remarking : As Germany , or rather the ruling caste in Germany , wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy . . . she is naturally very much annoyed at the stiffening we have given to those Powers which are not already within the sphere of German domination . We are the obstacle to the success of German ambitions and aspirations just as we were the obstacle to the success of the Napoleonic aspirations . . . . Our Foreign Office and our diplomats . . . have never attempted to do anything which could be regarded as hemming Germany in unless , of course , keeping faith with France and Russia and protecting ourselves may be so described . Our action can only be described as hemming in , if the action of the lamb in drinking below where the wolf drank could be called fouling the water and making it undrinkable for the wolf .   Six months later , when Germany replied to an English inquiry as to the possibility of a naval agreement that the German Navy could not be reduced without political concessions , the same journal observed ( May 20 , 1911 ) : We have , of course , no quarrel with Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every bit as much right to do as we have . But when that navy is held in reserve at the back of an unsettled but ambitious policy , we can not help regarding Germany as the most disturbing element in the European family . There is an inevitable conflict of ideals between Germany and Great Britain , between the satisfied nation and the unsatisfied nation , between the nation which desires to maintain the status quo and the nation which desires to alter it . The dispatch of the small German cruiser Panther to Agadir in July of that year added fuel to the flames . On the news that Germany declined to withdraw the Panther except in return for concessions from France , the Daily Mail ( July 21 ) gave as its view : The concessions demanded from France by Germany in Africa are so preposterous as to leave no doubt that the real purpose of the Kaiser 's Government is to make another test of the strength of the Entente between Great Britain and France . ... Germany has announced her intention to remain at Agadir unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is allowed to remain in possession of this Moorish port , the Entente Cordiale will prove its inherent weakness . . . . The German Government must be made to understand that its real purpose is known and doomed to absolute failure . The Morning Post next day hinted openly at the possibility of war : The German Government is either proposing to set half of Europe in a blaze on the chance of what she can get or is   trading on the general desire for peace to get something by threats . . . . If the solidarity between England and France should not be complete , the result must be to prove that there is no independent Power in Europe except Germany . Every Power will hereafter have to do as Germany wishes and will hold its lands during Germany 's pleasure . If England and France stand together there is the chance that they may be called upon to seal their accord by co-operation in a great struggle of which the end can not be foreseen except by faith . The Liberal Press , as exemplified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bellicose , though a caveat was entered that the Entente with France was not an alliance binding England to fight : In this business the parties first concerned are Germany and France . . . . It is clear that we have no treaty obligation to come in and take sides with France . An entente is not a defensive alliance . Equally it seems clear that we can not be indifferent to such a destruction of the balance of power or such a breach in the comity of Europe , which rests on the assumption that no Power is in a position to dictate absolutely to the others . No one can discuss with more reluctance even the bare possibility of a rupture in Anglo-German friendship but it would be folly to mislead German opinion at such a juncture or to obscure the fact that when Mr. Lloyd George spoke on Friday he spoke for the nation . Since Mr. Lloyd George had declared in his speech at the Mansion House that if Germany treated England as of " no account in the Cabinet of nations , " then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humiliation , " the Englishman " in the street , " for whom he spoke , was presumably thinking pretty hard in terms of war . Actually , pace the Press , he was not : he was thinking of August Bank Holiday . This time , however , the danger of war passed ; by November , France and Germany had reached an agreement ; Germany retired from Morocco in return   for a small extension of the Cameroons . But the tension in Europe remained . One final attempt at improving Anglo-German relations has to be recorded . In February 1912 Lord Haldane , the then Secretary of State for War , visited Berlin . He urged a naval truce , but was confronted with a German counter-demand that England should be neutral in the event of a European war . The visit was ineffectual , but the Spectator 's comment ( February 17 ) has a melancholy interest for the cynically-minded : All the indications point to the fact that Lord Haldane 's visit to Berlin has been useful . . . . Lord Haldane , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how perfectly pacific are our words and objects and how willing we should be to help Germany to get that place in the sun which she is said to desire , provided we could do it without sacrificing our own essential interests or the interests of any powers in alliance or agreement with us . . . . What we should like if it were possible would be to see the greater part of the African possessions of Portugal pass . . . into Germany 's hands and also on equally just and friendly terms a portion of the Belgian Congo . A further increase in the German Navy was voted in May , and in July an Anglo-French pact of naval co-operation in case of war was concluded . The success of the Serbs in their war with Turkey in 1912 increased the risk of an anti-Austrian ( or rather an anti-Teutonic ) Balkan League under Russian leadership . The atmosphere throughout the year 1913 remained explosive . A great many Englishmen had been reading novels and feuilletons whose central theme was a German invasion of England . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards executed by the Irish Free State for his too uncom- promising hatred of English Imperialism ) ; W. Le Queux 's tale of German invaders ; and a novel called simply War ! in which the Germans made cavalry charges through Essex and ( if our memory serves us ) offered violence to one young lady of good family . Lord Roberts was preaching the need for conscription to meet the German menace . War phychoses had been induced in certain circles without a war . Indeed , in one case a mass hallucination comparable with the later story of the Angels at Mons was produced . On February 24 , 1913 , the Daily Mail reported that " many witnesses " testified to the presence of a German airship over the Northeast coast , and on February 28 the Whitby Gazette ran a news story carrying the following headlines : WANTED : AN AIR MINISTER ENGLAND AT GERMANY 'S MERCY NORTHEAST COAST SURVEYED NIGHTLY BY DIRIGIBLES FURTHER APPEARANCES OF AIRSHIP AT WHITBY We quote these headlines from Mr. G. Dangerfield 's book The Strange Death of Liberal England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these alarming reports , which was nothing more than " a farmer wheeling a creaking wheelbarrow loaded with manure along a hilltop ; a light swinging from a broomstick , which had been tied to the wheelbarrow , guided his footsteps through the dark . " While these and similar fantasies occupied the minds of a portion of the country , real danger clouds were massing in a part of the world most Englishmen had never heard of . On June 28 , 1914 , the fatal match was struck : Francis Ferdinand , heir to the Crown of Austria-Hungary , and his wife were assassinated at Sarajevo , the capital of Bosnia , by Austrian subjects of Serb descent .   At first the English newspapers , as the following typical extracts show , were not alarmed by the possibility of international repercussions . The Times first ( June 29 , 1914 ) : Their assassination has produced horror and consternation throughout Europe ... . We can not yet estimate the full consequences of yesterday 's tragedy at Sarajevo upon the future of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is at first supposed . . . . The larger and more immediate question is that of the possible results of the assassination upon the Southern Slays and their hopes and ideals . . . . The more the Southern Slays see their hopes recede , the greater will be the danger of an ultimate explosion . Already they grow restive under repression , and if their dreams are thwarted in one direction they may turn to another . For the moment the horror of the assassinations engrosses thought , but the future must assuredly bring fresh clouds to the outlook in AustriaHungary . Now the Manchester Guardian ( June 29 , 1914 ) : The Austrian Royal House has had enough tragedies in its history and fate might well have spared it another . It was not to be . The ARCH DUKE FRANCIS FERDINAND , nephew of the EMPEROR FRANCIS JOSEPH and heir to the throne has been most cruelly murdered at Sarajevo and his wife the DUCHESS of HOHENBERG has shared his fate . . . . It is a difficult and at present an ungracious task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have on Austrian politics . ... It must be remembered that Austria during the EMPEROR 'S reign has ceased to be a purely German State . His great achievement is that he has accomplished the change from a German Emperor to a King of each of the various nationalities which compose the Austrian Empire without bringing   himself or his country to ruin . Not many men have the key to this silent revolution , but in few countries does so much depend on the character of the monarch as in the welter of nationalities which compose the Austrian Empire . Next day the Daily Mail expressed confidence that the Emperor could " be trusted to handle the situation wisely , to resist the extremists and to realize that a policy of reconciliation will be the noblest monument to the sacrifice of the dead . " Francis Ferdinand and his murdered wife were to have a monument rich in hecatombs of men then living , but England , preoccupied with the Ulster crisis , did not begin until July 24 to take a really serious view of the situation . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been delivered . The Daily Mail of July 24 observed judicially : The situation which has arisen between Austria-Hungary and Servia out of the crime of Sarajevo is admittedly disquieting . But it is necessary to steer a straight course between excessive alarm and undue optimism . . . . As for the Austrian Note to Servia . . . Count Berchtold will do well to proceed cautiously . Nothing could be more fatal than to create the impression that Austria-Hungary is not so much seeking the satisfaction of its just demands as the humiliation of a rival . Count Berchtold may be assured of the unanimous support of the Powers for demands that do not exceed what one independent Power may legitimately demand of another . On the same day the Manchester Guardian recorded its satisfaction that on the previous evening in Parliament Mr. Lloyd George ( foreshadowing later promises equally unfulfilled by him ) had expressed on the question of armaments hopes of improvement that were " more than mere pious aspirations . He all but promised a reduction for next year . "   In the last fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trace the divergent threads of opinion through the Tory and Liberal Press . In the Tory camp the Morning Post on July 27 was demanding that England should be ready to intervene in the interests of " right " and her own " prestige . " The impression that England is paralysed or divided against herself or indifferent to the fate of her neighbours or to the cause of right is completely erroneous . . . . It is essential to the highest interests of this country that Great Britain should maintain her place and her prestige among the nations of the world . National honour is no party question . If , therefore , matters are pushed , as we devoutly hope they will not be , to extremes , England must take her place by the side of those who are . . . to be thrown into the vortex of war . . . . The question of peace or war for England , as for the other Powers , can not be dismissed on the ground that England has no vital interests in Servia . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality and right in Europe and in the maintenance of her own character . " Stand by France " was the Morning Post 's exhortation on July 31 : The nation is not bellicose ; it has no desire for war . It has no enmity to gratify . Its watchword in the hour of crisis is duty . The national instinct we believe to be that England must stand by France . . . . The Government would be supported in any action aiming at peace which was seen to be consistent with the settled purpose of wholehearted support for France if she did have to go to war . In the unhappy event of war , the essential thing is that England should be decided and act immediately . There is nothing more dangerous in modern wars than waiting to see which way the balance inclines and then taking part in the struggle .   The Times , as early as July 25 , had expressed doubts whether , in view of Russia 's attitude , the crisis between Austria-Hungary and Servia could be " localised . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace with honour , " but it warned Germany that England would support her friends : We publish this morning the full text of the Servian reply to the Austro-Hungarian Note . In view of its moderation the way to a peaceful settlement ought to stand open . . . . Peace , indeed , is the first interest of the Entente and the first interest of England . Both will spare no efforts to preserve it . But any plans which may be based on the assumption that the policy of either has changed or is likely to change are doomed to disappointment and failure . Our friendships are firm as our aims are free from all suspicion of aggression . Should there arise in any quarter a desire to test our adhesion to the principles which inform our friendships and that guarantee the balance of power in Europe , we shall be found no less ready to vindicate them with the whole strength of the Empire than we have been found whenever they have been tried in the past . . . . England will not hesitate to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the testimony of its Berlin correspondent , Germany was " certainly quite sincerely working for peace , " but on July 30 it admitted that Europe was " on the verge of a war more general and more terrible than even the Great War of a hundred years ago . . . . If France is menaced , or the safety of the Belgian frontier , we shall know how to act . " On the following day the Times asked for " stout hearts " in the joint causes of " honour " and " our own security . " Nothing in all that has occurred can modify the attitude of England . In a few hours we may learn that Germany has fulfilled the unuttered menace which underlies her enquiries in St. Petersburg and has issued orders for mobilisation . France   will undoubtedly follow this example by placing her army upon a war footing as rapidly as possible . In that event our duty is plain . We must make instant preparations to back our friends if they are made the subject of unjust attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . . . an elementary duty of self-preservation . The days of " Splendid Isolation , " if they ever existed , are no more . We can not stand alone in a Europe dominated by any single power , or any single group of powers . . . . It is not merely honour which bids us be true to our friends . It is consideration for our own welfare and our own security . Were we to show weakness or pusillanimity now none would trust us again . . . . We shall still work on for peace ; work on for it to the very end ; but the hour has come when we shall have to make instant preparation for war . The angel of death is abroad . We " may almost hear the beating of his wings . " He " may yet spare us and pass on . " But if he indeed visits those with whom we stand , we must pay our share of the fell tribute with stout hearts . Turning to the Liberal Press , we find the Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer brutality " Russia 's threat to support Servia by armed force against Austria . It urged Sir Edward Grey , the Foreign Secretary , " not to destroy our influence for good in Europe by marching into the camp of the Dual Alliance , or for that matter into any camp . " On July 28 it declared : We want peace in Europe , but we want England to be and remain at peace even more . We wish that all Englishmen would say and think the same . Most of them certainly do . But there are some who , while anxious for European peace , still think that while we can not share the blessings of peace with others we must share with them the curses of war . " Should there arise in any quarter , " wrote the Times of yesterday , " a desire to test our adhesion to the principles which inform our friendships and that guarantee the balance of power in Europe , we shall be found no less ready to vindicate them with   the whole strength of the Empire than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . " This is mediation with the shirt-sleeves rolled up . It is something far more serious , for it seems to mean that if Germany , Russia and France start fighting , we must start too . The whole future of England depends on the suppression of that spirit . It is war to the knife between it and Liberalism . Either it kills us or we kill it . As late as July 30 the Manchester Guardian was still pleading for English neutrality : Let us for a moment drop solicitude for Europe and think of ourselves . . . . We care as little for Belgrade as Belgrade cares for Manchester . But though our neutrality ought to be assured , it is not . SIR EDWARD GREY walks deliberately past opportunities of saying that we will be neutral in the quarrels of Europe . . . . If Russia makes a general war out of a local war , it will be a crime against Europe . If we , who might remain neutral , rush into the war or let our attitude remain doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supreme and gratuitous folly , The Liberal Daily News awoke only on July 27 to the gravity of the position : The suddenness with which the crisis has come upon us is only apparent . This country has been too much pre-occupied with its own domestic struggle i.e. , Ulster to follow with close attention the course of events on the Continent , but those events have for weeks past pointed with increasing menace in the direction of war . . . . Together , Germany and France , Italy and England must be able to save Europe from the threatened calamity . It can only be done by a surrender on the part of Servia , and by a reasonable limitation of Austria 's demands .   Up till the last the Daily News was as insistent as the Manchester Guardian that England should remain neutral . On July 29 it denounced the idea of sacrificing British lives to build up a Slav hegemony in the Balkans : Will it be isolated ? That is the question which is in every mind in Europe today . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into such a quarrel . . . . The suggestion that we should spend British lives and British treasure to establish Russia in the Balkans would be an inconceivable outrage to a democratic country . Our hands are free in this business and we must take care to keep them free . Let us work zealously to preserve the peace ; but let us remember that the most effective work for peace that we can do is to make it clear that not a British life shall be sacrificed for the sake of a Russian hegemony of the Slav world , Once more , on July 30 , it urged that : The free peoples of France , England and Italy should refuse to be drawn into this dynastic struggle . We must not have our Western civilisation submerged in a sea of blood in order to wash out a Servian conspiracy . Based as they were on the assumption that the real cases belli lay in a Balkan dispute remote from England 's interests , these Liberal pleas for neutrality were drowned in the rattle of German mobilization and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " honour " and " our own security " became conveniently merged . The sixteen years ' prelude which had seen England drawn once more into the " balance-of-power " politics which had forced her sons to die at Badajoz and Waterloo was over .
