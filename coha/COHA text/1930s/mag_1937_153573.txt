James Rowland Angell last fortnight ceremoniously completed a distinguished lifetime of service to U. S. education when he bestowed an honorary LL.D . on his friend Cordell Hull at his 16th and last commencement as president of Yale University . Three years younger than Secretary Hull , President Angell was bowing gracefully to Yale 's rule that all faculty-men must retire at 68 . All year Dr. Angell , who is lively as a cricket despite what he calls his " obvious and offensive senility , " has made no bones of the fact that he was looking for another job . Last week he announced that he had accepted one , full-time and full-sized , as the first Educational Counsellor of National Broadcasting Co . <P> What NBC 's President Lenox Lohr wanted was " imaginative and efficient guidance " in a field which stands as much in need of an organizing genius as did the cinema industry when it hired Will Hays 15 years ago . Educators have long been unsatisfied with the radio as an educational medium . Two years ago they gave the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fess and Wagner-Hatfield bills calling for a Federal allocation of wave bands for educational purposes . This year NBC is devoting a record total of 4,360 hours , 44% of the network 's total broadcasting time , to a miscellany of speeches , lectures , concerts , meetings , all labelled " educational programs . " Most of these are " sustaining " ( non-sponsored ) and of widely varying quality . When schoolmen and radiomen met last year at the call of the U. S. Office of Education and the Federal Communications Commission for a conference on educational broadcasting in Washington , upshot was that educators wanted more radio time , networks wanted better programs . This week Counsellor Angell will sit down with Lenox Lohr to learn about his new job which starts in September , and to which he will bring the administrative experience not only of a University president but of a onetime ( 1920-21 ) president of the Carnegie Corporation . For his services Counsellor Angell will receive exactly what he was reputed to receive from Yale , $25,000 a year .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
