Last October the New York Times headlined a story : ALEKHINE 'S MOVE STIRS CHESS FANS . This was no arrant sensationalism . Dutchman Max Euwe , chess champion of the world , was defending his title against One-time Champion Alexandre Alekhine . The move in question occurred in Haarlem during the sixth game of a 30-game peregrinating match ( played in The Hague , Rotterdam , Amsterdam , Haarlem , Leyden , Delft ) . Dr. Alekhine opened with a queen 's gambit and was met by a Slav defense . On his sixth move Dr. Alekhine suddenly offered to sacrifice a knight . Dr. Euwe nibbled his fingers and stared at the board , nonplussed . A sacrifice so early in the game , in that position , was unheard of . He brooded for 40 minutes , then decided not to accept the sacrifice . The move he made instead was a bad one . Dr. Alekhine won the sixth game , and Dr. Euwe 's intellectual processes were disrupted . He lost three of the next four games before he recovered from the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up to the 25th game , Challenger Alekhine had won nine games , Champion Euwe four , and eleven were drawn . If Dr. Alekhine were to win the 25th game he would clinch the match ( 15 points to 9 ) and the remaining five games would be merely exhibitions . Played in The Hague before a large gallery of chess experts , the game ended after 43 moves when Dr. Euwe resigned , relaxed , reached his hand across the board to congratulate his opponent . After two months of play . Dr. Alexandre Alekhine , Russian-born Parisian , had regained the world 's chess championship he won in 1927 from Cuban Jose Capablanca , lost in 1935 to Dr. Euwe ( TIME , Dec. 30 , 1935 ) .
