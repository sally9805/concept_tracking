As advertisers well know , women buy far more body deodorants than men do . Yet it is equally well known that , while women merely glow , the same occasions put men in a downright sweat . This damp fact has been experimentally confirmed by Dr. James Daniel Hardy and his co-workers at Manhattan 's Russell Sage Institute of Pathology . Last week they announced their findings-appropriately enough , at a symposium of temperature held by the American Institute of Physics . <P> Testing normal men and women in a hotbox , the Hardy crew found that the women did not begin to perspire until the temperature of their skins was two degrees higher than " the threshold of sweating " in the men . This holding back is due to a more flexible metabolism in women , which simply slows down their internal heat production in hot weather . <P> Women have another advantage , according to Dr. Hardy , which enables them to stand cold better than men- " a thicker insulating layer of superficial tissue " ( vulgar translation : blubber ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cool room than a man with a light suit of clothes on. * Result of these superior adaptations both to heat and to cold is that the temperature range of the " comfort zone " is twice as wide for women as for men . <P> * Female imperviousness to cold has also been attributed , in part , to the fortifying effect of female hormones.
