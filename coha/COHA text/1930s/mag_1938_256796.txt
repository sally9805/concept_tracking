Day after day in Vienna last week , Theodor Cardinal Innitzer stayed indoors . Hollow-eyed , bewildered , unhappy , warned by police not to stir outside lest the sight of him " provoke " angry Viennese , he secluded himself in his archiepiscopal palace near St. Stephen 's Cathedral . <P> Vienna 's Archbishop was bewildered , and no wonder . After Anschluss he had attempted to temporize with Nazis , had been given the backhanded accolade of " a reasonable man " by the pagan Nazi ideologist , Dr. Alfred Rosenberg . Suddenly , last fortnight , Cardinal Innitzer 's palace was sacked by an obviously stage-managed Nazi mob . Last week the Cardinal was , to Viennese Nazis , a " black dog , " a " traitor , " a " political priest . " To the rest of the Catholic world he was a hero . All this was because he had advised Ostmark Catholics to proclaim their faith , and had spoken up for religious marriages , religious education of Catholic youth . <P> Although 90% of its people are Catholic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna 's most famed characteristic has long been " Schlamperei " ( slackness ) , and probably no more than 40% of Austrians are practicing Catholics . In Vienna last week , good Catholics worshiped timidly under the eyes of police , who also watched narrowly those who read their church bulletin boards , pasted with posters urging them to marry in the church . In his palace Cardinal Innitzer switched on his radio , listened to an open-air rally at which 100,000 Nazis shouted " Pfui Innitzer ! " and " Hang the black dog ! " during a furious speech by Nazi Commissioner Josef Brckel . Calling the Cardinal a friend of Jews , burly Herr Brckel declared that negotiations with the Catholics to settle the matter of religious schools and seminaries-hitherto kept secret-were definitely off . Cardinal Innitzer switched off his radio , retired to his chapel to pray . <P> That night the Cardinal could hear the mob gathering again in St. Stephen 's Square . He did not look out to see their fireworks or watch them brandish miniature gibbets . But he heard their shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adolf Hitler 's Vlkischer Beobachter ( Vienna edition ) " exposed " for its readers the Church 's wealth , declaring : " In showy palaces and proud strongholds live the earthly managers of Divine property , who draw from their business enterprises rich rewards .
