Life is held cheaply in the island nations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic . For the bloody border massacres of last October ( TIME , Nov. 1 ) in which , Haitians allege , some 12,000 of their countrymen were butchered when they crossed into Dominican territory , the Dominican Government agreed to pay Haiti $750,000 . Last week the first installment , a check for $250,000 , was delivered and the balance promised $100,000 at a time . The money will be doled out to refugees and to families of the massacred 12,000 , who were thus valued at $62.50 per head .
