When 13-month-old Barbara Stobie 's protruding abdomen grew so big that she seemed ready to give birth to a baby of her own , her young mother , wife of a southern Oregon timber worker , finally took her to a local doctor . He suggested that the baby go to the Doernbecher Memorial Hospital which the State of Oregon maintains in Portland as an adjunct of the University of Oregon medical school . There the blonde little caricature of motherhood underwent an X-ray examination a fortnight ago . This revealed to the dumbfounded staff of the hospital that Barbara Stobie was indeed carrying a child . Plainly visible were part of its bony skull , spine , arms , legs . <P> Last week Barbara Stobie was delivered of this monstrosity . As an artist and photographers recorded the scene , Surgeon Clarence William Brunkow made a seven-inch incision from the tip of her breast bone past the left of her navel . Lying horizontally within her abdomen , between the top of her stomach and her spine , was a skin-like sac .

Another nick of a scalpel freed Barbara Stobie of her ab normal burden and permitted Dr. Brunkow to close her up . He left the skin-like sac within her , to be removed at some more favorable time . <P> As it lay in an enameled operating-room tray , the fetus seemed to be that of a boy . It measured seven inches and had patches of infant 's down on its torso . It lacked a face , had part of a brain . Its right foot had six webbed toe buds , its left foot four . Its arms , fastened to its sides , had webbed finger buds . Fingers and toes had rudiments of nails . As Barbara Stobie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter of the University of Oregon medical school took the monstrous fetus to his laboratory to learn what was inside ( a three months job ) and to guess at how the brother ovum , from which it developed got inside the embryo which became Barbara Stobie 13 months ago .
