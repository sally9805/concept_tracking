txt Governor Davey , storm centre of charges of corruption and fraud in the administration of Federal relief funds in Ohio , brought a hectic day to a climax by appearing tonight before the joint convention of the General Assembly and defending himself against the charges made by Harry L. Hopkins . Federal Relief Administrator , with the approval of President Roosevelt . Late tonight after a series of legislative conferences the Senate adopted and sent to the House a resolution calling for an investigation by a committee of five members from each branch of all phases of relief since the establishment of the State Relief Commission in 1933 . Proposals that Attorney General Bricker conduct the inquiry and that the investigating committee be nonpartisan were rejected . In a dramatic speech to the legislators the Governor demanded a complete investigation and in President Roosevelt 's own words added , " Let the chips fall where they may . " Previously the Governor had motored to Newark , thirty miles distant from Columbus , where he filed charges of criminal libel against Mr. Hopkins . Francis Canny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that he would defend Mr. Hopkins and that he would begin at once an investigation to determine if Federal statutes had been violated in the administration of relief funds . Legislators Hear Governor . The Governor requested a special session of the Assembly in the hall of the House and the request was promptly granted . In his speech he said in part : " Last year I arrived at the age of 50 . I have spent all of my life trying to build a reputation for honor and integrity and to be a useful citizen of my country . Never , until the scurrilous campaign of 1934 , did any one ever raise a question about my honorable performance as a citizen or public servant . " The campaign against me last year was the most brutal and unsportsmanlike affair in the modern history of Ohio politics . But , in spite of it all , a majority of the voting citizens chose me as their Governor , and charged me with the grave responsibilities of that office . I have been striving as honestly and courageously as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Hopkins , a high official of the Federal Government , and seeks , by implication and innuendo , to cast the gravest reflection upon my personal integrity . He did not dare express directly the thoughts that he tried by steady effort to create by inference . His letter , given out for publication last Saturday afternoon and in the Sunday papers , is one of the most dastardly efforts to besmirch an innocent man in the history of this republic . " The highest privilege of an American citizen is to rise in defense of his good name . This I do tonight . And I do it with a feeling of deep indignation against a base and foul character assassin . " For this purpose , I proceeded to Newark , Ohio , early this morning and swore out a warrant for Mr , Hopkins 's arrest on the charge of criminal libel . The warrant has been issued . I am ready and eager for trial . I want the people of Ohio and the nation to know the truth , and the quicker the better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who is guilty of criminal libel , goes to trial , there will be a wave of popular indignation against his nefarious and cowardly action the like a which we have seldom seen . " Not a single change will be made in the Ohio relief program from what it was last week , unless they decide to dispense with the services of Mr. Walls and unless they find some of their own employes guilty of wrongdoing . " It has been reported to me that three of their employes are about to be discharged or permitted to resign . May I call your attention to the fact that the unnamed sins and the unnamed sinners to which Mr. Hopkins referred in his unscrupulous letter to me , were a part of the regime of the great General Henderson , under the administration of my predecessor . " It may be recalled that General Henderson was very unfriendly to me and every one associated with me . It may be recalled , also , that Mr. Hopkins seemed to be anxious to keep General Henderson . Whatever happened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If any one in that regime is guilty of wrongdoing , wily does not Mr. Hopkins prosecute him ? I challenge him to clean house . " Governor Davey devoted a large part of his address to a criticism of the relief administration . He attacked " young college students clad in tura , " who , he said , were experimenting rather than attempting to allay hunger . He criticized enormous expenditures for fancy pamphlets and read extracts from the Cleveland Welfare Guild leaflet , which , he said , proved relief workers considered that they had " permanent jobs . " Criticizes Recovery Status . " Does it not seem to you rather significant that the national recovery program is now two years old , and that more people are on relief than at the beginning of the relief program ? " he added . " As a good Democrat , and as a supporter of the President , I hesitate to say this . " But it is necessary to do so in order to make this case complete . These significant facts mean one of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or there is something wrong with relief as it is administered . I think it is the latter . There is plenty of evidence of improving business conditions . And yet the careless , wasteful re-lief program goes merrily on toward ! an unknown goal , and with expanding proportions . " He reviewed Ohio 's need for additional revenue of $30,000,000 or $40 , - 000,000 . Of the total $15,000,000 was needed to meet the Federal demand for the State 's relief quota . " I have been fighting for certain great principles , " he continued . " I would hold myself in contempt if I failed to do so . This is a battle for humane and common-sense procedure , for the elimination of highpowered theorists and for the destruction of waste and inefficiency . I would be willing to fight alone , but it is not necessary . The people of Ohio are with me in this great undertaking . It is a battle for them , and for great principles . I shall fight on , ladies and gentleman , and I welcome your earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Message Sent to Hopkins . At the time he announced the issuance of the warrant , the Governor released a message which he had sent to Mr. Hopkins . He read it tonight to the General Assembly as a part of his address . The message read in part : " I realize that you can not be extradited for this offense but I challenge you to come to Ohio , submit to arrest , and try this case in open court . If you fail or refuse to do so , you will be guilty of the lowest form of cowardice by hitting below the belt and running . You have done me a great and unforgivable wrong and if you have any of the instincts of manhood you will permit this wrong to be righted . " This alleged , but unnamed , wrongdoing on the part of some one connected with the Democratic committee , according to your own letter , took place before the inauguration while I was still a private citizen . During that time I was almost never in Columbus . During the period directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking some much-needed rest . I had absolutely nothing to do with the inauguration in any detail . " I have absolutely no knowledge of the financial affairs of the State committee , nor how the campaign deficit or the cost of the inauguration were financed , except I was told there was a deficit . The money , energy and ability of the State committee were used for all candidates , including the election of a Democratic Senator and eighteen Democratic members of Congress " Furthermore , during the period to which you refer , the relief program of Ohio was under the control of General Henderson , who is unfriendly to me and the State committee . Every official and employe of the relief organization in Ohio was appointed by him , and , I assume , with the full approval of - four own Federal agents in Columbus . Not one of them was under the slightest obligations to any one except to General Henderson and yourself . Says Federal Agents Ruled . " This same condition existed until Feb. 1 , two weeks after the inauguration , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed State Relief Director . I have never spoken to him nor to any one connected with the Relief Administration regarding any kind of business whatsoever . I have never recommended the hiring or discharging of a single individual and have left the relief program severely alone . " You know as well as I do that your agents in Columbus have been the absolute dictators of everything in the relief program of Ohio . Not a single move could be made without their approval . Several weeks ago I asked you to admit publicly the truth , that you and you alone were running it . I demanded that your name be put on the front door as general manager , so that you would take the blame publicly for everything that was happening and not hide behind the scenes . " I have charged repeatedly that the relief program in Ohio is very wasteful , inefficient and many times inhuman . These are the charges that you seek to evade . You might have found a more decent and manly way to evade the issues and not resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these charges , Mr. Hopkins . Your administration of relief is wasteful . It is inefficient . It is many times inhuman . I will go further this time and charge that , to a large extent , it is a violation of the most sacred right of American citizens ; that is , the inviolability of private family affairs . This is done through your professional young case workers , who have become a pack or inquisitors , going to the homes of their victims with a grocery order in one hand and their inexcusable intrusion into the private affairs of helpless people in the other .
