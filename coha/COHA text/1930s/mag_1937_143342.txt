Fortnight ago plain-speaking General Hugh Samuel Johnson was prepared to broadcast to the nation an address on " Public Enemies 1 &; 2-the two Social or Venereal Diseases called Syphilis &; Gonorrhea . " When his time came to speak , General Johnson simply growled to an estimated 17,000,000 NBC listeners : <P> " I came to the studio tonight prepared with a speech in support of Surgeon General Parran of the United States Public Health Service in his crusade against social diseases . A few minutes before I was to go on the air , I was informed that the discussion was not in accord with the policies of the National Broadcasting Co . Thank you , and good night . " <P> Soft orchestra music filled the rest of the 15 minutes for which Groves Bromo Quinine ( for colds ) had hired General Johnson to radiorate . General Johnson proceeded to a grill room on the 65th floor of the broadcasting building and heard NBC 's president , Major Lenox Riley Lohr explain why General Johnson 's brand of plain speaking was , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthright for radio consumption . <P> Last week , to avoid imputations of unhealthy prudery , NBC did broadcast a speech on the same topic by Dr. Morris Fishbein , spokesman and editor of the American Medical Association . The Fishbein speech , therefore , offered an example of what is now considered the proper phraseology in which social diseases may be discussed on the air . Excerpts : <P> " All of us ought to know that there is not just one , there are several diseases affecting the organs and tissues of men and women concerned in childbirth or in intimate personal relations . Most of these diseases are spread by human contacts . Occasionally , these infections are acquired innocently . . . . The vast majority of cases of infection with the venereal diseases represent intimate contacts . . . . <P> " In industry , the costs of venereal disease are tremendous . It has been estimated that from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 workers lose 21,000,000 working days each year at an average cost of $4 per day , as a result of infection with these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases were often considered incurable . . . . To-day scientific medicine , combining its efforts with those of public health officials , is beginning an organized , sustained campaign against the venereal diseases , a campaign in which the public is participating on a tremendous scale . Throughout the country , women 's clubs , the junior chambers of commerce , and similar organizations are aiding in dissemination of knowledge . Intelligent people are voluntarily submitting themselves to Wassermann tests as examples to others . "
