MY LIFE As A REBEL-Angelica Balabanoff-Harper ( $3.75 ) . <P> Thirty-four years ago , an ardent young Russian girl named Angelica Balabanoff spoke at a Socialist meeting in Lausanne , Switzerland . It was no new experience for her . She had left her comfortable , stuffy , middle-class home at 17 ; studied at Brussels , Berlin , Rome ; joined the Italian Socialist Party ; edited a women 's paper . As a speaker she had been cheered by radicals and chased by reactionaries until she lost all self-consciousness on the platform . But during her speech at Lausanne , she was distracted by the most wretched-looking human being who had ever appeared in her audiences-an agitated , unkempt , timid man with bitter eyes and a large jaw , who twisted his hat nervously . Angelica was so disturbed that after the meeting she spoke to him . He was sick , starving , and had fled Italy to escape military service . Angelica volunteered to help him , asked his name . " Benito Mussolini . " he replied . <P> Mussolini was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long revolutionary life , but none of the others-Trotsky , Stalin , Zinoviev. the Russian Revolutionist Georgy Plekhanov , Karl Radek-renounced his beliefs so completely . Nor did Angelica work so closely with the others as with Mussolini in the days when the future dictator was editor of the Italian Socialist Party 's central newspaper . Her picture of him- brooding , explosive , egocentric , enigmatic , alternately violent and timid-is the most interesting part of My Life as a Rebel , which is a long ( 324 pages ) record of defeats and betrayals , written with a quiet stoicism unique in angry revolutionary literature . <P> Although Angelica Balabanoff tells many a damaging story about famed revolutionists , harshly criticizes the Soviet Union , her book gives no comfort to conservatives . At Lenin 's insistence she became first secretary of the Third International . But intrigues , double-dealing - principally by Zinoviev - and unscrupulous measures taken to discredit opponents soon disillusioned her . No hero-worshiper , she considers Lenin chiefly responsible for the weaknesses of the modern revolutionary movement , says she often remonstrated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would stare at her " with an expression which was more sad than sardonic " and ask , " Comrade Angelica , what use can life make of you ? " like a father addressing a naive child . <P> Lenin , she says , could control Zinoviev , Radek , Trotsky , but she insists that he disliked Zinoviev , despised cynical Radek , whom she calls a vulgar politician , and distrusted Trotsky 's ambition . As for Stalin , she says he was so little known in 1919 that nobody had any attitude toward him . Her version of Bolshevik history is that Lenin employed Zinoviev to split the labor movement of other countries by all manner of intrigue , that such methods became habitual , were employed by Trotsky as much as by Stalin , led to recent Russian trials . Although Angelica Balabanoff has not lost her faith in Socialism , believes that " the international labor movement can be built again , " her disappointments make a melancholy record .               @ @ @ @ @ @
