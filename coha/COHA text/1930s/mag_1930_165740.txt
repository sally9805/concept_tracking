A NOTE IN MUSIC-Rosamond Lehmann-Holt ( $2.50 ) . <P> Grace was a big woman , nearly middleaged , not pretty , a messy dresser . But her husband Tom , fussy fat clerk in an English provincial town , loved her in his own way , realized vaguely she was of finer mould than he . Grace 's only child had been born dead , she could never have another . She had almost given up expecting anything to happen . She ate too many chocolates , went too often to the cinema . Then one day she met young Hugh Miller , nephew of Tom 's boss . Hugh was an aristocrat who did everything well , even wandering . They met only a few times . He thought she was queer but rather nice , soon forgot her when he went away . Her memory of him lasted the rest of her life . <P> On this thin thread of realism Rosamond Lehmann has strung pearls . <P> Rosamond Lehmann , young ( under 30 ) , is the wife of Painter Wogan Phillips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the staff of Punch , but better known as one of England 's most famed oarsmen . Rosamond Lehmann has written one other book : Dusty Answer .
