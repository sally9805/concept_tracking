One day 336 years before Christ was born , old man Diogenes was sunbathing on a Corinthian hillside . Beside him was the tub in which he lived , and his only real friend , a mangy dog . Suddenly a chariot charged up , out of which stepped an elegant , arrogant young man with ruddy cheeks , melting eyes , hair like a lion 's . <P> " I am Alexander , the King , " said the youth . <P> " And I am Diogenes , the Cynic , " said the old man , scarcely looking up . <P> " Is there anything I can do for you ? " asked Alexander . <P> " Yes , " said Diogenes . " Do n't stand there between me and the sun . " <P> Alexander the Great was tickled by the philosopher 's request , but it did not keep him from spending the rest of his short life elbowing others out of the best place in the sun . His romantic ambition drove him , leading victorious armies , from Macedonia up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troy , down through Asia Minor to defeat Darius and his Persians , on to Egypt , to India . <P> Two millenniums and a quarter later , last week , Adolf Hitler 's newspaper Vlkischer Beobachter drew a fanciful parallel : Joseph Stalin with Alexander the Great . No two men could be less alike . Alexander loved gaud and baubles ; Stalin likes big boots and old brown tunics . Vain Alexander refused to grow a beard on the specious grounds that it would afford a handle which an opponent in war might grasp ; diffident Stalin wears huge mustachios to make himself look more inscrutable . Alexander was imaginative , athletic , quick as an ocelot ; Stalin is practical , ponderous , deliberate as a bear . Only similarity : Diogenes , out looking for an honest man , would not shine his lamp in either Alexander 's or Stalin 's visage very long . <P> Vlkischer Beobachter was actually indulging in wishful thinking . Joseph Stalin , Friend of Peace , had metamorphosed into Joseph Stalin , Aggressor . And unfortunately his aggression was taking great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be better , suggested the newspaper , if , like Alexander , Joseph Stalin buckled on his breastplate and greaves and struck out for Illyria , Phoenicia , Babylonia , the empires of Persia and those lands which are watered by the Indus ? <P> Next day came an apparent answer to Vlkischer Beobachter 's prayer . In Moscow Communist International , official organ of the Communist Party , warned Rumania that she had better conclude an immediate pact with Russia , similar to those granted by the Baltic States and refused by unlucky Finland , and turn over the lost province of Bessarabia . In Moscow , New York Times Correspondent G. E. R. Gedye said he had learned " from a highly qualified observer " that Rumania did not even intend to defend the province-had no fortifications and not a single soldier there , was evacuating Rumanian businesses from the area , was mobilizing behind the River Prut , which divides Bessarabia from Rumania proper .
