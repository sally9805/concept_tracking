With much ballyhoo , New York City 's Municipal Art Committee last week opened its First National Exhibition of U. S. Art in Rockefeller Center 's International Building . Arranged according to the artists ' home States , some 700 paintings and 60 sculptures from 46 States , the District of Columbia and four territories hung on specially prepared walls of sea grass and plaster . For the preview dinner in Rockefeller Center 's 65th story Rainbow Room , New York 's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia rounded up a roomful of bigwigs , including New Jersey 's Governor Harold Hoffman . Beefy Governor Hoffman promptly proceeded to put the show on the front pages by flooring with one blow a spindly Hearstling named Lou Wedemar who heckled him about his handling of the Hauptmann case . After this preliminary bout the bigwigs were taken to look at the show . Advertised as a " representative cross-section of American art , " it was really a representative cross-section of American taste . Organized U. S. artists had boycotted it because the Municipal Art Committee refused to pay artists a rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Selection of paintings had been left to Governors . So scant was official interest in New Hampshire and Louisiana that no pictures were chosen at all from these States . First National had only three abstractions , a few surrealisms , countless landscapes , mostly of each artist 's native town , plain , mountain , sierra , river , lake or desert . Overwhelming majority of the artists were entirely unknown , uninspired , surprisingly competent . A bad start were the Hawaiian entries , except for John C. Young 's painting of blue-white water foaming against rocks . Puerto Rico 's N. Poy was even worse with a peon and green bananas . The Panama Canal Zone had a slightly superior cubic nude by Blanche Lupfer . The Virgin Islands scraped the show 's low . Alaska was not represented . <P> The Pacific States were dull . Undistinguished were pictures of San Francisco Bay , cod fishermen , miners , deserts and the Rock Island Dam . <P> The Plateau States did better . Notable was Colorado 's able Frank Mechau who showed a fine big canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TIME , March 2 ) . <P> The South Central States marked an-other slump . Probable worst was Devil 's Swamp by Oklahoma 's Edith Mahier . Kentucky 's Frank W. Long painted Singer Jack Niles with his dulcinet . There were plenty of portraits of pretty white women and brave white gentlemen . <P> Ablest , most vigorous painting in the show was in the North Central States section . Best known was Sleeping by Michigan 's John Carroll . The model for this picture was Georgia Finckel , 27 , whom Artist Carroll married last week in Columbus , Ohio . He called his frail , slant-eyed second wife the " inspiration " as well as the model for the murals he had just finished at Detroit 's Institute of Arts .
