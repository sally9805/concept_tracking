HELEN BONES was the greatest possible help and comfort to mother . She took care of all her personal correspondence , managed the private account books , and relieved her of many worries and cares , giving at the same time devoted love and companionship . Helen was very popular in every overlapping circle of Washington society , and I do n't know how any of us could have got along without her . She helped us all in a thousand ways , and fitted perfectly into the family group . Her room was always a sort of rendezvous ; the door was open all day long , and we drifted in and out , sometimes ending the day with an impromptu tea around her fire . Mother , relaxed in the corner of a big sofa ; father , teacup in hand , standing before the tire ; Belle Hagner shouting with laughter , and my sisters and I telling the day 's adventures . I made Helen my confidante , pouring all my problems , romantic , sartorial and otherwise , into her patient ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart . We always went together to a Presbyterian church , came back to a quiet family lunch , and rode horseback or went for a drive in the of ternoon . Only intimate friends or relatives were guests on that day , and father did n't like us to go to even the simplest Sunday-night supper party . Around the Luncheon Table D ISTINGUISHED visitors to Washington were always entertained at the White House , and often there were at least two or three guests at the luncheon table . When father played the role of host , I often recaptured somewhat the same feeling I had had in Mrs. Reid 's drawing room when I was a little girl . He was a dazzling stranger and I could n't bear to miss a word he said . Pretending to listen politely to my neighbor , I always had one ear cocked in his direction . Our guests appeared at their best , too , as father had a way of promptly making them forget their first shyness in the presence of the President . His own sensitiveness made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how to put , them completely at their ease , And he was not only charmingly aware of his guests but always of his family , too  --  a quick , flashing look of understanding or amusement , when we had not even spoken , telling us that he was always interested in our reactions . All our lives we had loved his stories : often prompting him to tell one of our particular favorites . He never forgot one or stumbled in telling it , but one day , to my astonishment , I heard him stop in the middle of a pet anecdote and say , " By Jove , I 've forgotten how that ends . " It was the story of a man who asked an Irishman for whom he intended to vote . The Irishman replied , " Sure . I 'm going to vote for that man Wilson Woodrow . " His friend said , " You mean vice versa , do n't you ? " and Mike answered indignantly , " I do not . I 'll not vote for a damned Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ears , and opened my mouth to prompt him , but shut it just in time . Afterward I asked him about it , and he said , " Why , did n't you see ? Our Italian guest did n't understand English very well , and certainly could not have got the Irish brogue ; all he would have heard was ' damned Italian , ' and his feelings would have been injured . " There were often concerts after the big dinner parties , and one night Paderewski played . Margaret found him just before the concert . pining excitedly up and down the Rose Guest Room . When she asked him if there was anything lie wanted , he said nervously , " May I have a howl of hot water ? Feel my hands ; they are so cold . " She brought . the water herself , and held it in front of him like a votive offering , while ho soaked his fingers , and then led him , a little calmer , to the East Room . We saw him , that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall never forget . One of the senators had had too much to drink , and in the middle of it beautiful , soft passage , rose and , striding up and down between the chairs , talked at the top of his voice . Margaret quickly persuaded one of his colleagues to lead him out , and in five minutes things were quiet again . But during all those bad moments Paderewski never even turned his head or faltered in his divine playing . For a man who was famous for not being able to stand the least noise during his concerts , it was a fine exhibition of consideration . We all fell in love with him , and father and he began a friendship that night that was to last all their lives and lead indirectly to Polish freedom . Father looked extraordinarily well and vital during these first weeks . When I saw him come out of his study and stride down the hall toward us , I noticed that his walk had acquired more than its usual buoyancy . His eyes were strikingly clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his face . Ile was finer looking in those days than ever before in his life . A friend said , " God set out to make Woodrow Wilson ugly , but Woodrow has made himself handsome . " The Problem of Patronage H E THOUGHT very little about his own ap-pearanee , but I know that he considered himself a plain , almost an ugly man . He often said that he looked like a horse , and his favorite limerick was : For beauty 1 am not a star , There are others more handsome by far . Be ! my fare , 1 do n't mind it , Far 1 am behind it . It 's ( hi potpie in front null I jar . Things were moving swiftly and smoothly , although the ever-present problem of patronage was troubling Ii do considerably . Hungry Democrats . out of ? Mee for sixteen years , were clamoring at the gates , but on the day after the inauguration , he had announced that he would deal with appointments only through the members of his Cabinet . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal investigation of every man appointed to an office of any importance , but he soon found that , with the best intentions in the world , this was utterly impossible . There were fifty-six thousand postmasters alone to be chosen , and he would have had to neglect practically everything else if he had undertaken to know personally about every one of them . Burleson had pointed this out to ( Continu  --  d on Page 291 ( Continued from Paso 27 ) him , but it was not until he had seen that it took two strong men merely to carry into his office the recommendations and information about a handful of applicants that he gave up . But he made the most important appoint-meats himself , taking infinite pains to be certain that each one was " honest and capable and forward-looking . " He was bitterly disappointed when President Eliot , of Harvard ; Richard Olney , who had been Secretary of State under Cleveland ; John R. Mott , leader of the Y. M. C. A. , and finally Harry Fine ; his old friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old story of a rich country refusing to pay its representatives to foreign countries enough to live on properly , making it necessary to appoint rich men . Father had no narrow-minded prejudice against rich men , but it was hard to find one who stood for his ideals of Democratic simplicity and open diplomacy . In one or two instances he had to get contributions from friends to help support them . It was difficult and discouraging , and Mr. Bryan , an old-fashioned politician in this respect , was on his back all the time with requests to reward " deserving Democrats , " regardless often of their qualifications . He was so anxious to give the " faithful " a chance that he wrote to father , suggesting that appointees should be asked to serve for only a short time , so that " we can pass the offices around . " Building an Official Family F ATHER 'S affection for Mr. Bryan made him more than patient , but he was adamant in his determination to appoint only the best men . He insisted that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightened up the regulations and refused to dismiss men from office merely because they were Republicans . He was able to make one appointment that pleased him greatly . On a trip to England in 1896 he had met Charles A. Woods , a young lawyer from . South Carolina . They were instantly attracted to each other , and Woods , admiring and enthusiastic , had predicted a great future for his new friend . Father had told him when they parted , " Well , if you 're right , I 'll put you on the Federal bench when I 'm President . " Woods had had a fine career since then , and father was as pleased as a boy when he was able to keep his promise made in jest . Henry Van Dyke , who had strongly opposed him in the Princeton controversies , he appointed minister to the Netherlands . Van Dyke was astonished , and came down to Washington at once to thank him . As a child , I bad always been very shy with him , and now I was surprised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . there were tears in his eyes . When McCombs was offered the ambassadorship to France , he declined and accepted at least a dozen times before finally turning it down . He had wanted to be in the Cabinet , and never forgave father for not putting him there . Father bore all this with patient good humor , but it irked him dreadfully to have his attention so distracted when he was eager to get on with his great program of reform . He was pleased with his Cabinet , and on the friendliest terms with its members . At the meetings he called on each man in turn , but encouraged general discussion , and never insisted on strict rules of procedure . If there were jealousies , they concealed them in his benign and courteous presence . He called Burleson " the cardinal , " because of his priestlike appearance and the round shovel hat that he affected , and later , in his letters to Colonel House and his private conversations with his family referred to Mac as " Pythias , " to Bryan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His loyalty to his official family never faltered . In the years that followed , he defended and upheld them through many bitter attacks . However , he was , to all intents and purposes , his own Secretary of State , always consulting with Mr. Bryan , but , in the end , making the final decisions himself on all important foreign questions . The Mexican problem was a legacy from Mr. Taft 's slow-moving Administration . Two factions in the United States  --  one for immediate intervention and the other for recognition of Huerta and a hands-off policy  --  were load in their advice and demands . During the first months in office , he handled this situation and controversial matters with China and Japan , Nicaragua and Panama with skill and almost-dramatic sincerity . By May he had received the verbal consent of five countries to what were called " the Bryan Treaties " ; treaties for " the advancement of general peace . " His repudiation of Dollar Diplomacy and his simple direct statement of policy and principle , especially the principle of " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears of Latin-America , brought a wave of excitement and commendation . Almost every newspaper in the country was with him . One day I spoke to him exultantly about his enormous popularity , and he put his hand . affectionately on mine , and then , as though he haled to disillusion me , said , " Remember , the pack is always waiting near at hand to tear one to pieces . Popularity is the most evanescent thing in the world , and the most ; unimportant . " Precedent-loving Washington was shocked when , early in April , father delivered his first message to Congress in person . For a hundred and thirteen years , the Presidents ' messages had been droned off PAIN Newh . NERV1 ! 11 , Dressed for Percy AfacK aye 's Bird Masque .

When ho called a , special session and announced that he would appear before them to consider the tariff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us considerably . There were fiery speeches at the Capitol , and oven some of his Democratic friends protested , saying that it would he like a " speech from the throne . ' ' But to father it was just the simple and natural way , and he paid no attention to the outcries . He always disliked to read his addresses from manuscript , but a message to Congress could not , of course , be made extemporaneously . He had his own peculiar method of preparing his speeches ; first writing the substance on a single sheet of paper , partly in script and partly in shorthand , then again entirely in shorthand , making the final copy himself on his own typewriter , on small sheets of thick paper . There were usually a. few corrections made , in his fine neat writing , between the lines . Jl President Goes to Congress TOTHER and my sisters and I sat in the gallery VI of the house of Representatives , where the joint session was held . it was jammed with people , and outside in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Washington society was well represented , coming all dressed up as if it were a " first night . " The Vice-President and the senators marched solemnly in ; the members of the Cabinet , looking a little nervous , settled themselves on one side of the Speaker 's desk , and at last the Clerk announced , " The President of the United States . " Everyone rose as father walked briskly in at the head of the committee appointed to escort him . There was scattered halfhearted applause from the floor , and then his old rival , Champ Clark , who was Speaker of the House , introduced him in an almost-unintelligible mumble . Father stood quietly for a moment with a little half smile on his lips , and then began , his voice very clear and untroubled ; " Mr. Speaker , Mr. President , Gentlemen of the Congress : I am very glad indeed to have this opportunity to address the two ( Continued an Page 32 ) ( Continued from Paz . 291 Houses directly and to verify for myself the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a mere department of the Government hailing Congress from some isolated island of jealous power , sending messages , not speaking naturally and with his own voice ; that he is a human being trying to co-operate with other human beings in a common service . After this pleasant experience , I shall feel quite normal in all our dealings with one another . " Then , in ten minutes , he covered the ground , presenting a general outline of his plan for a revision of the tariff and his reasons for advocating it . The speech was simple , concise and so brief that when he finished . I was startled . There was a moment of silence , and then a burst of spontaneous and enthusiastic applause . It was another triumph , but the unfriendliness at the start had upset me , and I found , to my surprise , that . I was trembling as we rode down in the elevator . As we drove home together , mother said , " That 's the sort of thing Roosevelt would have loved to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and answered , " Yes , I think I put one over on Teddy . " One of the newspapers had the same thought , for the next day it published a cartoon showing Teddy biting his fingernails and exclaiming , " Why did n't I think of that ? " With father , however , it was not an attempt at self-dramatization , but was dictated merely by his instinct for direct approach and his belief in responsible leadership in a democracy . He told us that he had been terribly nervous in the first few moments , but we laid heard that before . All his life he suffered from stage fright , hut . it left him as soon as he began to speak and lost himself in the earnestness and sincerity of his thoughts . Ever since , as a student at the University of Virginia , he had made a speech on the subject of the tariff , he had been interested in the problem , and had made it a lifelong study . He was , therefore , well equipped to deal with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length with Oscar Underwood , Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , and with members of the finance committees of both Houses of Congress , before the hill was introduced . The Tariff Fight He had set forth the general principle of the measure in a speech he had made in 1908 , when he said , " The power of the Government to tax ought never to be used to confer privileges upon individuals or groups of individuals , but should be used always and only to secure general benefits , the benefit of the taxpayer as a whole , or of the nation as an organism . " But . he was a thorough student of the principles of economics and knew that too violent a remedy would cause havoc with American business . He argued that " existing protection should not be suddenly withdrawn , but steadily and upon a fixed program , upon which every man of business can base his definite forecasts and systematic plans . " It was not , therefore , a free-trade measure that he advocated , but one that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " doling out of privileges " to special interests . Economists all over the country approved it as both necessary and sound , but there was a howl from Big Business , and the fight was very bitter . Lobbyists poured into Washington , bringing pressure to bear on the senators and congressmen through insidious threats and promises and predictions of disaster . It was well known in Washington that lobbying had been used for many years to defeat measures unwelcome to the interests , but , it was always carried on with such secrecy and cleverness that it was difficult to uncover . Father handled this with the same courage and audacity that he had used so effectively at Princeton and Trenton . He made a public statement in which he said that Washington " had seldom seen so numerous , so insidious a lobby " ; that " great bodies of astute men seek to create an artificial opinion and to overcome the interests of the public for their private profit . " It was a very bold move , because he knew that it would be almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his statement . caused a great stir throughout the country . But it was instantly effeetive . From then on , many congressmen were afraid to oppose the bill , for fear that they would be suspected of yielding to undue influence . In only one month the House passed the measure by a large majority , but . the struggle in the Senate lasted all through the long hot summer . At Cornish , in the New Hampshire hills , Winston Churchill , the American novelist , had built a tovely brick Georgian house and called it " Harlakenden . " Mother and father rented it , sight unseen , having fallen in love with the photographs and glowing descriptions of friends . When , in June , the heat grew oppressive , we were eager to go , but put it off week after week , hoping that father could get away too . He was anxious for mother to have it rest , and urged as not to wait for him , but she was never really happy away from him and always felt that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last , in July , he prevailed on us to go , promising to make flying visits as often as he could , but adding , " I ca n't be cool and comfortable at Cornish while Congress perspires here all summer at my request . " He expected at least to take us up there , but at the last minute had to change his plans because of some urgent matter . All he could do was to come down to the station to see us off , and after the train pulled out. , mother cried and would not be comforted , lying in her berth with closed eyes , refusing to eat . But she was pleased with Harakonden , and the winding river and blue hills , and she knew that Cary Grayson was staying at the White House , watching over father like a mother over an only child , and the next day she was able to smile again . There was a studio on the place , a simple harnlike affair , but she was delighted with it , and sending for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost childlike zeal . Helen , my sisters , the servants and I all conspired daily to see that she had a few hours alone , and that no outsider ever knew where she wa-s . Father wrote to her often , and again she read his letters aloud to us . And although she still skipped . the " sacred parts , " we knew by the tender pride in her face , that after all the years together , they remained the poetic messages of a lover . We all had a beautiful time at Cornish , with climaxes of real happiness when father came for brief visits and we took long drives with him , and , sitting on the terrace through the long twilights and starlit evenings , listened to his vivid and humorous account of what was going on in hectic Washington . Our life at Cornish reminded us a little of our happy summers at Lyme . Our neighbors included a delightful group of artists , poets and writers ; among them : Maxfield Parrish , Homer St. Gaudens , Norman Hap-good , Percy MacKaye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and father and mother were able to relax in their pleasing and andemandirig company . Margaret. , Jessie and I went to simple , amusing parties , listened to poetry and discussions of art and literature , and gave our days to tennis and picnics . Ernest . Harold Baynes , the naturalist , was trying to establish a sanctuary for birds in a lovely grove in the hills , and Percy MacKaye conceived the idea of writing a masque and presenting it there to raise money and awaken the interest of the community . For weeks we were absorbed in preparations and rehearsals . I was the Bird Spirit , Witter Bynner , the Hunter , Harold Baynes and MacKaye himself had important . parts , and Margaret was a spirit voice , singing from a bush . Father came up from Washington the night of the performance , and people drove in from all over the slate  --  more , I think , to see him than the Bird Masque . I had a headdress of while wings , and , twenty minutes before the play was to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was in despair , for I thought the wings very becoming and was certain that I could n't possibly speak My lines without them . White , the swiftest of the chauffeurs , was called in , and promised that he could make the ten miles and back in time . He was as good as his word ; coinplaining , however , that he had had a hard time getting hack because he " came all the way in his own dust . " After the performance , the cast , feeling very gay , drove home together . Passing through a tiny New England village , we saw that there was a country dance in progress in the small town hull . We had the same idea almost simultaneously . Stopping the ear a little way off , we approached stealthily and , without warning , appeared on the floor among the startled natives . Percy MacKaye , in his long blue hooded gown , leaned with folded arms against the wall , gazing at the scene like a necromancer who had himself created January 0.1937 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather headdress ; 1 , in my white robe , Ruth Hall and three others dressed as birds , in brief , bright costumes , we glided and swooped three times around the hall while the village people stood against the wall in a daze . Then we disappeared as silently as we had come . I have never known whether they thought us a dream , or a visitation from an insane asylum . Marie Dressier , who had a summer home in Vermont across the river , asked one day if she might come and entertain us . Father was pleased , and we looked forward to an evening of laughter , but for some unexplained reason she insisted upon singing only lugubrious ditties about little lost children , weeping mothers or blighted love . It was a sort of prelude to the " blues " that were to sweep America in later years . Toward the end , we rebelled politely , and she swung into her Jamboree song , and then told us a few amusing tales , but somehow the gloom was not dispelled . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day mother decided to run down to Washington to see him . At my urgent request , she took me with her , and father 's face , when we walked in and surprised him , made the long hot trip more than worth while . A Washington Interlude I was surprised when Mac , calling on father that night , asked if I would play tennis with him the next day . He had singled me out two or three times at receptions , and seemed to like to dance with me at parties , but this was something special . I dashed downtown and bought myself a tricky tennis costume , and we had a very amateurish and chatty game , and tea afterward in the garden . Father and mother were amused , and teased me about it that night at dinner . Father looked very tired . The controversy in the Senate over the tariff hill was fierce and exhausting , and having already introduced his proposed currency bill , he was in the midst of conferences and difficulties with the House of Representatives over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear ourselves away again , but Cary Grayson told us that father would worry too much about us if we stayed there in the scorching heat . He promised that he would make him play golf three or four times a week and drag him forcibly away to Cornish if he showed signs of breaking down , We were having a hard time keeping newspaper reporters from invading Harlakenden . Jessie 's engagement had been announced , and they all wanted " human-interest " interviews . Poor Frank 's past life was investigated in minute detail ; if he had had anything to conceal , it would have been difficult , if not impossible , to do so , and every time he and Jessie went out for even a walk or drive , they were tracked down like fugitives from justice . It was fine , however , to be able to take him openly into the family circle . We all loved him , and even father said , " He 's almost good enough for Jessie . " But we hated to think about this first break in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother consented to let them be married in November , I sulked for days . We went back to Washington in October and plunged at once into another round of parties . I was beginning to get my bearings , to look about me with ( Cantinurd on Pax* 63 ) come discernment , some understanding of the undercurrents of Washington life . It was interesting , but it was also disillusioning . Jealousy was the prevailing note , for the place was seething with ambitious people , and the gossips were busy from morning to night . I learned very soon that the few really important men and women were invariably the simplest , the easiest to talk to . I sat one night at dinner with Lord Bryce on my left and a young attach6 of the British Embassy on my right . I was in awe of Lord Bryce ; he was famous and old ; he would n't want to talk to me . The attachfi was not much older than I , so I began to chatter gaily with him . In five minutes I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up the courage to turn to Lord Bryce . He beamed at me and began to talk in the simplest and most charming way imaginable . It was not a monologue either , but a conversation . I talked as I had never talked before , expressed opinions , swapped stories , mentioned my travels in connection with his , and never even looked at the boy again . But I was rapidly becoming a youthful cynic . Unless , like Lord Bryce , they already had a high position , I began to suspect everyone of wanting something . I had some reason for this : the begging letters , the requests for jobs and the " freak " letters poured in literally by the thousand . I said one day to father , " Is everybody i the United States either crazy or *tinting us to do something for them ? " He laughed at my intensity , and said , " My dear little girl , there are ninety million people in this country . These few thousand do n't represent America , " and be talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become cynical and suspicious . " Most people are fundamentally honest and good  --  of that I am sure . Do n't let the few cheap and dishonest ones hurt you . You have understanding and intuition ; use them . " He never lost his faith in human beings , and over and over I have heard him say , " When the American people know the truth , they always decide right . " The National Blind Spot But he himself was often annoyed by the Washington atmosphere . He spoke 1r it many times to us , and in letters to friends . " Washington is , I should judge , the worst place in America to keep normal . One 's perspective goes wrong , along with one 's nerves , and there are a lot of people here who get on your nerves . " He said once , " No One ever remains the same after they come to Washington . They either grow or they swell , usually the latter . " And he was constantly asking for the frank opinion of friends who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game look to you , and the actors in it , as you sit at a distance and look on at it ? It is more important to me how it looks outside of Washington than how it looks inside . The men who think in Washington only can not think for the country . is a place of illusions . The disease is Twit men think of themselves , and not of their tasks of service , and are more concerned with what will happen to them than with what will happen to the country . *Latter to Mrs. Hulbert . " I am not complaining or scolding or holding myself superior : I am only analyzing , as a man will on Sunday , when the work pauses and he looks before and after . My eye is no better than theirs ; it is only fresher , and was a thoughtful spectator of these very things before it got on the inside and tried to see straight there . " * Thinking of himself and his own ambitions was u disease from which father never suffered . Lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , the chief element of his greatness . It was also one of the things that few people realized about him , and for which , almost subconsciously , they often bated him . He was not like themselves ; he looked beyond personal aims to the far horizon . Announcer to Cupid One evening when we happened to be all together in the Oval Room , Brown appeared at the door and announced in a booming voice , ' ' De Secretary of de Treasury . " Father looked around , surprised , because he had not expected Mae , but Brown added , obviously restraining his own astonishment , " fo ' Miss Eleanor . " There were shouts of mirth and banter , and I dashed quickly from the room to hide my mounting color , and with a beating heart went down to receive Mae in the Green Room . The second time he called , Brown marched a few paces into the room before be made the announcement in a lower voice . After that , the frequency of Mac 's visits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's increasing discretion of manner . Each time he advanced farther ' into the room , and each time his voice dropped lower , until be almost whispered his refrain , " De Secretary of de Treasury . " Finally , one night he ap-peared as usual and , amid the de-lighte d silence of the family , marched over to me , his big feet turned outward , bowed low from the waist , grinned , rolled his eyes in the direction of the door , and made his exit without a sound . The next day mother asked me bow serious it was , and if I had forgotten that I was supposed to be engaged ; whereupon I wept and stammered that . I did n't want to be engaged . She looked at me , puzzled , but left it at that , following her rule , since we were grown , of not insisting on confidences . Belle Hagner had a grand time with me , telling me , with an innocent expression , about the rich widow who , according to the gossips , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was so flattered by his attentions that nothing bothered me much . One night he began to talk about the currency bill , and I was in a panic . He would discover my abysmal ignorance on any subject related to finance . 1 quickly assumed the well-known feminine attitude of the rapturous listener and was enchanted when he told me that my comprehension of this complicated problem was little short of miraculous . The next day after lunch I took father aside and made him promise not to tell on me . He gave me a curious look , half inquiry , half quizzical amusement , and asked gravely , *Letter to Alm Hulbert , Sept. 28 , 1513. // " Would n't it be simpler to-make a real study of the currency problem ? " The tariff bill had passed the Senate on the ninth of September , and the House had voted for the currency measure on the eighteenth , but there was still no respite for father , struggling with recalcitrant senators in the face of the unfair attacks of Big Business . But although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , enjoying it ; the Irish fighter was never very far from the surface . He wrote to a friend , " Of course , I fmd a great zest in it all . Hard as it is to nurse Congress along and stand ready to play a part in guidance in anything that turns up , great or small , it is all part of something infinitely great and worth while , and I am content to labor at it to the finish . . . So far , things go very well and my leadership is most loyally and graciously accepted , even by men of whom I did not expect it . I hope that this is , in part , because they perceive that I am pursuing no private and selfish purposes of my own . How could a man do that with such responsibilities resting upon him ! It is no credit to be sobered and moralized by a task like this . ' ? On the third of October he signed the tariff bill . Quite a ceremony was made of it . Members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight in Congress , the family and a group of friends stood around his desk in the executive offices and watched him . He wrote " Woodrow " with one gold pen and " Wilson " with another , and gave them . still wet with the " unmitigated proof " of his signing , to Congressman Underwood and Senator Simmons , . after whom the act was named . Then he made a little speech and everyone applauded . He looked almost jubilant . This was not a personal victory , but a triumph for the American people  --  the first step in " setting the business of the country free . " As November twenty-fifth , the day set for Jessie 's wedding , approached , we drowned our mounting depression in a sea of preparation . Mother and I went with her to New York to order her trousseau , and comforted each other as we watched her radiant face and delicious indifference to her own beauty as she stood surrounded by enthusiastic saleswomen and fitters .

Margaret was to be maid of honor , and Jessie had chosen me and six of her own particular Princeton and college friends as bridesmaids . I had a grand time planning their costumes , making sketches and sternly imposing my own views on even the bride herself . The bridesmaids ' dresses , made in New York , were of charmeuse in four different shades of rose , from palest pink for Margaret to deep rose for me and the other tallest bridesmaid . They had Elizabethan ruffs of silver lace , and the skirts were draped in the prevailing mode , almost touching the floor in back , but in front daringly showing four inches of silk stocking through silver petticoats . There were headdresses too  --  little rose-velvet caps with silver lace , wired and standing up in the Russian manner . I thought them triumphs of simple chic . ? I ... tter to Mrs. Edith C.

Committees were chosen in each of the Houses of Congress to buy Jessie something really impressive . When the gifts arrived  --  a massive silver service from the Senate and a magnificent diamond pendant from the House  --  she sat down suddenly in a near-by chair , something like consternation in her face . " What shall I do with these ? What can a poor professor 's wife do with such things ? " she cried . Frank had accepted a professorship at Williams , his own college , and Jessie was rejoicing over the prospect of returning to the simple life of a college town . The day before the wedding the bridesmaids arrived , and the dresses , and we all tried them on together . It was a bad moment ; the headdresses , which I had thought a stroke of artistic genius , were complete and hideous failures . The bridesmaids looked at me accusingly , and I was sunk in despair . But Margaret and I and the ladies ' maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , remade them entirely . They were nothing to boast of , even then , bat at least . they were n't too awful . Wedding March I woke up the next morning without a voice . A sore throat and my self-assumed responsibilities had deprived me of everything but a. whisper . All day I felt like a ghost , unable to make myself heard above all the chatter and excitement . The ceremony was to be at six o'clock , and at five , mother , Margaret and I barred the door to everyone else , so that we might be alone with Jessie while she dressed . Her hair was like a wide golden fillet above her calm brow , and the long satin gown fell in soft lines to the floor . She looked half angel , half Grecian statue , and she had that lovely shining look that . always brought a lump into my throat . Mother pinned the veil on , smiling into . Jessie 's eyes with no sign of the grief that this parting meant to her . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , and not daring to look at Margaret , for fear we would both burst into tears . I could only think how beautiful she was , and wonder how we could ever be a happy Family again without her . The Marine Band , in their gorgeous scarlet coats , were tuning up in the entresol when we assembled in the big dining room . Father looked very distinguished in his dark gray cutaway , as he drew Jessie 's arm through his and smiled gravely down at her . Then we marched , two by two , down the long hallway to the East Room , crowded with people and blazing with fights . Dignitaries and their wives , diplomats , Army and Navy officers in full-dress uniforms and all their medals ; then the familiar faces of old friends  --  I saw it all in one swift glimpse while I slowly paced at the end of the procession . The big west window was banked with flowers and ferns , and , between tall candelabra , there was a little satin-cove red pric-dies on a white rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding present from the Peruvian Minister . Frank 's dearest friend , Doctor Oren-fell , of Labrador fame , was best man , and his solemn , ascetic face lightened as he looked at Jessie . He and Frank had shared many hardships at his mission and he loved him like a son . Doctor Beach , who had been our pastor at the Presbyterian Church in Princeton , performed the ceremony . In the midst of his solemn words , was conscious of a curious accompaniment , and stealing a side glance toward the front row of guests , had a vision of little Auntie Blanche almost . concealed under beads and bracelets and rings , and the famous serpent belt . Her dream had come true . She was taking long ecstatic breaths , and every jewel and bead was clashing like a tiny cymbal . Suddenly the Marine Band hlared out in a triumphant march , and Jessie turned , and , seeking mother 's face , smiled like a happy child . I saw the room and the crowd through a blur of tears and , clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a more or less dignified exit . But soon everything was gay again . Mac sought me out , and I took him into the Blue ROOM and gave him lessons in one-stepping and fox-trotting , my enforced whispering making me feel very intriguing . Cousin Lucy presided in the Oval Room , where the wedding presents were displayed , showing positive genius in her ability to put names , faces and gifts together with precision and dispatch . Knowing that everyone invariably looks first for his own contribution to the array , she managed to have each gift in a prominent position the moment she caught sight of the donor . Some of the presents were pretty awful , and these had been placed behind the door . There was one huge and ghastly oil painting ; and how little Cousin Lucy contrived to heave it up on the mantelpiece just before the proud searcher discovered it , was a mystery . Father and mother and the bridal party had supper in the big dining room , and then we all ran down the corridor to the main staircase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouquet down among the laughing bridesmaids . I saw her catch my eye , and then deliberately aim it in my direction , nearly tumbling me over with the weight of it . Parting is Such Sweet Sorrow Once more we four were alone in Jessie 's room , pretending to be very jolly while we helped her to change into her violet-colored " going-away dress , " with its little velvet hat to match . Father and mother bad always disliked the old noisy rice-throwing ens-tom , and as Jessie and Frank were anxious to avoid the newspaper sleuths hanging around outside , their departure was very quiet , almost clandestine . Leaving by the south entrance , they escaped in an automobile without the White House emblem on the door , and drove to a place in the Maryland hills , lent to them by a friend . As we turned away , father put his arm about mother 's shoulders and , drawing her close to him , walked slowly hack to the elevator . He wont off soon to keep an appointment , but there were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I took long breaths and tried feebly to entertain them , I even turned on the phonograph and suggested charades , the old childhood cure for the blues , but my hoarse whispering was not exactly a merry sound , and nobody really wanted to do anything but talk about Jessie . I heard mother say , with a little rueful smile , " I know ; it was a wedding , not a funeral , but you must forgive us ; this is the first break in the family . " The battle for currency reform hat , already lasted five months , and the debate was still raging in the Senate . Everyone was worn out and demanding a recess for the Christmas holidays . But father , knowing well the danger of deferred action , was adamant . He himself needed a holiday badly , but insisted that he could not rest or enjoy himself until the bill was passed . He had been studying this most complicated of all domestic problems ever since 1897. when he had said that " nothing but currency reform can touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that he knew very little about the technical problems of banking and finance , but men who had talked with him and listened to hi* speeches on the subject knew that he was extraordinarily well grounded in the fundamentals . The Currency Problem In Bermuda he had spent many hours studying proposed legislation and carrying on a correspondence with economists and hankers . On his return to America he had asked Carter Glass , a member of the House Banking and Currency Committee , and for many years an advocate and student of banking reform , to come to Princeton for a consultation . He had spared no effort , no time , in trying to work out a solution . When I remember the countless hours he spent , then and later , talkint to men from all over the United States  --  not just taking advice when it was offered , but seeking it  --  I am astonished that he could ever have been accused of arbitrary indifference to other people 's opinions . In his message to Congress in June , he had , as in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a short lucid speech ; " We must have a currency , not rigid , as . now , but readily , elastically responsive to sound credit , the expanding and contracting credits of everyday transactions , the normal ebb and flow of personal and corporate dealings . Our banking laws must mobilize reserves , must not permit the concentration anywhere , in a few hands , of the monetary resources of the country , or their use for speculative purposes in such volume as to hind/ or impede or stand in the way of other more legitimate , more fruitful uses . And the control of the system of banking and of issue , which our new laws are to set up , must be public , not private ; must be vested in the Government itself , so that the banks may be the instruments , not the masters of business , and of individual enterprise and initiative , . . I am at your service without reserve to play my part , in any way you may call upon me to play it , in this great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to perform , and discredit us to neglect . " The Republicans had passed the Aldrich-Vreeland Currency Act in 1908 , a plan which provided for a natiou ! a currency association to issue emergene9 bank notes in times of stress . It recommended the creation of a National Reserve Association having fifteen branches , to act as a central bank  --  a fur ( C  --  neinu.d on Paz . 68 ) 66 THE SATURDAY ( Continu  --  d from Pogo 64 ) cry from the Democratic ideal of developing the country 's business by individual initiative . It was only after months of effort , complicated by the fact that. , in addition to the bitter oppositiou of the big interests to any change at ail , Mr , Bryan and his followers were insisting on too radical reform , that a measure was evolved . The bill , as it finally passed , provides for what is now known as the Federal Reserve System . It consists of twelve Federal Reserve Banks in twelve different sections of the country of which all national batiks are members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wish . A Federal Board in Washington supervises the whole system . The member banks must keep a certain percentage of their cash reserves in the Reserve banks , and the Government may deposit its funds in these banks , at the discretion of the Treasury . The Reserve banks issue currency , as loans , to the member banks against notes of their customers or against other securities permitted by the Act . Obviously , the system provides for currency " elastically responsive to sound credit , " because the pooling of part of the reserves of many banks in a few central banks , under strict governmental supervision , makes possible the quick loans needed by business for expansion which , when business was dependent on the resources of small local banks only , or on the favors of a few powerful banks in New York , were often not available . There was a howl of indignation from the bankers when they heard that theirs was not to be the controlling voice on the Federal Reserve Board ; the President was . to appoint all but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision that at least two had to be " persons experienced in banking and finance . " A Bill in the Balance One evening father told us about a conference he had had that day with the currency committee of the American Bankers ' Association . They sat around the table in his office and quite peremptorily insisted upon banker representation on the Federal Reserve Board . He listened patiently until they finished , and then asked , Will one of you gentlemen tell me in what civilized country of the earth there are important government boards of control on which private interests are represented ? " There was a minute of erimplele silence , and then he added , " Which of you thinks the railroads should select members of the Interstate Commerce Commission ? " He was amused by the suddenness with which they dropped that . particular point . There were many days when it looked as though the bill could not possibly pass . Big Business brought all its guns into action ; the radicals in Congress threatened to bolt ; Colonel House was alarmed and pessimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored incessantly , and at last , on the nineteenth of December , the Federal Reserve Act was passed by the Senate . We at once made plans to get away for a real vacation and , wanting to go as far away as we could , chose Pass Christian , a sleepy little place on the Gulf of Mexico . We could hardly wait to get off , but it was not until the twenty-third that the Senate and House were able to iron out their small EVENING POST differences and present the bill to father to be signed . There was an even larger group of invited guests in the executive offices than when the tariff bill was signed , and the elation in the air was exhilarating . I came back from a the dansant , ran along the corridor in a frenzy , for fear I would be late and , arriving breathless , saw , to my dismay , that Mac was n't there . There was still time to inquire , and I found that he was at the door of the building , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas I ran back and whispered to mother , " Ask father to wait a minute . : Mac 's daughter has n't arrived . " She flashed me a glance of intense amusement and murmured , " I 'm to ask your father to hold up the currency bill because the McAdoo child is n't here ? " But when father sat down to sign , Mae was behind him , minus his daughter , and the three gold pens that were used were presented to him , Underwood and Glass . The house at Pass Christian had been built before the Civil War . I felt as though we had been suddenly transported to the faraway days at Colonel Stribling 's ; there were the same tall white columns , romantic balconies , soft-voiced Negro servants and the gentle consideration of the neighbors . But here the garden was a mass of luxuriant bloom , the trees festooned with moss , and , riding through the woods , we were constantly coming upon little winding rivers and still green bayous . On Christmas morning we had a big tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm sunstreaming through the windows , and we spent the rest of the day picnicking . We were very happy ; there was a deluge of praise from all over the country , approval of t he new bill , and admiration of father as a great leader and administrator . Even Republican newspapers and erstwhile opponents expressed their commendation . Father was particularly pleased with a published tribute from Mr. Taft , commending the Democratic Party for fulfilling its promises made in the platform , and saying that this was due to " Mr. Wilson 's masterful personality and attitude . " Floods of messages came from friends and followers . Father dictated and wrote four hundred letters in the three weeks of our stay , but he managed also to rest and relax , playing golf , riding horseback , loafing on the water in a little slow-moving launch . We celebrated his fifty-seventh birthday on the twenty-eighth of December , and 1 thought , watching his clear eyes , his eager , almost boyish expression as he unwrapped his presents , still carefully untying the ribbon and folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goose I was to have worried about him ! Ho had gone through a. grueling summer and the terrific strain of the last few months , and was well and vigorous and looking forward with undiminished eagerness to the next step in his program . It was characteristic of him that he never for a moment rested on his laurels ; always and immediately looking ahead - to more accomplishment . He was , even during this holiday , considering the next tasks : Trust legislation and a wisely planned budget system , and framing his next message to Congress . January 9 , 1937 There seemed to be only one black cloud : the situation in Mexico was still extremely disturbing . There was a mysterious visit from John Lind , father 's special agent to the southern republic , which interested me considerably . Father met him on a cruiser in the Gulf of Mexico one day , and came back looking very troubled . Lind , he told us , had had nothing very new to offer in the way of information , but had urged action against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizing of Tampico . Intervention in Mexico was the one thing father had been trying to avoid , and we knew  --  although he did not say so  --  that he would continue , if possible , to avoid it , but we were all upset that night , The Smiths came from near-by New Orleans to visit us , and we welcomed them joyously . Father could hardly wait for them to take their hats of before insisting that they sit down at once and tell trim all their latest darky stories . " I 've told all I know , " he said . " Please give me a new supply . What has Susie been saying lately ? " Susie had been their cook for many years , and when , later , I went to the Twelfth Night Ball in New Orleans and stayed with the Smiths , she gave us a new story that delighted us for years . Susie was very much interested in the new White House family and had made a large collection of newspaper pictures . On the morning of my arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , standing at the foot of the bed , folded her arms and nodded her head solemnly up and down . I said , " Susie , what on earth 's the matter with you ? " and she replied , ' ' Miss Nell , He gwine tell all my friends dat you ai n't half as ugly as dey say you is . " A Rubberneck Ride We were all rested and in fine spirits when we got back to Washington . One day Margaret and I decided to carry out a long-deferred plan to ride " incognito " on a rubberneck wagon . Every day they drove around the White House on their tour of the city , and many times , driving in or out of the gates , we had been subjected to the scrutiny of tourists as the gentleman with the megaphone pointed us out . We dressed in old clothes , draped veils over our hats and took a taxi to the bus depot , where we clambered aboard , finding seats in the front beside the driver . We were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were very quiet at first , but after a while we recovered our adventurous spirits and began to ask questions . Margaret assumed a high nasal voice and a Midwestern twang , and kept tip a running fire of comment . When we reached the White House , she cried , " Oh , mister , ca n't we go in ? I want to see where the Wilson girls sleep . Please take us in . Why ca n't we go in ? " He soothed her condescendingly , explained that she would have to have a pass , and promised to got it and take her through himself , but for all her pleas , he said that she could n't see the bedrooms . Weak with laughter , I dragged her off as soon as I could . Toward the end of . January Jessie and Frank came buck from an extended honeymoon trip in Europe , and stayed with us for a Few days . They had had a wonderful time , but all the things they had seen , the people they had met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped from their minds . All they could talk about was the little house waiting for them in Williamstown , and their plans and hopes and dreams for the future . We hated to let them go again . I was desperately homesick for the old adays ; most of all for the long nightly confidences with Jessie as we lay in bed in the dark . I began to be terribly troubled about my long engagement . Mac and I had formed the habit of taking walks every afternoon at dusk ; he was sending me flowers , and at dances refusing to allow anyone to cut in while we whirled about together . He would scowl and say severely , " It 's not etiquette to cut in on a Cabinet officer . " Washington was beginning to gossip about us , and mother 's amusement was mixed with definite concern over what looked like double-dealing on my part . At last I told her that Mac had proposed , and that I was shedding tears every night over having to refuse im . She was adorably sympathetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and think it all over very carefully . Also she told me to tell Mac that we must be " incommunicado " until his return from his trip to decide upon the locations of the Federal Reserve Banks . I obeyed in both respects , except for an occasional exchange of messages with Mac by what we called the " epaulette route " ? reports on each other 's health and activities , relayed by a friend in the Navy . When Mac returned , I was so glad to see him that I accepted him on the spot . Then began the difficult business of keeping our engagement a secret . There was a second performance of the Bird Masque at the Waldorf Hotel in " ' New York , and while I was there we wrote every day ; Mac 's letters always arriving covered with registered mail Ind special-delivery stamps . In the end , one letter was opened , carelessly stuck together again and remailed to me . In a few days our secret was placarded all over the front pages of the newspapers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an announcement . Father had established the custom of receiving the Washington corps of newspapermen twice a week . In many ways it was successful ; most of the correspondents responding to his frankness and trying hard not to color their reports to please the prejudices of their papers , but there were a few who betrayed his trust , and he was constantly irritated by personal questions . ? Reading the Riot Act He was very patient , however ; answering their queries , whenever it was possible , with courtesy and sincerity , and only on one occasion losing his temper . He was angry because my mail had been opened , and they had also been publishing absurd rumors about Margaret 's engagement to any number of men . He faced the group one day with fire in his eyes . " I am a public character for the time being , " ho said , " but the ladies of my household are not servants of the Government and they are not public characters . I deeply resent the treatment they are receiving at the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my oldest daughter . It is a violation of my own impulses even to speak of these things , but my oldest daughter is constantly represented as being engaged to this , that or the other man in different parts of the country ; in some instances , to men she has never even met in her life . It is a constant and intolerable annoyance . These things are printed without any attempt to verify them , by communications to the White House , and , when explicit denials are received from persons who are known to tell the truth , and to feel bound 10 tell the truth , those denials are not respected in the least . On the contrary , they are represented as avoidanees . If this continues , I shall deal with you , not as President but as man to man . " He frightened the correspondents to such an extent that for some time they let us alone . Father was sternly opposed to any form of nepotism , refusing  --  although it often hurt him to do so  --  to appoint even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Tumulty came to me and asked me , quite solemnly , if I had realized that if I married Mae I was putting both him and father in an awkward position , I was aghast and ran at once to mot her . She assured me that nothing could be more absurd . " Your father appointed him to the second highest position in his Cabinet before you even thought of marrying him , " she said . " What more ecuild he want or your father give ? The Shadow of Fear I had had a had shock when I got hack to Washington after the play . Father and mother met me at the door of the Oval Room , and mother looked white and ill . Father said , " She gave us a scare . She fell in her room a few days ago and she wo n't stay in bed and rest . " Mother smiled at me and said she was all right . This goose keeps worrying about me for no reason at all , " but as he led her down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . my heart suddenly sickened and the old fears crowded hack thick and fast . Helen and Margaret and I had a long talk that night . I raged against the social workers who were demanding too much of her , but Helen said that there was nothing to be done about it ; that mother had her heart set on getting the bill for better housing conditions in Washington passed by Congress , and that she would not spare herself . Then , too . the Mexican situation was very bad , and we knew that she was terribly worried about it , A British mining man had been executed in Mexico , and England was excited . British financial interests were using the incident to insist on American intervention . Father had had to order two regiments to Texas to calm the outraged feelings of border citizens who had been subjected to raids by Mexican bandits . It was one of those occasions when a spark might light a conflagration . Father himself was deeply disturbed , but determined to prevent war . He was convinced that " infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel House said one day . " Get him to rend his nonsense rhymes again ; try to inveigle him into evenings with the poets ; he is worrying more than you realize . " Once in a while we succeeded , but he wanted no serious poetry in those days , and confined himself to Stephen Leacock , The Bali Ballads , James Whitcomb Riley and Mr. Dooley . I remember our rather weak laughter over one of Dooley 's remarks : " Sure , with Mexico so contagious , we 'll be Lakin it soon , whether we want it or not . " EVENING POST In April we all went down to White Sulphur Springs for the Easter holidays . Mother had failed to get her strength back , and at the last minute father decided to take a nurse along to watch over her . It was a lovely interlude . Frank and Jessie and Mac joined us , and we played and rested and managed , for a few brief days , to recapture the illusion that all was well . But in Tampico , Huerta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors who had come unarmed in a Navy boat under the American flag to take off supplies for the ship . They had later been released but when word came that Admiral Mayo had insisted upon a formal apolligy , and demanded that the American flag be saluted with special ceremony by the military commander of the fort . father had to go back to Washington . He was intensely annoyed . Mayo 's action seemed an unnecessary bit of drama in the midst of a situation that was already tense enough , but he had , of course , to support the admiral in command . Also it was not merely a question of one isolated incident . Huerta was a tyrant who had come into power by deliberate murder ; there was a great ' principle involved  --  the consent of the governed , the right of a majority of the people to choose their own rulers  --  a principle very dear to father 's heart . If the United States could do her part to save Mexico and other Latin-American republics from recurrent anarchy , it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich men who wanted their interests in Mexico protected  --  was unthinkable . It meant a long war . It meant sacrificing the lives of American boys . For the first time in his life , father could n't sleep . The Ultimatum to Huerta After investigating the situation in all its aspects , he informed Huerta that he expected " a prompt acceptance " of Admiral Mayo 's terms , giving him until the nineteenth of April to comply , and came back to White Sulphur , Springs very tense and troubled . There was great excitement throughout the country , and hundreds of letters , most of them approving his action , poured in from all sides . The nineteenth came and went , with no sign from Huerta , and that night we went back to Washington , a silent and depressed family . The next day father addressed Congress . and this time even the gal ' leries , defying the rules , broke into tumultuous applause as he appeared . He summed up the moment 's crisis and concluded , " This Government can , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the people of Mexico . Mexico is torn by civil strife . If we are to accept the tests of its own constitution , it has no government . General Huerta has set his power up in the city of Mexico , such as it is , without right , and by methods for which there can he no justification . Only part of the country is under his control . If armed conflict should unhappily come as a result of his attitude of personal resentment toward this Government , we should be fighting only General Huerta and those who adhere to him and give him their support , and our object would he only to restore to the people of the distracted Republic the opportunity to set up again their own laws and their own government . But 1 earnestly hope that war is not now in question . I believe that I speak for the American January 9. 19.17 people when I say that we do not desire to control the affairs of our sister Republic . . . . The present situation need have none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly , firmly and wisely . . . . " I , therefore , come to ask your approval that I should use the armed forces of the United States in such ways and to such an extent as may he necessary to obtain from General Huerta and his adherents the fullest recognition of the rights and dignity of the United States , even amidst the distressing conditions now unhappily obtaining in Mexico . " There can be in what we do no thought . of oppression or of selfish aggrandizement . We seek to maintain the dignity and authority of the United States only because we wish always to keep our great influence unimpaired for the uses of liberty , both in the United States and wherever else it may be employed for the benefit of man- hi kind . " That night he told us that the reaction to his message had not been very favorable , and added , with a sort of grim sadness , " People seem to want war with Mexico , but they sha n't have it if I can prevent it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was startled by father 's expression . I said , " Oh , what 's happened , darling ? " And he told me that the Americans had landed at Vera Cruz at his order , taken possession of the cable , post and telegraph offices and the customhouse , and that there had been unexpected casualties ; four of our men had been killed . I knew that he felt personally responsible for their deaths , and I had such a lump in my throat that I 4 , could n't swallow my breakfast , The days that followed were hard to get through , especially when we heard that fifteen more Americans were dead ; Father was calm and managed most of the time to be optimistic , while mother concealed her intense concern for him behind a smiling serenity . As I watched her in those days , I remembered what Uncle Stock had once said about her : " She has a tragic capacity for suffering and being still about it . " " Watchful Waiting " Vindicated War talk was beginning to spread through the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much effect on Huerta , and things had reached a serious impasse , when suddenly they began to straighten out . On the twenty-fifth of April three* South American countries , Argentina , Brazil and Chile , ordered their ambassadors to call on the Secretary of State and offer to mediate , and father accepted at once . Huerta also consented , and made no protest even later , when father insisted that the settlement should provide for the " entire elimination of General Huerta " and " the immediate setting up in Mexico of a single provisional government , acceptable to all parties . " We were all immensely relieved . There would be weeks of mediation and many difficulties to be ironed out , but armed intervention had been definitely avoided , and " personal aggrandizement " by American investors prevented . Father 's enemies had sneered at his policy of " watchful " / waiting , " but in the end.he was to be vindicated .
