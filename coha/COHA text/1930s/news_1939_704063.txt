txt Earl K. Long was sworn in as Governor of Louisiana at 7:15 o'clock tonight , after Governor Richard W. Leche stepped down as a climax to a day of swiftly moving developments obscured by . mystery , scandal and embezzlement charges . Mr. Leche , as Chief Executive , accepted his own resignation by proclamation effective at 7 P. M. and Mr. Long was sworn in immediately in hastily arranged ceremonies at the Governor 's mansion . Mr. Long , who served as Lieutenant Governor under Mr. Leche , took over the Chief Executive 's post in an atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty , which shook the old , strongly entrenched political dynasty of his brother , Huey P. Long , to its foundations . Charge Filed Against Dr. Smith The atmosphere was by no means cleared with the political change over which occurred only a few minutes ' after formal charges of embezzlement of $100,000 of funds of Louisiana State University were filed in District Court here against President James Monroe Smith , who vanished soon after he resigned his post late yesterday , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Leche that they were without clues to the whereabouts of Dr. Smith , who was last seen at dusk last night just before Mr. Leche announced that " financial irregularities " had been discovered in university affairs . An order was signed by Judge William J. O'Hara of Criminal District Court directing two brokers to open their books for inspection of any transactions in which Dr. Smith was involved . The order was directed against J. M. Brown , an intermediate broker , and the brokerage firm of Fenner &; Beane . Dr. Smith a Loser in Market Dr. Smith 's fall from grace was accompanied by disclosure in New Orleans that the educator had been a market plunger during the last two and a half years , with reported heavy losses , particularly in a recent drop in wheat , in which he had large holdings . The disclosure was made by Charles E. Fenner , senior partner of Fenner &; Beane , with whom Dr. Smith had opened operations in 1936 under the code name of J. Monroe . Mr. Fenner said the account was closed out ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each , after thebrokers had refused to accept Louisiana State University bonds , proffered through an intermediary , as kollateral on account . Tried to Put Up $375,000 Bonds Mr. Fenner said the intermediary at one time offered L. S. U. bonds of a face value of $375,000 as a deposit on future accounts . An unsatisfactory effort followed to obtain a legal opinion , Mr. Fenner said . He added that , " without a legal opinion , we did not consider the bonds first-class collateral and we , therefore , requested that they be withdrawn . " The swiftness with which changes were being made was illustrated by Mr. Long 's unheralded inauguration after Mr. Leche said late last nght that he had called off his annopnced resignation and would hold the reins pending the investigation of the university affairs . Then , just before 7 P. M. , political leaders gathered at the Executive Mansion . Within a few minutes , Huey P. Long 's brother was at the helm . Mr. Leche , boisterous after a day of political uncertainty equaling any seen in the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansion and boomed out : " It 's all yours now , Earl . If you are as good a Governor as you 've been a Lieutenant Governor , you 'll be a credit to the State . " Mr. Leche then leaned over and exuberantly kissed Mrs. Long . John R. Land Sr. , Associate Justice of the State Supreme Court , administered the oath of office to Mr. Long . Soon afterward Governor Long issued a bible quotation , saying : " This is going to be my motto : ' Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right . ' " ( Proverbs XVI , 8 . ) Mr. Leche was forced to proclaim and accept his own resignation because Louisiana law has no provision for a Governor to resign . Dr. Smith disappeared immediately after turning in his resignation to Mr. Leche . During the day , the university Board of Supervisors met with Mr. Leche to go over auditors ' reports . which informed persons said showed unauthorized issue of university bonds that might total up to $750,000 . The mystery of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple , was heightened by the cryptic remark of one official that , despite the asserted " irregularities , " the university " might not lose a single cent . " Dr. Smith handled the expenditure of more than $13,500,000 in building up the university from an enrollment of less than 2,000 to more than 8,000 since he was put in as president by Huey Long ' in 1930 . Police throughout the State watched highways and trains for Dr. Smith . The man who , by his own statement , made it his creed to " get along with the politicians , " apparently began to slip in administration grace last week when he said the sale by the university of material for private purposes was not its policy and would be stopped . This statement was in disagreement with a previous explanation by Governor Leche defending the use of university trucks in delivery of university-fabricated material to a building site near New Orleans , owned by a close friend of the Governor . Anxious politicians streamed into the executive mansion during the day for conferences with Mr. Leche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ailing health and a desire to travel . Governor Leche was closeted for much of the day with Mr. Long , Mayor Robert S. Maestri of New Orleans , Louisiana political boss , and State officials . None knew whether these parleys dealt with the alleged university scandal or were called to lessen the strain on the administration 's political machine , weakened by uncertainty , failing leadership and unexplained manoeuvres that left politicians gasping . Legislators Crowd in Hotel Almost the entire Legislature and scores of out-State politicians meanwhile crowded the lobby of the near-by Heidelberg Hotel . None seemed to know whether they would witness the swearing in of a new Governor , or even more alarming political changes within the next few hours . Mr. Long arrived last night , Associated Press MISSING EDUCATOR Dr. James Monroe Smith freshly tailored and barbered to take the oath of office . He said he knew nothing of the impending change of schedule until then . Skeptical still that he would become Governor , Mr. Long said " if and when " he became the chief executive , the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crapshooter who wo n't pick up the money until he wins it , " Mr. Long said humorously , temporarily mastering impatience at the eleventh hour hitch . In addition to politicians , Baton Rouge today was filled with investigators , Federal and State , in an electric atmosphere closely resembling the anxious days following Huey Long 's fatal shooting here nearly four years ago . Armed guards patrolled the university campus , guarding Mr. Smith 's house and office . Federal investigators pored over university books and examined witnesses pursuant to the W investigation ordered last week following published charges in connection with WPA work around the university . In the midst of this atmosphere the Federal grand jury in New Orleans suddenly announced that it would carry out its own investigation of alleged WPA irregularities in Louisiana , assuming complete control of the case . Smith 's Nephew on Ball Emory J. Adams , Dr. Sinith 's nephew , voluntarily surrendered to officials here late today and after long questioning was held as a material witness under $5,000 bond in the Smith case . Mr. Adams failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night when they left the university campus for an unknoveo destination . He formerly was manager of the campus bookstore and fieldhouse at Louisiana State University . Some persons lo6ked for action from Attorney General Frank Murphy , who received from Mr. Smith an honorary university degree here less than a month ago . It was recalled that Mr. Murphy chose while in New Orleans to voice a blast against political corruption , and warn that the Federal Government had means of stepping in to clear up situtions where State or cities failed to act . Soon after that a New Orleans newspaper exposed use of university materials for the house in New Orleans suburbs . Mr. Leche hastily ordered an investigation and court hearing , then cancelled the latter . Then he suddenly announced he would quit , just after State WPA Administrator J. H. Crutcher disclosed that a Federal WPA investigation already was under way . Mr. Leche , political understudy of Huey Long , who stepped into the Governor 's chair as a compromise following Senator Long 's death , has changed overnight from a portly , jovial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a moody , reticent man . Huey Long once said he handpicked Dr. Smith as president of Louisiana State University because Dr. Smith had " a hide as tough as an elephant . "
