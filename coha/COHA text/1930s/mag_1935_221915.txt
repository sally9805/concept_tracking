' ' The astounding thing is that the great German people-educated , scientific , philosophical and romantic-not only did not resent the Nazis ' horrible blood bath but endorsed it and acclaimed its author with the honors not only of a sovereign but almost of a god . <P> " Although no subsequent political action can condone wrong deeds or remove the guilt of blood , history is replete with examples of men who have risen to power by employing stern , grim , wicked , even frightful methods , but who nevertheless , when their life is revealed as a whole , bave been regarded as great figures whose lives have enriched the story of mankind . So it may be with Hitler . " <P> This tribute to the Realmleader , tossed off three months ago by the Rt . Hon. Winston Churchill in a potboiling piece for Vincent Astor 's Today , went unnoticed by German diplomats in the U. S. last August . When it potboiled up again in London 's Strand Magazine ( which had bought it from Mr. Churchill , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the fat of cherubic " Winnie " was in the fire last week . Reason : Statesman Churchill in the interval has made his peace with British Prime Minister Baldwin and Germans , like everyone else , understood that by Christmas he would again be Britain 's First Lord of the Admiralty . To the German Government it seemed that the most intolerable and provocative of affronts had been offered to Adolf Hitler last week , virtually by a member of His Majesty 's Government . <P> When the German Foreign Office loudly announced at Berlin that their London Embassy was making " the sharpest protest , " Mr. Churchill was on the electioneering stump having another fling at Adolf Hitler . Soon in British Government circles the word passed that if the Realmleader was really aroused it would be impossible , all because of a potboiler , to give Mr. Churchill the Cabinet plum he has been promised . <P> Thus Adolf Hitler , with the crushing kudos of sheer Might , may repress the hitherto irrepressible Winston Churchill . Now bent on figuring in the Story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is currently being snapped by Nazi cameramen in poses which approximate those of the U. S. baby-kissing politician .
