Vice President &; Mrs. John Nance ( " Cactus Jack " ) Garner last week dined at the White House ( he in white tie &; tails ) . Contrary to report , Cactus Jack likes the party that the President gives him every year . He attended in 1934 , 1935 , 1937 , 1938 . Top members of Congress ( Borah , Sheppard , McNary , Sabath , Rayburn , Boland , etc. etc. ) were there . But local chit-chat artists were truly swamped two nights later when the Roosevelts entertained the 76th Congress , swamped by the new faces presented and their political implications . At the Congressional Reception , Jim Farley held court in a receiving line of his own . <P> Many of the Congressional guests were visiting the White House for the first time that night . Many of them were to give Franklin Roosevelt a rough reception the very next evening when the 76th Congress chopped $150,000,000 off their host 's Relief Bill ( see p. 11 ) . <P> That chop was the beginning , perhaps , of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh , young , oat-feeling Congress into the trap of a master politician . Franklin Roosevelt certainly did not worry unduly , knowing that in this era of a Permanently Unbalanced Budget , Congress would have a hard time taking his dare to economize generally-on pensions , Social Security , national defense . <P> &gt; As if to hammer home the irreducibility of big Government expenditures , the President handed on to Congress a report of the Social Security Board . Mr. Roosevelt warmly approved recommendations that old-age insurance payments be started in 1940 instead of 1942 , that coverage be extended to some 16,000,000 uninsured workers . Though this liberalization of benefits would inevitably siphon off some of the eventual $47,000,000,000 reserve , as the Board intended it should , the President avoided direct mention of the reserve or of the Board 's advice to stop hiking payroll taxes after 1940 . <P> &gt; The President told Congress that the Government 's real-estate holdings ( parks , forests , grazing lands ) which constitute one-fifth of all the land in U. S. , and were exempted from over $91,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nine-man interdepartmental board . <P> &gt; Son Elliott said by radio that : 1 ) a Texan ought to be elected President soon , and 2 ) Vice President John Nance Garner is a fine Texan .
