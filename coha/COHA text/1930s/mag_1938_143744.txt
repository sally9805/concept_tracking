At the Santa Anita race track , 30 minutes from Hollywood , over $100,000 a day goes into the till of its owners , the Los Angeles Turf Club . The Los Angeles Turf Club directors are rich and powerful . Since the day the track came into being three years ago ( the year after betting at race tracks was legalized in California ) , Santa Anita has enjoyed a profitable monopoly in Los Angeles County . Its directors frowned on interlopers . And so , it seemed , did the California Horse Racing Board . <P> But bent on breaking this one-track monopoly was the Hollywood Turf Club , a syndicate originally formed in 1935 but more recently reorganized and capitalized at $2,250,000 . Headed by politically powerful Jack Warner , sporty production chief of the $177,000,000 Warner Bros . Corporation , and a board of directors of impeccable backgrounds , the reorganized Hollywood Turf Club convinced the Racing Board of its financial and moral soundness , got permission to build a race track in Los Angeles County . But the Board shyly held up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , the Racing Board granted the Hollywood Turf Club 33 racing days next summer . <P> At Inglewood , 15 minutes from Hollywood , the new racing plant was already well under way . Since , in the Hollywood credo , no production has any excuse for being undertaken unless it can be bigger &; better than the last , Jack Warner and his associates had planned accordingly . Santa Anita cost $1,000,000 . Inglewood will cost $2,000,000 . Santa Anita can seat 20,000 . Inglewood will seat 25,000 . Santa Anita snuggles at the foot of the picturesque Sierra Madre Mountains . There Inglewood was momentarily stumped . Inglewood is close to the sea but not close enough to afford its paying guests a view of the twinkling Pacific . But Hollywood brains soon found a solution . Inglewood will have a man-made chain of lakes in the infield , with fountains and waterfalls for good measure . And then , just to make sure it will be the last word : a revolving paddock .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
