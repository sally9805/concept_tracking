txt Although foreigners probably bought between $150,000,000 and $200 , - 000,000 of American securities during the first half of this year , only a very small part of this total may be withdrawn as a result of currency realignments in Europe . This opinion was expressed here in official Icircles yesterday following publication by the Department of Commerce of its report on America 's international balance of payments during the first six months of this year . International security transactions , includi mg sinking fund and redemption operations , transfers of " direct " investments , and arbitrage ' transactions , resulted in a net inflow of $284 , - 1100,000 in the half year , according to the report . Foreign Buying Totals Foreign buying of American stocks and bonds accounted for by far the largest part of this influx , experts explained , but they declined to estimate the exact percentage . Other estiI mates , however , placed the foreign security acquisitions at not more than $200,000,000 and probably not less than $150,000,000 . Added to the Federal Reserve Board 's estimate that $616,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estimate for the first half of this year would bring total foreign security buying since dollar de ' valuation up to $750,000,000 or $800,000,000 . Several factors contribute to the feeling in official circles that these foreign holdings of American stocks and bonds will not be immediately sensitive to currency developments in Europe . Rising Dividends Attract Foremost is the belief that the foreign funds have been attracted by rising dividend rates here ; collateral tests , such as the segregation of buying for own account and through nominees , have been made and tend to confirm this belief . Secondly , only a part of the buying has come from the old gold bloc countries . The Reserve Board estimated that of ; 616,000,000 worth of securities purchased In 1933-35 , at least /tan went to England with most of the other half going to the gold bloc countries . Counterbalanced against these facts , however , is the increased volume of international security transactions , most of them in American securities , which developed during the first half of this year . This increase , noted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly due to French Laying and selling and may indicate that speculative as contrasted with investment buying by foreigners was slightly more important in the first half of this year than It was last year . Moat of the " nervous " funds fleeing from Europe , however , have gone into short-term balances here , which showed a net gain of ; 274 , - 000,000 for the first six months of 1935 , according to the official report . These bank balances are now between $1,000,000,000 and 51,400,000,000 and are considerably larger than necessary for working purposes , officials feel . Therefore , they may feel the effects of currency readjustments . The report declared that foreign purchases of American corporate securities continued to increase during the first six months of the year , reflecting improvement In American business conditions and , to some extent , financial and political uncertainty in foreign countries . The net inflow of funds on account of International security transactions amounted to $264,000,000 as compared with $60,000,000 in the first half of 1935 , As the rate of dollar bond repatriations , included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar receipts may thus be viewed as representing in large part the foreign purchases of American securities , Mr. Taylor said . Result of Business Rises The report explained that the increased returns on American investments abroad were largely the result of an upward trend in business conditions in various areas in which " direct investments " represent substantial American interests . Interest receipts on foreign dollar bonds held in this country were about 10% less than in the first half of last year , as the result of redemption and sinking fund operations and further repatriations , which have reduced the total volume of such bonds , the report said . Commenting on capital movements as a whole , Mr. Taylor said that in view of the fact that trade and service items during the first half of 1936 virtually offset each other , it may be said that the half year 's net inflow of gold and silver represented in effect a more or less direct measure of net long term and short term capital movements Gold movements , including earmarking operations , together with silver transactions , resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported January-June net receipts of capital funds amounted to $496,000,000 and were almost evenly divided between long term transactions ( comprising redemption and sinking fund operations , international security purchases and sales , international transfers of direct investments and security arbitrage operations ) and the international transfer of short term banking accounts and other short term funds , the report said .
