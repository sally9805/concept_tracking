THE PROGRAM A STORY BY LOWRY CHARLES WIMBERLY ATEthough he was , Albers should have gone boldly up to the front where , he took it for granted , the other speakers were sitting and awaiting their turn . Just now a big , tawny-bearded man was reading . He was standing almost sidewise to the audience , holding his manuscript in his left hand . But , instead , Albers took a back seat , a seat on the aisle . He thought of his mother and how she always insisted , even in church , on having an aisle seat . " With an aisle seat you do n't have that feeling of being trapped , " she had said . She was always worrying about fires , windstorms , and lightning . Even here , in this academic quiet , she would have been worrying about something or other . But as for Albers , he was calm enough . It was bad though that he had taken a back seat . This meant that when his name was called he would have to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , that he had n't managed to come in a few minutes early . On his way across the campus he had begun worrying again about the pronunciation of a couple of words . So he had hurried into the library and looked them up once more . And that had made him a trifle late . He had looked the words up any number of times before . But this morning there must be no question about them . For he was to read a paper at a learned gathering , a paper on Joaquin Miller , before the American Literature group . " For God 's sake , do n't make any boners , " Skelton had told him when , two days before , he had seen Albers off . Skelton was the head of his department and had , by pulling a few academic wires , got Albers a place on the program . Skelton had told him to go around and meet everybody , especially the big men . So , again , Albers thought , he should have managed to come in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chairman of the meeting , a Doctor Endicott , and perhaps also to the other speakers . They were all strangers to him , but the sound of their voices , a handclasp or so , might at least have made him feel at home . Still , one could n't imagine any warmth in the handclasp of the chairman  --  his eyes , through unrimmed glasses , looking coldly out of a thin , bloodless face , his clothes an aloof blackness . He brought Hayworth too readily to mind . Hayworth had been Albers ' doctor , and he , too , had eyes that chilled one , eyes that with a sort of malevolent indifference estimated one 's chances to carry on . Endicott was sitting behind a long , heavy table , on which were neat piles of pamphlets . Reprints of scholarly articles , Albers thought . Stuff that nobody on God 's earth ever read . But then it was all in the game and , any-how , who was Albers to be sneering at anything ? Skelton had told him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scholarly journals . " It would be a feather in your cap , " Skelton had said . Skelton was strong for printer 's ink . Well , Albers wished that the printer , or anyone else , other than himself , had the article now . He put his hand inside his coat pocket to make sure his manuscript was still there . But of course it was still there , bulging his coat out a little . It was typed on heavy sheets . He noticed how steadily the man up front was holding his paper . It was something to hold a paper with such a steady hand without rattling the Pages . But anybody should be able to read a paper . At least he had thought so , when , at Skelton 's urging , he had consented to go back East to read . All one had to do was to stick his nose into his manuscript and drive ahead for twenty minutes . The reader had the floor once his name was called . So many words . Enough to last twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself again and again . Moreover , Skelton had coached him in his reading . Albers glanced down at the sharp creases in his trousers . " You 'd better get some new clothes , " Skelton had told him . So he had bought a new suit , a blue serge that he thought was becoming . It gave one confidence to be well dressed . He felt for the paper once more . What if he had lost it and had only just now discovered his loss ? On a long . sleepless journey in a chair car one might lose anything . Once he had read the paper , though , he would n't care where it was or what became of it . He fancied himself , on the way hack home , tossing it out the train window , the pages scattering over the landscape ? one page , perhaps , blowing across a pasture and frightening a horse , others getting caught on the barbed-wire fences and flapping there , or some of them perhaps being sucked back under the train , the little black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters were clear enough . They must he clear now . Otherwise he would n't be able to make them out . It was absurd to be thinking that . And yet it was n't . For when he got up to read every syllable must be visible to his eye , and then be made audible to every ear in the room . The act of converting those quiet symbols into sounds that might be heard suddenly struck him as being no small accomplishment . For one might easily fall down in such a matter . The auditory nerves in that long room  --  his voice would have to play upon those nerves , reach , and try to impress all those listening ears . But would they listen ? And how many ears ? Why , twice as many ears , of course , as there were people . He began counting the people . But why count them ? " It 's as easy to talk before a thousand as a dozen , " Skelton had said . Besides , to count them all he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then look at the row behind him . That would make him conspicuous . But in a little while he would have to be conspicuous . His name would sound out , and he would have to get up and begin walking the length of the room , lifting one foot after the other , every head turned to watch his progress , the progress of Albers who had come two thousand miles to read for twenty minutes . It was as though he had walked all those miles , and be fancied himself playing out before he could reach his goal . Or , at best , he fancied himself stumbling , at last , up to the table where the big man was now standing . Fancied himself falling , and then that cold-eyed chairman looking down at him with his present unconcern , just as Hayworth , not so long ago , had looked down at him where , after a hard workout , he lay stifling on the gym floor . " Better use your head and watch that heart of yours , " Hayworth had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were altogether feeling-less . He wondered if the chairman had a family , if he had ever been in love , been anything that was human . Had any of his people died  --  his mother or father , say  --  and had he cried over their coffins ? Had he had to take those cold glasses off in order to wipe the tears from his eyes ? Albers wondered . He wished that he knew . He found himself shaking , his teeth chattering . God knows , he should have been listening to the man reading . All the others were listening , just as they would soon be listening to him . But how long now had the man been standing up there , or was it the same man ? It must , of course , be the same man . One could prove that beyond question . One had to prove everything . " Be able to document your stuff , " Skelton was always saying . " Know your authorities . " It was suicidal not to know your authorities . You were even supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller . But proof that this was the same man lay in the fact that the chairman had n't budged , mid had kept staring straight ahead out of that white face of his . If another man had got up to speak , the chairman would , despite his unconcern , have had first to announce him . Moreover , there would have been a little interval between the speakers when one could have heard clapping , then some discussion of the paper by these close listeners . Pretty soon they would be discussing his paper . He would be up there looking into their faces , faces that had never looked into his before . No , these people had never seen him before . And it would be possible for him to slip out the door , to escape from it all , and no one there be the wiser . No one there would know that he , Albers , had come and gone . Still there was that gaunt old girl in a brown dress across the aisle and five or six rows up . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room she had turned and stared at him for a moment , stared as if she knew him . Albers slid over a couple of seats until he was hiding behind the man in the next row , a colossus in a gray suit . What was this ox doing at a learned meeting , Albers wondered ? Brain , not brawn , was needed in a place like this . Albers ' folks had always said that he was the brains of the family . They depended on him  --  those folks back there in Pawson . They would be talking about him now  --  his mother , his father , and his Aunt Martha . They would be glancing at the clock and saying , " Fred will be giving his speech in a little while now . " They would be talking about the difference in time , Eastern Time and Rocky Mountain Time . They had it all figured out , and were thinking that he was about to give an address , a long speech , the sort . that booms out from some high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring tears and then begins booming again to bring deafening applause . They did n't know , out there in Pawson , anything about scholarship and learned papers . Learned papers . Ah , God ! His learned paper . They were expecting a speech such as old Brother Owens , their preacher , might give , throwing his arms about , pounding the pulpit desk , and pointing his long , skinny finger at the sinners , exhorting them to repent and come to God . Perhaps , though , the preacher was right . Perhaps one did need to repent , to come to God , and to have God thenceforth on one 's side . God on one 's side in times of trial . God at one 's back . God all about one , bolstering one up in the face of hell itself . God would give one strength , would give one voice , the power to stand unafraid in the presence of kings . Like Nathan of old . " Thou art the man ! " Nathan had said , pointing his finger at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David had had to take it . Why ? Because God was on Nathan 's side . But no one was on Albers ' side . Albers was alone , utterly alone . He tried , though , to get a grip on himself . He clenched his hands until it hurt . What , after all , was there to be afraid of ? A bunch of pedagogues ? graybeards and mossbacks , mainly , with a fair sprinkling of old maids and a few Catholic sisters . He recalled how as a student he had made sport of his professors , kept stories going as to their absent-mindedness . These men were just like those old professors of his . Or were they ? Endicott , the chairman . He did n't appear absentminded . Behind those unfeeling eyes was a calculating brain . No , Endicott was n't the sort to overlook anything . He would n't , for example , overlook Albers ' name , where , on the program , it stood after the title of his paper . In a few minutes he would fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to his feet , read them off . One more paper , and then Endicott would get up and read off Albers ' name . There was no way on earth to stop him . He was in control of everything . The big man up there now . Endicott 's voice had summoned him , and there he was . It must be Doctor Howardsen . Albers looked at the program . But there was no need of his looking at it . He knew it by heart . Yes , it was Doctor Howardsen. reading about Franklin and the Age of Reason . That he could verify this gave Albers a little courage . And he must have courage . Some thirty minutes now and it would be his turn . He looked at his watch . That would make it about ten o'clock . Well , by that time , perhaps , he could pull himself together . Again he measured the distance from his seat to the table . And he moved his legs a little , as though to prove that he still had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs were . He looked at his hands , opening and closing them . They were there too . His legs would get him to the table . His hands would hold his paper Both hands , for he would not , like Howardsen , rely on only one . It was strange , after all , that even in an endeavor of the mind , such as reading a paper , one had to rely on legs and hands . On legs , especially . He thought of Wordsworth and a statement by De Quincey to the effect that Wordsworth had walked eighty-five thousand miles . What tremendous legs the poet must have had . But had he actually walked that far ? Was n't that eighty-five thousand miles merely one of De Quincey 's opium fancies ? Good God ! Imagine somebody in this room getting up and making a statement like that , unless , that is , the statement could be fully documented , a footnote for every mile of the eighty-five thousand . Documentation . That was the thing . Footnotes a mile high for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the waterfalls and the " still , sad voice of humanity . " Or was n't it the music instead of the voice of humanity ? Albers was always misquoting . Anyhow , here he was , come into an alien land to make himself heard among a strange people . To read words , words of no moment , for all these important ears to hear , paltry syllables to strike upon these learned eardrums . What right had he to address himself to such ears ? " Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears . " As a boy Albers used to recite Antony 's oration . Why should he fear now ? But these were n't his friends ; these not his countrymen ; and obviously they were n't Romans either . That was verifiable . You could footnote that , too . " I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him . " Ah , but who would praise Albers ? " To bury Caesar . " Albers thought of the little graveyard back home and all the people in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite out of them , for they had now the perspective of the dead , that perspective which sees things for what they are , that dwarfs the fears of men , reduces these mountains of agony to the molehills they actually are . Upon the program in his hand the dead would look calmly . At sight of his printed name the dead would suffer no terror . A bit of paper . A few harmless letters . But for him , the living , these letters spelled all the manifold agonies of life . It was incredible that once he had been glad to see his name there . Back home he had other copies of the program . He had sent to the secretary of the Association for extra copies , so that he might mail them round . It was to be his first appearance before a learned society , and his friends should know about it . His enemies too , for that matter . To several of his illwishers he had sent copies  --  to Reynolds , for instance , and Stark . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all it is no small matter for a mere beginner to go back East , two-thirds the way across the Continent , to read before some of the big shots in the academic world . That 's what Skelton had called them  --  big shots . Skelton himself was something of a big shot . Otherwise he could n't have got Albers a place on the program . No , it was no small matter . He realized that now more than ever , far more than ever . His legs and hands were feeling numb , and there came a momentary blurring of his vision and a faintness  --  a momentary dying away that somehow drew Endicott and Howardsen towards him and then returned them to the front of the room . Something of the same thing had happened one day in tennis , a game he was addicted to , playing it badly but enthusiastically . All at once the net had come wavering towards him along the court , floating up to him , like a strip of fog , and bringing with it the misty features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , Bill 's hands rubbing at his , Bill 's voice telling him , as from far away , to come out of it . And after a bit Albers had got up and insisted on finishing the set , Bill arguing with him about seeing a doctor . But he would n't see a doctor . He was sick of doctors . He rubbed his eyes and moved his legs and hands about until some of the numbness left . The main thing was to be accurate . That was the reason for giving a paper instead of a speech . A speech may be more interesting , but it is n't likely to be accurate . A slip or so in grammar , a single error in matter of fact might well be fatal to one 's standing . So everybody read papers . Even the big guns like Howardsen . And yet Howardsen was just the sort of man one would think could be independent of his manuscript . Full-blooded face and lips , a great tawny mustache and beard , a shock of tawny hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well sway a political gathering . Still , be had a weakness . His voice . It was coming small and thin from that broad , bearded face , piping words instead of thundering them . That piping , though , heartened Albers somewhat , for his own voice was full and strong . He was glad his voice was good . Teachers ' agencies , for one thing , al-ways inquire about an applicant 's voice . if you had a voice like Howardsen 's , or if you stuttered , it was against you , no matter how much you knew . Yes , Albers ' voice was good . Skelton himself had said so . But these people would laugh at a big voice , a voice given , as it were , to megaphoning errors . A big voice and a little reputation . Or rather no reputation , though back home his mother , his father , and his Aunt Martha were watching the clock and talking about the reputation he was making . His mother doing most of the talking , but shadowing her pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his health . And back there , too , were Reynolds and Stark wishing he would n't make a go of it . And , above all , there was Skelton . Skelton , who believed in him and had staked him , in part , with money enough to get to the meeting . He owed Skelton over fifty dollars . That was his university 's fault . Universities never pay a scholar 's way to any-. thing , not even to the most learned meetings . They pay the football coach 's way all over the country . And the stock-judging team 's way . They pay that , too . But the scholar 's way , never . So he owed Skelton fifty dollars and more . And his folks . What did he owe them ? Life . But what was life ? He wished he were dead , away from everything , away from Endicott who had eyes like Hayworth 's , away from these people who were waiting to hear what he had to say about Miller . Joaquin Miller and the Frontier . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Albers ? Who was he ? They would laugh at Miller , but they would laugh more at Albers  --  laugh up their sleeves . He would prefer that they laughed out loud , a laugh one could hear and then damn to the laugher 's face . But for Skelton 's sakehe must ignore their laughter . For Skelton 's sake he must make good . " Ah , Christ ! " he said . " Ah , Christ ! " But he was n't swearing . He was praying . Praying for strength . " Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden and I will give you rest . " " I will give you rest . " There was magic in those words , so Walter Pater had said . Something supernatural . No mere man could have extended that invitation . Albers supposed that that was what Pater had meant . But how these wiseacres would laugh if they knew he was calling on Christ to help him . Scholars do n't call on Christ . They do n't need to . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . They walk about on their learned legs here and there . Back and forth in the halls of learning , in the academies , wise peripatetics , on their legs they go . Getting up out of chairs and marching up front and facing a learned audience and reading for twenty long minutes . All this without calling on Christ to help them . Who was Christ ? Who was Jesus ? Some scholars said that He had never lived at all , that He was a myth . Twenty minutes . A little chunk of eternity . And yet a big chunk , an eternity in themselves , those twenty minutes . " In my Father 's house are many mansions . " He had said that , too . But at these words also the learned men would laugh . Howardsen , with the big beard and the piping voice . He would laugh . Howardsen , who knew all about Franklin , Howardsen who was on the tail-end of his twenty minutes . Franklin and common sense . Franklin had said in a letter to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved from shipwreck he would build , not a shrine , but a lighthouse . Franklin , too , would have laughed at the words of Jesus . But would he have laughed ? You needed authority for the statement that Franklin would have laughed . Better not say that he would have laughed unless you bad stacks of footnotes . Still , no one laughed if you had enough footnotes . The highbrows would not laugh ? not even at God ? if you had authorities enough for God to stand on . Franklin and Wordsworth and Miller and God . " I come to bury Caesar . " Bury them all under a mountain of footnotes . Then the fear would all be gone out of them , and the laughter . No , not the laughter , for just then Albers began chuckling . He began chuckling over Howardsen and his twenty minutes . Twenty minutes . Howardsen had speeded up , his voice more piping than ever , his big right hand stroking nervously at his beard . It was funny , Albers thought , to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fur the seconds were flying now , and Howardsen , a big shot in the academic world , was flying along with them . A man like that should have been given oceans of time  --  forty minutes , eighty , or a thousand . But here hewas with only twenty . Why could n't Howardsen laugh at himself  --  put his paper down and laugh ? If he were dead he could laugh , for then he would know what the dead know . The laughter of the dead . What a wise laughter . Endicott was plucking at Howardsen 's coat . At the big reputation 's coat tails . " Ah , Christ ! Ah , Christ ! " Twenty minutes . Wordsworth and eighty-five thousand miles and Franklin ? And Hayworth . Hayworth with his ear eternally to one 's heart . What was he doing here ? And Endicott  --  Endicott whose voice summoned one . Endicott gave another tug at Howardsen 's coat , and Albers laughed loud and long , people turning to look at him , somebody getting up and coming towards him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once he stopped laughing . The old girl up ahead screamed and pointed her finger at him . And Endicott and Howardsen came running down the aisle , yelling for order and calling for a doctor . There was , though , no need of a doctor . Albers was dead .
