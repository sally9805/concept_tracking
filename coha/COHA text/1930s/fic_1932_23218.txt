ELMER A STORY BY ALBERT TRUMAN BOYD I ' D BEEN walking along following Pete 's tracks in the sticky snow , when the first thing I knew he grabbed the rifle out of my hand , threw it to his shoulder , and fired . He was almost on top of me , and the smell of the powder burned into my nose . He was standing still with the rifle at his shoulder , sighting along the barrel . I did n't move . Without speaking , he fired again , twice in succession . At last Pete said , " Elmer must have started him . " He kept the rifle at his shoulder and his eyes on Mill Ridge . Ransom 's Creek ran between that ridge and the one we were on . It was not a great way across , but it was growing dusk , and I thought it funny that Pete had sighted a flag at even such a distance . " Did you see him ? " I asked in a whisper . Pete nodded . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . " That old white tail just bobbed up while I was looking across . " " He was going away from Elmer , " I said . Pete nodded again . " You 're right . Elmer ca n't be more than ten rod back at the most . He does n't make very good time any more . " He looked back , past me , and I knew he was thinking of retracing our steps to the bottom of Prospect Hill . But if he was , he finally gave it up . It would be too dark to see anythingwhen we got all the way back there , so he would n't have been able to catch the buck if it did circle . " Do you think it was a. hit ? " I asked . Pete shook his head . " Hard to say . In this light it 'd be only luck . And I 'm not that lucky . " He leaned his rifle against a hemlock bough and hunted for his pipe . " Too late to take track now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Near home , too . " He smiled . " We 'll be on it before any of those village fellows come along , if they do n't happen to cross it ahead . " He put his pipe in his mouth and drew deeply , and I wondered if Pop could be persuaded to let me go along with Pete again to-morrow . Pete was our nearest neighbor , but Pop did n't waste much time on him . He 'd let me come to-day because Elmer Tracey was along . Elmer was Senior Selectman , and Pop , being a Selectman too , had a lot of business with him beside being good friends . But Elmer had to go down to Concord to-morrow , so Pop might not let me go with Pete . If he did , it meant doing chores before daybreak . But I did n't care . Pete might get that buck , and I wanted to see him . Pete put his hands to his mouth and shouted : " Hell0000 , Elmer . Hell0000 , El-mer . " A dull echo came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then started on . " Come on , Jim . " " Do you think he heard you ? " I asked Pete 's back . " Sure . He heard me . And he heard those shots . But we could n't hear him . The wind 's against him . " And it was , though I 'd forgotten it . But I wondered what Elmer Tracey thought when he heard that first shot , and then the other two . I could imagine him making his way through the brush , wishing his legs were n't so stiff , so he could have seen the buck first . Pete was ahead of me , and I kept trying to put my feet in his tracks so the snow would n't get in the top of my boots . But his strides were longer than mine . It was easier now than it had been coming up Prospect . There were some steep places going down , and sometimes there would be a slanting sheet of rock under the snow . Pete would slide down these , keeping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten miles that he did n't know with his eyes shut . We were going down the west slope of Prospect toward Pete 's place at the break of Banner Hill , and Elmer was coming along the top of Mill Ridge which came out a little below my house , for it swung this way . We were going to wait at Pete 's place for Elmer , and then he was going home and so was I. But now , if he picked up bloody tracks or found the buck , we 'd go up and get it . But I believed with Pete that if he hit , it would only be luck . He generally got a deer every year . And a lot of us thought he got a fawn or so in late summer , but nobody had ever caught him at it . Pete liked his venison  --  tender . We were almost at the bottom of Prospect , and I was sliding and sloshing along behind him , soaking wet andpretty well scratched up by hemlock branches , when he turned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up and talk to your pop about it . " " I hope he 'll let me come , " I said . Pete stood still , thinking , his eyes roving down the hill to the lights in his house . They were dim and mysterious in the heavy , wet evening . I knew why he wanted me to come along . You were only allowed to get one deer a season and if he fell one , he 'd say I shot it and he could hunt some more after that . He 'd give Pop the deer , of course , but Pop would give him back half of it . Pop did n't like this way of doing things , but Pete often got hard up during the winter , and the venison came in handy . So Pop shut his eyes and knew nothing about it . After all , we were nearest neighbors . Pete called back over his shoulder , " That is , if I did n't hit it back there , and if we can take up the track first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going away to-morrow on town business anyway . " Pete smiled . " Yes . Elmer 's got a good head for business . " That made me think of something I 'd once heard Pop say about Elmer . I guess he 'd tried to use some of the town money . But they 'd fixed it up and kept it quiet . It was before my time , and even Pop did n't seem to be very sure about it . " I hope I can go , " I told Pete . " I 'll talk to your pop , Jim . " It was all I could do to keep in his tracks for it was getting darker and I had to be careful of the young , wiry trees . I was all excited with the idea of going again to-morrow , and maybe Pete would really let me take a shot if he had good luck . I could hardly see and was n't paying much attention , so sometimes I fell . Once I landed on a slab of rock , hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , but I was up again . " Hurt yourself , Jim ? " " Just hit my shoulder a little . It 's nothing . " Soon Pete 's hound , Beadle , started baying at us . Then we came out past the barn into the road . Pop 's sleigh and mare were hitched to the woodshed . " Your pop 's waiting , " Pete said . " I 'll talk to him about to-morrow . " Then he stopped . " You let me talk to Elmer when he comes in . You and me can hunt pretty well alone . I do n't want him to change his mind about going away . " I nodded . Then I heard Pop in Pete 's kitchen . He was shouting at Christina , Pete 's wife , who was almost deal . Pete stood watching the house , and I knew he was listening to what Pop was saying . " Let 's go in , " he said . " Elmer will be right along . " Pete 's place was low and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship stranded on a big rock , which was Banner Hill . The three chimneys were three masts , and the smoke from the kitchen chimney was the flag . The house had little windows like the cannon ports of an old frigate . Sometimes when I was coming home from school late , I could see the lights in Pete 's windows from Ransom 's Flat , which was a good mile away , and I knew that the crew of the stranded frigate was signaling for help , and I 'd hurry . Pete stopped at the kitchen door . Pop was shouting at Christina , " We 're going to have the snowplow out from Milton . We have to keep the roads open for cars nowadays . " " There are n't any cows in the road , " Christina answered . " They 're all in the barn . " " No  --  cars , " shouted Pop . " Cars -- automobiles . " " Oh , " said Christina . " Cars . They ought to keep their cars to home in the winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete pushed open the door , and I followed him in . It was hot and stuffy in the kitchen . Pop was sweating on the forehead and his gray hair was plastered there . " Hello , " said Pete . Pop nodded . " Hello . " " High time you were home , " said Christina . The hound , Beadle , set up a terrible racket in the woodshed where she was chained . " I guess that 's Elmer coming , " said Pete . " We separated over at the far end of Mill Ridge . He started across the Ridge , and Jim and I came along Prospect . There was n't much chance , but I thought we could cover more ground that way . " " Did you pick up a track ? " " No , " said Pete , shaking his head . " But we got a shot , did n't we , Jim ? It was too dark though . I just saw its white tail twice , like this ? " and he waved his hand above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pete shrugged . " We shot once , then twice more . It 'd he only luck if I hit . You could hardly see . " Pop nodded . " Maybe Elmer found him , or the track . " " Perhaps , " said Pete . " I called , but the wind was against him , so I could n't hear if he did answer . " " That 's right , " said Pop . " Wind 's been out of the east all afternoon . " " Yes , it is time to eat , " said Christina , busying herself over the stove . " Well , " said Pop . " Time to be getting home , Jim . I guess the chores are still waiting . " " Get me a lantern , Chris , " shouted Pete . " I 'll ride up the road with you , " he told Pop . " I want to see how those tracks lay . If I did n't get her I want to be on them first thing in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll probably meet him , " said Pop . " Come along . " " I 'll be back soon , " Pete said in Christina 's ear as she handed him the lighted lantern . She nodded . We went out and climbed in the sleigh . I sat on Pete 's knees . We drove up the road by the broken pine and started through the woods . The trees were dropping melting snow and it was misty . It had n't turned cold at dark . It was more like sap-running weather than mid-December . The mare 's ears stood straight up , though she did n't hear anything but Beadle baying after us . Her hoofs sloshed down through the wet snow and sometimes she slipped on the softening ice beneath . There was a nice smell of pine in the woods , and I kept thinking of early spring . " Elmer ought to be along by now , " said Pop . " He ought , " Pete answered . " We started together . It is n't much nearer across Prospect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And harder going . " We kept our ears open as we went along , but it would have been hard to hear anything over the mare 's bells and the slosh-slosh of her gait . Then Pop said , " I did n't know you and Elmer hunted together . " Pete smiled . " We do n't generally . I thought it would be a good idea , just to show there was n't any hard feel- Pop did n't say anything , but this almost made me laugh , for there had been a difference between Pete and Elmer Tracey . Pete had sold him a cow that could n't carry a calf full time . Pop said it was a mean trick , because Pete knew all about the cow and Elmer did n't . Then Pete said , " Sure there was a little trouble between us . Elmer did n't like that cow I sold him three years back . And I did n't like the way he raised my taxes . " He shrugged his shoulders . " But what was the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise a lot of people 's taxes , " Pop said . " If they want roads to run their cars on they have to pay for them . Well , be that as it may , here we are . " And he drew off the road . I got out , and Pete stood up in the sleigh , cupping his hands to his mouth : " Hell0000 , Elmer . Hell0000 ? " No answer came through the heavy , dripping night . The mare stamped the balled snow from her feet , and Pop tied her to a tree . " That 's funny , " said Pete . " It is , " said Pop . " We 'd better take a look . " We climbed over the barbed-wire fence . Pete went first with the lantern , then came Pop , then me . We had to cross about ten rods of fairly level ground before we began to mount the end of Mill Ridge . None of us had anything to say and all of us kept our eyes on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was pretty useless . There was just a dim blur of light cast by Pete 's lantern , and besides , the going was so bad and heavy that we had to pay strict attention . Once Pete said , " Elmer might have quit , turned off , gone down across the creek and up over Prospect behind Jim and me , and on toward the village . " " That do n't sound likely , " said Pop . Long before , my grandfather had dug for gold on Prospect , at least that was what people said . But Pop said it was n't so , that he had dug for copper . Of on the far side of the hill you could still find some of the old diggings , and we used to play buried treasure in them . They were n't very deep , and no metal had been found . As we went on and up I kept stum-tiling and slipping and I had a hard time to keep from falling . I could see nothing but the soft , uncertain blur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . All of a sudden the big round trunk of a white birch would swing into the light , or more often the straight stem of a maple , then Pete would turn aside , then Pop , then me . We were just like a grass-snake or a thousandlegger , always keeping in line . Just before we got to the level stretch along the top of the Ridge we stopped . " I 'll can again , " said Pete . " It 's funny that we have n't run on to him . " " I 'll call , " said Pop . He took off his hat , threw back his head , filled his chest , and bellowed Elmer 's name . Pop had a fine , big voice when he let it out . Even in the murky night it rang through the valley , back and forth between Mill Ridge and Prospect . I was sure Christina must have been able to hear that . Mom could have heard it up home without any trouble at all . " You 'll wake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pete laughed , but there was no answer , and they both looked worried . " Queer , " said Pete . Pop nodded . " It is that . " We stood stock still for two or three minutes . Pete kept looking off through the trees . Pop kept his head bent , looking at the lantern sitting in the snow and the ring of light around it . Finally Pete said , " I do n't hear a thing but the snow falling off the trees . He must have cut across the valley . He said he wanted to get home in fair season . " Pop rubbed his forehead thoughtfully . It was wet from the climb . " I guess we 'd best go on and make sure , anyway . " " All right , " said Pete . " I want to locate those tracks , too . But you 'll find Elmer 's cut off . " " Might be you 're right , " Pop said . " But I doubt it . " He looked upset . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been something important to make him so late with the chores and supper . Mom was pretty particular about us being on time . Then I had an idea . " Maybe Elmer turned up the road and is at our place ? " Pete laughed . " If he is , he 'll hear what I think of him . He said he 'd come down to mine . " " No . I do n't think he 'd do that . He has to get home , " Pop said . That pretty well put me where I belonged , and I was getting tired and wished I 'd gone on home myself . There was work waiting for us before supper . Then I heard Pete say , " Well , we 're on top . Ca n't be more than a quarter of a mile to where I saw the buck , but Elmer might not have come that far . Perhaps lie did n't come up the other end of the Ridge at all . He might have gone on home by the other road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't he ? " Pop asked gruffly. yes , , " Well , then I expect he came . " Walking along the top of the Ridge was pretty much the same , only you did n't have to push so much with your legs . And there were some open places , and once Pete led us along the edge looking down into the valley , and we could hear Beadle baying faintly . " Wind 's still this way , " said Pop . Pete did n't say anything , but he kept right on , holding his lantern at an angle so that he could see underfoot . I do n't know how much Pop could see , but I could n't see a thing . I just stumbled along blindly , sometimes bumping into Pop and sometimes having to hurry to catch up . My shoulder was still sore and my back was tired from stooping under branches . ELMER At last Pete said , " It ca n't be a whole lot farther . I figured it was half to three-quarters of a mile from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my place . We must be that far from the road now . " Pop nodded . " Yes , we 're that far . But let 's go on a bit , and keep along the edge . You could n't have seen it if it was back in any distance . It must have been in a clearing . " " Even if Pete hit it , the buck might have traveled farther , " I said . " All we need is to find the tracks , " said Pop . Pete turned and led on again . " You 're right . We 'll keep along the edge . " Sometimes Webster school would have a picnic up here just before the term closed in June . And I 'd explored all over the Ridge alone and with Harry or one of the other boys . But it all looked strange to-night . I kept looking for big rocks and twisted trees that I knew , but I could n't find a thing . I was glad Pop was along . It was so late that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyhow , I was getting enough of deer hunting  --  which was mostly walking and waiting . I wanted to be home eating supper with Pop and Mom and playing with my baby brother , Don . We had a secret language of our own . I 'd put my lips against his soft neck right below his ear and whisper , and he 'd laugh and laugh and get both hands full of my hair and pull . Then he 'd shake his head till you 'd think it 'd come loose and make a whole string of noises which I was pretty sure I knew the meaning of . But best of all I liked Suddenly Pete stopped and stood staring ahead . Pop and I came up , one on each side . For a minute I did n't see anything . Then Pete moved the lantern , and I could see better . Elmer 's gray head lay half buried in the soft snow , and beyond that , the crumpled bulk of his shoulders . His red hunting cap lay nearby , and at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pop and Pete went forward and bent down . Pop turned Elmer over and studied the brownish , lined face , with its full beard and open eyes . Then we all saw the hole in his leather hunting jacket , over the right breast . One of the white-cotton work gloves he was wearing had brown stains on the palm and fingers . Pop said , " You hold the lantern , Jim . Pete , we 'd better take a look at him . " Together they turned Elmer over and rested him against a rock so that he was half sitting up . Pop undid his leather jacket and the clothes underneath , then put his hand over his heart . After a long minute he said , " Elmer 's dead , all right . Let 's take a look around . " The men got up and walked about . We were in a little clearing full of naked brush and with only one or two stripling birches . " He came in this way , " I heard Pop say . " He climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid off . See ? " " I see , " said Pop . Then they came back . Suddenly Pete started , stooped , and pulled off one of Elmer 's white cotton work gloves . " See this ? This is what I saw . He was standing on that rock . He must have seen us and was calling and waving . It was dusk . I could just see this white glove moving , and I thought it was a buck 's tail as he jumped . The wind was against him . We could n't hear . " " That 's right , " I said . " We could n't hear a thing . " Pop looked at me . " Could you see anything ? " I shook my head . " No . I 'd been walking along , trying to keep in Pete 's tracks . I was n't expecting him to get another chance . All at once he grabbed the rifle out of my hand and fired . He said he saw a flag jump . It was getting pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood staring first at Elmer 's bearded face , then at the glove in Pete 's hand . At last he shrugged his shoulders as if he was very tired and said , " You 'd better go down and unhitch the mare , Pete . Bring her up that old woods road . And bring the length of rope from under the seat . We 'll have to get Elmer out of here and we ca n't carry him . " " All right , " said Pete . " You see , I only saw that white thing wave once or twice and I thought sure it was a buck 's tail . I never thought Elmer would have got up this far already . Jim and I had been moving right along , and Elmer 's not as young as he was once . " Pop nodded . " I know . I know . There 's no doubt it was an accident . It would be pretty hard to hit at this distance in the dark , except by chance . " Pete looked at Pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll get the mare , " and started off in the darkness . Pop waited till he could n't hear Pete any longer , then shook his head . " Yes , an accident , all right . But it will be a long time before the town finds another man as smart at handling money as Elmer was . They 'll miss him . " Then he turned to me . " It was an accident , was n't it ? It could n't have been anything else ? " I shook my head . " I do n't see how it could have . " Pop nodded . " Here , hold the lantern close . I 'll take a look at him . " He opened the leather coat again and underneath it undid a cloth jacket and folded it back . On the right side , near where the bullet had gone through , there was a safety pin fastening the inside pocket . " If he 's got anything on him of value , I 'll take care of it . It might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his hand inside . For a long time be kept it there , feeling and thinking . He kept staring at Elmer 's face as if there was something he could n't understand . Then he turned to me . " Go over to that rock and look at those leverwoods back of it . Maybe you can see where those other shots struck . " I left the lantern and went over to the rock on which Elmer must have stood . I felt a little funny about it , because he 'd stood up there and practically beckoned for a shot . He should have thought of those white gloves . I could n't see much , but I ran my hands up and down the hard leverwood stems . It did n't make any difference whether I found anything or not . Pop just wanted me out of the way for a little , that was all . Pop was a Selectman , and now that Elmer was dead , Senior Selectman ; so beside being Elmer 's friend , this was really his business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of green paper in his hand . I knew it was a railroad ticket . Probably Elmer 's ticket to Concord . On his knee lay a long envelope and two letters . " Jim , " Pop called . I went back . Pop looked perplexed . " Did Elmer say anything about going away ? " I nodded , looking first at Pop and then at the ticket . " Yes . He was going to Concord to-morrow on town business . " Pop thought for a long time , then asked , " Did he say anything else ? " I shook my head . " Not about that . He and Pete talked about the taxes on Pete 's place and he told Pete that he would be fixed up all right . " Pop nodded and knelt in the snow , looking at Elmer 's face . Every once in awhile he 'd shake his head . He semed to forget the ticket in his hand , and I had a good look at it . Pop had promised to take me to Concord some day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long strip of paper was the name Montreal , and I wondered some about that because I was pretty sure you did n't have to go through Montreal . I did know that sometimes two or three of the men in the village would go there on a spree , but Elmer Tracey was n't a drinking man , so it could n't be anything like that . Without turning , Pop asked , " Did Elmer say anything about money  --  paying a note  --  a town note ? " " Not that I recall . I guess I heard all they said , but I ca n't remember anything about a note . He just said that he was going to Concord on town business . " Pop nodded and raised his shoulders slowly . Then I got a good look at the envelope . It was open , and if it was town business it would be in Pop 's care now . And it must have been town business for there was money in it . It looked like a lot of money , so maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pop seemed to remember where he was . He folded up the ticket , closed the envelope , and put them in his pocket along with the two other letters . He stood up and listened for the mare 's bells . " I wish Pete would come along . Mom will be worrying about the chores and supper . " He smiled to himself . " I guess Elmer wo n't need that money now . " Then he put his hand on myshoulder . I 'd forgotten how sore it was . " Were you and Elmer alone at any time this afternoon ? " " Yes , " I said . " We waited by the road while Pete went a little way up Home Hill to look for tracks . " Pop nodded . " Good  --  Good  --  Well , while you were alone he gave you that long envelope to give to me , " He looked at me hard , then smiled . " You know if I ever catch you lying tan your hide properly . But if you ever forget that Elmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something you 'll not forget for a long , long time . " I nodded . His hand tightened on my shoulder , and I had to hold my breath to keep from crying out . Then he turned his head . Very faintly the sound of the mare 's bells reached us . Pop looked relieved . Then he held his eyes on Elmer for a Iong time . The jingle of the bells was coming nearer and we could hear Pete swear when the mare slipped . Pop turned his head in the direction of the woods road , then said slowly , " Yes , this certainly must have been an accident . " " Sure it was an accident , " I said . " What with the distance and the poor light , even Pete could n't have made a hit except by luck . " And then the bobbing eyes of the mare caught the lantern light and burned like coals . Pop smiled gravely . " Yes , it was luck , all right . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
