VIID O N'T TALK ABOUT IT , " Sam told me kindly . " You 'll only say things you 'll regret . Mr. Browne is a fine , good man , but he 's a clergyman . Clergymen ca n't endure contradiction , and they 're pretty apt to be scared to death of anything that might damage their high standing in the community . Always remember that when you talk to a clergyman . I know how you feel . You 've got knots in your brain because of the things he said to you . I get them myself whenever he talks to me . We 'll go to Stoodley 's and have some rum to loosen the knots . " I may have felt a little better by the time we stood beneath the twin whale-oil lamps that flank the front door of Stoodley 's Tavern ; but my mind was numb , and though I was conscious that someone nearby was talking , the words spoken meant nothing to me . Sam shook me a little . " He 's talking to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulky figure and the moist round face of Cap Huff . He was in working garb of leather shirt and leather small clothes ; and I could only think , as I stared at this clumsy ox of a man , how Elizabeth and her father would hate the sight of him . " What do you want ? " I asked . He came closer , exuding a powerful odor of sweat and rum . " Where you been ? I ai nt seen you for months . You ai nt drunk , are you ? " I shook my head , but he continued to scrutinize me closely . " If you 'd like a drink , " I said , " come into Stoodley 's . That 's what we 're going in for : to get a drink . Sam tells me if I have a drink , it 'll take the knots out of my brain . " " Knots ? " Cap said . " You are too drunk ! You better go down to the Deer Tavern . They got rum down there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll sober you up good . " He lowered his voice . " I got to find Hunk . You seen Hunk ? " 40NORTHWEST PASSAGE 41When I said I had n't , he asked when I expected to cross the river to Kittery . I seemed unable to make up my mind . " I knew it , " he said . " You better wait right here , and not try to cross alone in this condition . I 'll be back pretty quick , so 's to see you get over all right . " Sam Livermore coughed politely and said , " I 'll keep him here till you come back . " Cap nodded approvingly and went lumbering down the street , while I wondered vaguely what was in the wind . Stoodley 's , when we entered , was doing a roaring business . It was the most fashionable of all the Portsmouth inns  --  so fashionablein fact , that from the profits of its nightly sales of lobsters and liquor , Stoodley , only two years later , built his Earl of Halifax Tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosiness of its taproomand the quality of its food and drink , has no superior in Pennsylvania , Maryland or even Virginia . The tap-room at Stoodley 's was long , wainscoted and ceiled with first-growth pine the color of maple syrup ; and at its far end was a bar with a sort of Dutch oven behind it . A bed of coals burned nightly in this open oven , even ' in hot weather , for broiling the small lobsters , fresh from the Piscataqua , for which Stoodley 's is famous . In summer , the hinged roof above the oven was drawn up , allowing the heat to escape and the room to remain cool . In winter , with the roof closed , the oven radiated a rosy glow ; and no matter how wildly the wind howled from the Isles of Shoals , or how high the drifts were piled in the streets without , Stoodley 's tap-room was a delight . Young bloods , and old ones too , dropped in after an evening of business or pleasure for a glass of buttered rum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the lobsters with a quart or two of Stoodley 's ale . Because of the number of King 's Councillors who frequented Stoodley 's , the rich merchants who entertained their ship captains and supercargoes , and the members of St. John 's Lodge of Masons who trooped down for refreshment from their lodge-room on the third floor , Stoodley had built connecting private rooms along42 NORTHWEST PASSAGEone side of his tap room ; and it was toward one of these rooms that Sam turned me . He patted my shoulder . " Everything 'll be all right , " he assured me . " In a day or two you 'll forget this ever happened . " He called cheerfully for a pitcher of buttered rum , and gave instructions for four small lobsters to be broiled six minutes if the fire was a hot one . In spite of his cheerfulness , I knew he was wrong . I 'd never get over what Elizabeth had done to me . " Here , " Sam said , when the rum was put before us , " here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He watched me critically while I drank ; then spoke earnestly . " Langdon , you 're making a mistake ! The Brownes are gentlefolk . They 're afraid of anything that 's different from what they 're accustomed to . Never tell people what you really think , if it 's at all different from what they think , because it sets ' em against you on general principles . You handled ' em badly . You started wrong-end to . You ought to have told ' em you would n't be an artist for a duke 's income , and then fixed so they 'd have begun begging you to be an artist . " " It 's possible , " I admitted . " It 's certain ! " Sam exclaimed . " There 's plenty of rich men in Portsmouth . Let me go around and talk to ' em a while , and in a few years they 'd contribute the money to make you an artist . You could even make money yourself while you 're waiting . Why , this town 's a-crawl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , I 'd give up the law tomorrow , so to take advantage of some of ' em . Look : all you need is a schooner ! Load her with anything beaver hats , barrel staves , salt fish , warming pans , ice  --  and sail her to the Sugar Islands . Sell your cargo there , buy rum and coffee with the proceeds : then sail her to England and dispose of vessel as well as cargo . You could make five hundred percent profit on a venture like that ! " " That may be , " I said , " but I do n't believe that would help me with Elizabeth . " " Certainly it would , " Sam protested . " She would n't care what you did as long as you had money . " NORTHWEST PASSAGE 43At the look on my face he coughed . " I do n't mean it just that way , " he added hastily . " She could n't marry without her father 's consent , of course , and she 'd know that if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of importance in the community . " He poured himself another glass of rum and drank it . " I 'm afraid you 're right , " I said . " I 'm afraid the best people in this town do n't care what you do as long as you have money . And I 'm afraid that if anyone was able to make money , and wilfully stopped making it in order to be something undignified , like an artist or an author , he 'd just be cast out and stoned . " " Nonsense ! " Sam said . " As for letting rich men help me study painting , " I continued " I could n't do it . If they help me , they 'll expect me to paint the way they like instead of the way I like . " " Oh , my God ! " Sam protested . " What 's more , " I said , " if I went to making money , as you suggest , I might not be able to stop . It might do to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . " Sam 's voice was suddenly brittle . " Well , well ! We 're a little above ourselves this evening , are n't we ? Just who do you mean when you speak of the best people ? " " You know who I mean . I mean the chosen of God : the Episcopalians ! They sing God Save the King and think Benning Wentwortha great and good Tian . " " Huzza ! Huzza ! " Sam cried satirically . " Here are the lobsters . " The door opened . One of Stoodley 's slaves  --  all of whom were named Duke , Prince , King , Earl , Baron or something similar  --  bustled in with four lobsters on a platter , and two mugs of ale . When he saw me sitting glumly , making no move to regale myself , he cried , in a shrill voice , " Heah ! Ah grabbed those lobsters right offa coals ! Why n't you git at ' em , Mist ' Towne ? ' Ey 's sweeter'n hot lobster-milk , yarsuh ! " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tender bodies from their shells and dipping them in melted butter . They. 44 NORTHWEST PASSAGEwere , as Duke had said , not unlike hot curds , juicy and tender , and sweet as scorched honey from ocean depths . Sam , his mouth full , speared half a lobster tail and waved it appreciatively at Duke , who shuffled from the room , appeased . Neither Sam nor I spoke again until we had demolished even the claws , and washed them down with Stoodley 's creamy ale . " There ! " Sam said , passing me a Cuban cigarro and lighting one himself , " I guess the world looks brighter to you , does n't it ? Come to think of it , not all honest men are dead yet , are they ? " " Certainly not , " I admitted . " There 's a lot of honest men in Portsmouth  --  men who do n't approve of the way the province is being milked . My father 's an honest man . So are the Langdons and the Pickerings and the Penhallows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have n't any power . The power 's in the hands of those who distribute the positions  --  those who chuckle and slap themselves every time Benning Wentworth makes a joke . " " Not so loud , cully , " Sam said . " Better lower your voice ! There 's too many talc-bearers in this town . " He glanced over his shoulder at the door separating us from the adjoining private room . " So , " I said , " I must n't speak the truth then ! I must n't be a painter and I must n't speak the truth , or else I 'll be in trouble ! " I waggled a forefinger at him . " Especially I must n't speak the truth about the best people ! Did you ever hear what the best people of Ipswich did to some ladies of my family ? They were good women ; but they were called witches and hanged ! Have n't you heard what happened to Richard Shortridge for marrying Molly Pitman when Benning Wentworth wanted her ? " Sam shrugged his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't I ? Go talk to seamen who know what 's happening in the British navy ! Two weeks after the wedding , Benning Wentworth arranged for a press gang to steal Shortridge out of his own home , press him into a British ship and keep him there for life . He 's on a British frigate today ; and for all I know , Wentworth 's still trying to coax Molly down to Little Harbor . " " Who told you this claptrap ? " Sam demanded . " It sounds 1ikt . NORTHWEST PASSAGE 45Anna Marriner 's tarradiddle , or something out of your flannelmouthedfriend Cap Huff . " " Well , " I said , " what about the grants of land being made by Benning Wentworth in this province ? He 's granting big tracts to outsiders at enormous fees , is n't he  --  or is that claptrap and tarradiddle , too ? " Sam eyed me warily . " Is n't Benning Wentworth , " I persisted , " reserving a fivehundred-acrepiece for himself out of every grant , with the understanding that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I know nothing about it , " Sam said . " That 's strange ! I thought everybody knew about it ! I thought everybody knew he 'd stolen a hundred thousand acres from this province ! Why , it 's common talk that thanks to Benning Wentworthand his brother Mark , the whole province has been stripped of its forests , and half the money for the lumber 's in Benning 's pocket . Where 've you been that you do n't know about it ? How does it happen a lawyer does n't know it 's impossible to get justice in this province unless you go on your knees to the Wentworths ? My , my ! Think of a lawyer not knowing that they own Wyseman Clagett , the new King 's Attorney , right here in this town ! Maybe you never heard Wyseman Clagett knows a hundred and seven different ways to have you put in jail if he does n't like your looks ! Maybe you never heard you 'd be Clagetted if you try to run contrary to Benning Wentworth 's schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packer take pennies off dead men 's eyes and divide ' em with Wentworth ! " Sam buried his nose in his mug of ale and said nothing . " I had to listen to the Reverend Arthur Browne , " I said , " because he 's Elizabeth 's father ; but I do n't have to keep silent when you want me to think you admire the leaders of this town . Do you admire Lettice Mitchel 's father and mother for making her marry Wyseman Clagett  --  for having a higher regard for any rogue in a King 's uniform than for an honest man in ordinary dress ? Do you admire Wyseman Clagett for beating Lettice twice a week ? Do46 NORTHWEST PASSAGEyou admire Clagett and Packer for sending constables to incite seamen to resist arrest ; then fining ' em ten shillings apiece so the King 's Attorney and the High Sheriff can be kept in food and wines ? I suppose if Wyseman Clagett and Thomas Packer came in here and took my clothes by force , you 'd admire them ! " Upon that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not the door into the big tap-room , but one leading into the private room adjoining ours  --  swung open , revealing a face and figure that sent a chill down my spine . Wyseman Clagett , King 's Attorney for the Province of New Hampshire , stood there looking at me horribly . He was a large man with heavy eyebrows , black eyes and a dismaying nervous affliction . Every moment or so his mouth , convulsivelycontorted , was drawn so far to one side that he seemed to be trying to eat his ear , and at the moment of this distortion his bushy eyebrows jerked together like two black caterpillars wrestling . Temper made Wyseman 's facial disturbance worse ; children screamed and mules ran away at the sight of it . He was worse now as he looked at me through the open door ; while I , speechless , looked back at him . Sam jumped to his feet and turned toward the door ; then Clagett walked in , and close behind him came Thomas Packer , the High Sheriff  --  the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Packer was a gloomy-looking man , as indeed he should have been . In the room from which they emerged I saw a table littered with lobster shells and ale mugs , so I was sure they had been there as long as we , and probably longer  --  long enough , certainly , to have heard easily , through the thin partition , every word I 'd said . Sam was the first to find his voice . " To what are we indebted for the pleasure ? " he asked politely . Clagett , grotesque but imposing in his long , scarlet-lined councillor'scloak , spoke in his surprisingly high-pitched voice . " Mr. Livermore , I 've nothing against you , but I find you in dangerous company . I think you and I can understand each other without unnecessary formalities . so I 'll bid you good evening . " NORTHWEST PASSAGE 47 " Mr. Attorney , " Sam said , " Langdon Towne 's my guest . If you 're here to say something to him , say it to me as well . " Clagett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks the same sauce as the goose ! Sir , you 'd like me to think , would you , that you 're in sympathy with all Mr. Towne 's opinions ? " " I 'm not familiar with all Mr. Towne 's opinions , " Sam said . " As for my sympathies , they 're nobody 's business but my own  --  until they 're expressed . But that 's not the question , sir . The question is why you 've joined us without an invitation  --  without doing us the courtesy of knocking , even . " " Oh , " Clagett said , " that 's easily answered . I 'm here to prevent repetitions of libels upon His Majesty 's government and officers . Perhaps , sir , you wish to defend libels upon His Majesty 's repre-sentatives ? " " Certainly not ! " Sam protested . " Certainly I do n't wish to defendlibels , no matter who it is that 's libelled . " Clagett 's high voice was stern . " Then , sir , you 've no business ; here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . Sheriff , open that door and give Mr. Livermore any necessary assistance ! " For all Packer 's heavy appearance , he could move rapidly when he wished ; and he moved rapidly now . Reaching for the door into the tap-room , he drew it open , placed a huge hand against Sam 's back and ejected him as easily as a man lifts an ale-mug . With equal rapidity he closed the door behind Sam and shot the bolt . I saw the latch rise and fall , and knew Sam was vainly trying to force his way back in . I realized that my goose , as they say in Kittery , was cooked , and that Sam could do nothing for me without ruining himself . Clagett looked at me , his eyebrows wrestling and his mouth trying to eat his ear . " Do you wish to make a statement ? " he asked me . I tried to keep my voice from shaking . " Why should I make any statement ? " " Because you 've made yourself liable to serious charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libel ! " Clagett struck the table with his open palm 48 NORTHWEST PASSAGE " You slandered me ; you slandered my wife . You libelled that great and good man , our Governor , Benning Wentworth . You repeated shameful rumors concerning the whereabouts of Richard Shortridge  --  lies , all lies ! Now I want to know the source of them . Who spread these poisons to you ? Who told you ? " breathed hard and shook my head ; that was all I could do . " You stand in some peril , " Clagett warned me . " I want the source of these calumnies . " " Calumnies ? " I tried to speak up . " I 'd be the last to repeat calumnies about innocent men . " " What ! " Clagett shouted . " What do you say ? " I was a frightened boy , but at his shout I somehow contrived to hold my head up . " I do n't believe they 're calumnies . " " Ah , " said Clagett and turned to the sheriff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceable community . No communication permitted with such a prisoner , Sheriff ! No communicationwhatever with anyone ! " " You do n't dare ! " I told him . " You do n't dare to bring me into a court and have me repeat what I said to my friend in this room . " Clagett made no answer ; he just pulled his cloak around himandgrinned . Then I understood that of course I 'd never see the inside of a court ; that I 'd never have recourse to the processes of justice ; that I 'd never even know the mercy of a judge owned by Benning Wentworth . Clagett planned to treat me , I realized , as Richard Shortridge had been treated . He planned to have me pressed aboard a British man-of-war  --  a prison from which there would be no appeal and almost no escape . " Wait ! " I cried out like a fool . " I demand to have word taken to my family ! I demand the right to see a lawyer : to see Sam Livermore . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of drink ! Not to be spoken to or even approached by anybody ! I hold you responsible ! " He waved Packer towad the door . In the next room  --  the private room from which Clagett and Packer had descended upon us  --  there was a clatter , followed by the crash of an overturned table and breaking chinaware . A hoarseNORTHWEST PASSAGE 49voice cursed loudly , bellowing , " Who 's raving from drink ? I want to hear him doing it ! Ai nt there enough for other people to get raving from ? " The half-closed door swung open , and in the doorway stood Cap Huff , breezy , enormous , bright-eyed , almost sober . ICHAPTER VIIICAP STOOD looking at us earnestly : then hitched up his breeches and came in ponderously , closing the door behind him . " Which one 's raving from drink ? " he asked . " Clagett , maybe ? Hunk Marriner tells me his mother , old Anner Marriner , had a good bit of money twisted out of her by Clagett only today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right and natural if he 's drunk and raving this evening . How you feeling , Mr. Clagett ? Good ? " Clagett turned to Packer . " Take them both , Sheriff . No com- munication with anyone for either of them . " " Take who both , Sheriff ? " Cap asked heartily . " I just stepped in to see that no communications from Royal representatives of the Crown did n't get young Langdon Towne here into evil also- ciations , and ruin him with their liquor . You three gentlemen been having a nice supper together ? I do n't like to interfere in friend- ship 's jolly hours , but it 's time this here boy went home , or his family 'll be fretted . " He went to the window and ripped down the curtain that covered it . " Why , " he said inconsequentially , " this room 's on an alley , just like the jail that everybody gets out of . The tide 's falling , and it 's a hell of a paddle across the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I ca n't , " I said . " I 've been arrested . " " You 'd ought to be , " Cap said solemnly , with a gesture toward Clagett and Packer . " Consorting with evil companions ! You 'd ought to be ! " " Sheriff ! " Clagett spoke harshly to Packer . " You have your orders . These men are under arrest . Are you going to take them to " I will , " Packer said ; but he did n't . Instead he tried to imitate the King 's Attorney 's manner . " You , " he said to Cap Huff , " are a hissing and a by-word in this town . You 've attempted to inter- fere with the King 's justice , and you 're a hissing and a by-word. " 5o NORTHWEST PASSAGE 51 " I 'm a by-word , " Cap said , " but I ai nt no hissing . I been a bywordin this town since I was seven years old and stole the minister'sbreeches . I can prove I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , but the man that calls me a hissing , he 's got to take and set down and eat it ! " He took Packer by the shoulders , rammed him down into a chair . " Packer , set down ! " Clagett strode toward the door that opened into the tap-room . " You fool , " he said to Cap Huff . " Do you suppose there was ever a night when there were no constables in Stoodley 's tap-room ? " " Call ' em in , " Cap Huff told him . " Open the door and call ' em in ! " Clagett jerked the door open , and the opening was almost filled with the broad-shouldered figure of Hunking Marriner . Hunk pushed Clagett back into the room , came in himself , closed the door behind him , and bolted it . Hunk 's mouth was drawn down at the corners . His face was ' white and his clothes were torn and muddy . He stood with his back to the door and , not speaking , looked hard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat him down beside Packer . " Do n't make much of a noise , gentlemen , " he said , " because if you try , I 'll load up your mouth with lobster shells till you wont be able to make even no hissing .

Hunk Marriner do n't like you neither , Mr. Clagett . " Cap , standing before the two seated men , with one hand on Packer 's shoulder and the other on Clagett 's , turned his head to speak to me . " Hunk 's going with you , Langdon . " " Going where with me ? " I asked . " Where you ai nt neither of you arrested , " Cap said . " Where you wont neither of you get pressed on a King 's ship , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Clagett this afternoon , Langdon . Hunk 's mother got Clagetted over a load of fish , just around sundown . Clagett wanted fish for supper , but he didn't52 NORTHWEST PASSAGE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 53want to pay for it , so he played the old trick him and Packer have played so often ; Packer had a couple of constables arrest her for profanity , and fined her five dollars . She paid her fine with the fish , and Clagett and Packer divided ' em . " Cap gave Clagett an admonitory slap on the top of the head . " How 'd you come to forget about Hunk , Mr. Clagett ? You 'd ought a remembered Hunk would n't like such goings on ! I 'm surprised you got any constables left , seeing that two of ' em wont be out of the hospital for a month , and that it took four more to throw Hunk in that damned old jail of yours .

In case Mr. Clagett do n't understand what you mean about your mother , I 'll explain it to him later . " His tone became querulous . " Why do n't you fellers get started so I can stop talking ? " Hunk swung himself over the ledge of the open window and dropped lightly to the ground . I scrambled after him , and then , standing on tiptoe , looked back into the lighted room . " Hurry , Cap , " I said . " You know you 've got to come too , do n't you ? " " I certainly do , " he answered , laughed boorishly and , for so huge a man , became a marvel of agility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he kicked the chairs of the King 's Attorney and the High Sheriff from under them , left them rolling and grunting upon the floor : then sprang across the room , squeezed himself through the window and dropped at my side . " Good-bye , bully boys , " he said . " There 's three of us better leave town a spell . It just happens I got a dear old grandma I ought a visit  --  keeps the Seaman 's Tavern in Newburyport ; so I 'm off to the south'ard while you two go north , I hope you 'll " He checked himself as an outrageous uproar was heard fromwithin Stoodley 's . " Well , suppose we all commence a-running , " Cap said , and these words , and a hoarse laugh from the darkness , and a heavy padding of his feet down the alley , were the last Hunk Marriner and I heard from Cap Huff as we turned and ran for the river . CHAPTER IXHUNK AND I crouched in the canoe under Spring Wharf 11 and kindled a lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles , perhaps because of the glimmering of the slimy green weed with which they were coated and the pressure of the rapid current against their lower ends , seemed about to engulf us , like a drippingdark forest . They had a dank , oppressive odor  --  a singular combination , seemingly , of mud , sulphur , saltpeter and decay ; and as I crouched among them in that wet canoe , I laughed feebly , thinking that as dusk had fallen that same night , I 'd sat with Elizabeth Browne in her mother 's parlor , a respectable young man who 'd been a student at Harvard and hoped to be a painter . Hunk had with him a letter to me from Sam Livermore , hastily scrawled in the tap-room of Stoodley 's . " Hurry up and read it ! " Hunk urged me . " Sam said not to waste any time getting away . He said I hit one of those constables kind of hard . " I broke the seal on Sam 's letter and unfolded two sheets . While Hunk held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Nobody will try to make trouble for you , as you will then be a hero . Trust me to look out for your interests with Elizabeth and Mr. Browne . Tell your father you could n't help what happened . Providence was against you today . " " Be careful of that other letter , " Hunk said . " Sam 's a Mason , and he 's put Masonic signs in it .

Mr. Towne has been educated at Harvard . Owing to a slight difference of opinion with the civil authorities of this locality , I have suggested to them the advisability of temporarily exercising their talents in your vicinity . If you can find places for them in your detachments , I will consider it a personal favor and will also guarantee they will make good soldiers . Accept , gentlemen , the assurance of my deepest consideration and high personal regard . Yr. obedient humble servant , Sam'l Livermore . " We dowsed the lantern , pushed out from under the wharf , and set off across the swirling black water of the Piscataqua . Half an hour later Hunk left me at our front door , promising to return as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house reluctantly , dreading the ordeal before me . The downstairs rooms were heavy with the feel of sleep . As I mounted the stairs , I heard my mother 's drowsy voice : " Is that you , Langdon ? " When I said it was , she murmured something about " all hours of the night " and told me to bolt the front door . I went on up the stairs and into the back room overlooking the river , which I shared with my younger brother , Odiorne . When I struck a light , Odiorne blinked , muttered inarticulately , and turned his face to the wall . Pulling off my jacket and shirt , I dragged my horse-hide trunk from beneath the eaves . Crown Point , I suspected , would be cold , 56 NORTHWEST PASSAGEso I took my leather shirt and breeches , woolen undershirts , a towcloth shirt for hot days , three pairs of stockings , and both tanned and untanned moccasins . Mindful of Sam 's hint that I might have spare time on my hands , I also added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencils . My mother pattered into the room , a shawl thrown over her nightdress . " Why , Langdon ! What 's this mean ? Did you know you did n't bolt the front door ? " " Mother , " I said , " I had a little trouble . I got to go away for a while . " Odiorne muttered complainingly in his sleep . My mother sat down suddenly on the bed , looking weak and tired . " What kind of trouble , son ? " " Trouble with Wyseman Clagett . He heard me talk against him and the Governor and pretty near the whole Episcopal Church . He almost put me in jail , Mother . " ' I gave her Sam Livermore 's letters . She felt at her breast for her opectacles , and I saw that her eyes were full of tears . " Here , " I said , " 1 ' 11 read ' em to you .

My father came slowly in , rumpled and gray in his nightgown , and behind him I saw Ehen , Richard and Enoch , my older brothers . My father 's face was rigid , and I felt that now I was in for it and no mistake . I took my brown blanket from the trunk and arranged my effects on it , so to roll it . When I picked up my sketch book , my ears burned in anticipation of what he would say . " Son , " my father asked , " how 'd you happen to be talking against Wyseman Clagett and the Governor ?

" " Yes , sir . I felt pretty bad about it , so Sam Livermore took me to Stoodley 's . I felt so bad that I said anything that came into my head . Clagett and Sheriff Packer were in the next room .

It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clagetts and the Packers and the Wentworths for some years to come ! " Ruminatively he added , " All things considered , you might be worse off , my son .

" If there 's anything of mine you want , " my oldest brother Eben said , " you can have it . " After some thought I settled on his new braided fishing line , a box of salmon hooks , two silk handkerchiefs and the big powder-horn scraped thin on shipboard by my greatuncleJames during the expedition to Cartagena in 1741.  --  New Englanders , I have heard it claimed , are tight-lipped and tight-fisted : as close as the bark on a tree , and cold as a brass door-knob . Some of them probably are , but I have never noticed any particular closeness among New Englanders in my section  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure , indeed , they 're not inclined to be close-mouthed in moments of emotion . At all events , when my father and brothers came to the kitchen with me and sat silently while my mother brought food for all of us , I knew their silence was due neither to coldness nor tightness . Hunk Marriner whistled outside . My mother kissed me , and my father and brothers helped me shoulder my blanket and pack , then went with me to the door . There I shook hands with them , none of us saying anything except " Good-bye " ; but as I stepped forth into the darkness , my mother 's voice called quaveringly from behind the nightgownedCHAPTER XTHE WAR in which we found ourselves so unexpectedly embarkedseems vague and far-off now ; but to us , at the time , it seemed as important as it did endless . Almost since I could remember it had been going on . We called it , simply enough , The War , because it was the only one of which we knew or expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French and their Indian allies . With the passage of the years we called it the Old French War ; and to those of us engaged in it it seemed older , even , than Robert Matlin , the Portsmouth baker , who walked to Boston and back every week to buy his flour , and lived to he 115 years old . Since the beginning of 1755 the colonists had fought under British generals who were blunderers and incompetents , and under far too many British officers who considered themselves insulted if forced to meet colonial officers on a basis of equality . Year after year the colonists , led by British , had fought to drive the French from their line of forts and trading posts , which extended from Quebec and Montreal , through Crown Point and Ticonderoga and out into the Indian country of the West ; and year after year the French , with subterfuges , surprise attacks and Indian cunning , had fought to hold the English back . The prize for which they struggled was one that aroused the cupidity of every king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of England would gladly have sacrificed the life of every general in their employ if by so doing they could win . That prize was the ultimate ownership of the Ohio Valley , with its endless forests , fertile plains , tremendous rivers and wealth of furs  --  the richest empire for which two nations ever contended . Each year , since the war began , the stupidity of one British general or another had brought overwhelming catastrophe upon us , so that every home and tavern in Portsmouth , and doubtless in hundreds of other towns as well , had buzzed with anger against60NORTHWEST PASSAGE 61the bunglers who were directing our destinies and doing it unbelievablybadly . In 1755 Braddock , a brutal and foolish man , had fallen into a French ambush near Fort Duquesne with horrible results . In the same year Sir William Johnson , by his pig-headed refusal to followup his victory over Dieskau and wipe out the fleeing French army , had prolonged the war for years . In 1756 the Earl of Loudoun , an experienced soldier , had come from England to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties that confrontedhim . He soon became cordially detested , however , when , in 1757  --  due partly to his own mistakes and partly to the cowardice of his subordinate , General Webb  --  Fort William Henry on Lake George was captured and demolished by Montcalm , and its unarmed , captive garrison of English and Provincials horribly massacred or maltreated by Montcalm 's Indians . In 1758 Abercrombie , master blockhead of them all , had led the finest army ever seen in America against Ticonderoga , ordered a general assault from the worst possible position , and sacrificed the victory and the army to his own stupidity . Seven men from Portsmouth had been caught in that French spider 's web of fallen tree-tops , at Ticonderoga , shot to shreds by French bullets , and left hanging there to rot . And now , in 1759 , the French had retreated from Ticonderoga and Crown Point before General Amherst 's superior forces , and there was talk on all sides that the French were at last certain to be beaten . If only the English would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be captured , and Canada would at last fall into the hands of England . There was one good feature of this British mismanagement , and only one . It had shown that Provincial troops could fight , if properly led , as well as any of the King 's regiments that had been brought to America ; but we remained as distrustful of British leadership as ever . This , then , was the war toward which Hunk Marriner and I were bound  --  not because we had any fondness for war , but be-62 NORTHWEST PASSAGEcause war seemed a lesser evil than Wyseman Clagett . Anything , I eventually learned , is preferable to war ; but that knowledge isevery fan must learn for himself  --  usually at considersomethingable expense . Our first objectipe was the fort on the Connecticut River known as Number Four , that being the crossing place of all roads , paths and Indian trails between the Atlantic Coast , Canada and the West . Once past Number Four , we knew , we were safe from Wyseman Clagett ; so we drove our canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through Long Reach , and swung to the westward with the rising tide , past Hilton 's Point and into the channel that leads to beautiful Great Bay . At sun up we left our canoe with a farmer near Durham , giving him the use of it until we should return , which we hoped might be reasonably soon . Then , strapping on our blankets and packs and shouldering our muskets , we set off due west on the beaten path to Dunbarton and Number Four . We fully intended , on reaching Number Four , to follow the old road to Lake Champlain , which goes by way of Lake George ; and if we had done so , the course of our lives would have been altered . Whether the alteration would have been for the better or for the worse , I can not say ; but I am certain that if we had n't stopped at the Flintlock Tavern in Dunbarton , and there met Sergeant McNott , we would have taken the Lake George road and been another two da9s reaching Crown Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference . Dunbarton is half way between Portsmouth and Number Four . It lies in fertile , rolling country , sprinkled with handsome fenced farms on hilltop meadows ; but the town itself is nothing to brag about , since it consists of a church , a smithy , a school and the Flintlock Tavern , all grouped at the crossroads and all built ofsquared logs. of the crossroads stood a signpost reading " No. 4 : In the center54 mis , " and on the front of the tavern hung a board lettered " Last chance : No more rum for 54 mis . S. Flint , Prop . " The tavern appeared to be as quiet as two fugitives like ourNORTHWESTPASSAGE 63selves could wish . There was no sign of life to be seen near it , except for a wolfish-looking dog that reclined in the dust beside the front steps , slumbering heavily , and dreaming of something that caused him to emit muted , falsetto barks . Since our canteens needed filling , we went in . We at once discovered the seeming quietness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there rose from a dark corner of the tap-room a dreary rendition , inmale voices , of the hymn , " Awake , my soul , and with the sun Thy daily stage of duty run ; Shake ofi dull sloth and joyful rise To pay thy morning sacrifice ; Redeem thy mis-spent life that 's past And live this day as if thy last ; Improve thy talent with due care ; For the great day thyself prepare . " Being still too close to Portsmouth to run risks , we attempted to withdraw quietly ; but as we turned to go , we were hailed so brusquely and explosively that I thought for a moment the speaker must be one of Wyseman Clagett 's agents . " Here you ! " the voice shouted from the group of hymn-singers in the corner , " where you think you 're going ! Come back here ! " We stopped and looked back . The man who had spoken had risen from the table in the corner and was glaring fiercely at us . It seemed to me he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little over medium height . His hair , what we could see of it , was a sort of carroty scarlet , and his face was not only brick red , as though he were on the verge of exploding with rage , but was pitted with smallpox . His eyes were a pale , frosty blue , and one of them was half concealed by a drooping eyelid , so that he seemed to be squinting with cold calculation . A scar ran from the drooping eyelid across his cheek-bone to his ear , which had been slashed through in the middle , so that it was divided into an upper and a lower ear , and the two halves were held neatly to-64 NORTHWEST PASSAGEgether by a flattened gold ring . His arms were so long that they reached nearly to his knees , and he held himself tilted forward , with his elbows flexed , as though he intended to leap at andstrangle anyone who disagreed with him . " What 's the matter ? " Hunk said . " We ai nt broken any laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came close to us . He wore ahunting smock of greenish buckskin , circled at the waist with a broad belt from which depended small leather loops , evidently forthe carrying of light baggage . His leggins were buckskin , with a flap below the knee . The flap was tied tight around the ankle andcalf , which gave him a trig look . The strangest part of his garb was his headgear . It was a stiff little cap of green wool , brimless , with two short ribbons dangling from its back ; and it was pushed over to one side , so that its front edge rested almost on the angry man 's eyebrow . Nevertheless , it clung to him like a limpet , givinghim an indescribably rakish and reckless appearance . I had seen such caps in Portsmouth , but there they were worn by girls andwere called Scotch bonnets . " Listen , " he said . " You can sing , ca n't you ? " As politely as possible , I told him we were in a hurry and hadno time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he demanded . " Then wha 'd youcome in here for ? Where you going to ? " I told nhr Crown Point . " Listen , " he said again , and his anger seemed to rise and boilwithin him , " why do n't you talk sense ? An hour more or lessaint going to make any difference to you if you 're going to Crown Point . You do n't know the way to Crown Point , anyhow ! You come on over here to this table and do some singing , like I say ! I tell you I got to find somebody that knows how to sing ! It'simportant ! " When I mistakenly laughed at this , I thought he might rupturea blood vessel . His right hand clenched convulsively , and heseemed about to fly at my throat . " All right , " I said hastily . " We do n't want any trouble withNORTHWEST PASSAGE 65anyone . We 'll sit down and sing if you want us to , but what in God 's name is important about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped his forehead on his sleeve . " By God , " he said passionately , " if you 'd ever had anything to do with drunk Indians , maybe you 'd understand ; but if you have n't , there 's no use talking about it . I got John Konkapot over here . He 's a Stockbridge Indian , and he 's drunk . Stockbridge Indians are psalm-singing Indians ; and this here John Konkapot , he wants to sing . There ai nt none of us can sing well enough to suit John , and he 's showing his dissatisfaction . When he 's dissatisfied , he wont drink nothing but rum . If I can get him to drinking beer , it 'll make him sick , and unless hedrinks beer and gets sick , he wont be fit to travel . That 's what 's important about it ! " " Why do n't you leave this Konkapot here to sober up by himself and go on without him ? " Hunk asked . The red-headed man clapped his green cap on his head , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anchored it securely , tilted though it was . He glared at Hunk . " Because he was sent here to get me ! " he said bitterly . " Because I got to get back to Crown Point and take him with me ! Because we need him ! That 's why ! Now , by God , you come over to that tablewithout any more talk , or you 'll get some of that trouble you ai nt looking for . " Hunk and I glanced at each other and decided we 'd better comply . We stood our muskets against the wall , hung our blankets and packs over them and went to the table in the corner . Three men sat at it . One was Flint , the tavern-keeper , as we soon discovered . The others were Flint 's hired man and theStockbridge Indian , John Konkapot . Flint and his hired man were evidently ill at ease . Konkapot was a strange-looking Indian . His leggins were of greenish buckskin , like those of our red-headed acquaintance ; but his upper body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shirt hung down outside his leggins , and was daubed across the shoulders with red paint . His. 66 NORTHWEST PASSAGEhead was shaved , except for a scalp-lock in the center of his skull , and the scalp-lock was confined at the base by a brass shoe-buckle . Although his face was buried in his hands , I could see he was crying . Our friend tapped Flint on the shoulder . " Beer ! " he said peremptorily . " Bring beer for everybody , and keep bringing it to Konkapot whenever his mug gets low . " " He wont drink it , Sergeant , " the inn-keeper protested . " He 'll only pour it on me , the way he did the last mug full . " Our friend turned on him furiously . " You do as you 're told ! If he wants to pour it on you , let him pour it ! I 'm paying for it , and he can use it the way he wants to ! Hurry up with that beer ! We got to do some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ahead and sing , " our friend told us . " Do n't pay no attention to Konkapot . He 's crying about his grandfather . " " What happened to his grandfather ? " " Oh , the regular thing ! Prob'ly they buried him without his bracelets , or maybe he had the misfortune to die in bed . Everybodyknows why Indians cry when they get drunk . Anyway , all you got to do is sing . " Hunk hummed the first line of " There is a land of pure delight where saints immortal reign . " " That 's a good one , " our friend said . " Let out on it , so 's to get Konkapot interested . " " I 'll carry the air , " I told Hunk , " and you take the tenor . If anyone else has a voice , I 'll take the second bass . " We went to work on it . Hunk 's voice , which was high and sweet , soared powerfully on the next-to-last line  --  " Death , like a narrow sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joined us deafeningly , and beat time with a forefinger . The hired man , too , chimed in , but feebly . When Hunk hit the high notes , the Indian Konkapot raised his head from his hands and stared at us from red , drunken , tear-filled eyes . He was the dirtiest-looking Indian I had ever seen . His face had been painted white not long before , but much of the white hadNORTHWEST PASSAGE 67rubbed off , so that he made me think of a pig-sty in need of whitewashing . Flint , the inn-keeper , came back to the table with three mugs of beer in each hand , stood behind us and joined disconcertingly in the last lines ; but when we 'd finished , he set the mugs on the table and slid into his seat . Our red-headed friend showed signs of exasperation . " What 's the matter with you ? " he asked Konkapot belligerently . " Here I got you some real singers , and you never open that big mouth of yours . If you want to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palm of his hand . " Moe , " he said . " Moe . " He gulped down half his mug of beer , blinked stupidly at us , and again said , " Moe ! " " Give it to him , " the red-headed man exclaimed . " Keep right at it ! " When we had moistened our throats , we went at the second verse . To my surprise , Konkapot had a good baritone , and thus I could insert a bass . The second verse was pleasing to all of ussopleasing that , at the end , we applauded ourselves freely and drained our beer-mugs to ourselves , after the manner of tap-room singers since time immemorial . When Flint left to fill our empty mugs , Konkapot swayed in his chair and examined us owlishly . " You know Dusty Fiddles ? " " We know ' em all , " Hunk said . " We 're just as civilized as you are . " Konkapot threw back his head and gave tongue like the Bull of Bashan. " 0 come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiate the first " 0 come , let us adore him " by himself ; then swung in with him on the second with such overwhelmingsuccess that the wolfish-looking dog came in from outside and lay by the door , moaning mildly . No sooner had we finished than Konkapot started the song anew . He could n't seem to get enough of it . He started it again and again , as tireless as a68 NORTHWEST PASSAGEmachine , and the more we sang , the oftener Flint hurried back and forth between our table and the beer keg . Just as I had decided Konkapot would never stop , he laid his dirty arm across my shoulders and said thickly , " You my sweet bludda ! " " Who ? " I asked . " I 'm your sweet what ? " " His sweet brother , " the inn-keeper explained . " He likes you , but do n't be scared . He wont kiss you . Them heathen ai nt learned how . " Konkapot hiccuped , rose unsteadily to his feet , stumbled over a chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though laboriously ascending a steep hill . " Climbing a mountain now , " Flint explained admiringly . " When he thinks he 's got to the top , he 'll fall down and roll like hell if somebody does n't stop him . But come on , Joe . " He and his hired man rose , charitably placed themselves one on each side of Konkapot , and conducted him out to the open air . The man with the split ear sighed gustily . " There ! That finishes him , When he comes to , he 'll be practically sober . " CHAPTER XITHE NAME of our red-headed acquaintance was McNott . He was a sergeant in the army ; and like most sergeants , he was set on having his own way . A more intolerant and bossy man I had never encountered . One of the most singular things about him was that he was not cowardly at heart , as are most bossy men , but would have flown at anyone twice his size if he thought the occasion demanded it . Since he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to see any point of view except his own , he seemed perpetually on the verge of fighting someone . To give him his due , he was more often right than not ; and no doubt his contentious attitude was due to his knowledge of the errors under which the great majority of mankind perpetually labor . Alone with Hunk and me , he abruptly seemed wholly sober , looked us over with a quick , keen eye : then spoke up briskly , " Who am I ? " and answered himself . " Me , I 'm McNott . What 's my business ? Being a sergeant . What 's yours ? Who are you , and what takes you to Crown Point ? " It was Hunk who replied . " Thought maybe we 'd go see what it kind of looks like , " he said . " Thought maybe after we got there we might take a notion to join the army  --  that is , if we feel like it after we get there . " " You do n't say ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Regiment , or the Highlanders , or General Amherst 's staff , or one of them lousy Provincial regiments ? " " To tell you the truth , I do n't know , " I admitted . " We have letters to Colonel Lovewell and Major Rogers , but we have n't decided which one to see first . " " Well , well , " McNott said . " When you going to make up your mind ? It 's kind of a shame , ai nt it , to keep two good officers like Colonel Lovewell and Major Rogers all excited and nervous , on account of not knowing which one of ' em might get you ? " He looked severe and called to Flint , who had left Konkapot to the6970 NORTHWEST PASSAGEhired man , and , returning , was just entering the doorway . " Three mugs more , Flint . " " Maybe , " I ventured , " you could tell us which officer we ought to see first ? " " Oh , " McNott said carelessly , " it depends what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller : a fine old feller . He keeps his regiment pretty busy , digging latrines and working on the fort . If you like to dig latrines , I 'd see Lovewell . If you like to chop down trees , maybe he 'll fix it so you can chop some down and raft ' em across the lake ; but if you 'd rather use a pick-axe and shovel , maybe that can be arranged , too . He 's a real accommodating feller , Lovewell is . " " We do n't want to do any of those things . " " Then you better keep away from armies , " McNott said . " Once you 're in the army , you do anything you 're told to do . Most always ' you 're told to do something you would n't choose to do if you had the say-so . " " You do n't do things like that if you 're under Major Rogers , de , you ? " I asked . Sergeant McNott eyed me suspiciously . " Listen ! Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about Rogers ' Rangers . " They kill Indians , mostly , do n't they ? " McNott spoke sharply . " Mostly they get along without sleeping , and a good part of the time they get along without eating . Sometimesthey lay in one spot for twelve hours without moving , while the mosquitoes and the black flies chew ' em to pieces . Other times they run seventy-eighty miles in a day and kill a few Indians when they get where they 're going . If they can go afoot , they do so ; but if they ca n't go afoot , they go in canoes , or on rafts , or on skates or on snowshoes ; and if none of those ways work , they walk on stilts or swim . Sometimes one or two of ' em gets hurted . They eat their food raw , a good deal of the time . They 're up prowling around when everybody else is a-bed ; and long before anybody else is up in the morning , Rogers ' men have most generally been up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got their breakNORTHWESTPASSAGE 71fasts , rolled their blankets , sewed up the rips in their buckskins and maybe shot a few Indians out of a tree . Then they do a little drilling and camp-cleaning , and later in the day they 're pretty apt to lay out a road to somewhere ; and if they have an hour or two to spare , they build the road in addition to laying it out . Then they parade , and maybe teach the English Regulars a little something about fighting . If any Regulars or Provincials desert to the French , Rogers ' men wait till after sundown , and then they go into the French camp and get the feller that deserted , and bring him back and cook his goose for him . That 's what they do mostly ! " " They do n't do things like that this late in the year , do they ? " I asked . " Late ! " McNott exclaimed . " Late ! This ai nt late ! This ai nt the middle of September yet ! Why , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt killed our average yet ! We 've got to slaughter five Indiansday , and so far we 're about fifty-eight behind . Hell ! It ai nt till the leaves get off the trees , so we can see ' em through the undergrowth , that we really get ' em nice ! The best battle we ever fought was the Battle on Snowshoes . " " We ? " I asked . " We ? Are you in Rogers ' Rangers ? " " For God 's sake ! " McNott cried , " could n't you tell ? Of course I 'm in the Rangers ! There ai nt nobody wears green buckskins , only Rogers ' Rangers ! There ai nt nobody wears Scotch caps , only Rogers ' Rangers ! Do you think I 'd wear one of those damned caps if I was n't in the Rangers ? Hell , I 'd be afraid of being mistookfor a shemale ; but if you 're in the Rangers , you can do any damned thing you please , and nobody dares to say Boo ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an unexpected powerful yearning ; I wanted one of those green caps to wear . In my mind 's eye I saw myself returning to Portsmouth and Kittery , swaggering in green buckskins and with a green Scotch cap tilted becomingly on the side of my head  --  yes , laughing hoarsely and giving ElizabethBrowne and the Reverend Arthur the mere tail of a jeering eye as I passed by across the street . I looked at Hunk and saw that he , too , was staring , fascinated , at the green cap so securely perched above Sergeant McNott 's ear. 72 NORTHWEST PASSAGEMcNott , I suddenly realized , was looking at both of us hungrily ; then all at once he seemed satisfied , nodded , and grunted in short laughter . " Good enough , " he said . " Soon as Konkapot 's got over what ails him , us soldiers 'll start for Crown Point and Major Rogers . " " You know Major Rogers well , Sergeant ? " Hunk asked deferentially . " Do I know him well ! " McNott stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How well do you reckon they knowed you ? Him and me 's been that thick ever since our very first Indian massacre , when we was little more than red-cheeked children . If you 've made up your mind you want to be in the Rangers , and I tell the Major to take you , it 's all settled . " " Major Rogers always does what you tell him ? " Hunk asked . " Always , " McNott said firmly ; then added , with a reasonable air , " except sometimes when I do what he tells me . Right now , for instance , I 'm doing something to oblige him , on account of him having sent me to collect his rents at Dunbarton . I 'd been laying out a road for him between Number Four and Crown Point , but he had to have these rents from the Dunbarton farmers that owed ' em to him ; so I been down here collecting ' em . " " Is n't that unusual ? " I asked . " Unusual , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and collect money for him ? " " Unusual ! " McNott shouted . " Unusual ! Hell , this ai nt no usual army ! Last year the Major raised five companies of Rangers out of his own pocket ! He never got a cent back from the British : not a damned cent ; and is it was n't for the Rangers , the British would n't know where they waL or how they got there ! Why in God 's name should n't he use one of his own men to get money for him ? Massachusettswont give it to him ! New Hampshire wont give it to him ! The British wont give it to him , and there ai nt nobody but his own men he can trust , and no money he can get except his own ! Unusual , for God 's sake ! That 's a hell of an idea about unusualness ! " I thought best to change the subject . " This Konkapot that 's with you , " I said . " He is n't in the Rangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ai nt he ? " NORTHWEST PASSAGE " Nothing , only I thought he did n't look " That 's because he 's wearing his shirt , " McNott said . " It ai nt because he 's drunk : it 's because he 's wearing a shirt . Shirts ai nt regulation for Stockbridge Indians . There 's a whole company of ' em in the Rangers , and when they 're on ranging service , they ai nt allowed to wear shirts . General Amherst says it do n't look soldierly , and I du n no but what I agree with him . A feller that 's got a dirty shirt hanging down around his knees , he do n't look as if he was good for much . Indians do n't see it that way , though . They all carry their shirts , and the minute they get free of regular duty , they put ' em on . They put ' em on to be stylish . Outside of that , shirts help to keep off the rain and the mosquitoes , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt got much use for Indians , taking'em by and large . You ca n't count on ' em for nothing except getting drunk when it ai n't convenient and running away when you need ' em most . But these Stockbridge Indians , they fight like civilized people . They 'd just as soon get killed as anybody . " Despite the variety of topics on which Sergeant McNott discoursed , he returned again and again to Major Rogers . To the Sergeant 's way of thinking , the Major was the greatest man and the greatest soldier the world had ever seen . McNott , it appeared , had lived most of his life in Dunbarton , and so , too , had Rogers , except during those periods when the French-led St. Francis Indians , coming down from the north , had burned the farmhouses , destroyed the crops , slaughtered the cattle , chopped down the fruit trees , scalped settlers and stolen women and children , and so forced farmers to seek sanctuary in blockhousesin the larger settlements . " Why , " McNott said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was weaned ! Fifteen years old , he was , when he started fighting ' em ; and in a year 's time the smartest Indian ever made could n't think half as much like an Indian as Rogers could . He knew what they aimed to do before they knew themselves ; and from that day to this , he ai nt changed one damned bit . No , sir ! He hates a St. Francis Indian worse'n poison  --  he hates ' em worse'n I do , pretty near ; but much as he hates ' em , he ai nt never got7374 NORTHWEST PASSAGEmad at ' ern . No , sir : I and him just sit down and figure what they 're going to do , and then I and him go out and stop ' em from doing it . Before he was seventeen years old , them St. Francis Indians was as careful of I and him as they 'd have been of a thousand rattlesnakes ! They was awful dainty how they showed themselves around here , just on account of how I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing when he was n't fighting Indians ? " I asked . " Farming ? " McNott shook his head contemptuously . " Hell , no ! Rogers could n't never settle down . He had to find out about things . Damnedest feller you ever saw for asking questions . He ai nt never satisfied with what he learns . He asks and he asks ; and if he ca n't find out what he wants to know by asking , he 'll run a thousand miles to look at something . Why , by God ! when he was eighteennineteenyears old , after that first Indian war , he 'd go off alone , where there had n't never been any white settlers , and he 'd travel day and night , just looking  --  all alone , mind you ! He traveled up through the Cohase Intervales , and up beyond Lake Memphremagog , where there had n't no white men ever been , only those that the Indians had captured . He went back and forth between here and Canada , just looking and figuring out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country better'n any book . Yes sir ! He knows it better'n any man alive , red or white ! " " How 'd it happen the Indians never caught him ? " Hunk asked . McNott put his elbows on the table and glanced quickly over his shoulder . " By God , " he said , " I du n no ! I du n no how he does it ! He 's the size of a moose , but he goes drifting through the woods like a owl . He 'll stand right in plain sight , in the middle of some trees , and if you take your eyes off him for a second , he ai nt there . No sir : you can look for him all day , and you ca n't find him ! The Indians , they call him a devil . White Devil . That 's their name for him : Wobi madaondo : White Devil . They say he disappears into rocks , and pops out of ' em , like Pamola , the Evil One . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I du n no . He 's learned to talk their language , Rogers has , and you ca n't talk that language and spend your time popping in and out of rocks . NORTHWEST PASSAGE 7 ! No sir ! You got to spend a good deal of it with Indians  --  mostly young , good-looking ones . " We drank our beer contemplatively . " Well , " McNott continued , " when this French war broke out in 1755 , I and him went to it . Right away we picked up some of the young fellers around here that had a knack for slaughtering Indians , and we went right to work doing it . That was the start of Rogers ' Rangers . One company of us , there was , under that old yeller-bellied windbag Sir William Johnson . " McNott became excited and shook his fist at us . " We watched the French day and night . They never made a move but what we knew about it and told Johnson . We killed their Indians and sunk their boats and burned their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it a month , the French would ' a ' paid five thousand pounds , hard money , for Rogers ' scalp . The next year Rogers had two companies of Rangers , and the next year he had four , and now he 's got eight , not counting his Stockbridge Indians ; and if the English win this war , it 'll be because of what Rogers and his Rangers have done for ' em , by God ! Why , this feller Rogers , he 'll march fifty-sixty miles in a day , with three feet of snow on the ground and the glass down to thirty below , or he 'll march the same distance when it 's up to a hundred and twenty , like a furnace , and he 'll take the britches and the hides off any Frenchmen and Indians that get in his way ! He 's a hell-roarer and a caution , that 's what he is ! There ai nt a soldier anywhere , French or English , colonel or general , that can hold a candle to him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had , young Lord Howe , he went to school to Rogers , so to learn how to fight a battle the way it ought to be fought in this country ; but before he learned his lesson , he got killed fighting the English way , and there never was a damneder shame ! " So moved and excited had McNott become as he spoke that he slid from his chair and went to prowling up and down the taproom . His moccasins made no sound , and in his greenish buckskinsand his green Scotch cap he was like a shadow against the dark pine walls. 76 NORTHWEST PASSAGEAbruptly he stopped and thrust his face close to ours . " Listen , " he said , " if they 'd let Rogers alone , he 'd do things the English never dreamed of ! They do n't know nothing about this country ! Not nothing ! Compared with Rogers , they 're little boys playing toy soldier . They 're  --  " The tap-room door swung open and Konkapot came in . He stood staring mournfully at us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said hoarsely . " Feel bad . " Sergeant McNott walked over to him and examined him earnestly . " No , " he said , " you 're well ! You feel bad , but you 're well ! Get your musket and blanket . We 'll sleep in the brush . " " Rum ! " Konkapot said . " Konkapot sick Indian ! Oh , oh , oh ! Konkapot so sick ! " " You ai nt ! " McNott told him sternly . " You already been sick ! Did n't I hear you ? I did ! Konkapot all well again ! Get your musket and blanket , but I 'll let you wear your shirt a while yet , now you 're so well again . Get ' em ! " Konkapot looked at him dumbly , wept feebly , then with meekness went to the corner of the tap-room where he had left his musket and blanket . McNott looked at Hunk and me . " This here Konkapot , " he said , " Major Rogers sent him from Crown Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to Crown Point in kind of a hurry . That means Rogers and Rogers ' Rangers are going somewherepretty soon . I expect you two was aiming to go to Crown Point by way of Lake George after you 'd passed Number Four . We wont go that way . We 'll go by this new road I was laying out , and that 'll save two days . " He stepped closer to us ; stood stiffly . " You 've heard me talking . Still think you 'd like to join in with Major Robert Rogers and Rogers ' Rangers ? " Hunk and I began to gather up our belongings . " That 's what we think , Sergeant , " Hunk said . In the deep dusk , ten minutes later , as we moved off to the westwardinto the black forest with those two strange soldiers , I could hear Konkapot snuffling and hiccuping , like a child who has been severely spanked . CHAPTER XII1NT NOON the next day we came down from the hills to the broad meadows along the Connecticut River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its name of Number Four . All my life long I had heard tales of Number Four ; for it was at this very spot , al ways , that the St. Francis Indians , coming down from the north , crossed the Connecticut and headed eastward to raid the settlements . On their homeward journey , too , they made straight for Number Four with captives and booty : then turned north , up the Connecticut , on the long trail to the Cohase Intervales and far-off St. Francis . I stared hard at this tranquil meadow with its stockaded fort called Number Four at the river 's edge . Across it had pelted the red devils who , eighty years before , travelled all the way to the Piscataqua , stole up to the door of the very house in which I had spent the summer just past , and drove a tomahawk into the brain of my mother 's great granduncle , Richard Nason . Back over this level clearing had raced those same red men , dragging with them to St. Francis another Richard Nason , eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , perhaps , that red men had carried my great great aunt Sarah , a child of six , to St. Francis and held her there five years , until Thomas Hutchins ransomed her and brought her back to Kittery . For my mother 's sake I made a drawing of the place in my sketch book  --  of the fort and stockade , the settlers ' cabins , and the swelling hills beyond  --  thinking I might never see the place again . I have smiled often , looking at that rough drawing of a sunny intervale  --  not so much because of its defects , but because it proves conclusively that although premonitions of approaching disaster may he common occurrences in romances , they are rare in real life . If I 'd had a premonition of the circumstances under which I should next see Number Four , my sketch of the place would have shown it as forbidding as the pit of Acheron. 7778 NORTHWEST PASSAGE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 79On the new road staked out by Rogers ' Rangers between Num. ber Four and Crown Point , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; through streams that grew constantly more turbulent ; and on the morning of September 13th , a day and a half after leaving Number Four , we came to the edge of the plateau overlooking the narrows of Lake Champlain . Spread before us , as on a map , was that gateway between Canada and the American Colonies  --  that narrow , watery highway for which the English and the French had so long contended , and over which such a vast deal of blood had been spilled . If there is a pleasanter sight , on a golden autumn morning , I have never seen it . Directly before us , on the far side of the narrows , Crown Point lay flat on the water like a blunt hook . At the bend in the hook were the low parapets of a square stone fort , surmounted by a tall stone watch-tower . It looked wholly useless , being so close to the shelving bank that it could never have brought a gun to bear on a rowboat that knew enough to keep close to its walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which formed the thick shank of this enormous hook , men were crawling like ants , constructing the ramparts of a new and greater fort . The strip of water guarded by these two forts , the old and the new , was so narrow that no vessel , small or large , could traverse it without the consent of those behind the guns , provided the guns were effectively placed ; and for the first time I saw why Crown Point , properly fortified and garrisoned , was a sure barrier to any hostile army that sought to pass . Only in boats could the supplies necessary to an army be carried between Canada and the American Colonies ; and so long as Crown Point forbade the passage of supplies , an army dependent on those supplies could not exist . To the left of Crown Point the narrows wound southward like a tranquil river to the distant heights of Ticonderoga . To the right the broad and placid surface of Champlain stretched to the north  --  and somewhere beyond its far blue reaches , I knew , the French and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that narrow inland sea rose the sharp peaks of the Green Mountains : on the other the rolling , tree-clad rampartsof the New York shore . In the morning sun the crowded spruces that clothed those hills stood out sharp and clear ; so that , instead of seeing merely hills , I saw an infinity of trees , close-packed . I had a dim vision of countless other hills stretching off to the north and west , mile upon mile  --  hundreds of miles : thousands , perhaps  --  all clothed with billions upon billions of close-packed trees . It seemed irrational to me that the human ants crawling slowly over the surface of Crown Point should have come a wearisome journey from their native ant hills to wrangle and strive eternally with other similar ants , and perhaps be killed doing it . Did all these ants consider themselves important , and ordained by heaven to have a hand in regulating the world 's affairs ? When Konkapot had guiltily removed his dirty checked shirt and hidden it in his rolled blanket , we went down to the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provincial soldiers in charge of the raft stared respectfully at McNott . " Where 's this Suagothel the Rangers are going to ? " ' one of them asked . McNott eyed him noncommittally . " Who told you we were going ? " " Enoch Simms , " the Provincial said . " He 's the barber in our company , and he gets to know everything . Five hundred Rangers , Enoch said , was going to Suagothel tonight . " " If he knows so much , " McNott said , " go back and make him tell you where Suagothel is . " The Provincial withdrew , offended , whereupon McNott glanced at me impassively . " Wha 'd I tell you ? " he said calmly . " The Major 's just waiting for I and Konkapot . " " Where 's that place ? " I whispered . " Where 's Suagothel ? " " Never heard of it , " McNott said , " but we 'll all damned soon find out ! " The rocky point we approached was alive with men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ahead of us , and carrying off the logs on their shoulders . Along the shore stood Provincials in homespun and British Regulars in canvas overalls , fishing with alder poles and handlines . As we jumped ashore , one80 NORTHWEST PASSAGEof the Provincials fell off a rock , scrambled yelling up the bank , and dragged onto the shingle a pickerel the length of a man 's leg . It must have weighed fifteen pounds . Two other Provincials fell on it , knocked it on the head with a rock and carried it away in triumph . " Stink-fish ! " McNott said contemptuously . " Provincials do n't balk at eating nothing  --  not even bad , diseased cats ! " He set off at top speed along the shore , skirted the star-shaped earthworks , and passed the half-finished ramparts of the new fort . Within the enclosure of the walls I could see the beginnings of two enormous stone barracks . The place was alive with men . There must have been nearly two thousand of them at work  --  digging , shovelling , hewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilled against a background of acres of tents . I could hear the rattle of wheezy drums , thumping out orders to the drilling men . The ceaseless and all-pervading activity filled me with anxiety , for I longed to be a part of that activity , and I was afraid there might not be room for me . On the northern side of the new fort , the ground sloped to a small bay , formed by the tip of Crown Point 's hook . The bank fell away abruptly to a shingly beach ; and on the beach , concealed by the bank from the forts and the parade ground , was a miniature camp  --  a camp of perhaps eighty tents , neatly following the line of the beach , and facing the long blue expanse of lake that stretched northward between misty mountain ranges . We stood at the edge of the bank , looking down at this little colony of tents , and saw that they were divided in sections , and that at their extreme right , in the angle of the hook of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if to emphasize the divisions , twenty overturned whaleboats lay on the beach , the bow of each boat pointing at one of the tent-clusters . The appearance of the boats would have pained aNORTHWEST PASSAGE 81seaman , for they were rudely daubed with brown and green paint . They were , however , uniform in their slovenliness . The whaleboats seemed to awaken fond memories in McNott 's mind . " There they are ! " he said delightedly . " There ai nt a drop of water in this whole damned lake that I ai nt rubbed against in one of those boats ! " Most of the men at work around the tents and boats wore Scotch caps similar to McNott 's , and barring a few who were tossingpine cones in the air and shooting at them with muskets , they were a busy lot . They were mending and greasing moccasins , washingshirts , stitching buckskins , cleaning accouterments , fastening protecting-cloths around the breeches of muskets , cutting bullet patches , filling powder-horns , calking the whaleboats , and piling supplies close beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a group of Indians . They had their own tents and whaleboats , apparently . Like Konkapot , they were naked from their waists up and were squatted at the water 's edge or on rocks , gazing at themselves in mirrors and daubing themselves with paint . McNott gestured largely at Konkapot . " Go ahead down and join your company ! I 've never seen a man need a coat of paint worse'n what you do , Konkapot ! I 'll report to the Major for you . " Konkapot , solemn , looked down at himself thoughtfully  --  planning design , color and composition , I suppose  --  then left us without a word . McNott wagged his head . " Yes , sir ! " he told us . " Yes , sir ! They 're going out ! When the Indians paint themselves , there ai nt no doubt about it ! Somebody 's going to be stirred up ! Yes , sir : there 's certainly trouble boiling for someone ! " On a log outside the markee sat five or six Rangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent-opening and called one of them . He jumped from the log , received instructions and went pelting up over the bank and away toward the main camp behind us . There was a constant movement of officers and men toward and away from the markee  --  of British officers in scarlet coats : 82 NORTHWEST PASSAGE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 83of Provincial officers in blue jackets and breeches , undecorated save for brass gorgets at their throats : of Rangers carrying written messages , heavy barrels , oddly-shaped bundles . McNott took me by the arm and pointed out men to me , men whose names meant nothing then , but were to mean much to me later . " You see those two Ranger officers waiting to go in the markee ? " McNott asked  --  " that sour-faced feller and the sanctimonious one ? The sour-faced one 's John Stark . He was in command of us when we laid out the road to Number Four  --  the road you just came over . The other one 's Jonathan Carver . He 's an engineer , and he worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' em . If you scratched either of ' em anywhere , you 'd probably split your finger on an Indian bullet or maybe a busted piece of toma-hawk . " I hoped fate would throw me with neither of them ; for Stark was gray-faced and tight-lipped , and frowned constantly ; whereas Carver had a sly and soapy look  --  a sort of false humbleness . Both of them , I suspected , would be hard to get along with . " That feller checking over the pile of supplies , " McNott went on , " the one in the green uniform : he 's a Britisher  --  cap'n in the Royal Regiment . Cap'n Williams . He 's studied with Rogers for a couple years . He can fight as good as a Ranger , and if he keeps on the way he 's going , he 'll be a general . He 's better'n any British officer ever I see . He knows enough to take orders from a Ranger officer , and that 's more than most of ' em know . Last winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was  --  arid fought three battles . If it had n't been for Williams , we 'd all froze to death on the way back . Williams can build a fire out of snow and just a little mud . " I tried to remember the things McNott told me , and the men he indicated , but as I could n't , I got out my sketch book and made quick sketches of the hurrying officers and men , writing their names beneath the sketches . I caught hurried outlines of Captain Ogden , Captain Butterfield , Captain Brewer , Lieutenant Dunbar , ' Lieutenant Turner , Ensign Avery . Hunk and McNott came and peered over my shoulder . " Look at that ! " McNott exclaimed . " Ai nt that Ogden to the life , peekingout of the sides of his eyes ! Yes , sir ! That 's the way he always looks : as if he did n't believe something ! " He was diverted . " And that 's Dunbar ! Yes , sir ! Hanging his mouth open so a bluebird could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ? " A thought seemed to strike McNott . " Look , " he said . " You stand right here . Do n't move an inch . I 'll go down and wait till I get hold of the Major , and then I 'll tell him . Yes , sir ! I 'll tell him he 's got to take you ; and by God , he better ! " He jumped down from the bank , ran to the markee , and a moment later there came to us from there the sound of his irascible voice : then that of a heavy , deep one  --  the thickest sounding voice I had ever heard . It had a clabbery quality , too , as though it came bubbling up from under water . Hunk and I studied the sketches I had made , and memorized the names  --  Captain Stark , Captain Carver , Captain Williams , CaptainButterfield , Captain Ogden , Captain Brewer , Lieutenant Dunbar , Lieutenant Turner , Ensign Avery -- and not a face in the lot but bore a scar of one kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly scars . Some were pitted with smallpox , too . I 'd never seen so much autobiography written on faces . From the markee-opening McNott 's scarlet hair suddenly emerged , and he jerked his head at us violently . We scrambled down the bank , pulled off our hats and went in . CHAPTER XIII NORTHWEST PASSAGE 85I N ONE CORNER of the markee was a rough bunk , spread with the tips of fir-branches , and beside it stood a small hairtrunk . In the center of the tent was a table , and behind it sat a man who eyed us expressionlessly . This blank scrutiny had a peculiar effect on me ; I became short of breath ; and my hands and knees began to tremble unmanageably . He was perhaps twentyeightyears old ; and it was he , I instantly knew , who had spoken with the thick voice ; for the man himself was thick . That was my first impression , one of solid thickness : not mental thickness , but physical  --  a kind of physical unkillableness , it might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , straight nose . His hands , clasped before him on the table , were enormous and muscular ; and their fingers , pallid by comparison with the brown of his face and hands , looked parboiled ; as though left overlong in water . Beneath his large eyes the flesh was puffy ; and his shoulders , sloping down from a bull-like neck , filled his buckskin hunting shirt so solidly that the leather might have been shrunk to fit them . The breadth of his chest and upper arms gave him the look of holding a deep breath . He wore a tight little infantryman 's hat which had a sort of semicircularblack plate or visor cocked straight up in front , as if to protectthe wearer 's forehead from bullets or blows ; and a curved ornament which I thought was leather rose from the hack and swept over the cap 's top like a squirrel 's tail . The eyes that stared at me from beneath that upstanding black visor were the color of the round gray pebbles that lie along our Maine beaches , scoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner was genial , as though he addressedan equal  --  which was contrary to the attitude of important military men , according to my understanding . When he smiled , it was hard to tell the meaning of his smile . It might have been consideredadmonitory , or kindly , or even as sheepish , depending on84the state of mind of the person to whom he spoke ; but to me it seemed to indicate that he was , at heart , a good-natured man . " Sergeant McNott tells me you 've got a letter for me . " It almost seemed that the thickness of his lips made it hard for him to form words as rapidly as he wished . " Yes , sir . " I gave him Sam Livermore 's letter . He studied the address upon it ; then flipped it open and read , moving his heavy lips as he did so . " Yes , " he said , putting the letter on the table , and slapping it with his huge hand , " I know Livermore . Ordinarily I 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about Ranging service . Nobody knows anything about it till he 's been through it . I do n't believe I 'd be doing him a favor if I took you in the Rangers . " McNott spoke to him almost ferociously , and I marvelled that a sergeant could speak in such a tone to a major . " I tell you he can draw pictures ! Why do n't you look at his pictures ? " To me he said angrily , " Show him that book . " Rogers took the book and turned the pages with his thick fingers . At one point he said , as if surprised , " That 's Number Four . " A little further along he made a singular explosive noise , held up the book to McNott and pointed at a page . " Ai nt it the spit of him ? " McNott asked complacently . Rogers closed the book , gave it back to me and stood up . He was tall  --  taller than Hunk or myself ; and we then saw that his hips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He picked up Livermore 's letter and read it again , moving his lips as he had on the first reading . " Harvard ! " he said doubtfully . " I do n't know how some of these boys of mine would make out with an educated man . They 're a pretty rugged lot ! Pretty rugged ! " " I 'm not very educated , " I told him . " You do n't get much education in two years  --  not out of books . " McNott , behind me , spoke contemptuously . " He ai nt educated at all ! He do n't even know why Indians cry when they 're drunk ! " He pointed at Hunk . " Look at him , Major . Does he look like he 's been at Harvard ? " 86 NORTHWEST PASSAGE " No , " the Major said , and smiled at me . " I suppose at Harvard they do n't teach you about country like this . " " No , sir , " I said . " What I learned about the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean that , " Rogers said . " I mean I suppose they do n't teach you about the undeveloped sections  --  sections like the Ouisconsinand the Northwest . " " No , sir , " I said . " They do n't know much about it . Anyway , they do n't bother themselves about what 's going on nowadays . They teach you about Greece and Rome and Egypt and places in the Bible . Last year Professor Winthrop lectured about Captain Middleton 's voyage and all the argument over the Northwest Passage , but he was illustrating a point in philosophy . " " Argument over the Northwest Passage ? " Rogers asked . " What argument 's that , and who 's Captain Middleton ? " " Well , sir , " I said , " Captain Middleton , as near as I can recall , got permission from the British government to sail into Hudson 's Bay in search of the Northwest Passage to Japan , but he went back to England saying he could n't find it . Then a gentleman published a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five thousand pounds not to make the voyage and " " Why ? " Rogers interrupted . From his half-grin I suspected he disbelieved me . " Why did they offer him money for not going ? " " Because they had a monopoly , sir . They were afraid Middleton might discover the Passage . Then everyone in the world would rush to it , and the Hudson 's Bay Company would lose its monopoly . England would have benefited , and the world ; but the twelve stockholders in the Hudson 's Bay Company would have been out of pocket , so they tried to stop Middleton . " " But they did n't stop him ? " " No , sir ! Leastways , he sailed his voyage ; but the gentleman who wrote the book says he must have taken a bribe , because it can be proved from Middleton 's Journal that he was in the NorthwestPassage , although Middleton claims he was n't . He says Middleton was a liar , and the Hudson 's Bay Company are charNORTHWESTPASSAGE 87latans , forgers , bribers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their country . " " How 'd it happen you remembered all this so pat ? " " Because the book told about the Indian nations to the westward . I got it and read it , so to find out how the Indians look . " " Find out how they look ? Find out how they look ? Why would you want to find out how they look ? " I fumbled for words . " Well , " I said , " I 'd like to draw people from the different Indian nations  --  draw ' em and paint ' em . Nobodyever did it . If you try to find out how they look , you ca n't . Nobody knows how they look . Mark Catesby made a great name for himself drawing the birds of South Carolina , and I do n't see why Indians are n't as important as birds . I thought the book about Middleton might tell me how the Indians looked ; but it was like all the others : it did n't tell you anything you really wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An English gentleman named Arthur Dobbs . " " Arthur Dobbs ? Arthur Dobbs ? What happened to him after he wrote the book ? Where is he now ? " " I do n't know , sir . " Rogers eyed me intently , his lips moving almost imperceptibly , is though he sought to memorize each word . When I stopped speaking , he stood there , his heavy hands hanging slack , his thick lips parted , as if he expected me to continue . I thought he intended to ask other questions ; but he went back to his stool behind the table , read Sam Livermore 's letter once more , then placed it beneath a pile of papers . " All right , " he said . " You two say you want to join the Rangers . If McNott says you 're qualified , I 'll take his word . Just make up your mind you 've got your work cut out for you . Understand ? I do n't care what you do when you 're not under my command ; but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders promptly and willingly , and they wont be easy ones . " He once more made that singular explosive noise , which I now recognized as a laugh . " Some of the orders you 'll get would make an ordinary man dro NORTHWEST PASSAGEdead . We have to have discipline in the Rangers  --  and that 's pretty hard to teach a Provincial . If you 're willing to join the Rangers on that understanding , I wont stop you . " In the boundless ignorance of youth , I answered confidently for Hunk and myself : we wanted to be Rangers . " All right , " Rogers said . He turned to McNott " Take ' em out , get ' em their equipment , and begin teaching ' em what they ought to know . Be sure they have bayonets . You 'll be in charge of NumberTwo whaleboat , with Sergeant Rice next in command . " He picked up a paper from the table . " Here 's your list of men and supplies : Gillis is crossed off . He 's got hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneezing this trip ! Use Marriner in place of Gillis . " He eyed me reflectively . " You 're pretty handy with a pen , I s'pose . I s'pose in Harvard you had to write examinations on Greece and Egypt and those places in the Bible . " I nodded . " I 'll put you in Number One whaleboat under Captain Ogden , " Rogers continued . " I 'll be in Number One myself . If I need letters written and do n't have time to tend to ' em , you can write ' em , ca n't you ? " " Yes , sir . " " All right , " Rogers concluded , waving us from the tent . " We 'll try to teach you some of the things Harvard College overlooked . " CHAPTER XIVWE SAT on the bank where McNott stationed us , while he and some others puttered around Number Two whaleboat . From our post we looked down on the camp as at a stage . The scene at which we stared , as well as those who acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama , in which we were not equipped to act . This theatricality was heightened by the milky blue lake , which stretched into the north between diminishing headlands and mountains that looked like flat profiles of mountains painted for a theater 's scenery . Seventeen boats , we saw , were going on this venture of which we had so unexpectedly become a part . That meant , probably , twelve men to a boat . " Hunk , " I said , " maybe we made a mistake not to go over and loin Lovewell 's regiment . Maybe we do n't know enough to be Rangers . " " I du n no why we do n't , " Hunk said . " We can keep going through the woods all day . We can stop a deer at two hundred paces . That 's good enough shooting to kill anyone we need to kill . If you can hit a deer 's shoulder-blade at two hundred paces , you can hit a man 's head at the same distance ; and a man ai nt good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? You know he ai nt , Langdon ! We can look out for ourselves in the woods , and what more can any of these Rangers do ? I bet I could do as good shootingas any of those fellers over there if I had me a little practice , and so could you . " He indicated a group of Rangers on the beach . One of them threw pine cones in the air . The others , in rotation , shot at the cones . When one of the cones failed to burst Into fragments , a derisive howl arose . It was first-class shooting ; for from the manner in which the cones exploded , the muskets must have been loaded with a single ball . In spite of Hunk 's seeming confidence , I suspected from the89NORTHWEST PASSAGE 91and what they enjoy best is putting bullets where it hurts the worst and using your hair to make the girls look up to ' em at home . You 're looking for them and they 're looking for you ; you 'll feel better afterwards if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you most generally lay where they left you . It ai nt convenient for Rangers to get detained by what 's useless  --  funerals and all such . " He became more cheerful . " That ai nt going to happen , but you got to be careful about everything . You got to tell the truth about what you see and what you do . You can lie all you please when you tell other folks about the Rangers , but do n't never lie to a Ranger or an officer . There 's an army depending on us for correct information . Do n't never lie , and always be careful ! Do n't never take a chance you do n't have to . That 's the way the French and Indians fight , and it 's the way we got to fight . That 's what the Major 's always telling us : do n't take chances . " He snorted , as if he found the Major 's insistence irresistibly amusing . " Now then , " he went on , " when we 're on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shot ca n't go through two men  --  sensible , ai nt it ? If we strike swamps , or soft ground , we spread out abreast , so it 's hard to track us . When we march , we keep moving till dark , so to give the enemy the least possible chance at us . When we camp , half the party stays awake while the other half sleeps . If we take prisoners , we keep ' em separate till we 've had time to examine ' em , so they ca n't cook up a story between ' em . Is that all clear ? " We said it was . " Now then , " McNott continued , " we have to make allowance for all sorts of trouble . That 's why we carry skates on marches . S'pose you 've marched somewhere . Do n't never march home the same way . Take a different route , so you wont be ambushed . " No matter whether we travel in big parties or little ones , each party has to keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty yards in the rear , so the main body ca n't be surprised and wiped out . That 's something you do n't want to forcarelessnessof the question he now asked me , that he was really as nervous as I was . " Where 's this Suagothel we 're going to , d' you s'pose ? " " God knows , " I said . " It 's got to be north , if we 're going in boats . Twelve men is about as many as one whaleboat ought to carry , so there wont be enough of us to make much of a fight . Maybe we 're just going to look at something and bring back word about it . " " You do n't need seventeen whaleboats full of men to look at something , do you ? " Hunk asked . " With that many you could look at the whole of North America ! " I gave it up and watched McNott and his men . They overturnedNumber Two whaleboat and slid it into the lake with a thunderous grating of pebbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the floorboards . Seemingly they found no leaks . McNott hopped out , made his way between the tents and came up the bank to us . " Let 's get at it , " he said . " There 's papers to sign , caps and buckskinsto get , and rations to draw . You got to be ready to start by roll-call tonight . " " Start where ? " Hunk asked . McNott might have been deaf . " All you need to know , " he continued , " I can tell you in ten minutes . I ai nt going to tell you twice , so listen to what I say , and remember it ! Do n't forget nothing ! If you do , you 'll pay high . It might cost you your scalp , and maybe you ai nt particular , but that 's something most people do n't like . Got that straight ? " We said we had . " In camp , " he explained , " you 're paraded and inspected every sundown . Have your musket clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ball , and be ready to march at a minute 's warning . " When you 're on the march , act the way you would if you was sneaking up on a deer . Just remember the deer you 're hunting now ai nt going to run away if you do anything wrong , or if he sees you first . These deer got two legs : they carry knives and muskets , 92 NORTHWEST PASSAGEget . You never know when you may have to lead a party yourself , " Another thing you never know is when you 're going to run into an enemy force too big to handle . If you do , there ai nt no sense standing still and letting yourself be wiped out , the way the British do . So every night , when you 're on the march , you 'll be told where to meet in case we 're surrounded . If we 're surrounded , we just scatter and go it alone . Do n't make any mistake about where we 're going to meet in case we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place is , and do n't never forget it  --  never ! " Do n't sit down to eat without posting sentries . Do n't sleep beyond dawn . Dawn 's when French and Indians attack . Do n't cross a river by a regular ford , because if anybody 's laying for you , that 's where he 'll lay . If you find out somebody 's trailing you , make a circle , come back onto your own tracks , and ambush the folks that aim to ambush you . Do n't stand up when the enemy 's coming against you . Kneel down . Lie down . Hide behind a tree . Let him come till he 's almost close enough to touch . Then let him have it , and jump out and finish him up with your hatchet . That 's simple enough , ai nt it ? " " That 's just plain common sense , " Hunk said . " Of course it is , " McNott agreed , " but you 'd be surprised how often it never occurs to those fellers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , whence still came the hoarse thumping of the drums of the drilling British Regulars  --  " how often it never occurs to those fellers to do anything sensible . British generals , they march a regiment right up to the muzzles of a battery of guns , and feel real bad when the whole regiment has to be buried . Then they start thinking what ought to be done next , so they bring up another regiment just the same way , and get it buried too . If they did n't have Rogers and his Rangers to scout for ' em , there 'd be a fresh army of British Regulars wiped out by the French every year . And if Rogers could ' a ' been put in command of everybody , British and Colonials too , about four years ago , there would n't be any French left in North America by now . No , sir ! He 'd have pushed ' em clear way back to Quebec , and then he 'd have thrown scouts all ' round Quebec and starved ' em to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in mind of food . " Now we 'll go eat . " He seemed to marvel at our astounding luck . " My , my ! First day in camp , and you get to eat Ranger food ! When we 're in camp , there ai nt no soldiers anywhere eat like Rangers . Wine and rum and the best of everything , the Major gets for us . " Somewhatruefully he added , " We do n't eat so well on the march . " " Look here , " I said , " where 's this Suagothel we 're bound for ? Uncertainty 's a curse to newcomers like us . " " Nobody 's supposed to know till we 've started . Somebody might blab . " " You know us by now , " I protested . " We wont blab . We did n't blab much to you coming over the road , did we ? " McNott cast a cautious glance over his shoulder at the Rangers at work around the tents and whaleboats : then came closer to us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it when you 're writing the Major 's letters and have a chance to do me a good turn . Did you ever hear of St. Francis ? " We both nodded . All New England , to its sorrow , had heard of St. Francis . " That 's it , " McNott said . " That 's it ? How do you mean , that 's it ? What 's Suagothel got to do with St. Francis ? " " There ai nt any such place as Suagothel ! " McNott said . " Rogers said Suagothel so to fool the French if they should get to hear about it . It 's St. Francis we 're for ! " " St. Francis ! " I exclaimed . " St. Francis ! " " That 's right ! " McNott said comfortably . " Those red hellions have hacked us and murdered us and burned our houses and stolen women and killed scouts and brained babies and scalped stragglers and roasted officers over slow fires for five whole years , but they 've done it once too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truce , a week ago ; and they captured James Tute , the best Ranger officer we got . Well , they 've had their fun , and now they got to learn that war 's a serious business ; so that , my boy , is going to be the end of St. Francis ! " ALL THE REST of that day , the camp remained as we had first seen it . Not a tent was struck . Not a boat was launched , except temporarily , to hunt for leaks . The sun swung into the southwest and slid down behind the mountains of the New York shore , leaving them masses of purple against an orange sky . A chill September wind swept across the flat surface of Crown Point , ruffling the waters to the north and darkening them to a steely drab ; but still the Rangers dawdled about their tents , laboring at tasks that might have occupied them on any ordinary day . One who spied upon them from the heights on either side would have seen nothing but the commonplaces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twilight grew , a generous fire brightened the dingy canvas , so that the tent-fronts gleamed whitely in the glow , like beacons of their owners ' innocent put. - suits and peaceful intent . The orange sky softened to a rosy yellow : dimmed slowly to a pallid green . The mountains bulked black against the fading light , and as the stars began to appear above them the lake darkened until there was no telling where water ended and shore began . Then , between the tents and the beach , there was unseen move- ment , and faint noises were heard  --  the sound of wood rubbing against wood : of low-pitched voices : of splashings . More than ever the row of tents seemed erected upon a stage ; for before each fire , throwing its light against the canvas , a movable palisade of brush had been set in place , screening the flames from the lake . Thus , although the tents were illuminated as by a row of giant footlights , the boats and those around them were left in blackness . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , following McNott 's instructions , left the shelter of a tent and entered the darkness near the water , we found that narrow space thronged with men  --  men who multiplied and grew thick about us as though they rose noiselessly from out of the ground . We could hear94sergeants monotonously muttering the numbers of their boats  --  " Seven , seven , seven , seven "  --  " three , three , three ! " Hunk left me . I worked to the eastward along the shingle , through milling men who growled and murmured , until I heard , hoarsely reiterated , the words " One , one , one , one . " Number One was the whaleboat to which Rogers had assigned me . Three officers stood close by the beached stern of Number One . I recognized the tight-fitting cap of Major Rogers . " Get in , " he told me . A sergeant , clutching the stern , asked my name . When I told him , he said , " Take the third thwart . " Two men , vague figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third thwart . Each held an upended oar . Others climbed in and stumbled between us , walking on our feet and rapping musket butts against us , and the boat seemed to float in an aroma of greasy buckskin , sweat , gun-oil and damp wool . From where I sat , shivering , I looked back at the shining tents and at black shadows passing swiftly between us and the fire-screens . I heard one of the shadows report , " Number Fifteen filled and ready . " Close on the words another muttered , " Number Twelve filled and ready . " Rogers asked amiably about Number Seventeen . " Anybody dead in Number Seventeen ? Maybe they are n't going . " A whisper went down the beach like a shadow dying in a thicket . A breathless voice said , " Number Seventeen filled and ready . " " Send ' em off ! " Rogers ordered . Up the beach I heard gratings , thumpings , and the sound of water slapping and slapping . An officer came in over the stern of Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogden . Dimly I saw the boat beside us slide slowly away from land . Its oars creaked and dipped softly as it moved beyond my line of vision . " Push out ! " Rogers said . The boat stirred beneath us , rumbling on the pebbly bottom : then floated clear . Rogers and two others  --  one of them the sergeant  --  climbed in over the stern . The ser-96 NORTHWEST PASSAGEgeant picked up a steering oar and pushed , while the men beside me set their oars softly in the gunwales and pulled . We moved out to find the other whaleboats drifting as silently as dark shadows and as we passed them one by one , a voice from each identified it . " Number Seventeen , " the first boat said ; and in reply Rogers ' thick voice called " Buttonmould Bay . " They lay there in a long line , sixteen of them , seeming to wait avidly for this word that Rogers flung at them . When we had passed the sixteenth , we kept on into the north , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tents we had left , I could see the oars of the other whaleboats moving rhythmically in our wake , like the legs of a gigantic centipede.  --  Faintly I could see the bulky figure of Major Rogers leaning over the stern of the boat , unshipping the rudder from its slings , hanging it in place on the stern-post ; and I thought I could feel an emanation from him  --  a sort of warmth , as from a hidden flame . It seems to me now that if I could make others feel that warmth , which forced us on and on , and ever on , when all hope of going onward had long died within us , it is possible that they might in the end have a clearer understanding of that singular indomitablefigure , in whose brain was stored a fund of knowledge possessed by no other living man . If I could convey to others his astounding fortitude , which held us up and held us up , long after we had lost the power to stand , it is possible that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him.  --  The boat moved slowly , with a small , uneasy rocking . From the waters of the lake rose a cold dampness and a brackish smell , unlike the clean salt freshness of the Piscataqua . This reflection turned my mind to Elizabeth . Wait , I thought : wait till she sees me withNORTHWEST PASSAGE 97my green Rangers ' blanket fastened at my shoulder with a silver brooch ; my Scotch cap cocked rakishly toward my right eyebrow , as Rangers wore them ! Would she weep because once she had been hard to me : had scorned me ? She had n't understood me when I wished to be a painter ; but when I came home a hero  --  ah , she 'd understand that ! She had despised me for associating with improperpersons  --  " Vulgar creatures "  --  and , wondering what she 'd think if she could see some of the persons I was associating with now , I laughed bitterly  --  and unfortunately I laughed aloud . The sergeant at the steering oar made a clucking noise . " For laughers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoarsely , " they 're hereby granted leave to swim under water till they get to shore , where they can laugh like hell while getting unbowelled with a hatchet . " I sat rigid , and thanked my stars for the darkness . Behind me the boat was silent , save for the cautious slight splash of oars . Before me , on the stern thwarts , Rogers , Ogden and the third officer huddled together , whispering . The darkness of this brackishlake was the close , clammy darkness of a warehouse in winter . The slow , monotonous beat of oars became , in my sleepy mind , a sort of threnody to whose tune we moved inexorably , a dark procession , toward a distant open grave . Hours , it seemed to me , elapsed before the sergeant at the tiller hoarsely whispered " Oars ! " The man at my left pulled at my arm and slid toward me . It was my turn , I saw , to row . I crawled over him and got my hands on the handle of the clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers himself . Every half hour there was a similar shifting of oarsmen on every thwart . To me the strangest thing about this stealthy parade of boats was the silence of the rowers . Never before had I been for hours in the company of men who were entirely silent . I thought I understoodwhy Rogers ' Rangers had the reputation of doing wild and outlandish things when not on military service . If they were thus bottled up for nights and days on end , it seemed to me , they must indeed be on the verge of bursting when restraint was at length removed . Rumor , no doubt , was right when it credited them with98 NORTHWEST PASSAGEdrinking powerful liquors in prodigious quantities and seeking the society of women who were wild and gay . Toward morning we moved more slowly . We were close in shore  --  so close that we could see pointed spruces against the faintly luminous sky ; hear the lap of wavelets on the rocky banks . Rogers stood in the stern , sniffing the air ; he really seemed to smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he called back to Number Two boat , " Turn in here : pass the word . " We headed for the loom of the land . Beneath our bows there was the scrunching of a sandy beach , and we heard the other boats slide ashore , one by one . In a thick whisper Rogers gave his orders for posting sentries  --  six men to the north beyond the headland : six over the ridge in front of the boats : six to the flat land to the south . He spoke as though the shore were distinct before him in the rays of an afternoon sun , instead of a black mass from which emerged the soft scent of pines and ( lying grasses . He spoke , too , as though an unseenenemy might be lurking close at hand , waiting to hatchet the lot of us in case so much as one precaution should be overlooked . CHAPTER XVIWHEN DAWN CAME , the seventeen boats lay close together under the bank , screened beneath bushes . Their crews were camped on the high land above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake . I say they were camped , but it was a poor apology for a camp . There were no tents : no fires : no kettles : no hot food . We had been told to build no fires till we knew ourselves to be free from French and Indians ; and this was a warning that needed no repetition . The boat-crews had orders to stay together , so in reality there Were seventeen small camps grouped about the knoll . The men could go only to the latrines , or to a spring for water ; so they sat quietly , blankets around them , waiting for rations to be distributed . Thus they were not only under the surveillance of the sergeants who camped with them , but of their lieutenants , who occupied posts on higher ground , and of Rogers himself , who had arranged his captains and his belongings on the summit of the knoll.  --  It seemed to me , when the pale dawn light had brightened into day , and the crew of Number One whaleboat were flesh and blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had never seen men who looked less companionable . They ignored me ; and I , unwilling to thrust myself upon them , thought gloomily that if it ever came to fighting , I would be unfortunate indeed with such comrades . There were twelve of us , aside from Rogers , Ogden , Williams and the sergeant , and I studied them when the opportunity offered . Our sergeant 's name was Bradley . His face was pale and a little bitter , and he was given to standing stock-still and staring99100 NORTHWEST PASSAGEaccusingly from one to the other of us , as if he expected to catch us in something underhanded . One of our crew was a jet-black negro , about whom there was something vaguely familiar , though I had seen so few negroes that they all looked alike to me . He carried his head a little forward , so that he seemed always to be looking slyly upward . When speaking , he half-laughed , as if he found the world and everyone in it irresistibly amusing . He was called Pomp by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesse Beacham , was old and stooped . His hair was almost white ; and the calm detachment of his face put me in mind of a setter dog sitting sleepily in the sun with upraisedhead , enduring the attentions of obstreperous children . Half our boat 's company were Irish , though I would n't have known it except by the names they bandied back and forth  --  Killian , Foyle , Healy , McLock  --  for in their manner of speaking they were New Englanders . They used insulting language to each other at one moment , and immediately afterward were almost sickeningly affectionate and conciliatory . There were two corporals , Webster and Crofton . Webster , thin and lugubrious , had charge of the rum rations . Crofton , a small man , quick in his movements and of a suspicious and contentious nature , had charge of the boat rations . In each boat was a breaker of rum , from which a gill was supposed to be issued to each man twice a day while we were on the lake : also every boat carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sausage , and in addition each man carried a bladder filled with corn meal , which was to be the only ration when we had left the boats and were on the march . Feeling heavy-hearted and homesick , I got to my feet and stared around , hopeful of seeing Hunk or McNott , but I could find no familiar face among the scores of green-clad figures who sat or lay among the fallen logs and mossy rocks that were thick on the knoll . In the early morning light that filtered down through the tall trees around us , those dim figures seemed unreal ; and I felt cold , lonely and miserable . Mosquitoes by the thousand whinedNORTHWEST PASSAGE 101around my face and ears . Infinitesimal insects  --  no-see-'emspiercedmy hands and neck , as with red-hot needles . I sat down again . Jesse Beacham , motionless beside me , stared into space like a benevolent white hound . " Do n't they bite you ? " I asked . He said , simply , that they did n't , and the tone in which he said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something on you so they do n't bite ? " I asked . He said " Yes , " in the same courteous tone . Soon afterward I discovered that Jesse seldom said more than " Yes " or " No " until he had , in his own mind , satisfactorily phrased a more extended reply . He liked to be exact in what he said  --  an excellent trait , but one that can be carried to excess . Not knowing Jesse 's peculiarities , I was thoroughly discouraged and wished I 'd never been such a fool as to become a part of an army . Although none of the men about me had appeared to be aware of me , I found that most of them had heard what I 'd just said . Crofton , on his knees sorting out rations , looked up at Jesse . " Tell him about your woolen strings , Grampa , " he said . " Tell him how the mosquitoes ca n't bite while you got on your woolen strings . " Jesse stared mournfully into space . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Irishmen rose on his elbow . " Of course they ai nt for insects ! The woolen strings keep off toothache . The thing that keeps off the insects is two acorns a day , eaten raw , ai nt it , Grampa ? " " No , " Jesse said . " No . The woolen strings do n't have no virtue for toothache . " Sergeant Bradley came quickly among us , stared bitterly around him ; then began to distribute biscuit and a bologna sausage apiece . Webster followed him sadly , pouring rum from a wooden canteen into our horn cups . As each man received his ration , he glanced up at Webster with a sort of furtive curiosity . When Bradley reached me , he spoke defiantly . " In dry weather102NORTHWEST PASSAGENORTHWEST PASSAGE103Jesse rubs soap on himself . He hates to talk about it , because that 's the only use he has for soap . In wet weather he greases like an Indian . " In a milder voice he spoke to Jesse . " Ai nt that what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caressing his knuckles . Bradley snorted and walked away , and Webster , having filled our cups , went on in silence , his face contemplative . I was surprisedwhen Jesse looked solicitously after him ; then the old man 's eyes met mine , and he cleared his throat . " Webster got a letter yesterday . His wife just died , and he do n't feel good . " " That 's too bad . " Jesse nodded . " Yes ; I s'pose a man gets interested in a woman after living with her a few years . " The jet-black negro , Whip , got up , came and stood beside me , and without a word held out an old brass snuff box . " What 's this ? " I asked . The box , he explained , contained bear 's grease , and if I rubbed it on myself , the mosquitoes and no-see-'ems would be less troublesome , since they disliked getting their feet greasy . I thanked Whip and rubbed some of it on my face and neck . While I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember me ? I 'm one of the Braveboat Harbor Whipples . I 'm Pomp Whipple . " Braveboat Harbor was a section of Kittery to the eastward of my home . " Then you must be one of Captain Whipple 's boys , " I said  --  " one of the boys he brought from Africa ! " Captain William Whipple was a highly respected resident of our section , who had made a fortune out of sailing a slave-ship before he was thirty years old . Pomp nodded . He 'd often seen me around Kittery , he told me , when he was younger  --  before he ran away and joined the Indians . Crofton leaned forward to wag the uneaten portion of his sausage at me . " Kittery ? You do n't talk like you come from Kittery . I come from Epping my own self . Where 'd you get to talk like an Englishman , the way you do ? " I said I was n't conscious of talking like an Englishman . Sergeant Bradley came over to stare , with what seemed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epping , " he complained , " think anybody talks foreign if he do n't sound as if he had a mouse up his nose ! " He turned his attention to me . " Funny I never see you before . I was born and brought up in Portsmouth . " I confessed that Portsmouth had seen little of me in recent years , because I had been away at college . " College ! " the sergeant said incredulously . " What college ? " When I said Harvard , he uttered an exclamation of comprehension . " Harvard ! No wonder you do n't sound right to Crofton ! The most educated person Crofton ever heard talk was somebody up in Epping that was thinking about studying common fractions . " He eyed me speculatively . " What would you want to join the Rangers for , if you got a good home and book-learning to boot ? " " Well , " I said , " I joined on account of a man you probably know  --  seeing you 're a native of Portsmouth . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that be ? " " Wyseman Clagett . " The sergeant 's face was blank . Elderly , white-haired Jesse Beacham turned mournful eyes on me , and Pomp Whipple laughed nervously . " Well , well ! " Bradley said . " I never expected to see a friend of Wyseman Clagett in the Rangers . " " I 'm not exactly his friend , " I said . I told him how , in a private room in Stoodley 's Tavern , I had unwittingly insulted Clagett and Sheriff Packer , and been helped to escape by the intervention of Cap Huff and Hunk Marriner . My boat-mates gathered around and listened , and Pomp Whipple , rolling his eyes , chuckled delightedlyat inopportune moments . Bradley ruminatively sucked a pine splinter ; and when I had finished , he said carelessly , " When you go home , some of us better go along , so if Clagett says anything to you , we can take his house to pieces , just to give him the idea . " From the others arose a muttering of assent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen a kindlier or pleasanter-looking set of men . It struck me as incredible that I could have thought them104 NORTHWEST PASSAGEchurlish ; and I was glad my lot had been cast with such intelligent and sympathetic companions . A distant , hoarse voice shouted - for Sergeant Bradley . My newfoundfriend left me , running . When he came back , he addressed me brusquely . " Towne , Major wants you . " CHAPTER XVIIROGERS , when I had first seen him on the preceding day , had impressed me , because of his thick lips , his long , fleshy nose and the puffy circles beneath his eyes , as one of the ugliest of men . Now I found nothing ugly about him , and was chiefly concerned with his intense and violent energy of mind and body . He was forever on the move  --  prowling among his men and staring at them , as if weighing the state of their health or equipment : eyeing a tall pine speculatively : squinting at distant landmarks : kicking at the soil underfoot as if to judge its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the air of studyingsome bothersome problem : casting quick and rather furtive glances at the faces of those near him . When I came up the knoll , he was walking in circles around a lofty spruce , at the base of which sat Captain Ogden and handsome , yellow-haired Captain Williams of the Royal Regiment ; and scattered here and there were other officers , rolled in their blankets , their heads on knapsacks . The sun had just topped the rise behind us . From the knoll the lake , half shrouded in early morning mist , looked milky . Rogers peered into that pale expanse : then stared upward and whistled sharply . " See anything ? " A guttural " No ! " emerged from the tree top . I looked up and saw Konkapot wedged against the trunk . Rogers went to his knapsack and fumbled in it . He drew out a note book and handed it to me . " Here , I want you to write down the names of men I send out , and where I send ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Put down the places we stop and what the weather 's like . I want to keep a map of this trip . This place is Buttonmould Bay . Tonight I figure on getting beyond Otter River  --  maybe as far as Split Rock . " " Split Rock ? " Captain Williams asked . His voice was polite . Rogers grinned . " Probably you think we ought to go farther ; 105106 NORTHWEST PASSAGECaptain . Maybe you think we ought to be able to reach the Winooski . " " Well , Major , " Captain Williams said apologetically , " we 've got quite a way to go . Split Rock 's only about ten miles , is n't it ? " " That 's all , " Rogers agreed , " but it 's better to take your time going ten miles and get there than trying to go thirty miles in so much of a hurry that you do n't . " Williams said nothing . " These Frenchmen , " Rogers continued patiently , " pop right up out of the water when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Yes , Indians do it , too . " He laughed . " Seems to be something about me that kind of attracts ' em . Yet , on the other hand , they do n't much like me . Anyway , we 'll take it slow and dodge ' em . You 'll see what I mean when this fog burns off . " A pine cone landed with a thump near Rogers , and he looked up inquiringly . Konkapot 's mournful voice said , " Six men in canoe ! " We stared between the tree trunks at the New York shore , dimly seen through the lifting fog , but saw nothing . A sentry ran through the heavy underbrush and up the knoll to Rogers . " Two canoes and a bateau , " he said . " There 's a canoe scouting each shore ; and the bateau 's keeping out in the middle . It 's full of Frenchmen . Fifteen Frenchmen . Six Indians in each canoe . " " How close are the canoes ? " Rogers asked . " About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Rogers said . " Tell Captain Jacobs I want him . I 'll use his Indians and the Mohawks too . " Captain Jacobs was captain of the Stockbridge Indians , and he was a nightmare . His upper body was painted black ; the lower part of his face white . On his chest was neatly depicted , in yellow paint , a representation of an officer 's gorget . His head was shaved ; the base of his scalp-lock was wrapped tightly , to the height of five inches , with a rattlesnake skin . Thus the top of his scalp-lock sprayed out above the snakeskin like a ragged shaving brush . Among the hairs of the scalp-lock were bound the rattles of several rattlesnakes . NORTHWEST PASSAGE 107Rogers was more military with this Indian officer than with any of his white officers . They saluted each other punctiliously , and Rogers not only addressed Jacobs as " Captain , " but also as " Brother Nawnawampeteoonk , " which was his real name , Jacobs being his Christian or civilized name . All the Stockbridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes and bateau and report their movements . The Mohawks were to scout north toward Otter River in an attempt to find out where the party of French and Indians had been camped the night before . These orders given , Rogers pulled at his lower lip , rolling his protuberant eyes from his concealed whaleboats to the open lake , still innocently empty of enemies . He beckoned to Captain Ogden . " Take twenty men , " he told him , " and post ' em in the brush above our boats . If that scout canoe gets sight of any of our boats , and comes in to investigate , let it get close up and then destroy every man in it . Do n't let any of ' em get away . Finish ' em all . If they do n't see our boats , let ' em go by . " Ogden summoned Sergeant Bradley , and Bradley walked around the knoll , calling off names : Beacham , Foyle , Orford , Bennett , Rice , McRae , Murphy , Thacher . I saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the positions they should take . Rogers turned to his other officers , who had folded their blankets and picked up their packs and muskets . " Join your detachments . Stay with ' em till we find out where these scout boats are bound . Tell your men to get what sleep they can . They 're not to talk or move till everything 's clear . " Instantly they hurried away , leaving the knoll deserted , except for Rogers and me . The Stockbridge Indians , stripped to leggins and breech-clouts , came over the shoulder of the knoll and stood looking out over the calm blue lake . It seemed to me that the black and white paint on their upper bodies had the effect of making them look more like shadows than men . A man 's body , some-108 NORTHWEST PASSAGEtimes , seemed to terminate at the white paint , so that one needed to hunt carefully in order to find his complete outline . Fascinated , I began sketching them as they stood there , but stopped when one of the Indians pointed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turning my head , I saw a canoe had slid into sight from behind the headland . " There they are , " Rogers said . It was n't one of the big canoes , called canot du maitre , but the next smaller size , known as a half canoe . In it were six Indians : a steersman , a bow-man , and four who were doing the paddling . All six shone in the early morning sun as if lacquered . Their faces were painted green and yellow : their bodies black and red . When the canoe swung into the bay on a long curve , about fifty yards from shore , we could see the shaved heads of the bow-man and steersman moving slowly from side to side : see them lift their eyes , white in their painted faces , to the treetops  --  hunting , no doubt , for signs of smoke . I looked for the Stockbridge Indians , to sec what they thought of these strangers , but they had vanished , and the knoll where they had stood seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : no sound . Even the groups below me had melted away . Wrapped in their green blankets , the Rangers looked like moss-covered logs or boulders . The canoe slid around the bay . Far out in mid-lake a bateau slowly held a straight course toward Crown Point . The oarsmen wore buckskins ; but in the bow and stern were men in white uniforms  --  French officers . These were the first French soldiers 1 had ever seen , and in the distance , on the bosom of that placid lake , they looked like painted little toy soldiers for children to play with . I could n't feel that they were dangerous , or deadly enemies , or that they , and others like them , had fought our colonists for five long years : had sent Indians by thousands against our settlements : had allowed Indians to butcher women and children and unarmed colonists two years ago at Fort William Henry : had slaughtered thousands of our men a year ago at Ticonderoga . NORTHWEST PASSAGE 109When the bateau and canoes had vanished beyond the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . They had n't seen our whaleboats , and the camp was at ease once more . Men puttered with knapsacks and muskets ; entered into involved and endless arguments ; spread blankets on the ground and played at five-card loo with a deal of finger-wetting and slappingdown of cards ; slept , rolled up like cocoons in green strouds . It was noon before I could sleep myself ; for Rogers kept me with him , even though he must have seen I found trouble in stayingawake ; and in that time I came to have , from Rogers ' remarks to me , a clearer understanding of the Rangers and of the men who made up that body . Most of them , both officers and men , had en listed as Rangers , and were nothing but Rangers at any time . A fair number , however , were temporarily attached to the Rangers because they were officers or men from other parts of General Amherst 's army who seemed well equipped to become skilled in the type of marching and fighting for which Rogers was famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a school in which his most promising officers and men could learn the only type of warfare that could ever be successful in forest fighting , and having learned it , they would be able , in future campaigns , to impart their knowledge to others . Thus Captain Williams was normally a captain in the Royal Regiment ; Captain Dunbar from Gage 's Light Infantry ; Captain Butterworth a Provincial Captain ; Ensign Avery from Fitch 's Provincial regiment ; and a full quarter of the men were selected from Provincial regiments , from the Royal Highlanders , from Gage 's Light Infantry and from other British regiments whose fighting experience , up to now , had been limited to meeting the enemy in close formation in open fields  --  a suicidal method when employed against French and Indians accustomed to forest warfare . The Stockbridge Indians , too , were Rangers ; but the Mohawks were not . The Mohawks had been sent to General Amherst by Sir William Johnson , who lived in the Mohawk Valley and was the Superintendent of Northern Indians for the British Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , had ordered110 NORTHWEST PASSAGEthem to accompany Major Rogers as scouts . From the Major 's tone when he spoke of them , I gathered he was not enthusiastic about Mohawks . Every moment Rogers was more of a marvel to me . He seemed unable to feel fatigue . Almost continually he prowled around the camp , examining boats , talking with sentries , scrutinizing the lake ; even stopping to watch the progress of card games . I was always surprised to see the small distinction he made betweenofficers and men . He stood over a group rolling dice on a blanket , and took part in it by throwing down a shilling . The shilling became two : then four . The men were familiar with him , daring him to let it stay . He took up his shillings , however , and prowled away , abusing them good-naturedly ; telling them they knew nothing about the game , at which they guffawed . Even though I was new to the army , I had lived near a British garrison and knew that a British officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equality with his men like this . Twice when we were alone , he returned abruptly to the fragmentaryconversation we 'd held in his tent at Crown Point on the preceding day . Had I , he asked , read the book about Captain Middleton 's voyage in search of the Northwest Passage ? I said I had ; that it was a short book ; and then he cross-examined m , e upon it as though he had no other interest in life . He could think of more things to ask in a minute than I could have thought of in a week . What , he wanted to know , had interestedDobbs in the Northwest Passage ? What made Dobbs so sure of its existence ? What reasons did Captain Middleton have for thinking there was n't a Northwest Passage ? Did the book mention other attempts to find it ? Who were the Spaniards who had tried it ? What Indian nations were mentioned in Dobbs 's book ? Did the English seem greatly interested in the Northwest Passage ? Did Dobbs 's book have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say concerning the expenses connected with finding the Northwest Passage ? Some of his questions I could answer and some I could n't , but I knew the answer to the last one . Dobbs , I told him , had said theNORTHWEST PASSAGE 111expenses were large , and he had persuaded the Lords of the Admiralty to offer a standing reward of  --  20,000 to the person whoshould discover the Northwest Passage . Rogers whistled . " Twenty thousand pounds ! " he murmuredmeditatively . " Twenty thousand pounds ! " What he thought , there was no way of knowing . Whatever hewas doing or saying or hearing , he wore always a semi-deferential , semi-apologetic , semi-amiable smile , just as some men perpetuallywear a preoccupied frown . He let me go , finally . Only twenty-four hours had passed since. leg-weary from my long march with Hunk , I had looked for the first time on Crown Point and the army ; and it began to seem to me I had been in the army all my life , and had never rested . CHAPTER XVIIITHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to Otter River ; but short as the journey was , it was long enough to rob me of my only friends , and to come within an inch of putting an end to the expedition . It was long enough , too , to give me a respect for Rogers that endured . Toward sundown the Mohawks had returned from the northwardwith the news that they had found no signs of a place where the bateauload of Frenchmen might have camped . Rogers listened without comment to the report of their spokesman , but he was far from satisfied . " Damn it , " he complained to Williams , " those Frenchmen camped somewhere ! If I 'd been in their place , I 'd have camped at Otter River . They came past us early in the morning  --  just the proper time for ' em to get here if they 'd started from Otter River at daybreak . I know damned well they did n't row all night ! By God , I wonder if those Mohawks just went far enough from camp to lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked anything Sir William Johnson had a hand in , and it was he who sent those Mohawks to General Amherst ! " When Captain Ogden opined that the Mohawks were , probably , no different from any other Indians  --  as good scouts , doubtless , as Stockbridge Indians , Rogers stared at him owlishly . " Maybe they are , " he said , " but whatever white man 's discipline they got , they got from Johnson , and Johnson does n't know any more about discipline than he does about war . I 've had these Stockbridge Indians with me for three years , and they do what they 're told . If the General had eft it to me , I would n't have taken Johnson 's Mohawks , any more than I 'd have taken those men from the regular army . " Captain Jacobs and his Stockbridge Indians came back at dusk and reported that the French in the bateau and the Indians in the two canoes had gone to a headland from which they had an un-112NORTHWEST PASSAGE 113obstructed view south to Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head , but gave orders for the whaleboats to be uncovered and launched , and for the oars to be wrapped with strips of blanketing . When the men were aboard , he went from boat to boat , warning the crews to be silent . Under no condition , he told them , were they to talk . The cry of a loon , given twice , would be the signal to stop rowing : given once , the signal to go ahead . The night was cold  --  so cold that my neck ached and my muscles seemed made of wood . A heavy mist hung low over the water , thrusting clammy fingers against our flesh and through our garments . Rogers , a towering figure in the stern of our boat , explored the air currents with his beak of a nose , seeming to feel them as an animal might . From time to time , startlingly , the vacant , hysterical , laugh of a loon burst from his lips , and we lay drifting silently , rocking a little on the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night we could hear him sniffing and whuffling like a suspicious bear . Four miles of rowing brought us to the shallows that lie off the mouth of Otter River ; and it was here that his snuffling was rewarded . He had stopped us with that singularly vacant burst of laughter , and so long did he hold us motionless that it seemed to me our boat itself vibrated with our shivering . Not a sound could we hear save the faint chirping of small birds , far overhead , moving south ; yet Rogers , apparently , was aware of something . We could feel him lean from side to side : hear him sniff as a questing dog sniffs , blowing outward as if to freshen his organs of scent : then drawing the air jerkily into his nostrils . Of course it could n't actually have been altogether smell ; he had some sort of sixth sense that the rest of us lacked . Just when I thought our waiting would never end , a faint but unmistakable sound came out of the mist dead ahead  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Portsmouth docks , when brigs and schooners stirred uneasily at the push of a rising tide . It was the muted screaking of the jaws of a boom , working against a mast . Rogers sank down in the stern of the boat . " Frenchman anchored114 NORTHWEST PASSAGEoff the mouth of the river , " I heard him whisper to Captain Williams . " We can row around it , " Williams breathed . " No telling how many vessels there are , " Rogers said softly . " We got to get past ' em , and there 's only one sure way . We 'll have to go where they ca n't go . " Obeying his whispered orders , the seventeen whaleboats silently floated backward , like the ghost of some strange lake monster : then nosed off to the eastward , into a bay so shallow that our oarbladesscraped bottom  --  so shallow that long before the boats had reached the shore , we had climbed overboard to drag them through the mud and the clustered water plants . It seemed more like a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats should move across that mud-puddle of a bay without a shout , without a curse , without the splashing of water , or the thump of a dropped oar against a thwart , or the rumble of one boat colliding with another . That was how they moved , however , so that we came safely to a dark , low-lying bank from which mosquitoes rose by the million to devour us . We covered ourselves as well as we could from the bloodthirsty insects , and when the dawn came we went to work carrying the boats . Otter River has a peculiar mouth . In the centuries during which it has poured its brown flood down from the sharp hills to the eastward of Champlain , it has brought with it so much soil that it has built for itself a narrow spit of land , projecting a mile into the lake . This spit of land has made two bays out of the one into which it extends , and along the spit runs the river . A sketch of the bay and the river-mouth , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrusting out an eager tongue as if wishful of gulping down the succulent little island that lies a mere three-quarters of a mile away . Above the tongue is North Otter Bay , which is deep ; below it is South Otter Bay , so shoal as to be dangerous , in spots , to anything but a canoe . It was through the shallows of South Otter Bay that we dragged our boats ashore on the tongue of land along whichNORTHWEST PASSAGE 115the river pours itself into the lake ; and it was across this tongue of land that we were obliged to carry the boats in order to get to the northward of the French . After an hour of back-breaking labor , steaming with sweat , up to our middles in water , almost eaten alive by mosquitoes , we finally brought the boats to the edge of North Otter Bay and covered them with brush at the foot of the wooded hill that lies to the north of the river mouth . There we lay , simmering and fuming , while Rogers set off for the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain additional information about the French.  --  I say that we simmered and fumed , but those words are in adequate to express the current of rage against the Mohawks that ran through the camp as flame runs through dry grass . The heat , perhaps , had set our nerves on edge : perhaps our long and silent labors had made our anger keener . Whatever the reason , the whole camp was furious at the Mohawks : and when Rogers came back , bringing word that there had been and still were three French sloops ranged between the river mouth and Diamond Island , the language used to describe Sir William Johnson 's Indians becamebiblical . Every man in the detachment knew that the Mohawks had been sent on a scout toward Otter River on the preceding day . These French sloops , almost necessarily , had been anchored in this same spot during the entire time the Mohawks were on their scout ; for the occupants of the bateau and two canoes that had passed us must have been sent out from these very vessels . The failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French craft had endangeredthe whole expedition . Lacking a leader as astute as Rogers , we would probably have been discovered if there had been only one French sloop . With three of them lying across the channel , our escape was miraculous . All around us the men cursed the Mohawks openly and bitterly , calling them murdering red hellions , dirty red skunks , and names116 NORTHWEST PASSAGEunfit to repeat ; and only the Mohawks themselves seemed unconsciousof the temper of the detachment . They sat at the water 's edge , looking like thirteen skinned foxes , and complacently daubed vermilion bands across countenances previously blackened with soot ; and those who had business in their vicinity sheered away from them as though they were vipers . Rogers prowled restlessly at the foot of the hill , making sure that the boats were properly concealed , and issuing orders for the picketing of the camp . My brief experience of the day before had taught me how to stick close to his left elbow , ready to note down his orders , and at the same time keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avery 's detachments and the Stockbridge Indians , fully equipped : then sent them off to join Avery and Turner on the slope of the hill overlooking the river mouth , where they had been left to watch the sloops . He kept Captain Jacobs with him , and sent word to Turner by Captain Jacobs ' Indian lieutenant , Lieutenant Solomon , that he and Jacobs would also come to watch the sloops as soon as the camp was in order . Then , followed by Jacobs and me , he went to the northern slope of the hill , where the whaleboat crews had settled themselves , and there , beside a tall spruce , he halted . " Now , " Rogers said to Jacobs , " tell those Mohawks I want to see ' em . Their hash is all loose in ' em : we 'll have to settle it . " CHAPTER XIXTHERE WERE THIRTEEN of the Mohawks , and when they stood before Rogers , staring at him out of eyes as dull and black as the soot on their faces , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their heads were flatter than those of the Stockbridge Indians , and that flatness was accentuated by the scalp-locks which lay against their shaved and blackened skulls . From ear to ear , across their eyes and the bridges of their noses , they had painted vermilion bands that seemed to me unpleasantly like the stripes upon serpents . All of them wore their blankets fastened around their waists and hanging down in folds , and above those folds their thin , soot-daubed upper bodies rose lithe and tense . Unquestionably the thirteen were contemptuous , defiantand dangerous . Rogers stared at them : then glanced around the knoll  --  at the officers on either side of him ; at the groups of Rangers chewing busily at their morning rations , their faces turned toward the little knot of painted Mohawks . It was a smolderingly silent audience that the commander had when he began to speak . " Our brothers the Mohawks , " he said , and his thick voice was almost kindly , " are known to all the world as great warriors . They have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we , their friends , understood they had come to raise their hatchets in behalf of the great King their father . Because they are known to be terrible in war , the great King , speaking from the mouth of his most trusted leader , General Amherst , gave orders that they should go with me to act as my eyes and ears against our enemies , the French . Now it may be that we have not understood correctly why our friends the Mohawks came to Crown Point to join the army of General Amherst , so we will ask them to tell us why they came . " He nodded to Captain Jacobs , who interpreted his words to the Mohawks in a language that was pleasant to hear , even though the117118 NORTHWEST PASSAGElistener understood none of it . When Captain Jacobs had finished , one of the Mohawks replied , and the gist of his speech , again translated by Captain Jacobs , was that their father was Sir William Johnson , and that Sir William Johnson had asked them to come to Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water that his children the Mohawks were still his children , obedient to his wishes and to the wishes of their friend and benefactor , Sir William Johnson . " Our father , Sir William Johnson , " the Mohawk said , " understandsthat there is a time to fight and a time not to fight , but there are some who do not understand this . We left our homes before the corn was harvested , and we have no way of knowing whether our crops were large or small . If they were small , we must start at once to kill game for our families unless we wish them to starve . Any wise man knows this . Yet instead of thanking us for coming to Crown Point to show our friendship for the great King and giving us presents to carry back to our families , your general without consulting us sent us off on a long journey to kill someonewe have never seen . If we had known we would be sent or such a journey , we would never have come to Crown Point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Rogers again spoke amiably . " I see that we did not understand why Sir William Johnson sent our brothers the Mohawks to join us . He sent them to eat our food and drink our rum and do nothing , and we have not been accustomed to expect such behavior from warriors . We expect such actions from old women , but nor from brave men . We did not understand , probably , because Sir William Johnson did not tell us that he had instructed his children the Mohawks to behave like old women . He should have told us . Since he did not , we can not blame our brothers the Mohawks fob not wishing to go on this journey . " There is another thing , too , that we do not understand , and we will be pleased if our brothers the Mohawks will explain it to us . Yesterday , knowing that the Mohawks were skilled in tracking enemies , we sent them to Otter River to discover the camping ground of the French . Since they made no complaints , we supNORTHWESTPASSAGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their orders . There were three vessels at Otter River : yet our brothers the Mohawks failed to see those vessels , They returned , saying they found nothing . We trusted them ; and because we trusted them , all of us have this morning been in danger of losing our boats and our lives . How do our brothers the Mohawks explaintheir blindness ? " The spokesman of the Mohawks replied as gravely and with as noble a bearing as though he gave utterance to the most rational and sagacious sentiments . " Sir William Johnson , " he said , " allows his children the Mohawks to do what they will . If he wishes his children to go somewhere , he asks them whether it would give them pleasure to go ; and unless the Mohawks are agreed that it would give them pleasure , they do not go . At Crown Point it is different , and here it is also different . We are told to do the thing that one man wishes us to do , regardless of our own desires . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to order us . When we were told yesterday to go on a scout to Otter River , we went a short distance and then held a council to decide whether we wished to go further . Some were willing , but others were not . Each man made an oration , and when all had spoken , more were in favor of returning than of going forward . Therefore we re-turned . " I know now that Indians are peculiar people , and can not be judged as white men are judged . I have learned that some of them are so direct and honest in their manner of thinking that they are as wise , in many ways , as the wisest white men ; but most of them are simple to absurdity  --  so simple that they can only be depended on to do the wrong thing : to waste food when it should be saved : to rely on dreams when reason is essential : to be reckless when caution is advisable and cautious when recklessness is imperative : to lie when truthfulness is required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run home when they are most needed , and get under foot when they are least wanted : to punish harmless transgressions with death and ignore the most heinous crimes . In those days , however , I knew nothing about120 NORTHWEST PASSAGEIndians , and the Mohawks seemed to me to be treacherous , and as dangerous to us as mad dogs : shooting , I thought , was far too good a death for them . Rogers had different ideas , and his reply was as gentle in its manner as though he were praising the Mohawks for faithful service . " We are grateful to our brothers the Mohawks for explaining to us the things which we did not understand , and we are grateful to them , also , for coming such a long journey to show their friendship . We need their help , and we hope they will always be our friends . We also hope that some day they will learn our method of making war , as have our brothers from Stockbridge . Our brothers say that Sir William Johnson allows them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what they wanted to do in this section of the country  --  if , when they were put on guard over a camp , they should prefer to wrap themselves in their blankets and sleep  --  they would soon lose their scalps . What is worse , those whom they were supposed to guard would also lose their scalps . " We have discovered that this is not a good way to make war . It is impossible to make war if you are dead , and the only way to stay alive when fighting the French is for wise men to give orders beforehand as to what must be done ; then for everybody to obey those orders without arguing , whether he wants to or not . That is why , in our army , soldiers are shot when they do not obey orders .  --  when they decide to do as they will . " Since our brothers the Mohawks are accustomed to do as they will  --  accustomed to disobey orders if they find those orders displeasing  --  theyshould be careful to serve only under Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will probably be shot . Since the Mohawks are our friends , I do not wish to hurt their feelings or the feelings of Sir William Johnson by shooting any of them . Neither am I willing to keep them with us any longer ; for they will only eat our provisions and drink our rum and refuse to obey orders . Therefore they must go back to Crown Point . But if they should tell the truth as to why they went back , General Amherst might have them shot , so they must say theyNORTHWEST PASSAGE 121became sick . They can say they became sick from something they ate . It may seem remarkable that all the Mohawks on this expeditionshould become sick together , all at one time , and probably they will be called old women for doing so ; but it is better to be called old women than to be shot . " He leaned casually upon a musket and waited for Captain Jacobs to translate . The Mohawks , seemingly indifferent to Jacobs ' words , stared straight ahead out of lacklustre eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers said , when Jacobs had finished . " We need their boat , so they 're to go by land . Have ' em get their belongings from their boat and set off immediately . " He turned to Captain Williams . " You 're in command , Captain , until I come Lack . I 'll have to find out what those sloops are doing . " ONE of the fundamental differences , it seems to me , between Indians and white men who are known as civilized is that the white man has been more or less disciplined , whereas Indians , as a rule , are free of disciplinary measures from their earliest days . Indian children are never whipped for wrong-doing ; drunken Indians are held guiltless of crimes committed while intoxicated ; no Indian is forced by his tribe or nation to do anything he does n't want to do ; lazy Indians are supported by more industriousones . Because of that lack of discipline , Indians are supposedto be more savage , cruel , treacherous , cowardly , shortsightedthan any other race . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men who , because of panic , mob excitementor lack of leadership , have temporarily broken away from the discipline that is supposed to be the white man 's birthright . The Mohawks went quietly enough to their boat when Rogers and Jacobs were out of sight , and all over the knoll Rangers rose to their feet to see them go , and never before had I heard profanityto equal that which accompanied them . On rejoining the crew of Number One whaleboat to devour my delayed breakfast , I found even Jesse Beacham gazing mournfully after the red men and mildly repeating the words " drammed red bustards . " The Irishmen among Number One 's boat-crew were in such a temper that they were wrangling passionately with one another , while in the adjoining crew Sergeant McNott , purple-faced with rage , stared belligerently about him , as if for someone to attack . Hunk Marriner crawled over to sit beside me . " Ai nt it a shame , " he said , " that Indians do n't have pelts half as good as a weasel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently urged me to write down in my book , where Rogers would see it , that it would pay the British government not to make presents to Mohawks except those who had kept farthest away during three consecutive campaigns. 122ment at those dreadful Indians , who would have sacrificed all of us to their own senseless stupidity , and so hot was this resentment that it seemed to me I would have had as little hesitation in killing a Mohawk as in shooting a porcupine that had filled my dog 's mouth and tongue with quills . Someone shouted near the river bank , where the boats were hidden in the brush , but so engrossing was my anger that the sound made no impression on me : I forgot noise had been forbidden : forgot , that is , until McNott leaped to his feet and violentlyhurled a stick in the direction of the shout . Captain Williams ran down from the knoll , and there was sudden and unaccustomedmovement in all the groups . Hunk scrambled back to his detachment , seized his musket and snapped up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were picking up their muskets and getting to their knees , peering toward the boats . Out from the brush in which the boats had been hidden stumbledone of the Mohawks , and close behind was Captain Butterfield , a Provincial officer from New Hampshire . Butterfield , burly and red-faced at all times , looked even redder now . He was clutchingat the Indian 's greasy shoulder ; and the Indian , encumbered by a musket , his pack and a bulky powder bag , staggered but was not stopped . Captain Williams went past the Mohawk on the run , caught Butterfield 's outstretched arm and swung him abruptly to a halt . The whole knoll boiled with men in green buckskins . A phalanx of them seemed to spring from the ground behind Williams , and without knowing how I got there , I found myself in the front row of this formation , with Hunk and McNott crowded close against me . The Indian , halted by the wall of men , turned and would have gone back past Williams and Butterfield toward the boats , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For God 's sake ! " Williams cried . " You ca n't do that , Captain ! " The Indian had bounced to his feet like an enormous red squirrel , his eyes darting here and there as if seeking a hole through which he might scramble ; but Rangers had run between him and124 NORTHWEST PASSAGE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 125the boats : he was penned in a ring of men with Williams and Butterfield . " Ca n't ! " Butterfield cried . " Ca n't ! Why ca n't I ? Those red skunks stole the powder and the rum out of the boat ! It ai nt theirs : it 's ours ! They ca n't wreck us and rob us too  --  not without learning a lesson ! I caught this one , by God , and I 'll make an example of him ! " From the circle of men came angry words : " Blow his head off ! Stick a knife in him ! " " Where 'd the rest of ' em go ? " Williams asked . " They went up river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this one wont ! " " Lieutenant Dunbar ! " Williams called . " Lieutenant Grant ! Take your men to the river bank and see there 's no trouble . I want all the other officers to take their men out of this crowd . Get ' em back to their camps where they belong . " He never took his eyes off Butterfield . Behind me I heard the voices of officers calling their men by name . " Now , Captain , " Williams said to Butterfield , " just step to one side and let this Indian join his company . We want ' em out of camp , all of ' cm . " " I do n't care what you want ! " Butterfield said . " That red hellion ai nt going to get out of here with that bag of powder ! I wont back down for those dirty rats . " " You 've got your orders , Captain Butterfield , " Williams said coldly . " Let this man through . " " You go to hell ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can throw us any kind of an order , no matter whether there 's sense to it or not . Well , by God , you ca n't ! ' We 've got brains : just as many as you have  --  and better ones , too , most of the time ! " From somewhere in the circle of silent Rangers came a hoarse whisper , clearly heard by everyone . " You lousy Provincial ! " The ring of men wavered and shifted . I saw three or four Provincialsmove around behind Butterfield , and realized that nearlyall the men close to him were Provincials . Butterfield 's face , which had so recently been scarlet with excitement , had grown pale . " Lousy Provincials ! " he said in a shaking low voice . " Lousy Provincials ! That 's what you think , but where would you pigheadedEnglishmen be if it was n't for us  --  you and your damned murdering Highlanders and your drunken black Irishmen . You 'd be two feet underground , where you damned well belong ! You ai nt Rangers ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On the edge of the circle a man from a Highland regiment suddenlyhit one of the Provincials on the jaw . Two Provincials jumped at him and the three went down in a tangle of fists . McNott leaped for the struggling men , dragged them apart , sent the Highlander flying with a tremendous kick , jerked one of the Provincials to his feet , and slapped his face resoundingly . Then , as if he 'd completed one slight task and was ready to take up another , he looked about him invitingly , waiting for further infractionsof discipline . " Captain Butterfield , " Williams said , " if Provincials have a bad reputation among regular troops , it 's because of actions like yours . That Mohawk is going safely out of this camp . If you interfere . I 'll have you courtmartialled . " Instead of answering , Butterfield snatched at the bag of powder beneath the Mohawk 's arm . The Mohawk threw himself on the ground , and in a moment the circle of men had turned into a sort of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cursing maniacs , all filled , seemingly , with the desire to tear each other to shreds . I saw the Mohawk , still clutching his musket and powder bag , creeping among the feet of these grunting , fist-swinging madmen ; - saw Butterfield kick him brutally in the side . The Mohawk writhed like a snake , grasped the knife that hung by a thong on his breast , and plunged it into the powder bag . I heard McNott shouting violently in my ear . Hunk 's contorted face appeared close to mine : his flailing arm struck my cheek and swept me out of the circle and flat on my back. 126 NORTHWEST PASSAGEThen I heard a musket shot , followed instantly by a gigantic thump  --  more of a stupendous concussion than an explosion . It seemed almost to pluck the moccasins from my feet , the clothes from my body , the hair from my head : it pressed me down as though an invisible feather bed had fallen on me.  --  When I got to my knees , dazed , the cluster of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy were stretched on the ground , a smoldering , feebly-moving tangle of human wreckage from which came groans and incoherences . The air was filled with the thick and salty smell of gunpowder , the musty odor of burning leather ; and high in the trees hung a slowlydriftingcloud of bluish smoke . I was conscious of men running from all sides toward this writhing , smoking heap . I crawled among them myself , looking for Hunk Marriner . I recognized him by his fair hair . He was on ' his knees , pawing with one hand at the shoulder of his Ranger 's smock , from which came wisps of gray smoke , and his face and hands were black . " Wait , " I said . " Let it alone . I 'll cut it away . " With my knife I sawed the sleeve from his shirt and peeled it down his arm . Powder had somehow blown inside his shirt and burned there , leaving his whole shoulder black and streaked with blood . " Can you put it out ? " Hunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " I said . " It 's out . It 's all out . Put your arm around me and I 'll get you away from here . " Hunk lifted his hands . Both palms were blown full of powder grains . " I damned near got that powder bag from him , " he said . " I almost had my hands on it when he fired his musket into it . What happened to the Mohawk ? " I heard McNott 's voice behind me , husky and sour . " He got away . " I looked around . McNott sat with his legs stretched straight in front of him . His face was as black as Hunk 's . The left leg of his breeches had been slit open , and burning powder had so searedNORTHWEST PASSAGE 127his knee that the tendons showed white through the blackened , bloody flesh . Ogden came behind us and looked closely at the sergeant . " Here 's McNott , " he told the Rangers with him . " Move him up on the ridge . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Careful of that leg , " McNott said , " or I 'll wring your damned necks ! Half my leggins got blown into that hole . " " I 'll take Marriner , " I told Ogden . " They 'll hurt his shoulder if they try to carry him . " I got him around the waist and hoisted him to his feet . When I turned him toward the knoll , Captain Williams came up to us and looked hard at Hunk 's shoulder . The captain was almost unrecognizable . The whole side of his face was blown full of powder , his left eye was completely closed , and the towcoloredhair on half of his head had been singed off , leaving a charred stubble . Captain Ogden , at his elbow , spoke to him imploringly . " That eye ought to be looked at , Captain . You ought to have it tended to . " " It 's nothing , Captain , " Williams said cheerfully . " I 'm quite all right . Just take care of the others and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You behaved well . You very nearly saved us all . " " I thought I had it , " Hunk said . " I ought to known what he figured on doing when he stuck his knife in the bag . " " Not at all , " Williams said . " Not at all . You acted as quickly as anyone could have . You 'll make a good Ranger . I 'd be pleased to have you in my company . " He peered at Hunk 's wound out of his one good eye . " Yes , " he added with simulated cheerfulness . " You 'll be all right  --  all right . " Swaying like a drunken man , he turned to leave us , but Ogden took him by the arm and steered him between the trees . From his closed , puffed eye a stream of moisture had washed a white furrow on his blackened cheek . The sickening thought struck me that in all probability he would never lead another company ; that Hunk might not only never serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his shoulder again . I had made my friend as comfortable on the knoll as I could128 NORTHWEST PASSAGEand was picking powder from his wound when I saw Rogers coming back to the camp from his excursion to look at the sloops . I had expected him to show violent anger at what had happened , or perhaps grief ; but what I seemed to read in his face was a sort of grim amusement and a kind of regretful relief . Then Sergeant Bradley came to look after Hunk and I left them and went to Rogers with the orderly book . Officers crowded close around him , . and before him stood Captain Butterfield , making a halting explanation . He seemed entirely unhurt . " We needed that powder , " Butterfield said . " If captain Williams had n't interfered , I 'd ' a ' taken it away from him without any trouble , and none of this would have happened . " Rogers laughed . " You do n't know what would have happened . You were dealing with an Indian , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Indian . No matter how these Indians behave , we need to keep ' em friendly . We 've got enough unfriendly ones yowling around us without adding to the number ! " He pulled his hat down on his head , glared at his officers ; then fixed his eyes upon Butterfield again . " That 's all beside the . point . The point is that you did n't maintain discipline , and the moment discipline 's gone , everything 's gone . You lost your head , and maybe it 's a good thing for the rest of us that you did ! An officer who loses his head once will usually do it again , so it 's better to have it happen now than later , when we might not have got out of it so easy . " " Major , " Butterfield said earnestly , " I did n't lose my head . I knew what I was doing every minute . It was the others lost their heads . " " I wont argue Liu ; point , " Rogers said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually count on one thing : the only one who is n't hurt is the one who lost his head . Everybody else suffers in one way or another . I notice you did n't get hurt . " Anyway , captain Butterfield , you 're going back ! You 've done enough damage to mY men ; and if I have you courtmartialled , you 'll probably do more . I guess it 'll be enough punishment if you go back and report to General Amherst that sickness preventedNORTHWEST PASSAGE 129you from going farther than Otter River . You 're sick , and so are the Provincials who 'll return with you , and the Rangers and the Regulars who 'll have to go back because of this . These men are either sick or burned with gunpowder : that 's all you 're ever to tell anybody about what happened . " He moved a few steps toward the boats , then turned and called , " Captain Williams . " Williams moved forward , supported by Captain Ogden . " Captain Williams , " Rogers said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men  --  Indians , Rangers , Regulars and Provincials . Move ' em back , away from this camp , and start home at once . The rest of us 'll stay right here . " Captain Williams was a pitiful spectacle ; for although Captain Ogden had made an effort to wash off the powder stains , the flesh around his damaged eye was raw and bloody , and his other eye was almost closed in sympathy , so that he was obliged to throw his head far back in order to see . Blisters had formed where the hair had been burned from his scalp . " Major , " he said , moving his lips with difficulty , " I 'll be all right in a day or two . This is n't anything . I can see out of my right eye . I could sight a musket right now if I had to . I can march as well as " You 're going hack , Captain , " Rogers said . " Those are your orders . You 'll have to go back by land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll take every Ranger and every Regular who was burned or who has powder marks on his uniform . " " Major , " Captain Williams mumbled , " I 'd like to say one more word . " " All right , " Rogers said . " Say it . " " Major , " Williams continued , " that 'll mean sending back pretty near thirty men , not counting the Mohawks . Counting the Mohawks , you 'll lose over forty men . That 's twenty percent  --  a higher percentage than you 'd lose in two battles if you had bad luck . I do n't believe you can afford that many , Major . Could n't you reconsiderthose orders , Major ? I figure practically all of us could make the trip , Major  --  Captain Butterfield and all the rest of us . " " Look here , Captain , " Rogers said . " You ca n't bandage that eye130 NORTHWEST PASSAGEproperly . You do n't even know what 's happened to it . You ca n't keep the flies out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods ? I 'll have to send another man home with you ! I wont take the chance ! Captain Williams , you 're going back because you 're incapacitated and so are some others , but the most are going because they have n't shown themselves subject to discipline . If there 'd been a hundred in it , I 'd send a hundred back . I do n't give a damn how big a percentage of ' em I lose if they are n't subject to discipline . By God , I 'd make this expedition with fifty men  --  yes , with ten men  --  and do more with those ten than I could do with two hundred that did n't obey orders . " He lowered his head and stared at his officers out of stony eyes . " All the men in this detachment are Rangers , understand ? Rangers ! They are n't Scotchmen or Englishmen or Irishmen or Provincials or Regulars or anything else : they 're Rangers ! If I find two Irishmen leagued together as Irishmen and not as Rangers , by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within twenty feet of where we 're going . " CHAPTER XXII WONDERED , that night , as we pulled silently out of North Otter Bay into the teeth of a northeast storm , why I felt no sense of loss at leaving Hunk and Sergeant McNott behind . I thought , at the time , it was because I was numb from bodily misery and lack of sleep  --  because of the drenching rain that trickled coldly down my neck to form a puddle in my soggy buckskins . I know now that when we lose a friend in war , he never quite seems gone . We think of him as being somewhere near , in another company , where we can find him readily enough  --  if the everlasting work is ever done , and the everlasting discipline permits . The worst part of our water journey lay behind us ; for although we still had twice as far to row as we had already come , we had passed the narrowest part of the lake and would henceforth be in more open waters , less likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this I thought , for a time , our progress might be easier , but instead it became more difficult . For five successive days after we left Otter River the storm howled out of the northeast , drenching us with rain , numbing us with cold , and making travel an agony . As we approached the eastern arm of Lake Champlain , which ends blindly in Missisquoi Bay , the eastern shore along which we coasted each night became flatter and flatter ; and on this flat land we were obliged to find complete concealment before dawn each day for a hundred and sixty men and seventeen whaleboats . A mile or two away we could see Grand Isle and Isle la Motte , rich in rocky coves and wooded country ; but Rogers grinned like a satyr at the suggestion of camping there . " Yes , sir , " he said , when he saw Ogden studying the heavy timber of Grand Isle , " that 's might pretty country . When the French come looking for us , they 'll look there first of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box . We 'd have no place to retreat to , and that would be the end of us. " 131132 NORTHWEST PASSAGE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 133 " I suppose so , " Ogden admitted . Rogers laughed abruptly . " You bet it 's so ! The place to hide is in the last place the French would think of looking  --  a place we can escape from if they find us . We 'll camp right out on the flat land , and nowhere else ! " It takes time to conceal a hundred and sixty men and seventeen whaleboats in open country , but we did it  --  did it in the darkness , without lights or fires , and so thoroughly that when daylight came , we had apparently vanished from the face of the earth . Through the loth of September we lay opposite Grand Isle in a pelting rainstorm and saw nothing . On the 21st , hiding abreast of a passageway between the islands , we saw four scout canoes prowling from cove to cove along the western shore . At mid-afternoon they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where we lay , but paying no attention to the low expanse of brush that screened us  --  brush so insignificantthat a deer , standing in it , would have stuck out like a blue heron in a frog pond . On the 22nd , our long row almost over , we made our camp on the peninsula separating Missisquoi Bay from the main body of Lake Champlain . At our left was the narrow strait between the Bay and the Lake ; and ahead of us , beyond Missisquoi 's blue surface , lay the endless flat expanse of Canada . What we would find when we set out to cross that flat expanse , I did n't know . Rogers himself did n't know . Not even Captain Jacobs and his Stockbridge Indians knew . We were certain of just two things : the town of St. Francis was ninety miles due north , and in all that ninety miles there was no house , no road , not even a path . When the men speculated as to what lay before them , Sergeant Bradley shut them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he growled . " You fellers been grumbling about not liking to row whaleboats , and about the blisters on your tails , and about having to shiver all day and work all night . Well , after tomorrow there wont be none of that ! You wont have no boats to row ; and you wont have no time to sit down , so you wont be bothered by blis- , ters where you got ' em now . You 'll march by day and sleep by night , like regular civilized human beings ; so you 'll have everythingjust the way you want it ! " I was so sick of whaleboats that what he said sounded , to me , encouraging . As long as I lived , I thought , I would n't care if I never saw another whaleboat ; I would n't care if I never saw anotherboat of any kind again . CHAPTER XXIITHE NEXT NIGHT we rowed cautiously into Missisquoi Bay , curved sharply to the right , and at dawn landed at its southernmost tip . " This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's firm land to hide the boats on , and the French may not find them there . Firm land 's pretty scarce in this section . " He laughed in a way I did n't like . When we hauled the boats ashore , we found the bank almost flush with the water . It was land and yet not land . The trees grew from a spongy soil that oozed water at the smallest pressure ; and as the lot of us went back and forth between the boats and the places where we deposited our belongings , our sloshings put me in mind of thousands of frightened fish caught in the shallows of a tide river . The activity of Rogers was unremittently furious . He stationed men in trees to watch for the French : then drove the rest of us at cleaning , caulking and storing the whaleboats ; and when it came to hiding them , he laid hold of Number One with Ogden and the rest of us , and helped us drag it halfway to where we were to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . The weight of our boat , as we dragged it , forced our legs deep into the marshy soil . Sergeant Bradley , helping to heave it across a deadfall , had hic breeches pulled from him by the muck . One of my moccasins was sucked off , and both of Corporal Webster 's , and when we went back to dig them out , we could scarcely find them , so completely were they engulfed . The mud seemed animate , pulled at us and squeezed us like some huge , half-slothful python that hoped to hold us and in time digest us . When we had carried the boats a hundred yards to dry earth and packed their lockers with provisions we 'd use after our return , we hid them beneath screens of pine . I had expected Canada to be cold , but the marshy forest steamed with a breathless , sultry heat . Clouds of mosquitoes rose from the swamp , 134NORTHWEST PASSAGE 135whining and singing about our heads . With every breath , we drew them into our throats , and coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man carried a whole bologna sausage , a bag of meal , two cakes of chocolate and a canteen of rum , and I heard Rogers warning the officers : " Be sure each man fills his meal bag as full as he can . God knows when we 'll get more ! Make ' em carry enough for two weeks . " No sooner were the boats hidden than he paraded us . Possessed of a demon of impatience , he was up and down our lines and everywhere , urging us to move faster , and at the same time strappingon his knapsack and blanket , hanging his belt with hatchet and corn-meal bag . He hovered around us like a persistent bee , buzzing at us to be quick  --  to hurry . He went from man to man , tweaking knapsack straps , shaking powder-horns , looking at moccasins . To me he said , to be noted in my orderly book , " I 'm leaving two Indians on the high land to watch the boats  --  Lieutenant Solomon and Konkapot . They 'll stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats . In that case Solomon and Konkapot 'll come after us to bring the report . " As the men jostled into position , fastening the last of their equipment to their belts , Sergeant Bradley hustled me into place behind Ogden and beside Jesse Beacham . Captain Jacobs and eight of his Stockbridge Indians , stripped to the waist and covered with grease and paint , ran ahead to act as advance scouts and stopped at the end of the high land to look back at us . " Follow the lake shore to the northeastern tip of Missisquoi Bay , " Rogers called up and down the lines . " That 's our meeting place in case we have to scatter . We 'll strike inland there . Until we 're out of the swamps , we 'll march abreast . " He looked from one end of his tiny army to the other , and I saw a hint of a dubious smile appear upon his heavy lips , as if we were only partly to his liking . From neck to thigh we were hung with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given us a sweaty and raffish look , and splashed us with mud and water ; and some had even rubbed themselves with mud toprotect themselves from mosquitoes . No wonder Rogers wore that dubious smile . The advance guard of Indians ranged forward , vanished , and then the long advance of the rest of us began . We struck wet ground at once , of course , and plodded into it . I hoped that we might pass it soon , and that my breeches , unlike poor Bradley 's , might remain upon me . Through the dense trees , to our left , we caught glimpses of blue Missisquoi Bay , as cool and tranquil as we were hot and uncomfortable . Rogers led us silently , moving apparently with miraculous ease , while we followed him as noiselessly as men could who were half the time sloshing through marsh , and the other half forcing themselvesthrough heavy undergrowth , fending branches from eyes and freeing knees of shrubs . Except for side glances to gauge our distances , we kept our eyes on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We stopped every hour at Rogers ' orders . " Saves straggling , " he said . " Ca n't afford straggling on this trip . " Every time we thus stopped , he walked the length of the line , examining each man : then went behind us to stare toward the rear . When , at dusk , we reached a dry ridge , he gave the word to camp for the night . The straps of my blanket and knapsack had cut me like iron bands , and to sit down was torture , but to get up was worse . I stood there watching Rogers ; wondering how he did it . He had called Bradley and Lieutenant Farrington , and with their help had hoisted himself to the lower branches of a tall spruce . He went up it like a big squirrel , almost to the top , and clung there , peering back along our route . There was nothing , no exertionor hardship , he could n't bear and be fresh at the end of it . Through the dull fatigue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last thing I heard at night , and it was that , same thick voice that , in the morning , awakened me to a wet blanket and aching joints . I can hear him now , shouting to the officers : " Get ' em up ! They got ten minutes to get started ! Get ' em up ! Get ' em up ! " We were two days reaching the northern end of Missisquoi Bay ; and it was at the end of the second day that I understood one of the reasons why Rogers so often studied the country we 'd left behind us . We had just made camp . From the penetrating feel of the windlessair , which cut into us the moment we stopped moving , I knew we were in for a frost . We needed fires badly , not only to dry our blankets , but to warm our aching feet : to make hot food and hot rum ; but since our orders forbade fire , we were doing what we could to make ourselves comfortable ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into camp , and with him came Solomon and Konkapot . " They found our boats ! " Bradley called . " The damned French found our boats ! " I heard a hundred men repeating the words incredulously . " They found the boats : the damned French found our boats ! " The Rangers around me did simple and foolish things . One dusted the corn meal from his sausage and replaced it in his knapsack . Another pulled off his Scotch cap and peered within it . A third took his blanket from the ground and shook it like a tidy housewife . Perhaps they , like myself , were trying not to remember that our means of transportation were gone , our reserves of food lost : that we were deep in enemy country , with an enemy force behind us and entire enemy armies ahead of us and on our flank . Perhaps they were merely trying not to wonder how many days of life were left to us . CHAPTER XXIIIROGERS and the two Indian runners were hemmed in by silent clusters of Rangers whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunbar made a move to push the men back , but Rogers stopped him . " All right , Lieutenant , " he said . " We 're all concerned in this . " He looked up at Solomon . " When was it ? When did they find the boats ? " It was at sundown the day before , the Indian lieutenant told him . He and Konkapot must , therefore , have travelled in twenty-four hours as great a distance as we had covered in two full days . Consequently those who had found the boats must be at least one day behind us . " How many ? " Rogers asked . Solomon ran a knotted string through his fingers to refresh his memory . Four canoes filled with Indians , he said , had entered the bay just at sunset . Behind them were twenty bateaux , each one loaded with twenty Frenchmen . Almost immediately one of the canoes had discovered where we 'd disembarked ; then they followed our trail to the concealed boats , and whooped and fired muskets in great joy . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had seen the Indians cast about for further traces of us : then give it up because of darkness . When the Frenchmen lit campfires , Solomon squirmed nearer them , saw the French commander divide his force into two parts , and to something more than half of the men distribute the suppliestaken from our boats . From this , Solomon argued that in the morning half of the four hundred Frenchmen and probably all of the forty to fifty Indians would be sent in pursuit of us . Solomon and Konkapot had travelled all night , necessarily making slow138NORTHWEST PASSAGE 139progress , but as soon as light came , they 'd come at top speed , not stopping all day for food or the slightest rest . Rogers reached behind him , picked up his shot pouch , and fumbled in it . He brought out two six-inch carrots of tobacco , which he handed to Solomon and Konkapot , who went silently away . They were tired Indians . The circle of men opened to let them through : then crowded together once more with furtive movements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their eyes gleamed whitely in the dusk . Rogers again fumbled in his shot pouch , and this time he brought forth a phosphorus bottle and a piece of paper . He gave the bottle to Captain Ogden , unfolded the paper , and looked at the circle of faces . " We 'll make up our minds right here and now , " he said rather quietly , in a steady voice . " You men have all guessed where we 're supposed to be going , but you have n't yet heard the orders . I 'll read ' em to you . " Ogden pulled the spunk from the phosphorus bottle and held it , glowing , over the paper . Rogers ' eyes , in the bluish glare of the phosphorus , looked cavernous ; and his heavy nose , enlarged by shadows , gave him the look of a grotesque , carved from stone . " General Amherst signed these orders , " he said , " and here 's what they say : " You will proceed to Missisquoi Bay , from whence you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south side of the River St. Lawrence , in such a manner as you shall judge most effectual to disgrace the enemy , and for the success and honor of His Majesty 's arms . Remember the barbarities that have been committedby the enemy 's Indian scoundrels on every occasion where they had an opportunity of showing their infamous cruelties on the King 's subjects which they have done without mercy . Take your revenge , but do n't forget that though those villains have dastardlyand promiscuously murdered the women and children of all ages , it is my orders that no women or children are killed or hurt . When you have executed your intended service , you will return140 NORTHWEST PASSAGEwith your detachment to camp , or join me wherever the army may be . " Rogers wagged the paper at us . " Those are the orders ! " I could see his head turning , like that of a gigantic owl , as he scanned our dim faces . " The French think they 've trapped us . They 've caught us where we ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers ' Rangers . They 've been trying to wipe us out for five years . Probably they 're telling each other , right this minute , that they 'll have our scalps inside three days . They 're counting the money they 'll get ! They 'll get a thousand pounds just for my head alone . Probably they 've already arranged how to divide the money . " The circle of men swayed and muttered . " They want us pretty bad , the French do , " he continued , " but if you want to know how I feel , I 'll tell you . I 've worked too damned long and too damned hard over this corps , and so have you , to see it destroyed by two hundred lousy Frenchmen and a little parcel of Indians . We 've always done things they thought could n't be done , and I do n't propose to stop now . " Almost irrelevantly he added , " Some of you fought in the Battle on Snowshoes last year . Lieutenant Phillips and Lieutenant Crof. ton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The French offered ' em good terms , so they surrendered  --  they and their party . None of ' em ever came back . Maybe you remember - what happened to ' em . Lieutenant Crofton 's brother can tell you . in case you 've forgotten . He 's in Number One Company right now . Maybc he 'd care to speak up and say . " Crofton spoke up . His voice was shrill . " They tore my brother 's arms out of him . They chopped the ends of his ribs away from his backbone and pried ' em out through his skin , one by one . I do n't care how many French and Indians there arc ! I do n't care if there 's a million of ' cm ! If there 's only two hundred , I can pretty ncar kill ' em all myself ! " Nobody said a word . NORTHWEST PASSAGE 141Rogers nodded . " That 's what happened to Lieutenant Crofton . Lieutenant Phillips had a strip of skin ripped upward from his stomach . They hung him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They chopped up his men with hatchets and threw the pieces up into the pines , so there was n't any way of putting ' em together again . The frosty air around us was so still that I could hear sentries , a hundred yards away , moving with sucking sounds in the wet soil . " I 've heard tell , " Rogers continued , " that Rogers ' Rangers are as well known in France and England as they are in America . I ca n't say as to that ; but I know this : if there ever was a body of men that could march better or shoot better or fight better than Rangers , nobody 's ever known about ' em . " He cleared his throat . The men around him were dark and quiet , like shadows , and seemingly as devoid of opinions . " They think they 've got us , " Rogers said . " They think we 're as good as dead . Well , they have n't got me , by God ! They have n't got you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe they ever will  --  not if we use our knowledge and fight the way we have in the past . " From the shadowy circle rose a babel of cries . I found myself repeating , over and over , " No , no ! No , no ! " I felt as though I had been one of these men all my life : as though the Indians had torn Crofton 's ribs from his still-living body before my own eyes : as though I myself had seen Phillips hanged to a tree by a strip of his own flesh . Like all the green-clad men around me , I was confidentthat all the Frenchmen in the world could n't harm us while Rogers led us . I sat half the night with Rogers and Ogden in a sort of cave made of fallen logs . In it we had a fire , screened above and on three sides with blankets . Captains , lieutenants and sergeants crawled in on hands and knees to report the health of their detachments . None of the officers was sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PASSAGE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 143duty . While I copied their reports in the orderly book , Rogers worked on a birch-bark map and conferred with Ogden over the location of rivers and valleys . Between the two of them they seemed to know every brook and hill south of Canada ; but it was midnight before the map was finished to their satisfaction . " Here , " Rogers said to me , " copy this map in the book . It 's important . " To Ogden he said , " Well , there 's got to be an officer work his way back with those half-dozen sick men . " He pulled at his heavy lower lip . " I ca n't spare any of ' em . I ca n't even spare any of the sergeants . " " McMullen 's been limping , " Ogden said . " I know he has , " Rogers said , " but I ca n't send McMullen . I had trouble with him last spring when Captain Burbank was captured . McMullen thought he ought to be made captain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took over the company myself . McMullen was wild . He complained to Amherst , and tried to quit the Rangers . If I send him back , he 'll be sure I 'm doing it to get even with him . " Ogden said nothing . Rogers rubbed his huge hands together and breathed heavily . " All right , " he told Ogden , " get McMullen in here . " Ogden thrust his head from the opening of our smoky den and told the sentry to call Lieutenant McMullen , and the night was so still we could hear McMullen groan when his sergeant waked him . He crawled in to us soon after , his eyes puffed half-shut with sleep and mosquito bites . Rogers grinned at him . " What 's the matter with your leg ? " " Leg ? " McMullen asked . " What leg ? " " You know what leg . " McMullen shook his head . " Major , there is n't anything wrong with my leg , any more'n there is with the folks ' tails that still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rogers said , " there 's six sick men out of this detachment , and somebody 's got to lead ' em home and carry a message to Amherst at the same time . You 're the one I 've picked . " They stared at each other . Twice McMullen opened his lips to speak , and twice closed them again . A vein stood out in his forehead , and his puffed face seemed about to sizzle and explode . " Now , Lieutenant , " Rogers said , " I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking I 'm doing this out of cussedness , the way I kept you from getting command of your company . " " Yes , " McMullen said , " I am thinking that . " " Look here , " Rogers said , " I kept you from being captain of Burbank 's company because you have n't had enough experience , and you 're too impulsive besides . You 're better as a lieutenant , right now , than as a captain ; and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This message to Amherst has got to go through . If it does n't get through , there 'll be a lot of us , probably , that 'll never be seen again . If you get through safely with it , I 'll mention you in despatches , and it 'll mean twice as much to you as just being one of twenty officers on this expedition . " " I 'd rather be one of the twenty , " McMullen said . " If you want to be sure the message goes through , why do n't you send somebody who has n't hurt his knee ? " " There 's nothing the matter with your knee , " Rogers said . " You just told me so yourself . " McMullen , fumbling at his swollen neck , stared helplessly at Ogden : at me . " Well , " he said , " well  --  where 's the message ? " Rogers unrolled the piece of birch-bark and held it before McMullen . " Now look here . You can remember this map as being a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown Point , runs up Lake Champlain and ends at St. Francis , nearly on the St. Lawrence . The eastern leg runs from St. Francis down past Lake Memphremagog to the Connecticut River and rests on Number Four . " He tapped the map with a thick forefinger . " Take a good look at this eastern leg  --  the one from St. Francis to NumberFour . See those two big curves in the Upper Connecticut River ? Those are the Cohase Intervales . I built a fort in the Cohase Intervales for Benning Wentworth four years ago , so I know ' em pretty well ; but I do n't believe anybody else knows anything about ' em . If we can reach those Intervales , we ought to be all right. ' 144 NORTHWEST PASSAGEI doubt anybody 'd run the risk of following us farther than that . Is that clear ? " McMullen , running his finger along the eastern leg of that insertedV , nodded . Again Rogers tapped the map . " Look : at the lower end of the Cohase Intervales , the Ammonoosuc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . It was at the mouth of the Ammonoosuc that I built the fort . That 's sixty miles above Number Four . It 's easy to find . Lieutenant Stephens was stationed at Number Four last winter . He can tell Amherst just where I want the provisions left . " " I can tell him myself , " McMullen said . " All right , " Rogers said . " Start for Crown Point first thing in the morning . No matter what happens , get there . Get there as fast as you can , but do n't take chances . The French and Indians that found our whaleboats will keep on following the main body of us , of course , so you make a circuit to the eastward and get around ' em  --  a fifty-mile detour if you have to . If you 're discovered , abandon your sick men and let ' em look out for themselves . You 've got to get through ! You 've got to ! " McMullen noddecl . " Do n't tell any of those six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're sure you 're done for , and the others have a chance to get away , tell the likeliest one . Otherwise keep it to yourself . No matter what happens to you , no matter what they do to you , do n't let any Frenchman get these plans out of you . " McMullen eyed him bleakly and again nodded . " When you reach Crown Point , " Rogers continued , " go straight to General Amherst . Tell him we lost the boats . Tell him I did n't give you a written message for fear you 'd be captured . Tell him that when we leave St. Francis , we 'll go by way of Memphremagog and the Connecticut . Tell him I want provisions sent to my old fort at the . mouth of the Ammonoosuc and left there under guard  --  provisions for a hundred and fifty men  --  a hundred and fifty hungry men . Just repeat those orders , Lieutenant . " In a wooden voice McMullen said , " Provisions for a hundredNORTHWEST PASSAGE 145and fifty men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wells River , at the end of the Cohase Intervales . You 're coming back by way of the other leg of the triangle whose base rests on Number Four . " Rogers grinned . " That 's right . That 's how we 'll come back  --  if we come back . " CHAPTER XXIVTWO HUNDRED FRENCHMEN and nearly fifty Indians were hard on our heels , Jacobs had said ; and when McMullen and the six sick men had drifted off to the eastward in the misty dawn of September 26th , there were a hundred and fifty-three of us left to outdistance those two hundred and fifty Frenchmen and Indians , do what had to be done at St. Francis ; then get away  --  if we could . No sooner had we left the northern end of Missisquoi Bay that morning than we entered a spruce bog . The water was a foot deep , and in places even deeper , where the current had hollowed out channels like running brooks , into which we sometimes stumbled and sometimes fell full length . When Indians went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might make greater speed , they returned with the word that there was no dry land : that it was all bog . Although they climbed trees to look for solid footing , they saw none , came down and reported the whole land to be a vast wet sponge . Water stood everywhere between the trees , concealing irregularitiesin the ground . Young growth , choked to death by its own profusion , lay ankle deep , knee high , belt high , breast high , head high . Blown-down trunks rotted in the water with small spruces sprouting densely along their length . Dead branches were heaped in windrows ; and one who stepped upon them plunged through the tangle , raking his leg from ankle to thigh on jagged points . Living branches clutched the garments , scratched at the eyes , plucked the caps from our heads , tore holes in our clothes , and gored us through the holes . Through this terrible country we marched in triple file , and the , men on either side of me seemed crackling and splashing shadows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huskily calling the course to Konkapot , who moved between him and the Stockbridge Indians to relay messages. 146NORTHWEST PASSAGE 147It was part of my duty to write down these changes of directionsin the little book . " There 's never been a map of this country , " Rogers had told me , " and we 'll make one now . If we get out of this , we 'll probably have to do it all over again some day ! " There was little imagination to his description of our travels , but he worked hard to make it accurate . It read simply enough  --  " September 26th . North-north-east a mile and a half , northeast one mile , crossed two small brooks running southwest , went a northeast course half a mile , north a mile , northwest half a mile , crossed a brook running west by north , travelled north a mile , north-north-east half a mile , went three miles due north , and came to a brook about two yards wide , runningdue west , crossed it , and encamped about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To attain this simple record , he kept his compass perpetually in his hand : he counted the number of steps he took , and had others do the same : he went back and forth along the detachment , stopped and watched them pass him , sweating and cursing , wrestling their way through the dead growth , crashing through windfalls of branches . He climbed trees : went circling off by himself : came splashing back to shout to Captain Jacobs to slant off to the north-north-east . All day we saw no really dry land , and we ate standing in water . Sundown found us still laboring through the swamp . I felt parboiled , burned out , and at the same time sopping wet , soaked and chilled . It seemed to me that every muscle of mine had been beaten with hammers , and I knew from the look of Bradley and Crofton and the other men near me that they felt no better than I did . Their faces were liver-colored with fatigue : their eyes sunk in their heads : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Their lips were slack ; their mouths half open . Jesse Beacham , who was sixty years old if he was a day , seemed to stand it better than any of us , barring Rogers himself . When we were finally halted , it was almost dark and we had made nine miles . The water was halfway to our knees , so that the only way we could be free of it was to cut trees and climb into148 NORTHWEST PASSAGEthe branches . Working in pairs , we chopped young spruces with our hatchets , and by placing three close together and lopping the limbs from their upper sides , we made something like platforms , held above the water by the limbs underneath ; and the tips of boughs , properly placed on these platforms , made passable sleepingplaces . Jesse Beacham , working with me , seemed able to see in the dark , and he could make a bed of spruce boughs more rapidly than an inn-keeper could make one from two blankets and a feathermattress . As soon as we could , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown swamp-water , although the branches , beneath our wet buckskins , felt like the ridges of washboards . We put our knapsacks beneath our heads , placed our muskets between us where we could get at them quickly , and ate our supper of sausage , corn meal and rum . " Jesse , " I said , " do n't you get sick of sausage and corn meal ? " " No , " Jesse said . " No . If there ai nt nothing to eat but sausage and corn meal , you like it . If you had to choose between sausage and corn meal and sausage and beans , you 'd hate both of ' em . " That helped me to eat , and I began to realize that old Jesse was more of a comfort than a younger man could have been . We chewed our - ausages and listened to curious noises  --  the sound of articles falling in the water : breaking trees : the blunderingsplashes made by men whose platforms were insecure : the snuffling and coughing of those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locating his officers  --  calling Jacobs , Dunbar , Turner , Avery , Grant , Farrington ; fixing their positions in his mind . 1 heard him ordering out sentries , rear , front and both flanks , and thanked God I could lie on knobby branches , uncomfortable as they were , and wrap myself in a blanket , sopping wet though it was . " Jesse , " I said , " I wish I had his energy , do n't you ? " " Hell , no , " Jesse said . " I 'd ruther be like meCHAPTER XXVWE ENTERED THE BOG on the 26th of September , and were in it nine days . On the 27th Rogers routed us from our spruce hammocks with the first graying of the sky , and in ten minutes we were wallowingforward  --  north , north-north-east , north-east by east , north by east , and then north again -- sweating , straining , stumbling through a boggy tangle of spruce in no way different from that of the day before . On the 28th , on the 3oth , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4th of October , it was all the same  --  the same water , the same trees , the same tangled hoorahs ' nests of dried branches , the same snags under water , the same knobby platforms at night , the same incessant hurry to keep ahead of the Frenchmen and Indians in our rear . Only the men changed . Jacobs and his Indians looked little different , since they were thin to begin with , and naturally malignant in their appearance , in addition to being free of the curse of whiskers ; but the others grew more and more hairy every day and , for the most part , more evil looking . A few were improved by their changed appearance . Sergeant Bradley , that pale and soured man , sprouted red whiskers that gave him an air of raffish gaiety . Jesse Beacham 's beard was white as snow , and as it lengthened , the younger Rangers took notice of it , calling him Grandad , old Kriss Kringle , the Snow King , or the Spirit of Niagara . To all such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might look , peering through the interstices of a fleecy cloud . Our buckskins , too , from the constant whipping of the spruce branches and the everlasting wetness , gave way here and there , developing rips which we had no chance to mend . Worst of all , our moccasins became pulpy , so that we either had to take them off and tie them around our necks , or have no149150 NORTHWEST PASSAGEfootgear left by the time we reached dry land  --  if that time ever came . I asked Jesse Beacham whether , in his opinion , it was better to go barefoot , or to trust to luck that we might soon be out of the bog . " I do n't know , " Jesse said . " I got to give it some thought ; but I guess I better take off my moccasins while I do my thinking , so 's I 'll have ' em when I decide what to do about ' em . " I followed Jesse 's example and went barefoot . The chill of the water seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stumbling or stepping on sharp branches was only painful at first . It was when the moccasins began to wear out that now and then we became aware that one and another of us had simply disappeared . We had started from Missisquoi Bay with one hundred and fifty-three . On the 29th of September a man was missing from Lieutenant Grant 's detachment . On the 3oth another vanished from Lieutenant Dunbar 's . When the first man 's absence was reported to Rogers , he sent Jacobs and Konkapot back along our trail to search . They could n't find him , and we never knew whether he had fallen so far behind that the French had caught him , or whether he had stumbled into a hole and drowned . Rogers seemed to think the first explanation was the right one . He went back among the men and told them to move faster . " If some of those Frenchmen get ahead of us , so we 're caught front and rear , " he said , " you would n't like it ! You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving ! " So we did . We splashed doggedly onward , and as for me , I was going as fast as I could all the tune . On the 2nd of October two more men disappeared  --  one from Lieutenant Farrington 's detachment and one from ours . The one from our own was Webster , the lugubrious corporal who had learned of his wife 's death the day before our expedition started . I had come to like Webster . He never grumbled , and twice he had carried my musket while I made notes for Rogers . It was toward sundown when I missed him from his regular place in the line . I looked back , thinking he might have changed his position . NORTHWEST PASSAGE 151When I could n't find him , I shouted his name , but heard nothing except the splashing of the nearby men . " When 'd you see him last ? " Jesse Beacham asked me . I could n't remember . " I 'd better go back and look for him , " I told Jesse . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'd keep travelling . " " My God , Jesse , " I said , " we ca n't leave Webster like this , feelingthe way he does about his wife . " " Maybe , " Jesse said , " it 'll be kind of a relief to him to be left alone . " Rogers heard us arguing and came back to walk with us . " Who 's gone ? " he wanted to know . When we told him , he said it was too bad . " Maybe , " he added , " he was discouraged . They go quick when they 're discouraged . " He looked hard at me . " There 's no use hunting for Webster . If you found him , you could n't carry him . It would only mean the French would get both of you . " Then , seeing that I was silent , he said abruptly , " Webster knew what would happen if he could n't keep up . He understands you 'd like to help him  --  that we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " With that he splashed ahead to overtake Ogden , and I tried to keep my mind off Webster . I thought probably he 'd made himselfone of those soggy spruce platforms and lain down upon it . Maybe the French and the Indians would n't find him ... - On the 4th of October , early in the afternoon , we crossed a mound on which white Indian Pipes grew from a smooth bed of pine needles  --  the first dry patch we had seen since the 26th of September . It was n't much of a mound , being about a hundred yards long and thirty yards wide ; but it put heart into us . We had come to think there was no dry land left in the world . When some of the men stopped upon it , staring as if in sur-152 NORTHWEST PASSAGEprise at their pallid , parboiled feet , Rogers drove them on , into the bog beyond . " Keep going ! " he urged . " Get off this mound and do n't leave traces ! We 're damned near there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep going ! " We stumbled on into the bog ; it seemed to me the water was shallower , and by mid-afternoon I was sure of it . I sank in only to my ankle-bones . Again and again we crossed patches of dry land  --  patches the size of a kitchen table : of a whaleboat : of a barn door . In place of the muck and tangled roots through which we had wallowed for nine long days , we began to feel firm ground beneathour feet ; and then , toward sundown , there was solid earth everywhere , except for puddles in scattered hollows . We were out - ) f the bog at last . Like new men we hurried on over dry ground until stopped by thick darkness . To sleep on dry land once more , without the labor of chopping a platform of boughs , seemed a heaven-sent luxury , even though my clothes and blankets were as wet as ever , the camp as devoid of fire , and my supper only a handful of corn meal . We were close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He climbed a tree and made Lieutenant Turner and Jacobs do the same . Then , when he was down , he made a circuit of the camp , warning every sentry as he came to him . " Use your eyes and your nose ! " I heard him say . " If they catch us , it 'll be tonight . Keep watching and keep sniffing ! " God knows when he slept  --  if he did . Again and again I heard his voice , dimly , in my sleep . When Sergeant Bradley rolled me from my blanket in the morning , it was still dark , and the first thing I heard was Rogers , warning Captain Jacobs not to let the Indians get out of hand if we stumbled unexpectedly on St. Francis . " You tell ' cm to spend their time killing , " he said . " No torture ! Kill fast ! " We were on the march with the first faint light of dawn . The ground continued to rise and to harden , and our breeches andNORTHWEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dry . The worst of our journey , I felt , must be behind us , since nothing could be worse than that endless spruce bog . War , however , is one of the things that never improves with age . We had no more than started when Konkapot and Solomon came running back to Rogers . " River ! " Solomon said exultantly . " Big river ! " " That 's it , by God ! " Rogers cried . " It 's the St. Francis ! " CHAPTER XXVIWHEN WE HAD DRAWN the charges from our muskets and reloaded , we lay concealed in the brush on the river bank , looking for enemy Indians and for the town we had come so far to attack . We saw only a brown flood that I took to be thirty to forty yards wide . It surged between gravelly banks so high that in places they were cliffs . So turbulent and swollen was the stream that all the water in the bogs we had just crossed might have been trying to force its way to freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in midstream the sharpness of its riffles gave it the look , I thought , of brown ice . " Let 's see that book , " Rogers said to me . He took it and pored over the records of our journey , his thick lips moving as he read , , He got out Stark 's rough map and scrutinized it . Finally he went up a tree . When he came down , his mind was made up . " I ca n't , see any low land to the north of us , " he said . " The town 's only two miles from the flats of Lake St. Peter , so we 're nowhere near it . We ought to be as much as fifteen miles upstream , so we 'll cross right here . Then we 'll be on the same side as the town . " " How many rafts shall we make ? " Ogden asked . " Rafts be damned ! " Rogers cried . " There 's no time for rafts ! Tell ' em to plug their muskets ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders ! We 'll wade it ! "  --  The banks of the St. Francis were covered with hardwood growth  --  maples , beech and oak . Their leaves , bitten by recent frosts , had turned fiery scarlet , smoldering red , blazing yellow ; and my companions , against this flaming foliage , put me in mind of demons crawling blunderingly out of hell . We had stripped off our legginsand tied them to our packs ; and our packs , in turn , were154NORTHWEST PASSAGE 155lashed high on our shoulders , so that our heads protruded turtlelikefrom bulging humps . These misshapen upper bodies were supported by lean legs , bleached pallid by days of soaking in the bog . We must have made a strange and ludicrous spectacle , crowded close together to watch Rogers , who knelt half-naked at the water 's edge and thrust with a long spruce pole to test the depth . Behind us , sprawled at the top of the bank , lay the Stockbridge Indians , peering back into the forest on the lookout for the French . Before us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogden , at a word from Rogers , stepped off the bank and into the stream . His arms waved frantically ; his legs flew from under him , and his body plunged beneath the surface in a welter of yellow foam . Rogers caught him , swung him back to shore , and the half-drowned officer crawled out on hands and knees , coughing and choking . Then using the pole as a prop , Rogers himself stepped in . The current boiled around his knees : the pole vibrated . He looked back at us and grinned , and it seemed to me that instead of our commander , I saw , in this exultant grin , the look of a reckless boy who laughs at his fellows because he outdoes them . I could make out that he was bawling something to Ogden , but I could hear nothing above the roar of the river . A tall Ranger put down his musket on the bank , edged into the stream and caught Rogers by the belt . Another Ranger followed , seizing the belt of the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of Rangers moved into the rushing water with painful slowness . The water rose around their waists ; caught at their clumsy packs . They leaned against the roaring current , a human chain , slowly fighting their way across . In midstream , the riffles splashed over Rogers ' head . He stared owlishly back at us , gasping , his eyes pouchy , his long hair dangling like seaweed in his eyes and along his thick nose . Inch by inch he passed through the riffles . The water was shallower . He moved more rapidly , pulling his line of Rangers after156 NORTHWEST PASSAGE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 157him . He was waist deep : then thigh deep . Like a draggled mermanhe reached the bank and hooked his arm around a tree . Between him and us stretched a causeway of Rangers , the brown water of the St. Francis piling against them and boiling downstreamin yellowish foam . One by one we made our way along this causeway , fumbling from human link to human link like mountain climbers on a cliff , moving from one precarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musket , since those who formed the chain had carried none ; and where to carry those two muskets seemed to me the greatest problem that life could hold . I buttonedthem inside my shirt and strapped my belt around them , so that their muzzles stood three feet above my head . At each step their locks tore at my stomach . The stones at the bottom of the river-bed moved beneath my feet ; the icy current dragged at thighs and hips . There was a singulardizzying fascination to the swirling torrent that wrenched at me with a continuous sucking roar . When halfway across I heard a chorus of yells . The French , I thought , had caught us ; but the Ranger to whom I clung urged me onward . " It 's Foyle , " he said . " Lost his footing . Dropped his muskets . " It was Rogers himself who pulled me to the bank . " Get the men out of the river , " he was calling to his officers . " Get ' em out dead or alive ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're done for ! " I ran down stream , and found Ogden running with me . We could see someone rolling like a log in the sharp waves . We got him by cutting across a bend . It was Foyle . His arms were tangled in the straps of his knapsack , and he was dead ; but we put him on the bank , head downward , in the vague hope that the water might drain from him and let him come to life . There was nothing else we could do . When we returned , the human chain still held , and the StockbridgeIndians , who were like dogs in the water , were diving and groping for lost muskets . Another Ranger besides Foyle had been drowned ; and six more , wrenched from the living chain at the beginning of the crossing , had been spewed out on the far bank by the boiling current . Two lay at the edge of the stream , unable to crawl from the shallows . Four had dragged themselves to higher land and sprawled there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them to cross , they sat motionless , too exhausted to move . " One of ' em 's mine , " Lieutenant Avery said . " He 's got the flux . I 'll go over and get him . " Rogers shook his head . " You 'll stay where you are ! You 'd get drowned yourself if you tried to carry him over . We 'll have to leave those men . They 're better off back there than they 'd be over here , and that chain of men ca n't stand where they are , waiting for sick men to get better ! " He gave sharp orders to the nearest man of the living chain . " Tell those sick men to move . o : he eastward and try to keep out of the way of the ' nch who 'll follow us . Pass the word , and tell the . st an to let go when he 's delivered the message . " ! ' hose who had crossed , officers and men alike , stood silent , staring over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to feel disapproval . " Too bad , " he said . " Too bad , but if they can get far enough to the eastward , they 've got a chance . We 've got to keep moving , gentlemen . " Captain Jacobs crawled out on the bank , dragging three muskets with him . Several , he said , were still at the bottom of the river , and he thought if he had time , he could get them . " Time ! " Rogers echoed . " We 're moving on ! " One by one the human links of the chain emerged shivering from the rapids and came stiffly among us , seeking their muskets . Rogers herded us rapidly from the water 's edge . " Get away from this river bank , " he ordered . " Get onto high land and get dressed . Draw your loads and reload with buckshot ! " Ogden asked whether men should be sent to bury Foyle . Rogers shook his head . " We 've got fifteen miles to go ! Maybe it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their returns ; there were one hundred and forty-two of us left . Five were without muskets. 158 NORTHWEST PASSAGERogers hitched up his leggins and settled his black infantryman 's hat more firmly on his head . " Why , " he said , " that 's not bad ! Things might be worse  --  lots worse ! I could take Quebec with a hundred and forty-two men as good as this ! We 'll keep the same order . Stockbridge Indians in advance : Lieutenant Turner 's detachmentin the rear . " After what we had been through , the Indian trail along the high bank of the river was as easy to travel as a post-road . The trees were enormous : the undergrowth long since killed down . Beneath our feet was packed earth and brown pine needles , springy to the touch . If I could have had a decent dinner in me , in place of the few scrapings of corn meal that my pouch had yielded , and if there had been no Frenchmen following on our heels , I think I might really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long line of men in ragged buckskins and green Scotch caps slipped through the darkening forest as noiselessly as owls on the hunt . It was nearly night when Rogers , finding a tall pine from which to make an observation , gave the order to halt . He was on his way up the tree before the file-closers had come in . We stared up the tree after him . The detachment gathered around it , their upturned faces blobs of pallor in the dusk . He came sliding and scratching down and dropped among us like a big cat . He straightened his clothes and dug pine needles from his neck . " Well , " he said , " we 're there ! I can see the fires , not three miles away . It 's the town ! " It was the fifth day of October  --  the twenty-second day of our journey from Crown Point . We had been twenty-two days without fires ; without cooked food ; without dry blankets ; without shelters over our heads ; without clean clothes . And this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized as being almost over . CHAPTER XXVIIROGERS , it seemed to me , could go beyond the limits of human endurance ; and then , without rest , buoyantly hurl himself against the fiercest opposition of Nature or man , or both . There was something elemental about him  --  something that made it possible for men who were dead with fatigue to gain renewed energy from him , just as a drooping wheat-field is stirred to life by the wall of wind that runs before a thunder-storm . We 'd no sooner made camp that night than he called for LieutenantTurner and Ensign Avery ; and the three of them moved silently off into the darkness , Rogers leading at a gait so sharp it was a sort of inaudible run . He left one order behind him . " Make ' em sleep , " he told Ogden . " They 're going to need it ! " Sleep , for me , I thought , was out of the question , for I was in a turmoil over the thought that in a few hours we would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I suspected that I was already as good as dead . I saw with dreadful clarity what a fool I had been about everything , and wished to God I had stayed at home , content with an orderly existence . Of what use to me was my foolish , youthful desire to paint , and how would my knack for drawing and for color benefit me when I lay scalped and mangled in a Canadian forest ? If I had stayed at home , where I could see Elizabeth 's eyes darting amused and sidelong glances at me : where I could have sat comfortably in our warm kitchen on a frosty morning and watched my mother pouring flapjack batter .. .  --  Sergeant Bradley shook me to consciousness . " Come on , " . he was saying . " Come on ! The Major 's back . Everything 's all right ! Come on : we 're going to attack ! " The moon , almost full , touched the tall trees with silver **26;5078;TOOLONG to keep out Japanese goods there would be money again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now he knew was the moment to buy . He had planned his schedule closely . A week in Ranchipur , which would at least be cooler than Bombay , twenty-four hours in Bombay , with everything planned by telegram beforehand so that there would be no delay , and then the Lloyd-Triestino boat to Genoa and ten days or two weeks on the Mediterranean on the yacht , if he did not have to go direct to London because of the trouble the bloody Bolsheviks were making over oil . He did not travel by the line in which he owned a great interest because the boats were slower than the Italian boats and Lord Esketh had a mania for speed . The damned " dagoes " had been cutting into his business lately ! The Government , he said to himself , owed it to him to blackmail the Italians , by controlling port privileges , into running their boats on a slower schedule . The Government , he thought , had no guts any more since these labor party bastards had had a hand in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject peoples . There were moments when the great Lord Esketh regretted not having been born fifty years earlier when the Empire was an empire . It would have made his career in many ways much easier . During one of his eternal moments of " juggling figures " he estimated that during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries British capital had taken out of India five hundred thousand pounds for every pound invested . Colossal ! Why , a man of his ability would have corneredthe world in a time like that ! It was his strange passion for horses which led him to Ranchipur . In Simla , talking after dinner with a couple of cavalry officers , he learned about a breed of which he had heard but never seen  --  the tough little Kathiawar horses , bred in the dry wild peninsula on the edge of the Indian Ocean . They were , he heard , rather like Arabs but more heavily built and tougher . They not only had speed but they were weight carriers ( which he always had to consider ) . They had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts . Esketh , having heard of them , had to have them , and he had to have no ordinarystock but the best . The best , the cavalry officers said , were to be found in the fabulous stables of the Maharajah of Ranchipur . So the Viceroy arranged it . He would go to Ranchipur and be received by theMaharajah ; he would be housed , not in the guesthouse , but in one of the smaller palaces , as befitted a great lord of the West . And at the same time he could see , persuade and perhaps bribe the shrewd old Dewan of Ranchipur to help in the deal for the Bombay Mills . The old Dewan was a power in Indian politics . Thus he might kill two birds with one stone , and he was a great one for doing that . The Viceroy was certain that his friend the Maharajah would sell him a stallion and a half-dozen mares to ship back to England . That was the only bright spot before him , because even the prospect of putting over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed money did not excite him much . If he had been a man given to examininghimself he would have known that this was the first sign of failing strength . Suddenly he felt hot again and rang the bell at the side of his bed . No one came and he rang again angrily , and then a third time in fury , and then the door opened and Bates , his man , came in , looking sleepyeyedand pale with the heat . Lord Esketh raised himself ponderously on one elbow and shouted , " God-damn it ! What have you been doing ? I 've been ringing for ten minutes . " The valet was a lean cold man but detached and extremely efficient , the kind of person Esketh liked to have around him . Bates never asked favors and never gave any outward sign of affection or devotion . He did not tremble now . He simply said , " Sorry , sir . I must have fallen asleep . " This appeared to enrage His Lordship further . " I do n't see why in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that black bastard to bring in some ice . There 's nothing left of what 's here . " " Very good , sir , " and Bates retired , still outwardly unmoved . Nor was he much moved inwardly . He had put up with this sort of thing for twelve years and it did not disturb him very profoundly . The one emotion he felt toward His Lordship was that of a cold dispassionate hatred which never varied . But it was a good post with excellent wages , a great deal of prestige , quite a lot of time off and all sorts of perquisites most of which Lord Esketh knew nothing about . When he felt that he had enough in the bank he would simply quit , like that , one night . The401 41Itime , he knew , was not far off , and then to hell with His Lordship . He would retire then to a semi-detached villa in his native town of Manchester , join the Communist Party for good and put at its disposal all the knowledge he had of the chicanery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The odd thing was that Bates had succeeded where far more clever and successful and brilliant men than he had failed . By his very indifferencehe had managed to keep a rich post for twelve years , and during that time he had seen partners , secretaries and clerks , chauffeurs and butlers , come and go , sometimes dismissed , sometimes driven away because life had been made unendurable for them , but always broken and humiliated . There were two people , Bates knew , whom His Lordship had never succeeded in breaking or even in humiliating . One was himself and the other was Lady Esketh . That was why they were both still with him . If the day ever came when either of them showed signs of weakening , they too would go the way of all the others . In the next compartment Lady Esketh heard her husband 's shouts . The sound of his voice , rising even above the monotonous beat of the wheels over the uneven track , roused her out of the stupor into which she had fallen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll be coming in here to annoy me , " but almost at once she knew that it really did not matter . She had grown used to all that long ago . One more time could not matter . She would think of something else , pretend that it was not Albert but another man , almost any man , a train guard or even a coolie . That at least would be exciting . Anyway she could not be more miserablethan she already was . Languidly she sat up , holding her pink crepe-de-Chine pillow over the edge of the bed , to shake from it the coating of yellow dust . That hellish dust was in her mouth , in her hair . She switched on the light and looked at herself in the mirror . Her face was yellow with dust and on the temples the perspiration had mixed with it and turned it to mud , which ran in a little stream down the famous complexion which had cost a fortune in beauty specialists . She gave a little cry of horror and then lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the misery was only begun . At four in the morning they would have42to rise and dress and wait on a platform to change to the narrow-gauge train for Ranchipur . So far as she could see Indian trains never left or arrived at any hour save between midnight and dawn . For weeks now , it seemed to her , she had been sitting up to take a train which left at two in the morning or rising to change from one to another at four . The private car was all very well on the main line but it was of no use on the narrow gauge railways . She took more sleeping medicine , thinking , " Then I wo n't notice it so much , " and she had nearly fallen into a stupor again when the door opened and Lord Esketh came in . In the morning when John the Baptist brought Ransome his tea the storm was over and the sun was shining once more as if there had been no rain and the drought had never been broken . That , Ransome knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began thus , coquettishly , it sometimes meant that the rains would be violent but spasmodic and insufficient , no more than enough to startle the whole earth into a forwardrush of green , leaving it tender and fresh , to be cooked almost at once by the vicious , hateful sun . Its rays brought anxiety to every eye which opened that morning in Ranchipur , but Ransome 's ill ease had in it the special quality of one who had spent most of his life between wet green England and the fertile rolling green country of Middle Western America . His body , his whole soul , ached for the rain , not because it meant food but because it ended the terrible drought . For him the spectacle of a burnt dusty land had always the quality of unreality . When he had had his tea and a shower of tepid water he went out on to the verandah to have his fruit and his first drink of the day . The garden had been transformed by the rain . In the few hours of the night fresh shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the ancient walls , and underneath them the earth , instead of being burnt and dusty , was a rich dark color ; but he knew that by evening it would be yellow again , baked hard by the sun . Nevertheless , when he had finished his drink he went down and , taking a hoe from the summer house , set to work to break up the soil . That , at least , would help it to hold the moisture for a few hours longer in case there was no more rain. 43At the far end of the garden near the well he set to work with his hoe , but he had only worked for a little time when he heard his pie dog barking and found that the end of the garden near the house had been invaded by an army of monkeys . He called off the dog , retired into the shade of the trees and watched . He knew the whole troupe , for they lived in the trees in the palace gardens on the opposite side of the river . Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stray bits of food put out for them in the evening by the servants of the palace . But sometimes they went wandering , not in search of food but bent upon mischief , adventureand destruction . Usually Ransome made relentless war on them and left orders with John the Baptist to drive them out if they arrived while he was absent , and John , being a converted Christian , had no scruples about putting the sacred monkeys to rout . Once or twice when there had been no one in the house save the Hindu servants they had arrived without warning and , as if aware of Ransome 's enmity , had stripped the garden of every flower . Systematically they would go from plant to plant and vine to vine , tearing off every bright-colored object which caught their attention . They did not eat the blossoms but only threw them in the dust , looking over their shoulder from time to time to make certain that vengeance was not at hand . They were , thought Ransome , exactly like an invading army of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded him of whole villageshe had seen in the war , each house with windows and doors broken open and half the contents scattered in the mud of the road outside . Now they impudently took no notice of his presence . They climbed over the verandah and swarmed up the waterspout . There must have been thirty or forty of them , all female save for the big monkey who sat solemnly on top of the high wall watching for danger . And there were a dozen baby monkeys of all sizes from half-grown ones to babies just born and still clinging to their mothers ' necks . One , perhaps five or six days old , was being taught to walk . Its mother sat on her haunches while another female monkey , perhaps an aunt , squatted a couple of yards away holding out her arms . Then the mother shook the baby from herself and gave him a push . He returned to her at once , and a44second time she pushed him from her . He returned to her again and this time , irritated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed somehow to totter a few steps . Again she slapped him and again he managed a few tottering steps until now he was nearer the aunt than the mother . Halting , the baby turned from one to the other with a comical , terrified expression on his tiny face and then , in perhaps his first moment of decision , he perceived that the aunt was the nearer of the two and tottereduncertainly toward her . Here on her breast he was permitted a moment 's rest , and then she too , with firmness , set him on his feet and gave him a push . When he returned for reassurance she too slapped him , and he was forced toward his mother , until presently she was comforting him with caresses and a fine flow of monkey chatter . From the shade Ransome watched the lesson in silence , his whole face warmed by an unconscious grin , but after the third adventure he became aware of a hubbub on the verandah above the baby and turned to find a raid in progress . His breakfast table was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mangoes , the bananas . One of them , holding his teacup , turned it from side to side speculatively as if trying to make out its use . A third , a mother with a baby clinging to her , sat in the window investigating the stuff of the curtains . The spectacle made him laugh but at the same time he felt that the moment for decision had come and he drew from his pocket a catapult made from a fork of mango tree and strips cut from an old tire . Cautiouslyhe picked up a round pebble and fitted it into the pocket of the sling and took careful aim . It was the only way to keep sacred monkeys in check . Driving them off did no good , for they only came back when your back was turned and began tearing the tiles from the roof to hurl them at you . He knew that by now he had succeeded in establishing in their clever brains the fact of a hidden special menace that lingered inside the enclosure of his garden  --  a sudden burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriously out of the air itself . At last he let fly the pebble . It struck the rump of one of the females clusteredon the table . She gave a wild scream and fell on her nearest neighbor , scratching and screaming and biting like a fury . And then pandemonium broke loose . The food was scattered over the verandah , the teacup fell withX45a crash . Suddenly there was a stream of monkeys flying up the jasmine vine to the top of the wall and then by the lower branches into the mango tree . The last of them carried with her a bright cotton napkin which caught her fancy . Only the big male stood his ground on top of the wall , jabbering and swearing . Once more Ransome selected a pebble , but he was not quick enough . The old male was no fool , and before Ransome could hit him he was gone , still screeching , into the trees . The last he saw of them was in a wild procession along the tops of the mangoes , making their way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park . " I suppose , " he thought , " Jehovah must sometimes feel as I do now . " For a little while more he worked , but this morning his mind , instead of becoming absorbed and lost in the very earth , conjuring up new wondersof flowers and vegetables which would spring from every stroke of his hoe , wandered away into strange paths of speculation . He wondered why it was that America , a new , a young , a rich country should have fallen into the same decadence as Europe , why it was there were no longer any men great enough to lead the way , no leaders but only mediocrities and political opportunists and dictators who ruled by brutalityand hysteria . " Perhaps , " he thought , " the times , the age , economics , the very passionsof mankind have grown beyond the control of man in the West . Perhaps the tottering structure has become so great , so complex , so unmanageable that there could be no one man great enough to cope with it or even a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman world tottered and fell . Perhaps that was how some universal law operated , a law as exact , as immutable as the Mendelian theory . Perhaps man was allowed to build and build until at last , in his pride , he was crushed by the very thing he had built . " The thought brought to him a sudden humbling sense of his own insignificance and at the same time a feeling of contempt and pity for the arrogance of man himself  --  that he should be so presumptuous , that a few men should conquer and control disease and pestilence while a few others , like Esketh and his sort , could arrange a wholesale slaughter in which not germs or pestilence killed men by millions but men themselves . Nature , it seemed , was not to be gotten round . She simply found , 46through the agency of man himself , new means of killing him off , of bringing him once more to his knees , as she had done long ago with Egypt , with Rome , indeed with the very Indians living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificence to that of subject people , preyed upon by ignorance , defeatism , superstition and disease . It seemed to him that he had never seen his own world clearly until he had come to India . Now he saw it in all its parts . And presently he began to think again of Esketh , wondering why he should be coming to Ranchipur to disturb its peace with his boisterouspitiless brutal presence . Vaguely he remembered him in the days after the War when he had crossed his path in Whitehall , and he had no liking or admiration for the man , neither for his shrewdness nor his ill-spent energy , nor for his talk of empire . If Esketh were coming to Ranchipur it would mean no good to anyone there , least of all the old Maharajah who in his goodness and simplicity could only be a victim . The thought of Lady Esketh troubled him because the name was so familiar to him and yet so lost . For a long time now , for nearly fifteen years , he had been out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost to him , like most of the other once bright important names which no longer meant very much even when he saw them with faces attached in the " Sketch " and the " Tatler " and the " Bystander . " He knew that he was not the only man who was sick nor the only one who sought escape and peace . There were millions of others like him , in factories and offices , in schools and shops , who could not escape like himself because their grandfathers had not dug a vast fortune from the mountains of Nevada . As he hoed more and more vigorously , it struck him that it was only in the earth that men could find peace and hope in these times , for there was little peace to be found in the world which man had made , a world which in his own sickness , appeared to him dull and tired and apathetic , going from makeshift to makeshift and compromiseto compromise , and arriving in the end at the same old evils which had destroyed peoples and nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had found nothing save perhaps a druglike peace , and that was not what he had come searching for because he knew that in that very peace lay the seeds of death . He had run away , he thought , 47from the spectacle of his own world , faithless and without hope , slowly and wearily destroying itself . Hoeing and thinking he became excited so that he forgot the hour and even the boiling heat until John the Baptist appeared looking alarmed and comic in his breech clout , to ask whether after all he meant to lunch at home . It was one o'clock and the day was Saturday and he should have been , long before now , on his way to the Mission to lunch with the Smileys . Throwing down his hoe , he hurried into the house to bathe and change his clothes . Then he went to the potting shed to take out his motor , one of the seven motors in Ranchipur , not counting the Rolls-and-Packard-filled garage of the Maharajah . He rarely used it save during the monsoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , one to the vast artificial lake above the town that served as a reservoir and the other built three hundred years ago by the Moguls to the ruined city of El-Kautara at the foot of Mount Abana . He found the old Buick standing in the shed , naked and open to the burning sun , for the monkeys had been there before him , perhaps early in the morning before they paid him a visit in the back garden . They had entertained themselves by throwing all the tiles off the roof on to the ground . He grinned , thinking that in the end it was the monkeys who had won . The American Mission occupied two big barracklike houses a mile or two beyond the race course . In the beginning , long ago , just after the mutiny , they had served as buildings to house the officers of the British troops stationed in Ranchipur . Square ugly buildings , age had given them character and time had provided beauty in climbing vines and creepers  --  clematis and trumpet vines and bougainvillea . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little way from the dusty road . In one lived the Reverend Mr. Elmer Simon , with his wife and two daughters , Fern and Hazel . In the other dwelt Mr. Smiley with his wife and Mrs. Smiley 's great-aunt Phoebe . In the care and the appearance of the two gardens one could read the characters of the two families . Mr. Simon 's garden had no flowers at all save those hardy shrubs and vines which in India needed no care and were impossible to kill , either by drought , flood or blight . Alone , 481apart , it would have looked like a garden moderately well furnished and well tended , but beside the Smiley house it had a barren , rather shaggy look , for the Smiley garden was filled with flowers which even during the long drought seemed more vigorous than any flowers in all Ranchipur . There were salvias and petunias and geraniums and marigolds and zinnias , mostly sturdy old-fashioned flowers such as Aunt Phoebe had grown in her garden back in Iowa fifty years before . Begonias and pansies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suspended here and there from the lower limbs of the trees hung receptacles of one sort or another  --  tin cans painted green , cracked bowls held together with wire , bamboo baskets . These too were the work of Aunt Phoebe who from nostalgia had decorated the branches of the mango trees in Ranchipur exactly as she had done the branches of Iowa 's cottonwoods as a farmer 's wife , half a century earlier . The suspended receptacles held ferns and petunia plants and lilies , but Aunt Phoebe 's greatest pride were the orchids which grew in the bamboo receptacles . They were a tribute to her from the Untouchable boys of Mr. Smiley 's school . They brought them to her out of the jungle and in their workshop they made her the little bamboo baskets in which they grew . It was one of the reasons ( she wrote to the folks back in Iowa ) why she liked India . You could have orchids growing all the year round , right in the front yard . The effort which , with the Smileys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Simons , on a double tennis court and a large arbor covered with trumpet vines which stood at one end of it . This was the work of Mrs. Simon , a powerful , pretty and tenacious woman on the verge of middle age . To look at her you would never have suspected her power . She was forty-one , small and plump , with curly blond hair which had faded only a little . At the age of twenty she had met Mr. Simon at the Baptist college at Cordova , Indiana , and married him while still in the throes of adolescent experience , under the misapprehension that her feelings for Mr. Simon were spiritual and unassociated with the body . Later , because in spite of everything she was a shrewd woman , she recognized the difference but admitted it to none hut herself . By that time Fern and Hazel were born , and although she knew that she had made a bad bargain she knew too that she would have to make the best of it for the rest of her life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " was extremely trying for the Reverend Mr. Simon and her daughters , Fern and Hazel . The fault had been her upbringing and background , for she came from a Baptist family in a small Mississippi town and so her ideas of life in the great world had been somewhat false and warped from the very start . At twenty she was filled with zeal for the faith and regarded the prospect of life as a missionary with enthusiasm . It was only slowly , after she had left forever the backwoods Mississippi family and the hysterical atmosphere of the little sectarian university , that she began to see life in terms of the character with which nature had endowed her . She realized presently that in spite of all the calls she had had from God , she was not meant to be a missionary but for greater things . But it was too late and so she had to compromise . At heart she had been from the beginning an ambitious Southern belle with a will of iron concealed beneath a coy mid-Victorian facade . Without ever suspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many American women , undefeatable , because the world about her  --  her husband , her two daughters , Mr. and Mrs. Smiley and Aunt Phoebe , even the Maharajah and Maharani themselves-existed only in relation to her own ego . All her existence was concentrated into a struggle against the world in which she found herself , to raise it somehow , to alter it , to transmute it into something which it was not . She was the wife of a missionary , but neither those early vapors which had deceived her into throwing herself away upon Mr. Simon , nor the miserable state of the people among whom she found herself , nor even the words of Christ himself , made any difference to her . She was determined to be a person of importance and of distinction , a creature much more than the mere wife of a missionary ; and to accomplish this she found it necessary to dominate her husband and her daughters , to assume strange affectations , to spend all of the little income she had inherited from the hotel block back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband'smeager salary . There were moments when she succeeded , momentsof triumph when some acquaintance or new friend made during the summer months in Poona would say , " The last thing I would have thought you were was a missionary 's wife . " She disliked very nearly everyone  --  the Smileys most of all because50they were always there before her , just across the drive , a living reproach , a nasty irritant to her own conscience , remaining in Ranchipur all through the terrible months of the monsoon while she was enjoying the cool high air of Poona , working night and day , spending their money not on automobiles and tennis courts but on the people they had come to help . They were always there , recalling to her the disappointment of her own now distant dreams when for an instant she had known an intimation of the delights of self-sacrifice . In moments of wild exasperation she would sometimes say to her husband , " They do n't make all those sacrifices just because they 're good . They do it to spite you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reply , " No , my dear . You must n't exaggerate . They 're good hardworkingpeople , even if they are not quite up to date . " For Mr. Simon had the great gift of self-deceivers he managed to transmute his weakness and even his petty vices into virtues . He persuaded himself that with his automobile and tennis courts he was a " modern " missionary and that he was better able to do the work of the Lord if he did not wear himself out riding a bicycle and if he kept up his health by having regular exercise at tennis . He was the only person in the world before whom Mrs. Simon did not put on airs , and sometimes the spectacle of her nakedness was terrifying to him . The worldliness of his wife was the one thing he could not quite explain away , either to himself or to the Lord . He was really a harmless man , quite stupid and good-looking . ( There were moments in the night when Mrs. Simon found that a consolation , together with the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holidays kept him young and vigorous despite the climate . ) His smooth good looks were those of a man who somehow has remained forever a little boy , unaware of the currents of the lives about him , unawareof disaster or of suffering , whose motto was " Everything will turn out for the best . " Even when he wrote home complaining of his colleagueit was not himself who was responsible ; it was Mrs. Simon who forced him into it . In the beginning he had written complaining letters and neglected deliberately to post them , but when no replies came from the Home Mission Board his wife divined the reason and afterward she posted them with her own hand . What she hoped to accomplish was51the recall of the Smileys so that she might have in the house across the drive a couple who were impressed by her , by her clothes , by her tea parties , by the provincial Englishmen she picked up in Poona , and most of all by the English subalterns in Ranchipur whom she corralled with difficulty by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save at her house . She wanted too someone in the house opposite who would not be reminding her perpetually , day in and day out , that she was after all only the wife of a missionary . She had designs . She did not mean to have her daughters Fern and Hazel waste their lives as mates to missionaries . In romantic moments she saw them both , or Fern at least , married into county families , living in England in an atmosphere and background of which she had read in novels but had never yet seen . There were times when she had designs on Ransome himself as the son of an earl and the grandson of old " Ten Percent " MacPherson , the millionaire . There were even moments when , behind locked doors , she experienced in her desperation a renaissance of faith , and kneeling , prayed , " Oh , God , help me to get Mr. Ransome to come to tea . Oh , Lord , make him come to tea just once . " In her heart she thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these feelings she never allowed to interfere with her campaign . She hated him because of his indifference to her fading prettiness and to her tea parties . He had a way of being perfectly polite but of making her feel at the same time with a disconcerting suddenness that she was wriggling her shoulders , tossing her head and rolling her eyes like a pie dog bitch . She hated him for the prestige which he achieved without effort because he was what he was , when she worked so hard without ever achieving it at all . She hated him because everyone in Ranchipur was always asking him to lunch or to dine or to come to tea , and because she knew that there were only two places he never refused to go  --  to the palace and to the Smileys . And she hated him because he would go to tea and dinner with Mr. Bannerjee , an Indian , and was a great friend of Raschid Ali Khan who was not only an Indian but a Mohammedan . Somewhere in the back of her baffled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against people of darker complexion than herself , and the other a conviction that all Mohammedans were demons who had large harems guarded by eunuchs52where the most lascivious orgies went on incessantly . In her ignorance of history , race , geography and all culture she lumped together Indians and negroes in one large sacrifice to her early " poor-white " prejudices . She hated the Maharajah and the Maharani because in spite of their dark complexions they were supreme in Ranchipur , of greater importance , despite any arguments she could bring up in her frequent interior dialogues , than anyone , even Lily Hoggett-Egburry and the Resident himself . And she hated them because she and Mr. Simon were invited to the palace only once a year to dine in splendor with the Smileys and a few insignificant minor officials . She would complain to her husband , " I do n't see why we should be treated the same as those hicks ' across the drive . We are n't the same . " " My dear , we are the same to His Highness . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference to the old man . " " He would n't understand . You must remember he is an Indian and an Oriental . " " It 's humiliating . " " It 'll come out all right . " " I 'm sick of hearing that . " " What would you suggest that I do ? " " Make His Highness appreciate all you do for him . Demand an audience . " And then Mr. Simon would manage to put her off by saying , " We 'll think about it . We 'll find some way out . " And she would say , " If you do n't , I 'll go to him myself . You ought to do it for the sake of Fern and I lazel . It 's humiliating for us to be treated as if we were the same as the Smileys . " And then Mr. Simon , rather desperate , would say , " Weare the same in the eyes of the Lord , " and Mrs. Simon would shout , " The eyes of the Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her husband in a perpetual state of terror lest she make good her threat and create a scandal at the palace . He knew that it was not beyond her , if she wereexasperated sufficiently , to storm the palace gates and , knocking down the Sikhs , force her way into the royal presence . He was at once weakened and strengthened by the knowledge that X53much of what she said was true , and being a muddled man who valued peace and the good will of others more than action or clear thinking , he remained in a perpetual state of compromise and unhappy confusion . He was meant by nature to have been a good citizen with a small shop in a Middle Western town where he could belong to innumerable lodges and be a moving spirit of the Rotary Club . Instead of that he found himself , bewildered and often hurt , in the depths of the Orient where the virtues of his simple nature were completely lost . Before the intrigues of the Maharajah 's entourage , made simply out of love for intrigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburban snobberyof the tiny English colony and the rudeness of the subalterns who came to his wife 's teas , he was simply lost . Both his wife and the Smileys were stronger than himself , his wife because , in her energy and singlenessof purpose , she simply overrode all those things , and the Smileys because for them none of these things existed ; they were simply unaware of them . He knew how much the Mission had done for Ranchipur , not only by bringing the Maharajah 's subjects into the Kingdom of Heaven , but in ways far less heavenly and far more real . In his heart he knew that the conversions meant nothing in a spiritual sense , because somehow in a fashion beyond his understanding , the Hindu religion , with a devastating indifference , managed mysteriously to swallow up Christianity and absorb its gods and prophets and saints . In Jaipur he had heard a holy man saying his rosary , calling out the names of Hindu gods , saying rapidly , " Krishna , Vishnu , Rama , Jeesu Kreest ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ranchipur there was a cast-iron statue of the Virgin Mary . Although he always talked otherwise he knew that the whole problem of conversion was a hopeless one . The real benefits which the missionariesbrought to Ranchipur were not heavenly but material . The intelligentamong the Untouchables rushed into Christianity because , once converted , they ceased to be Untouchables in the true sense , exchanging this for the blasphemous and low state which all Europeans , even the Viceroy himself and the Emperor of India , held in the eyes of orthodox Hindus . Nevertheless the gates of conversion held rewards , and if the Untouchableswere indifferent to heavenly ones they appreciated the rewards of a new economic and social status and the opportunity to go as converted54Christians where they chose and make their living as they saw fit . And conversion among the wild nomadic hill tribes meant that they embraced not only Christianity which they promptly turned back into a kind of witch-doctor religion , but they embraced agriculture and weaving and settled down in villages , ceasing to make the disturbance and trouble they had created constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all very disturbing and discouraging and if Mr. Simon had not been an extremely easy-going healthy man , all of whose glands functionedperfectly , the whole thing would have thrown him either into an even deeper self-deception or a state of suicidal depression . As it was , he found his life pleasant enough despite his wife 's ambitions and the problemscreated by the future of Fern and Hazel . One thing weakened all his half-realized decisions , and that was the knowledge that he himself and Mrs. Simon were really of very little value to the Maharajah or to India because their side of the mission was devoted entirely to spiritual conquest . It was the Smileys in the schools and workshops who did all the work and achieved the lasting good , and he was perfectly aware that the Maharajah knew it . On the Saturday Ransome came to lunch with the Smileys Mrs. Simon had one of her moments of prayer . Kneeling beside the bed in her locked room , she implored God to send a call to Ransome to come to tea . Not trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and ears well open in order to attack Ransome in person when he arrived at the Smileys . She knew that he was almost certain to come because on Saturdayshe always lunched there at what , in moments of exasperation , she had referred to as Mrs. Smiley 's " treasonable lunches " because the people who came there were interested only in India . Those " black traitors , " Doctor Ansari and Mrs. Naidu , had both been there on the occasion of their visits to Ranchipur , and Raschid Ali Khan and Mr. Jobnekar who both lived in Ranchipur came there nearly every Saturday . Mrs. Simon wanted Ransome especially on this Saturday because it was a kind of farewell party before she left with Fern and Hazel for the hill station . So when he drove up to the door in his battered Buick , before he had set foot to the still steaming earth , Mrs. Simon came out of the house and across her untidy lawn toward him , her blond hair freshly curled , her55new silk dress crisp and as yet not dampened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after the first wave of weariness at sight of her ( after all , he had come all the way to Ranchipur to escape people like her ) he thought , " Hell , make it Thursday . " He knew that they would be leaving soon and that there would be a respite of at least three months during which he would not be invited by Mrs. Simon to a tennis party . Besides , very faintly somewhere in the depths of him there had been stirring lately a desire to see people again , to see them indiscriminately , and be amused by them . Mrs. Simon was holding out her hand , tossing her freshly made curls . Abstractly he recognized that she was a pretty woman of a certain age and he thought it a pity that she was unwilling to let it rest at that . She kept imposing her prettiness upon you , as if otherwise you might overlook it . And the eyes were perpetually giving her away . Far down in the depths of their blueness there was something as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only this morning , " she said . " We 're having a farewell tea party and I said to my husband , we must ask Mr. Ransome . ' He was going to stop by your house to ask you . Did he turn up ? " All this about stopping by the house was , Ransome knew , pure fabricationand he found himself suddenly in a position in which many people found themselves when dealing with Mrs. Simon . He was aware that he must help her with her lies . He began to play the game . He did not know why except that he felt a terrible necessity to save her from the shame of being caught . " I suppose something has kept him in town . I just left the house . I could n't well have missed him . " Mrs. Simon gurgled , " Well , anyway , I 've caught you on the fly . You will come , I hope ? " And she cast one of her most persuasive glances at him , a glance which , if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood could mean only one thing . Ransome wanted to laugh , first at such a display of sex in the interests of so trivial a matter ; and then at all the effort she was making when , if she only knew it , her game was already won . And suddenly in the midst of it he heard from the Smileys ' house the angry voice of Raschid Ali Khan , booming and violent in a broken phrase. 56 ... only got second raters now men who do n't come to India to make a career of India , but just to pass the time . " And something about the juxtaposition of Mrs. Simon and Raschid Ali Khan struck him not only as fantastic but as absurdly funny . " Surely . I 'd like to come , " he said . " Oh , I 'm so glad ! I 'm so glad ! It 's always so hard to get you . " He smiled and put his topee back on his thick dark hair . The sun of the monsoon was like a funace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 'll be delighted . I ca n't see how he came to miss you . " She showed signs of lingering , and he began to feel that old uneasiness which always crept over him after two minutes of her company . It was an uneasiness mingled with exhaustion . What did you say to a woman like this , who made gestures of invitation unaware of what she was doing ? What did you say to a woman who made conversation in which there was no sincerity whatever ? Always when he found himself trapped by her his mind began to wander so that he made wrong answers . He was aware that when she spoke to him her Southern accent grew doubly rich , so that sometimes he had difficulty in understanding her . And with him she referred a great deal to plantations and old " mammies , " which he felt was not only laying it on a bit thick , but insulting to his experience and power of discernment . " You 'd better not stand about in this sun . It 's ferocious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See you this afternoon . It is n't large . Just some of the boys dropping in . " She always referred to the subalterns as the boys . " As he walked up the path beneath Aunt Phoebe 's orchids and petunias he heard Raschid Ali Khan booming out again , from the kitchen this time : " The trouble is that they know they 're only coming out here temporarilyand they do their job offhand , between times , just waiting for the day they can go home on leave . If they 've got any money they go by the Italian line and get there quickly . If they have n't they go by P. &; O. They have n't any interest in India or Indians . " And then as Ransome entered the house he heard Raschid saying , 57 " England has lost India because men like them wo n't sit down with an Indian to have a cup of tea . " And he knew that Raschid was talking about civil servants . There was no one in the drawing room so he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would find them . In the center of the room the big Mohammedan was striding up and down , shouting in his excitement and pointing each gesture with the long radish he held in one hand . By the stove stood Mrs. Smiley in a clean apron , stirring something in a pot . In one corner sat Mr. Jobnekar , leader of the Depressed Classes , and in the other , seated in an authentic American rocking chair , was Aunt Phoebe , fanning herself with a large palm-leaf fan across which was printed in large black letters , " GO TO FREUNDLICHTHE CLOTHIER , IF YOU WANT GOOD VALUE . 19 MAIN STREET , CEDAR FALLS , IOWA . " She was a small thin old lady of eighty , with a body bent and worn by fifty years of life as a farmer 's wife , but in the blue eyes behind the steel-rimmed spectacles glowed the light of youth . She was enjoying herself . She liked big , handsome virile men and Raschid Ali Khan was giving one of his best performances . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a big muscular body through which flowed blood that was a mixture of Arab and Turk , Afghan and Persian , with perhaps a dash of Hungarian and a soupcon of Tartar . There was really nothing of the Hindu Indian about him . Beside a man like Major Safti , big and handsome as he was , one recognized at once the difference . In the Mohammedan there was a wildness and violence while in the Brahmin there was suavity and good nature . In Raschid there was a frankness and a positive quality which in the Hindu was supplanted by tact and a taste for intrigue . The Mohammedan was all for getting things done . He was a romantic and a visionary . The Hindu was passive and mystic . " Perhaps , " Ransome thought , " that is why a few million Mohammedans can hold their own against three hundred million Hindus . " With fair hair Raschid would have been blond , for his skin was fair and his eyes a blue-gray , but the hair was blue black and curly . The sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horsemen of Baber , " thought Ransome , " must have looked like Raschid . " There was no accountingin his appearance for the few drops of English blood that58Mowed in his veins . It was true , although Raschid never spoke of it , that his great-grandmother was an Englishwoman , the daughter of an East Indian merchant in Calcutta long before the mutiny . Raschid did not remember her at all although she had lived to be nearly a hundred years old and stories of her at least must have come to him from his father and grandfather . He never spoke of her and did not , Ransome discovered , like to be questioned about her . It was as if he tried to forget that drop of blood come to him from the destroyers of the rotting Mogul Empire . Ransome tried to imagine her , a young middle-class Englishwoman in the tiny world of Calcutta , eloping with the young prime minister of an obscure Muslim State . She must have been , he thought , one of those strange exotics which England in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic than those produced by other nations  --  people like Byron and Lady Hester Stanhope and Doughty and Lawrence and Gertrude Bell and hundreds of others less well known who had found relief and spiritual peace in the midst of peoples as far removed from their own as night is from day . A portrait of her which Ransome had seen existed in Raschid 's possession , but from it one could discover nothing . It was done in the deliberate decadent style of Persian miniatures at the end of the eighteenth century , stylized and artificial . She sat cross-legged , like a Muslim woman , on a cushion . Through the archway behind her there was a lovely blue sky diapered with mannered stars . From the portrait he gathered that she was dark , but the most importantfact was that she , a Mohammedan woman , had been painted at all and that she was without a veil . When he spoke of this to Raschid , his friend , a little annoyed , said , " No , she was never in purdah , nor my grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing about purdah . My great-grandmother always received her husband 's friends and went about freely . She ruled not only him but his people . She knew all about his affairs and sometimes she gave him good advice . Pure Islam does not recognize purdah . It was a corruption which grew up out of war . " She must indeed have been a remarkable old lady . In her old age her husband had been knighted for his services in helping to bring peace to India after the mutiny , so in the end she died honored by her own peopleX59whom she had scarcely seen since she was a girl of twenty . Her own romanticblood , it seemed , had brought neither British balance nor a shopkeeper'scalculation to the blood of her children . It was as if God had meant her all along to be a Muslim princess , and in the end she had found her place . Raschid was a devout Mohammedan , less from tradition than from conviction , because the religion in its purity seemed to him the most honest and practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included Christ among its prophets together with Moses and Isaiah , but Christ ( thought Raschid ) had been too impractical , too visionary , and all that he taught , which like the Islamic faith had been simplicity itself in its origin , had been corrupted ever since by priests and the church . He did not deny the corruption and the heretical sects of Islam , but he found them less mischievous and less productive of evil than the corresponding complex corruptions in Christianity . Priests had never had the same powers in Islam , nor the same worldliness nor the same hypocrisies . He knew the history of Christendom far more profoundly and in detail than Ransome or any man Ransome had ever met knew the history of Islam . " Neither one , " Raschid would say , " is anything but a sorry spectacle . Perhaps the Russians are right to make a religion of the state and the brotherhood of man . " But somehow in Islam the idea of the brotherhood of man had been preserved . Raschid himself like any good Muslim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother in Islam . In this , he said , Christianity had failed since clots and clusters assorted themselves according to races and according to nations ; that , he would say , has been the undoing of the West : " It is that which will destroy the West in the end . While Islam is still intact from the Pillars of Hercules to the China Sea , Christendom will be a howling wilderness once more preyed upon by marauding bands . " He would issue these statements in a thundering voice , his blue eyes flashing  --  these and others like , " Islam forbids any good Muslim to be a money changer or to loan money for interest . Did Christ ever speak of that ? " 6oHe spoke perfect English in a poetic and occasionally pompous manner , for he was Asiatic enough to enjoy long , pompous phrases and European enough to be excellent in the field of polemics . At moments , when he got thoroughly going , even his vitality could not save him from being a bore . He would have made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent politician in the West , but his great fault as a politician and as a leader in India was his sincerity . Not only did the tactlessness which sometimes accompanies sincerity paralyze his own efforts but it confounded alike the intrigues of the West and the East , so that both elements refused to deal with him because he slashed through any intrigue straight to the heart of things . He would have been a leader in time of war or of revolution , but in times of bargaining and compromise he was of no value to any party . His tragedy was that he had risen in his prime too late and too soon , and that in his heart he was aware of this . Now , at forty , he was head of the police in Ranchipur , a Muslim police official in a Hindu state . It was a less impossible situation than one might have imagined for there had been no religious riots , nor even any unpleasantnessin the State of Ranchipur for twenty-five years . That peace which was almost unknown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will and the absolute power of the old Maharajah . In Ranchipur religion was kept inside the temple and the mosque . There were no fanatics or agitators allowed  --  neither Mohammedan nor Hindu , nor those who sometimes appeared mysteriously from the world outside , armed with political rather than theological heresies . And Raschid himself was the soul of justice . No one , not even the most orthodox Hindu , had ever accused him of partiality toward his fellow believers in Islam . However profound his own belief , once he had stepped into the role of minister of police he became a fanatic for justice . Across his forehead , cutting deep into his thick , blue-black hair , there was a scar which had been given him by bandits in the middle of the Arabian desert long ago , a year after the greatest war in Christendom . Alone , with one fellow Muslim , he had made the journey on camel back across the freezing desert from Haifa to Mecca to report on the damage clone in the Christian war to the Holy City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey through the dust and burning heat and cold. 6rHe had made it not because in his heart he believed there was any special holiness attached to the city or even to the shrine itself , but because he knew that the shrine was a symbol which held all Islam together from Morocco to Macassar , and when the great day came Islam would need such a symbol . It would need a consciousness of brotherhood . He had two loyalties , one to Islam and one to India , and sometimes they were difficult to reconcile . On Saturdays Mrs. Smiley sent her cook into the city to enjoy himself , and herself took over the kitchen . It was the one half day of the week which she had to herself , and sometimes even that was snatched from her if there was illness or disaster among the families of the girls she taught all through the week . She liked cooking and she was a good cook , and there were times when she grew very weary of Indian cooking , excellent but always too highly seasoned when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastelike and monotonous when he made the European dishes she had taught him . When she took over the kitchen she was able to cook the things which she and Mr. Smiley and Aunt Phoebe liked  --  things like candied yams ( which grew in Ranchipur in abundance ) , lemon meringue pie and beaten biscuit . Saturday afternoon was a gala day and , as it was also the only time when the Smileys might see their friends , their kitchen on that clay had long since become a kind of lunch club . The members included Raschid Ali Khan , Aunt Phoebe , Mr. and Mrs. Smiley , Ransome , Miss MacDaid when she could get away from the hospital , Mr. Jobnekar when he was not traveling , and sometimes Major Safti . After a few meetings Raschid , who liked good food and was an excellent cook , could no longer resist the temptation of the kitchen and himself took a hand , and from then on the Saturday lunches became a mixture of Mohammedan and Iowan cooking . Raschid made dishes of which pancakes were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat . Mrs. Smiley undertook the desserts and the principal dishes . In all that odd assembly there was little trouble over the diet , for the Christians had no restrictions , nor had Mr. Jobnekar as an Untouchable , and Major Safti , the Brahmin had long ago forgotten that the cow was still sacred to millions of Indians . Only Raschid , the Mohammedan , drew a line , and that was at pork . He believed that the621ig was a dirty animal and that in any case pork was impossible in so hot a place as Ranchipur . Mrs. Smiley was a small woman with a thin body and a face , which although it had never been pretty was agreeable and had in it the light which is in the faces of good simple people . Both her body and her face , worn by the heat and the hard work of twenty-five years spent in Ranchipur , save for one year of leave in Cedar Falls , were those of a woman ten years older . But somehow this made very little difference , no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something else which you found in Mrs. Smiley , something which lay deeper than prettiness or fashionable frocks , something which you could not quite define but which made you notice her a moment or two after she had come into a room  --  notice her and think , " This is no ordinary woman . " Mrs. Smiley had no consciousness of the effect she made ; there was never any time for such things , any more than there was time for cosmeticsand clothes . There were never enough hours in any day for all that she had to accomplish , for all that must be done until she was old like Aunt Phoebe and at last in her grave , never having had time in all her life to think for a moment of herself . The friendship between Ransome and the Smileys was a subject of much muddled speculation , not only in the mind of Mrs. Simon but in the conversation of the whole European colony , who could not see what it was " a man like him " saw in " that dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her was much simpler than anything they supposed . He liked her common sense , her simplicity , her contentment in life . He liked her toughness which , more through the spirit than through the body , had resisted the burning heat for twenty-five years as well as attacks of malaria and once a bout with typhus . He liked her lack of pretense and her integrity  --  that on Saturday afternoons she allowed all India to slither away from her and became for a few hours what she had always been at heart , a good Iowa housewife . He liked her because she was undefeatable , because deep in her soul there was a profound and solid philosophy which never permitted her , even in India , to turn cynical . Above the disillusionment , the disappointment , the betrayal , the pettiness , that was all about her in the vast country , in the state , in her own church , among the very Untouchable boys and girls to whom she63tgave her life , she arose resilient and humorous , always saying , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which with her covered everything from a burned pancake to the paralyzing intrigues of Mr. and Mrs. Simon . She was no professional cheer-giver like the Reverend Mr. Simon , yet from her presence you were somehow able to gather strength . That was why they all came to sit in her big kitchen on Saturday afternoons  --  Mr. Jobnekar , Ransome , Miss MacDaid , even the great dynamo of vitality Raschid Ali Khan  --  all those who sometimes grew low-spirited and fearful and discouraged . And he was certain that she had never once thought of why they came . She was only glad that they were there . To Raschid Ali Khan Mrs. Smiley was always something of a mystery , but Mr. Jobnekar , the Untouchable , sitting on a stool in one corner , listening , understood her a little , because he had been to America . He was a small dark man , wiry and compact like a panther , with the tough smoldering vitality special to Untouchables . " It is my theory , " Mr. Jobnekar would say in his odd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race living in India since the beginning of time , who were enslaved when they were conquered by invaders . That 's why they have greater powers of resistance . The others are newcomers . We have always been here . We are immune to most of the evils of India because we belong here . " Unlike Raschid who had been to school in Oxford and Berlin and Paris , Mr. Jobnekar spoke English awkwardly and with difficulty . He had learned it first in the mission schools from the predecessor of Mr. Smiley , and although four years in America had helped him it did not give him an easy command of the tongue . Now and then in the midst of an impassioned speech he would say , " You bet ! " or " By Golly ! " It was the Maharajah himself who had paid for Mr. Jobnekar 's education in America and now Mr. Jobnekar was the leader of the Depressed Classes and the only organizer they had in all the turmoil of people and races and faiths that was India . He traveled from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosswise , into the great cities of British India , into obscure barbaric little states where a Hindu might kill an Untouchable and go unpunished on the plea that he had been defiled by64contact with his shadow . He knew them all , from his own people living in comparative peace and freedom in Ranchipur , to those who lived like vultures off the garbage and the donkeys and cows and goats which ( lied each night of starvation and old age in the streets and lanes and byways of their towns . It was not so long ago that this had been true in Ranchipur . Mr. Jobnekar at forty could remember when he had played near a great pile of animals , dead of starvation and disease , which always ornamentedthe dirty little square in the center of the Untouchable quarter . In famine time the Untouchables suffered less than the other poor inhabitants , for there were always the beasts which fell each night to be collected before the vultures got them . There were still places like that , plenty of them , throughout India . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and educatedand an excellent speaker in spite of his odd accent . In a way Mr. Jobnekar was a kind of symbol  --  the Untouchable Awakened ! The Maharajah was proud of him as a father might be proud of a gifted son . Before Mr. Jobnekar there had been no leader and so his people had been a football for the politicians and the sentimentalists . But that was changing now , and it was Mr. Jobnekar , passionate , filled with the feelingof a crusader , who wore himself out to bring about the change . Aunt Phoebe liked little Mr. Jobnekar immensely . He always reminded her of Job Simmons back in Wesaukee County as a young man . At seventy Aunt Phoebe had discovered India , and at eighty-one she was still discovering it , finding each day something new and fascinating and unbelievable . She had come to Ranchipur when the Smileys returned from the only leave they had ever taken , when twelve months of Iowa seemed to them dull and unexciting after the first reception and the first speeches of Cedar Falls were finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd been away for years and somehow we 'd struck root in India just as if that was the place to which we had always belonged . And in Cedar Falls we had n't anything to do except visit friends and relatives , and they did n't like it because we were so fond of India . After they got their curiosity satisfied they got angry because , you see , they thought America and Cedar Falls were the finest places on earth , and they would n't believe that there was65anything wonderful or exciting anywhere else . When we left India to go home we thought it would be wonderful to be back in Iowa again , seeing everybody and everything , but it was n't . After a couple of weeks we both wished we were back here , and we kept worrying about the school and the people we 'd left behind . It 's funny , when we first came out here we both hated it  --  the dirt and the dust and the heat and even the people , and then slowly we got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to live anywhere else . I missed it when we went home . Life back there seemed too easy and Cedar Falls seemed to have shrunk somehow . The houses , the streets , even the river were all so much smaller than we re- membered them . And they seemed kind of dull and drab . " When the time came for them to return to India and they were packing their trunks , Aunt Phoebe drove in from the farm dressed in her best clothes . She sat about almost the whole of one afternoon and after much backing and filling she came at last to the point . She said , " You know , Bertha , I 'd kind of like to go back to India with you . " " That kind of knocked me out , " Mrs. Smiley told Ransome . " She was sixty-nine , but she was strong and full of life , and she was full of arguments . " " Being here is dull , " said the old lady , " and I can leave my farm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have me out of the way anyway and not meddling around and making suggestions . I 'm going to die anyway some day and I might just as well die out in India . I 'd like to have a little excitement before I die . I 've never had any , like Pa had when he came out here and took up land and it was a wild country full of Indians . Iowa 's always been kind of tame all my life . I 've never been further away than Chicago . I 'm good and strong and I 've got a little money laid aside . I could help around the house . I 'm sound as a nut and can work right alongside any middle-aged woman . It would be kind of a rest and recreation for me . " When her niece told her about the heat and dust and disease she was unimpressed . She said , " I guess I could stand the heat all right . I guess India 's no hotter than Iowa in good corn weather . And old people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy as young people . As for dust , I 'm not afraid of that . I 'll pay all my expenses and I wo n't trouble you . Mebbe I 'd be a help . " L66Nobody was able to stop her , not her sisters , nor her sons nor the Con- , gregational minister . She had got the idea in her head and nothing was i ng to change her . " It 'll be , " she said , " like beginning life all over again . " And so it was . She resisted everything  --  heat , dirt , disease . Instead of being aged or weakened by it , she seemed to take a new hold on life . She was ageless because she liked people and she was full of curiosity and so , as she said , she could begin life " all fresh in a new country with a lot of new people . " She managed the household while the Smileys were it the Mission School . She even learned enough Hindustani to converse with Indians , and enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them even better than her niece had done because they respectedher on account of her great age and indestructibility . Her humanity and her simplicity they distrusted at first , as they distrustedthe humanity of the Smileys in the beginning . All the servants were Christians and they had been told about Christ 's doctrine of the brotherhood of man , but none of them had ever experienced any manifestationof it , least of all from white people from the West . Presently heir suspicions were quieted and they came to understand that the Smileys and Aunt Phoebe had no desire to exploit them . What they never quite understood was Aunt Phoebe herself and all the background which had determined her character and her beliefs and her 1peculiar un-European behavior . Only Mr. Jobnekar , who was intelligent .1nd had been to America and traveled there a great deal , had intimations of it , and even for him the intimations never passed beyond the state of rather vague emotional impressions which he could not reason out because he had always been a little confused by a life which was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the simplicity and honesty and friendliness of Aunt Phoebe existed in the center of America , because for two summers , partly to earn money and partly in order to know America better , he had worked in the harvest fields of Iowa and Kansas and there he had discovered these qualities . He knew too that one never found them in the Eastern states . The Eastern states were , Mr. Jobnekar thought , rather like a false Europe . He did not know , as Aunt Phoebe knew , more by instinct than by reason , that what lay behind Aunt Phoebe was a vanishing thing . She knew it . That was6711one of the reasons for wanting to come to India . In her heart she could n't bear to stay on there in Iowa watching the old life she had loved droopingand ( lying . And so here she was at eighty-one sitting in the kitchen of a vast cool barrack of a house in Ranchipur surrounded by a whole new world , by a whole new set of friends made after she was seventy years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's conquerors , and Mr. Jobnekar , the Untouchable , and Ransome who was half English and half American , and Miss MacDaid , a Scotswoman born in Sourabaya . Here she was rocking and fanning herself and chuckling at the sight of Raschid pacingup and down , making a thundering political speech while he turned his pancakes . Once she interrupted him in the middle of a great flood of orating to say , " Do n't make the meat balls so hot , Mr. Raschid . Last week they burnt the lining right out of my stomach . You Muslims must have stomachs made of leather . " She was perfectly happy . There was only one fly in the ointment and that was the Simons . She thought the Reverend Mr. Simon was a humbug , which was not quite true , and she hated the snobbery and the airs of that " poor-white " woman , Mrs. Simon . Presently they all sat down to lunch at one end of the big kitchen overlooking the enclosed part of the garden where the Smileys kept their little menagerie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animals . In the enclosure there were two wild pigs , a gazelle , and a hyena which was tame as a lap dog and did not smell at all . The animals , all but two mongooses which keep running in and out in a dither of curiosity and excitement over the Saturday lunch , all lay now in the shade of the mangoes away from the scalding heat of the sun . At the table there were two empty places . Mr. Smiley said , " I expect Miss MacDaid has been kept at the hospital . We wo n't take away her place . And I ca n't imagine what 's happened to the Major . " And then they all fell to talking of the weather and whether more rain would come . Mr. Jobnekar reassured them . He knew . In him there was ten thousand years of India . Beside him Raschid and even Major Safti and their people were newcomers. 68 " You sec the bree , . c , " he said . " Look at the trees . The leaves are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze will rise . You 'll see . Well have rain , plenty of it before midnight . " The breeze was rising but it brought no relief . Instead it only carried the dust and the dreadful heat into the very heart of the cool thickwalledhouse . Mrs. Smiley rose to take her lemon meringue pie out of the Indian oven . It was perfect , the beaten eggs lay bisque-colored across the top . " These old-fashioned ovens are better than any new fangled ones , " said Aunt Phoebe . " You can even get an even heat . I never made bread as good as when we used to bake it in an outdoor oven when I was a girl . " Outside a motor drove up under the trees and from it stepped Miss MacDaid and the Major . She looked crisp and cool even in the heat , but she had put too much rouge on her worn face . The Major was in high spirits . " I ca n't stay , " he said . " I 've got to go and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack of angina . I 'll be back . " " It 's a shame , " said Miss MacDaid . " He never gets a moment to himself . " She watched him go out , climb into the motor and drive off . Ransome at the far end of the table looked at her and remembered suddenly what John the Baptist had told him . " It 's awful the way the Major has to work , " said Miss MacDaid . " He should have an assistant or two who know about angina and things like that . I try to save him all I can , but that is n't very much . Oh , lemon pie ! I forgot it was lemon-pie day . We 're going to have rain tonight . The porter says so and he 's never wrong . I hear Mrs. Simon is giving one of her routs this afternoon . " Ransome thought , " If she would only stop talking . She 's trying to hide it and she ca n't . It 's horrible . " " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " We had to go down there this morning . Two of the patients died and the third was brought to the hospital . " " I hope that 's not going to spread about , " said Aunt Phoebe . " It wo n't nowadays , at least not under normal conditions . We 've got everything pretty well under control . " 69 " I 'll never forget nineteen twelve , " said Mr. Smiley . " It is n't the same now . It 's lice that spread typhus and Ranchipur is eighty-five percent cleaner now than it was then . " " The monsoon 's a bad time for it , " said Raschid . " The plague dies out and typhus comes in . " " Well , there 's not much use to worry about it . Ranchipur 's a pretty modern state . Men like the Major manage to keep diseases pretty well under control . Mankind is n't the victim now that it once was . " She went on talking , leaping from one subject to another before any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really thinking of the Major and seeing him , far more clearly than she saw any of those about her , probably at this moment bending over the heart of that old humbug , Mr. Bannerjee 's father . And she was talking now , on and on endlessly , because in her heart she knew that her love for him was a little ridiculous and always she was haunted by the fear that anyone , himself most of all , would ever discover her secret . She never knew , as she should have known out of her long experience with the East , that it had been divined long ago , even by the little black Untouchable boy who ran errands for her . And now one by one the Europeans would discover it . Ransome , watching her across the table , knew that what John the Baptist had said was true , and for a moment he was a little startled and frightened by the thought of how blind and cruel nature might be . For a moment , for the first time since the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive Mrs. Simon took a short nap after lunch and arose feeling soggy and discouraged and worried . There were moments in her life , rare but terrifying , when suddenly she would ask herself , " Why do I make all this struggle ? What 's it all for ? Why do n't I simply quit and be lazy and enjoy myself ? " But she could n't be lazy no matter how hard she tried . Something drove her on and on until at times she worked as hard and got as little sleep as the Smileys . Lying on the bed , dripping with perspiration , she worried about the cakes and the tea , about Fern 's and Hazel 's frocks , and about the weather . She too , like Mr. Jobnekar , knew that it was going to rain , although she knew for a different reason . Her bunion always told her . Half aloud , 70 she was saying , " Oh , Lord , do n't let it rain until after all the guests have gone home ! " If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the tea party indoors , and that in turn meant it would be a failure . On the lawn where there was plenty of room , with tennis and badminton in progress , things seemed to take care of themselves , but inside the house she became a nervous harried hostess aware that her guests were bored and desperately unable to do anything about it . She hoped too that Aunt Phoebe would n't come and sit on the Smiley 's front porch looking on . She had not asked the Smileys . She had given up asking them long ago , telling herself that it was because they always felt nervous and ill at ease among the distinguished people she entertained . To the Smileys their fall from the upper circle of society in Ranchipur had come as a relief , for they no longer had to put on their best clothes and stand about pretending they were enjoying themselves . In their simplicity they had always made a great effort to go to Mrs. Simon 's teas , feeling that she would be hurt if they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked God that a year or two earlier she had taken the bull by the horns and announced to Mr. Simon that she no longer intended to invite the Smileys . " I wo n't have them standing around , " she said , " stiff as pokers with their awful Middle Western accents . They hate it too . They 'll be glad not to come . It 's as if they just stood there reminding us that we 're missionaries . " " Well , we are , are n't we ? " suggested Mr. Simon . " Yes , we are , but not their kind of missionary . We 're modern mis-sionaries . " So the Smileys had not bothered them any more . It was only Aunt Phoebe who annoyed her now . Aunt Phoebe did it after a fashion which was at once subtle and ostentatious . As soon as the subalterns and the small officials and Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry arrived she would drag her American rocking chair out on to the verandah and sit there , rocking and drinking lemonade and fanning herself with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon 's guests because she knew very few of them , but she sat there , grim and grotesque , reminding them all that they were coming to a missionary 's tea party . It was as if she made up for the role by wearing her dowdiest calico dress and dragging in all the most 7s vulgar properties  --  the lemonade , the rocking chair and the palm-leaf fan from Cedar Falls , Iowa . Mrs. Simon could not order her off her own verandah and she suspected that Aunt Phoebe behaved thus out of malice . Prostrate in the heat , Mrs. Simon fell to thinking of the rumored visit of Lord and Lady Esketh , wondering whether Ransome knew them and how long they meant to stay in Ranchipur and whether she would ever meet them . The last she admitted was unlikely unless she could induce Ransome to arrange a meeting . She knew Ranchipur , shrewdly and well , and she knew there was very little chance that anyone at her tea party except Ransome would ever see the Eskeths save as they rolled majestically along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would stay in the old summer palace and meet no one but the ministers and the General , Ransome and a few important Indians . Not even Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry or Mr. Burrage , the railroad manager , would be invited . All the really distinguished people , she told herself , would be ignored . In British India , she thought , it would have been different , and almost at once she began considering again how to induce Mr. Simon to ask for a change of post to a more civilized world . By civilization Mrs. Simon did not mean culture , sensibility , intellect , art , architecture or science . She had very definite ideas on the subject ; she meant a world in which middle-class suburban society reigned supreme . The hot breeze , rising , stirred the window shades , and with a groan she rose to pull them up and regard the sky . It was still cloudless , with the same scalding sun overhead . " So far , " she thought , " so good , " but she knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent storm might come up in two minutes . Putting on a wrapper she crossed and opening the door called , " Fern ! Hazel ! " and a voice answered her from far down the huge hallway of the ancient barrack . It was Hazel 's voice , of course . Fern , she knew , would not take the trouble to answer her . " Put on your old tennis dresses and go down and see that everything is ready . . . not your new frocks or you 'll be all sweaty before the boys arrive . " Her daughters were at once Mrs. Simon 's pride and cross . Neither of them was perfect and neither of them was the instrument she would72have chosen to help her carry out her ambitious plans . Fern , who was nearly twenty , was the prettier of the two . She looked rather like her mother , and she had a good deal of Mrs. Simon 's wilfulness , and a great deal more petulance than her mother had ever had . In spite of her upbringing , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her life in India , in spite of her mother 's ambitious plans for her , she remainedstubbornly what she was  --  an extremely pretty small-town Americangirl . Designed by God and nature to lie in a hammock and strum a ukelele , circumstance had put her down in the middle of India , in an Indian state , where the only young men she ever saw were the young middle-class Englishmen with a fondness for " ragging , " and to Fern " ragging " made all " the boys " in Ranchipur simply seem not quite bright . Her happiest moments were spent in the fastnesses of her own room with the motion-picture magazines which her cousin sent her regularly from America in exchange for occasional exotic gifts from India  --  cheap shawls and bits of brocade for slippers ; and when she was not reading the " Secrets of the Stars " she was turning over in her mind vast , misty plans for escape . It was not very clear in her mind where she meant to escape to but Hollywood seemed a likely place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had evolved a philosophy of life which she revealed to no one , least of all to her mother . She knew that she was pretty and she knew that for her anything was better than Ranchipur . What she wanted was furs and jewels and lovers and mechanicalcivilization . In the solitude of her own room she came presently to develop a highly organized dream life in which she spent at least half of every day . To herself it came gradually to attain the proportions of reality , but by her mother it was referred to simply as " the sulks . " Her sister Hazel , with whom she had nothing whatever in common , was plump and rather moon-faced , and like her father she had that rather good-natured corn-fed look which many Americans from the Middle West possess . Unlike her sister , she was docile and never complained and never had " the sulks , " but alas , so long as Fern was about , " the boys " were unable to see the more homely virtues of Hazel . Mrs. Simon would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disposition and Hazel had Fern 's looks . " She never gave either of the girls any peace . Fern she was always scolding for her ill humor and her attitude73I lusband " " Blythe Summerfield , the Languorous Child of the Orient "  --  " Blythe Summerfield , the Screen 's Best-Dressed Woman . " For she had already picked her name . " Well , anyway , try to be polite to him . Try to be pleasant for once , like Hazel . " " If I looked like Hazel I 'd have to be pleasant . " " You ought to be ashamed of yourself . " " Well , I 'm not and I do n't see why you have to give these awful parties anyway . I 'd rather sit upstairs in my room . I hate everybody in Ranchipur . " " Now , Fern . Do n't work yourself up . " Through the doorway Mrs. Simon caught sight of the first guests arriving . They were Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry and one of " the boys . " Mrs. I Ioggett-Egburry was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own assumption of importance , the acknowledged leader of the only society in Ranchipur which Mrs. Simon recognized . The " boy " was Harry Loder who , Mrs. Simon knew , had a liking for Fern despite her evil disposition . He was thirty-three , and scarcely a boy either in years or appearance , but Mrs. Simon lumped him in with the others . He was good-looking in a rather beefy fashion and had a maleness which approached brutality and never failed to arouse in Mrs. Simon a little quiver of excitement . Sometimes during those long hot hours in the early afternoons when she was off guard against her own imagination , she found herself wondering what it would be like with Harry Loder instead of the Reverend Mr. Simon . Now at sight of him she felt the old quiver of excitement , and said to Fern , " Here come Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry and Harry . Do try and look agreeable . " " Oh , to hell with Mrs. H. ! " cried Fern . " To hell with everybody and ii everything ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tellingherself that her parents had no right to bring her up in a place like Ranchipur where there was nobody and nothing . " I did n't ask to be born , " she sobbed , " I did n't ask to be born ! " Flinging herself down on the bed she cried for a long time , and then rising she bathed her face in water which was tepid from the heat , made up her lips again and came downstairs . She moved slowly , with one slender hand resting on the stair rail , then passed through the little group 6of superiority toward the eligible young men of Ranchipur . Hazel she was forever poking and prodding , ordering her to stand up straight and not to giggle so much , forbidding her to eat because her figure was already lumpy , forbidding her even to perspire . By this method she managed to destroy entirely whatever confidence poor Hazel had ever had . And before both of them she forever dangled the prospect of matrimony as the one goal of existence . When she came downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one eye still on the weather , it was after five o'clock and all the preparations for tea were complete . She found Fern alone in the living room and said , casually , " Mr. Ransome is coming for tea . " To which Fern replied sulkily , " Is he ? " " I hope you 'll be nice to him . " " He probably wo n't even look at me . " " What makes you say that ? " " I 'm nothing to him . He never even notices me on the street . " " You 've never known him very well . You should be nicer to him . " Fern was silent for a moment , engaged in putting powder on her face . In the heat the powder seemed to melt away . Her mother watching her wondered how best to get round her , and all the time Fern was aware of her plans . She said , " If you 're thinking that I might marry him , you 're on the wrong track . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best families in England . " " That 's just the reason why he would n't look at me . " " You 've got a lot to offer him too . " " Anyway that 's not the kind of husband I want . " " What is it then ? " " I want to be something on my own . I do n't want to be anybody 's wife . " " That 's the best thing for a woman . " " Not any more . Not in America . Whoever marries me is going to be my husband . " Inwardly she was constantly giving interviews which one day would appear in the movie magazines : " Blythe Summerfield Adored by Her74 75of women in the living room and out across the lawn to the tennis courts and the pavilion covered with the brilliant flowers of the Indian bignonia . By the time she reached the bottom of the stairs she had recoveredherself and slipped into the one state of mind which made her mother 's parties bearable . It was not Fern Simon who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Languorous Daughter of the Orient . " The people at Mrs. Simon 's parties always seemed to Ransome extraordinarilylike the flocks of silly sheep among which he had lived for a time in the high mountains of Nevada . Long ago , watching the flocks at sight of a coyote , he had suddenly thought , " Sheep are the middleclassanimal . They should live in suburbs , always belong to the conservativeparty and be perpetually swindled by stockbrokers . " At the first sign of danger , of menace , even of change , the sheep would begin milling about , each one pushing and thrusting to reach the security of the very center of the herd . Like sheep , the people at Mrs. Simon 's parties were without originality and without initiative . At sight of them he always began by feeling ashamed of the human race and ended by feeling ashamed of himself for feeling so damned superior . That was one of the reasons he refused the invitations nine times out of ten . Like sheep they sought only security and enough grazing to keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action , alarmed them . And he was sick to death of having heard all his life that this class , this whole society , evolved in little more than a century out of industry , mechanical inventions , shopkeeping and moneylending , was the ultimate in human aspiration and achievement . There were moments when it seemed to him that the middle class and the middle class alone was responsible , with its toadying and sentimentality and nationalism and muddleheadedness , for the sickness and decay that afflicted the West . Here in Mrs. Simon 's dusty shaggy garden , a little colony isolated in the imperturbable and terrifying vastness of the East , they seemed at their worst , like a culture of specimens set apart for examination under the microscope . Filled with boredom simply at the prospect of the party , Ransome crossed the drive from the Smiley 's house a little after six . The heat was still stifling and the sun was like hot brass in the sky , but the breeze had76gun to assume the proportions of a real monsoon wind born far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean . It was as cool now beneath the Simon 's trees as anywhere in Ranchipur , save perhaps the icehouse or the inner courtyards of the great palace . On the Simon 's lawn he found exactly what he had expected to find . here were no Indians , and grouped about the tables and in the arbor vered with trumpet vines he found exactly the same world he would ve found at the same sort of party in England or America , save that re , against this hot Eastern background , all the qualities both of class nd individual seemed to have become exaggerated to the point of fantasy . ( ) ices were pitched a little higher , snobberies were pushed a little further , and the accents , a queer mixture of Cockney and Middle-Western andsomething earnestly believed to be Oxford , together with Mrs. Simon 's " mammy talk , " made speech at times very nearly unintelligible , and all ' tnmunication , especially for Ransome who had not frequented the setsufficiently to have discovered the key of tongues , almost impossible . Icre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duchesses , o millionaire bankers , no prime ministers , no chamber of commerce residents , and so each individual , unawed by the constant presence of ese phenomena , expanded and sought to fill the places of the missing iants and giantesses . Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry , a large florid woman who had created an accententirely special to herself , stepped into the role of duchess and referredconstantly to her relatives as county people in Shropshire ( here in Ranchiurit was easy to refer to them thus for no one could possibly discover at they were simply honest dairy farmers ) . Mr. Burrage , who had mething to do with the state railway , became the local Lord Esketh nd Mr. Burgess , who was a kind of head accountant in the Ranchipur ank became something which was a blend of chancellor of the exchequer nd head of the Bank of England . And " the boys , " with their polo and igsticking , became Lord Lonsdales and Lord Derbys . Lost and hiddensway in a powerful Indian state , far from the pomp and gold braid andtococco splendors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudeness showed breeding , ignored civilization and allowed their uls to expand into a middle-class idea of what was aristocratic . Only Mrs. Simon , as wife of a missionary , was left with no great role77to play . The only missionary she could think of who had ever been renownedwas Livingstone , and there was nothing very smart or worldly in pretending that she was Mrs. Livingstone . Moving among them , watching them , it always astounded Ransome that this tight little world existed , day after day , in utter ignorance of the splendorous world which engulfed it , unaware of its beauties , its magnificence , its tragedy , its squalor . Yet , like sheep , they were aware of the terror . It was always with them , the fear of being swallowed up and forgotten ; and so to give themselves courage they became arrogant and comic . Among themselves they referred to this process as " keeping a stiff upper lip . " Like sheep in their fright they huddled together , all save Miss MacDaid and the Smileys and Aunt Phoebe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who ran the Maharani 's High School for Girls and were never seen by anyone . And so all these were outcasts among the sheep , mavericks who wandered alone . The spectacle of the tea party , Ransome knew in his heart , was more pitiful than annoying . The bleating , the arrogance , the odd affected accents were like the whistling in the dark of a small and frightened boy . Yet there were compensations . Here in Ranchipur all these people experienced a certain prestige and importance ; when they returned home they would be lost in a vast swamp of suburban mediocrity . Ransome was aware that he was not popular with any of them but he was aware too that every one of them , save perhaps one or two of the more cocky subalterns , was impressed by him . The sight of him crossing the lawn created a sudden stir in the little party . The men turned to look and the women became more animated , and Mrs. Simon swept forward to greet him , clinging with one hand to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gust of the rising monsoon wind . He thought , " If I were simply myself , a man , unknown to them , poor and without relatives who have titles , they would not look twice in my direction . " There was a tennis match in progress with the Reverend Mr. Simon , his big amiable face dripping and red , and Mrs. Burrage on one side , playing Hazel , obliging , clumsy and perspiring freely despite her mother 's orders , and a dapper little subaltern called Hallett . At one end of the courts in the arbor sat most of the others grouped about Mrs. Hoggettburrywho , seated in a large wicker chair , was playing graciously theIc of the local duchess who had just opened the bazaar . She was a urge woman , not fat but with a large blond milkmaid body which seemed pot to have faded but simply to have spread . Thirty years ago she had been a beauty and she still dressed in the Edwardian tradition , in flowing chiffon and an enormous bazaar-opening hat with which the monsoon wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in India as the wife of an official of the Imperial Bank , and in those thirty years she had come to use a language which was an odd jargon of English and Hindustani and East of Suez slang . With her a whisky and soda was always a chota pieg ; a 111tter was always a chit ; rupees were chips . Her husband she always referred to as the burran sahib and people were classified in her simple mind simply as pukka or not pukka . Her capacity for brandy was the I Ighest in Ranchipur , higher even than that of Ransome himself . Her husband saw her infrequently : a good part of the time he was occupied with business in Calcutta or Madras or Bombay , and when he was in Ranchipur his own engagements nearly always failed to coincide withers . She had no children and nothing whatever to do with her time save o drink quietly and go calling or coquette with " the boys . " Ransome nd Miss MacDaid and the Major always called her " Pukka Lil . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unrest began to manifest itself among the men because nothing stronger than lemondeand ginger beer ever made its appearance , and after an hour or two of the same games and the same gossip their spirits began to flag . In her heart Mrs. Simon felt that serving only lemonade and ginger beer implied loss of caste , but the shadow of the Board of Foreign Missions was always there forcing her , like Aunt Phoebe , to remember that she was only the wife of a missionary . She was a nervous hostess , unwilling to let well enough alone and f never stirring up her parties and separating people the very moment they began to get on , in order to make new and unsympathetic corn-I i nations . She suffered profoundly and the only pleasure she got from I lese occasions was the illusion , after everyone had gone home , that she 11.1 ( 1 come a long way from Unity Point , Mississippi . Now she keptrcircling round Ransome like a sheep dog , conducting him from group to group as if , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favors without partiality . Meanwhile she kept one eye on the storm and 1 the other on the verandah of the Smileys ' house , praying that Aunt Phoebe , for once , would not appear with her lemonade , her fan and her rocking chair to sit there watching like an angel of judgment . When Ransome was thrust at last into the group surrounding Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry , they were all talking of the Eskeths , and Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry , the Edwardian , was explaining about Lady Esketh . " She was Edwina Doncaster , " she said , " Ronald Doncaster 's daughter , you remember . He was a great friend of the King . King Edward of course . The family comes from my part of the world  --  from Shropshire , that is . Mr. Ransome must know her . " And graciously she reached out one large soft unsteady white hand as if to draw him physically within the circle . A little startled , he said , " No , I 'm afraid not . " He had lied , partly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the announcement of Lady Esketh 's identity , for he did know perfectly . The moment Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry , out of her " Court and Society " knowledge , used the name " Edwina , " he knew at once . He had known somewhere in the back of his consciousness all the time , but in all that had happened to him in fifteen years he had forgotten . When he had turned his back long ago on people like Edwina he had managed to forget what had become of a good many of them . Now suddenly he saw her again not at Mrs. Simon 's tennis party but against the background of after-war London , surrounded by crowds of people all smartly dressed , with a jazz band playing somewhere in the background young , pretty , smart in handsome clothes which were probably not paid for , with a reputation already tarnished . Once he had fancied himself in love with her and now the memory of her brought him a sudden wave of warmth and sympathy , because once he had belonged in her world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illness which journalists had a way of fastening upon one generation and one small group . But it was an illness more widespread and profound , of which Edwina and himself were only the exaggerated symptoms . The old , living in the illusion of a security which was gone8oforever , could neither understand nor divine it and the young , being born to it , accepted it as the normal state of affairs . With a fixed polite smile on his face he slipped away from the conversationof Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry and her friends to thinking about Edwina , wondering what she would be like now . He was quite certain that he knew ; she would have followed the pattern of the wcnen of her class and time . Then Mrs. Simon left him to occupy herself with the refreshments , and suddenly out of nowhere he saw her daughter Fern standing in front of him . She was saying , " Mr. Ransome , could I speak to you for a moment ? " He had never really noticed her before and now he saw that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blushing and confusion . His thoughts still entangled with memories of Edwina , he found himself comparing the two ; Edwina was never fresh and young like this girl . There was never anything feverish and excited about her , and he found himself wondering whether in all her life she had ever blushed . He managed to say , " Of course . Whenever you like . " Hesitating , blushing , she said , " Do you mind coming on to the verandah ? It 's rather private . . . what I want to ask you . " As they crossed the burnt seedy lawn the wind suddenly increased , stirring up little swirls of dust which had already formed since the downpour of the night before . He noticed as they passed the Smileys ' that Aunt Phoebe had taken up her position on the verandah and was staring at the party , and that Mr. Jobnekar was waving to him as he sailed down the drive on his bicycle through the very midst of the party . From the direction of the tennis courts he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either as an Untouchable or as the leader of millions of people . At the far end of the verandah there was a corner hidden by moonflowervines and a swinging seat , and it was here that Fern led him . He saw that she was making a great effort . She said , " Of course , I know I 'm nothing to you . You do n't even know I exist . " He interrupted her to assure her that he was aware of her existence and had been ever since he came to Ranchipur . He could not say that81 to him she had always been a child ; indeed until this very moment he had not thought of her as a woman at all . " Maybe you 'll think I 'm crazy , " she said , " but there is n't anyone else I can talk to . If I even mentioned it to any of those people , everybody in Ranchipur would know in half an hour . " And then she plunged : " You see , I 've got to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't Blythe Summerfield , Pearl of the Orient , now . She was just Fern Simon , a bored unhappy restless girl who in her spirit had never left her own country . " I 'd rather be any place than here . I ca n't stand these awful people . There is n't anything to do or any place to go . I 've got to get away . " Ransome 's eyes opened a little wider and he thought , " Maybe she 's better than I believed . " And not knowing what to say he waited , aware that she made him , with her enthusiasm and unhappiness , feel immeasurablyold . " I 'm only thirty-eight , " he thought , " about twenty years older than she is . " But he knew the difference was much greater than twenty years . She said , " I want to find out about boats and things . I 've got some money saved up and I want to take a boat from Bombay , and by the time they find out it 'll be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? " For a moment she hesitated and then she said , " Hollywood . " He laughed because he could not help himself and then , a little ashamed , said seriously , " That 's not so easy . " " If you want a thing badly enough you 'll always get a break . I 'm still young and I 'm prettier than most of them . " Silently he appraised her . It was true that she was prettier than most of them . Perhaps if she had her chance  --  who could tell ? He was aware that he felt vaguely miserable , for as he grew older and more solitary he resented the confidences of people . He hated the responsibility of decision which they always thrust upon him , why he did not know , unless there was something special about him which he did not understand that encouragedthem . Now he found himself trying to discourage her , again without knowing why , for he did not believe in meddling in the lives of other people , and even while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and respectable . Once I 'd have encouraged her to run82away and find as much adventure as she could squeeze into a life which is far too short . " Instead of being persuaded by him , she began suddenly to cry , not quietly but with great hysterical sobs , pouring out all her troubles and the persecution she suffered from her mother . " She 's determined to make me marry one of those pipsqueaks . She does n't even see that the lousy little snobs will never ask mc . I ca n't stand them any longer . I ca n't ! You 've got to help me . There 's no one else in Ranchipur . " " Be quiet first and then tell me what you want to do . It 'll stake a fine piece of gossip for Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry if she should come up here and find us like this . " Gulping , she said , " I want you to lend me some money . I only need about fifty pounds more . " He laughed , " Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . " " I 'd pay you back . I promise I would . " " It is n't that , my dear child . Do n't you see ? It 's die position it puts me in . " She gave him a sharp hard glance . " I did n't think you were going to be respectable like all of them out there , " and she began to cry again , more noisily than ever . " I wo n't go to Poona with her ! I wo n't . . . and have to see all those awful people again ! " Despite anything he could do he began to laugh , until he was shaking in his efforts to suppress his mirth . He was aware that something must be done quickly . The wind was rising and the sky was suddenly black with clouds and at any moment the entire tea party might be forced inside . He said , " If you 'll be quiet and go upstairs and wash your face , I 'll promise to help . 1'l1 do what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave him a sharp , appraising look from her clear blue eyes . " You promise ? " " I promise . If you 'll only be good now and go upstairs . " " I wo n't forget . " And he thought , " No , she wo n't , " and again he began to laugh at the spectacle of himself , a man who certainly knew his way83about the world , being quietly blackmailed by Fern Simon in whom he had not the least interest . And then he was aware that beyond her , by the tennis courts , some disaster had overtaken the tea party . Most of the women , clinging to their hats , were running toward the house . Two or three had climbed on to the tables at the side of the tennis court and somehow Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry had managed to scramble unsteadily up one side of the arbor . " The boys , " armed with chairs and tennis racquets , had formed themselves into a circle to cover the retreat of the women against a menace which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of the verandah and discovered the cause of the panic . There in the middle of the lawn , ambling genially toward the tea party in quest of a biscuit , was the Smileys ' tame hyena . Shaking inwardly and making strange suppressed noises he leapt off the verandah to the rescue . The big brute recognized him and ran at once in his direction , making small , affectionate noises . Siezing him by the scruff of the neck he led the hyena away from the tennis party , across the drive to the Smiley 's . Between gulps and chuckles he managed to call back over his shoulder , " He 's harmless . He would n't hurt a baby , " and then almost at once he realized that with " the boys " still in formation , armed with chairs and tennis rackets , and Mrs. Hoggett-Egburry still clinging in all her Edwardian finery to the lower end of the arbor , he had been tactless . " Like sheep , " he thought , chuckling . " Exactly like sheep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward in her rocking chair and said tartly , " I might have gone and fetched him home myself only I was n't invited to the party . " Looking up at her Ransome caught the shadow of a twinkle in her bright blue eyes , and then he knew . Aunt Phoebe had left the gate of the enclosure open deliberately , so that the amiable hyena might escape and go to the party , and all at once he knew why she had always seemed familiar to him , even on their first meeting . She was very like his grandmotherMacPherson who had forced " Ten percent " MacPherson to marry her at the point of a six-shooter . As he turned the hyena into the enclosure and fastened the gate , the rain began again in big splattering drops . It seemed to him that each84drop must contain half a teacup of water . The Simons ' tennis court was rripty now and the Untouchable servants were scurrying to rescue the , , reshments while Mrs. Simon , who had given up the struggle with ther , nsoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions ; ainst the howling of the rising storm . The rain caught Mr. Jobnekar on his way home from the Smileys ' and Ransome found him standing under a mango tree outside the alcohol distillery . When he had taken him and his bicycle into his car he told him the story of the hyena and his suspicion of Aunt Phoebe 's guilt . " That 's what I mean about Aunt Phoebe , " Mr. Jobnekar said . " That 's how she 's different . She makes big fat vigorous jokes . She loves people but she ca n't bear to see them making fools of themselves . I used to know old men and women like that in the West in America . I could always be sure they 'd be kind and friendly to me . Most of them had never seen an Indian before  --  any kind but a redskin  --  but it did n't make any difference . " They drove across the bridge by the zoological gardens , past the statue of Queen Victoria with an inscription written by Disraeli , down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lived . The quarter was an irregular network of streets and alleys grown up without plan over a period of a thousand years and all centered about a square which contained the tank and the wells of the Untouchables . Once not so many years before it had been a filthy place with a great heap of dead animals , the bounty and communal property of the quarter  --  at one end ; but all that was changed now and the quarter was clean and well ordered , cleaner indeed than the quarters occupied by most of the caste Hindus . For part of the change , Mr. Jobnekar explained , the Maharajah himself was responsible , but a great part of it came from the energies and the teaching of Mr. and Mrs. Smiley . As they crossed the square toward Mr. Jobnekar 's house the steaming rain cascaded in a waterfall down the steps of the tank . Mr. Jobnekar said sentimentally , " Look at it . What is more beautiful than water ? The nourishment of the earth . " Mr. Jobnekar 's house was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had a second floor and had been painted a bright85pink that was already discolored by spots of damp . At the windows there were cheap curtains of lace which together with the pink plaster gave it a curious bedizened likeness to the villa of some small shopkeeper in Nice or Toulon . At the house next door an old woman , drenched by the rain , was hastily removing pats of cow dung from the house wall before they became wet and unfit for use as fuel . Mr. Jobnekar refused to let Ransome go without a cup of tea and so they got down and walked through a narrow passage and up the stairs to the main room of the house . There they found that Mrs. Jobnekar was entertaining Miss Dirks and Miss Hodge , the mistresses of the High School for girls . Mrs. Jobnekar came out of the shadows at the far end of the room to welcome them , a tiny woman with enormous black eyes and skin the color of copper , clad in a sari of pale blue cotton stuff . Although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly perfect , and for that she had to thank the conscience and devotion of the two spinsters who now sat on stiff chairs at the far end of the room . Behind Mrs. Jobnekar trailed three small children aged four , three and two . It would have been difficult to judge their ages exactly for there was something miniature and ageless about them , like Persian dolls or midgets of extraordinary beauty and perfection . Tea was already under way and Miss Dirks and Miss Hodge , sitting like two strange birds beside the sewing machine , were having theirs . In this house , where by habit everyone sat on the floor and there were no tables , there was something grotesque not only in the ' sight of the two spinsters but in the very cheap chairs upon which they sat . Jobnekar said to Ransome , " I 'll fetch a chair for you directly . They 're kept downstairs except when we entertain visitors , " and Ransome went forward to speak to the two schoolmistresses . He scarcely knew them , for in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them only twice and then only on occasions when he went to visit the school . They led a life apart , without contact of any sort either with Indians or Europeans ; they never entertained and they only went out on occasions like this when their duty toward the school seemed to demand it . One never saw them at the palace nor in Mrs. Simon 's set , nor at Mr. Bannerjee 's nor even at the Smileys ' . They lived861in a neat bungalow opposite the great gate of the palace on the EngineeringSchool Road . At sight of them Ransome thought , " They belong in some village in the north of England living in a house made of granite where the sun only shines ten times a year . " And here they were living in India beneath a sun which blazed day in and day out from morning until night from October to June . Miss Dirks was tall and thin with iron-gray hair , and she wore a topee with a scarf which fell down the back and a suit of white linen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating costumes . Her face , the texture of leather , was seamed and lined and utterly plain save for the fineness of the eyes in which there was a dark expression of suffering . Miss Hodge was less hard-bitten in appearance . She had rejected the topee and veil and the grim practical costume of Miss Dirks and wore a hat of white felt ornamented by a single artificial rose and a frock of pink gingham ornamented with little frills at the throat and wrists . But her face was as plain as that of her companion . It differed only in the fact that instead of king rough hewn from granite it was lumpily molded from clay . The pair of them filled Ransome , who was not a shy man , with shyness . When he shook hands with Miss Dirks he felt rather like a friendly dog being greeted politely by a woman who has the conviction that all dogs are unpleasant and smelly animals . They affected Mr. Jobnekar in the same fashion but instead of throwinghim into an awkward silence they forced him , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hospitality which rang all the more false for the effort he put into it . As Mr. Jobnekar returned with the chairs a sudden silence felt upon the room and poor Mr. Jobnekar redoubled his efforts at conversation . Mrs. Jobnekar went to ( etch more tea and for a few moments they all talked of the weather , of the school , of the typhus and cholera cases which had broken out larmingly in the poorer quarters  --  stiff stilted conversation during which Ransome discovered that Miss Dirks seemed to have lost all capacity for contact with her fellow creatures . Miss Hodge , although rusty and shy , had moments when conversation would gush forth like a spring freshet ; Ind then suddenly dry at the source , and immediately beneath the pallid87skill there would appear something which might have passed for the ghost of a blush . The conversation could not have lasted more than ten or fifteen minutes , and during all that time Ransome was aware that the grim Miss Dirks was eager to be up and away . It was as if both Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We 've spoiled their call . " And wanting to make some kindly gesture , he said , " I 'll drive you both home . You ca n't possibly walk through this flood . " Miss Dirks said primly , " Thank you very much but we like walking . We came prepared . We have galoshes and umbrellas and mackintoshes downstairs . " Ransome laughed , " Well , even all those things are n't any good against the monsoon , " and then he was sorry because she looked at him sharply and he divined that she thought he was poking fun at her . Miss Hodge started to speak and then suddenly , with her mouth alreadyopen , thought better of it and was silent . Mrs. Jobnekar came forward bearing garlands of jasmine and marigold which she sprinkled with rose water and put over the heads of the two spinsters when they stood up to go . Then she gave them each a fragment of coconut and a bit of brocade sari cloth , and Miss Dirks and Miss Hodge in turn shook their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen Miss Dirks led the way out of the room . But in the doorway Miss Hodge turned and addressed Ransome with sudden boldness across the whole length of the room . " Thank you for your offer , Mr. Ransome , " she said . " Perhaps some other time . You see , we came prepared to walk . We get so little exercise . " She lingered a moment longer , shy , awkward and uncertain , until the voice of Miss Dirks came up the well of the stairway : " Elizabeth , what are you doing ? " " Coming . . . coming , " cried Miss Hodge and hurried down the stairs . Ransome , watching her , had the feeling that she would have liked to have stayed behind . From the window overlooking the flooded square he watched them picking their way between pools of water around the tank and into the mouth of the street which led toward the old abandoned palace facing the cinema . Miss Dirks walked a little ahead as if she were a trapper 88guide , erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topee like the tail of a racoon cap , with Miss Hodge scurrying along at her heels . They wore the garlands over their mackintoshes and each carried the bit of coconut and brocade in her free hand . There was something sad in the sight of the two lonely women which filled Ransome with a sudden impulse to do something to brighten up their lives , but what it was he could do and how he could do it he had not the faintest idea . Long ago when he had spoken of them to Miss MacDaid she had shaken her head rather solemnly and said , " There is n't anything to be done . You see they 're like that . They might just as well be in Birmingham as in Ranchiptir . They 're doing their duty . They 'd have the same life anywhere . I tried to be friendly but it was n't any good . It just made them suspicious of me . They disapprove of me I think , because I feel quite as much at home with Indians as with anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they never feel at home . " Standing at the window Ransome saw beyond their two drab figures into the background from which they had come . He knew what it was because there was nothing rare and unusual in it . The West was filled with just such tiny worlds  --  narrow , nonconformist , respectable , with just enough money to carry them through from one year to another , worlds in which there was never any color nor any fire , worlds in which the father went to an office at eight in the morning and returned at eight at night , hardworking , innocent , loyal to the employer who kept him and his family forever on the edge of starvation . Suddenly he knew all about the tragedy of the two lonely women . They had never lived . They had scarcely even breathed . Even India meant nothing to them . By the time they were old enough to have loved a man all love and all men had been made ugly and forbidding by the little world out of which they came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Jobnekar was pouring him another cup of tea . He turned to her thinking how pretty she looked and how well the pale blue sari suited her copper skin . Beyondher through the high window stretched the open country  --  the mango orchard and the burning ghats and then the fields of maize and891millet , all the way to the fabulous mountain , Abana , rising out of the dead flat plain , its summit crowned by a cloud of white Jain temples . " They 're very odd , " he said , meaning Miss Dirks and Miss Hodge . " But they 're very kind , " said Mrs. Jobnekar . " If you were in trouble Miss Dirks would do anything for you and hate it if you spoke of her kindness . They 're like lots of Englishwomen . They ca n't show what they feel . Believe me , " she added as she passed him his tea , " I know how good they are . " Mrs. Jobnekar was smiling and he wondered how she , who had never been out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their hearts had never left their own country . The very idea of Miss Dirks and Miss Hodge having tea in the house of an Untouchable seemed too preposterous to be believed . For a long time afterward he kept seeingthem , plodding flat-footed through the monsoon flood in mackintoshesgarlanded with jasmine and marigold that had been sprinkled with rose water . Still in silence , Miss Dirks always walking a pace or two in front , the two schoolmistresses crossed the square before the old palace where so much evil had taken place , continuing past the tank and the music school , beginning now to be clamorous as the day 's work ended and one by one the students began to arrive , past the great gate of the palace where the Maharajah 's military band was giving its evening concert , until at last they came to the gate of their little bungalow . Here Miss Dirks took out a key , opened the gate and held it open for Miss Hodge to enter . The bungalow was no longer new and its nondescript architecture was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp in monsoon time and bad for Miss Dirk 's rheumatism . It had been built especially for the two schoolmistresses when they had come to Ranchipur twenty-five years before , by an Indian contractor who admiredLiverpool suburban architecture . It was not well adapted to so hot a place as Ranchipur and , if the vines which covered it had been ampelopsis and Virginia creeper instead of trumpet vines and passion flower , it could have been transported intact to any English suburb and worn the name " The Nook " without startling anyone . Inside itX90had grown with time to become a perfect shell for the two women . Like caddis worms they had surrounded themselves gradually through the years with bits and pieces , until at last the inside of the little house had the air of a charity bazaar . There were innumerable cushions , and every available spot was covered with doilies and covers of the lace which Miss Hodge worked in moments of leisure during the hot still evenings . And there were bits of Indian embroidery and cheap brasses from Benares and a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorge and Windemere . Once inside the house the two ladies pu , down their umbrellas and shook the water from their mackintoshes , hanging them carefully on the golden oak hall rack where they or their predecessors had hung for twenty-five years . Despite umbrellas and mackintoshes they were both thoroughly soaked , partly from the rain itself and partly from the effect of the mackintoshes which , designed for the chilly climate of Scotland , simply became walking steam baths during an Indian monsoon . Miss Dirks , shaking out her mackintosh , said , " Go at once and have a bath , Elizabeth . I 'll see to the supper . " But Miss Hodge protested , " No , I 'll do it . You take the first bath . " " Please , Elizabeth , do as I say . " And then began one of those interminable pointless arguments which occurred between them , day after day , arguments which were subtly selfish because each of them sought the fruits of martyrdom for herself . Once long ago the arguments , less frequent then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine solicitude , but as the years passed they had become perverted somehow and twisted into mockeries of sincerity . It was as if each of them sought to martyrize herself in order to hurt the other by exhibiting the scars , with the implication , " Look how I have suffered for your sake . Look how many times I 've given in . " They wrangled over the subject of the bath for nearly ten minutes and in the end it was Miss Dirks , the more grim and powerful of the two , who won . From the great Persian gateway across the road the music of the Indian band drifted in through the open windows  --  wild , barbaric , strident and monotonous to the Western ears of the two schoolmistresses , now rising in volume , now fading away , a cacophonic clamor to which Miss Dirks91had never grown accustomed . When she was exhausted by the heat and the damp the magnificent sounds became almost unbearable , especially when in her heart she was homesick for a good band concert on Bournemouthpier . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that music any longer ! It 's driving me crazy ! I 'm going to demand another bungalow . " Miss Hodge said , " We could escape it for the summer . It 's not too late to take a P. and O. boat and have two months in England . We 've plenty of money saved up . " " I 'm not going back ! I 'm never going back ! I 've told you that , a thousand times . " For a moment the outburst silenced Miss Hodge and then wistfully she said , " I think you 're wrong , Sarah . The change would do you good . We 've both been away for such a long time . " Then Miss Dirks went alarmingly white and looked fiercely at Miss Hodge : " Do you want to go back there , ever again ? After what happened ? You must be crazy ! I never want to see England again . " The angry tears came into her eyes and Miss Hodge was suddenly frightened , not only by the sudden burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of injustice , of shame , of lies , of deceit which still , after twenty-five years , had the power to frighten and confuse her . In a low conciliatory voice she said , " That was twenty-five years ago . " " I do n't care whether it was a hundred years ago . I 'm never going back . " And turning , she ran from the room , slamming the door to lock herself in with her loneliness and nostalgia and shut out from her mind the picture of a soft green country with lovely gardens where there were never any snakes or monsoons or earthquakes and no wild horrible barbaric music . Miss Hodge made no effort to follow her and presently she went quietly to her bath . For a long time now she had been dimly aware of a strange restlessnesswhich had invaded her worn middle-aged body , raising a curious intangible barrier between herself and Sarah . It was a sensation which made her feel strong and miserable at the same time , and the odd thing was that in her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakest manifestations it was a desire to cross Sarah , to irritate herX92by disagreeing upon every subject , to turn even the smallest incident into a " situation . " At its worst it showed itself as a wild craving for some excitement or adventure to break the narrow monotony of her existence , a fierce desire for freedom from the intricate web of habit and duty and devotion which had grown about her , more binding and more bitter with the passing of each year . At such times it was as if she became another person , forgetting the loyalty between herself and Sarah , forgettingthat all either of them had in the world was each other . The feeling came over her at times in great waves against which she found herself powerless , and as each wave passed she would be overcome with remorse for having hurt Sarah and be filled with a desire to make amends . She would try to apologize to Sarah without apologizing , to explain without speaking , by the tone of her voice when they discussed simple things like the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attention ; but each time she was swept by a wave of feeling she was aware that like a wave breaking up on a beach , when it had passed , it left her a little further removed from Sarah . Never was she quite able to recover exactly the old feeling of devotion and understanding . Each time a little ground was lost and each of them became a little more solitary . Lately it had made her feel more and more miserable and muddled and confused until there were moments of terror when she thought she was going crazy . Now lying in her bath , listening to the wild music from the gateway , one of the greater waves swept over her . With Sarah locked in her room weeping , it was as if she had won a great victory which left her feeling independent and strong . It was as if in some way she was enjoying vengeance , how or for what she could not say , because during these waves she did not trouble  --  indeed it was impossible for her  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen Sarah weep , but she knew that there were times when Sarah wept because she had heard the sobbing through locked doors . More and more as the music , played each evening at sunset , had affectedSarah 's nerves , she herself had come to like it . Now it made her feel almost savage so that she really found pleasure in the knowledge that Sarah was growing old and ill while she herself was still strong . It brought her a strange excitement in which she imagined all sorts of 93things which might have happened to her if her life had been different . There were moments at that hour when the daylight , fading , lingered and then quickly vanished , when , listening to the wild music , she seemed to escape from her plain rather plump body and soar to great romantic heights , when she became a woman like the heroines of Flora Annie Steel . When she got out of the bath and dried herself she regarded her face for a long time in the mirror , studying its lines and bumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , now that , attempting to imagine how she would have looked as a girl if she had done herself with a little more dash and had not had a nose that was too snub and too fleshy at the bridge , and if her chin had been firm instead of weak and her skin lovely and white instead of blotched and oily . And then as she dressed she allowed her mind to wander about the subject of Mr. Ransome , thinking that he was very good-looking and that she would have liked to have stayed behind at Mr. Jobnekar 's to talk to him . She liked his Scottish darkness and blue eyes , the leanness of his face and his nice manners . And the fact that he had a reputation for loose living and dissipation only made him the more exciting and opened up exciting vistas of mysterious things which she was unable even to imagine . And then she tried to think what it would have been like if she had never met Sarah and had perhaps married a nice dull little clerk ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family and a semi-detached villa with a back garden in Birmingham . Sarah had taken her away from all chance of that ; she had enveloped her in a web of devotion and protection , and then given her nothing in return , nothing that the hypotheticalclerk could have given her . And then all at once the music across the road stopped and outside it became swiftly dark , and the wave of independence and romance and bitterness left her as if she were a child 's toy balloon pricked by a pin . It was too late , too late ! There was nothing to do but go on and on with Sarah until the end of things . She would die and be buri . d here in this dreadful country where the earth was never cool and damp as at home but always hot and dusty . Remorse took possession of her and suddenly she began to hurry with her dressing so that she could havesupper ready and on the table before Sarah could recover herself and see to it . When she had dressed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Untouchable girls who worked for them after school hours , and when , fussily , she had seen to it that each dish was made to look as attractive as possible , she put on her mackintosh and went into the garden to gather a few sprigs of bougainvillea . Then she returned and going to the cupboard took out the best lace tablecloth she had worked , the one they only used once a year when the Maharani and her women came to tea . When she had reset the table she went to Miss Dirks ' door and knocked to let her know that supper was ready . When at last Miss Dirks came out her eyes were swollen and she looked tired and old , and for a moment terror struck at the vacillating heart of Miss Hodge . Only a moment earlier in the bathroom her mind , beyond her control , had been hovering about the idea of Sarah 's death and the freedom it would bring her , and now frightened she could only think , " What would I do if anything happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle of Miss Dirks and Miss Hodge and the contemplation of all that had gone into the making of their tragedy threw Ransome into one of the periods of melancholic reflection which attacked him from time to time like an illness ; and then on top of that he had been upset by the talk of Mr. Jobnekar about the work he was doing among his people . The little man , seated uncomfortably on a stiff chair out of politeness for his European guest , had talked long and eloquently after the departure of the schoolmistresses , his black eyes glittering all the while with excitement and hope . He had found a new man in Bombay , like most of the Untouchable leaders , a Christian . Each time he found a new worker it was , he said , like waking on a bright cool morning with the sun shining brilliantly . The new man was called Mr. Bikaru and he came from the United Provinces . " It 's spreading , " Mr. Jobnekar said with excitement . " It 's spreading all over India , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're beginning to get somewhere . You see , we 're organized now . That 's one of the things we 've learned from the West  --  organization , banking , evenX94 95things like engineering . By golly ! We 'll have all our own engineers beforevery long , to make steel and cotton mills and build dams . The British have taught us a great deal and lately we 've been learning from the Americans . We 're waking up . It has a huge body  --  India  --  and it takes a long time for it to waken . " " Do n't learn too much , " Ransome wanted to say , " or you 'll only destroyyourselves the way the Japanese are doing , " but he held his tongue in the face of Mr. Jobnekar 's faith and enthusiasm . It was the faith of men like Mr. Jobnekar and Raschid which he envied . They believed in something , in a marvelous , almost mystical future for which they might give their souls and their bodies . What was there to work for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? You could make money and pick up worldly honors but that was n't living . You could n't live without faith . You merely existed in a dull squalid fashion . Suddenly he took his pipe from his mouth and interrupted Mr. Jobnekar : " That 's what the enemies of Russia wo n't see . Faith ! They do n't see , or perhaps it 's beyond their understanding , that faith is more excitingthan silk stockings and the mass production of pins . . . that it 's the most exciting thing on earth , the only thing which makes life worth living . " What man or what people had faith in Europe ? Who was there that desired anything beyond middle-class security and a chance to make money ? No , the West was tired . There was no one , no man , no people , strong enough and young enough to make the effort . Feeling the old depression stealing over him , he rose and said , " I must go now . " For when he felt thus he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jobnekar came in with a garland of marigold and jasmine and put it over his head . The gesture touched him because he knew that he had been an unexpected guest and there had been no garland prepared . It pleased him too that Mrs. Jobnekar and her sisters made no attempt to become imitation Europeans . They had the integrity which must accompany faith . Ransome knew exactly the moment when he had been aware of the illness for the first time . It had come over him one evening in Flanders96a little after his twentieth birthday and two days before he was wounded for the second time . It was evening , a still blue evening in summer with a long fading twilight so different from the quick nightfall in Ranchipur , and he had been sitting on the ground with his back to the wall of a house which had been hit the night before , listening , with half his mind , as one always did , to the distant roar and crackle of the German shells that were reducing to dust , with systematic thoroughness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was full of thin Flemish beer and cheese and his whole body was relaxed and peaceful in the knowledge that he would have one more night of respite from the lines , for it had long since ceased to be exciting . Even to a boy of twenty it was only a dull horror . He had been thinking about the quiet green village of Nolliam and what his father and mother were doing , and wondering whether when the war was finished , if it ever was , he would go back there and take over one of the farms , or go up to Oxford for a while , or simply clear out for Canada or South Africa and find a new world where he could build up a life of his own , free of all the things he hated at home . And slowly through his daydreaming he became aware of the shrill sound of a fife , a perky , gallant sound , and turning his head , he saw coming down the street from the direction of Ypres a dozen companies of soldiers from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Belgian lines . They had been there for ten days or more and there was nothing strange about them ; he had seen them again and again . Only this time he seemed to see them with a kind of second sight , not as men , but as monkeys , a whole regiment of monkeys , but tragic without the grotesquerie and humor of monkeys . They marched toward him and then past him , half a regiment of men , none of them much over five feet tall , gnarled , hard , brave little fellows , but all rickety and twisted and deformed . Past him they went swinging along to the sound of the fife , rank after rank , and presently he was aware of a profound feeling of pity and affection for them . It seemed to him that he saw beneath the drab ill-fitting uniforms , beneath even the tough skins of the twisted undernourished little bodies , bleached by years of mines and factories , into the hearts and beyond even that , into the womb of time and what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw them born out of the smoke and filth of factories , out of the damp and blackness of mines , out of starvation and misery and strikes , the greed of mankind and the black sanctimonious hypocrisy of the nineteenth century . None of them had ever had a chance at life , nor their fathers and mothers for generation after generation beforethem , until at last they had emerged from the womb of time , whole regiments of men , small and wretched and deformed . In his half-dreamingstate their numbers seemed multiplied vaguely into thousands and millions coming not only out of the Black Midlands but out of France and Germany and America and Italy , from all the Western world , marching and marching , a cloud of men . For a moment in a kind of vision the whole dreary Flemish landscape , the low hills in the distance , the very sky itself seemed filled with marching men . And then as the sound of the fife died away he wakened , feeling sick and depressed , thinking , " I must be going balmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what he had dreamed was truth . All that night  --  that one precious night of peace  --  he had not slept at all , and the next morning he went back again to the lines filled with a sense of numbness and despair which made the discomfort and danger and misery seem no longer anything at all . And then two days later he had thrown himself forward at the head of his men to attempt a desperate thing and received a bullet in the thigh . And for that , months later , they gave him a decoration , never knowing that he had charged forward not because he was valiant and brave and full of faith in his action , but because he had hoped to be killed in order that he would no longer have to suffer that sense of shame for being a man , one billionth part of what was called " the Civilized West . " During convalescence the sense of depression clung to him , and when his father came to him proposing that he be transferred to a " cushy " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been twice wounded and given the V. C. , he surprised everyone by accepting . He was finished with the indiscriminate killing of men . He knew then that if ever he killed again he would know the man he killed and it would be for a reason . And then when the War had finished the neurasthenia did not go 98away . It remained , growing a little stronger each time it returned , so that there was no way for him to return to normal life and to find for himself a place in the civilization that was England . He tried a dozen things but each time he abandoned them in the end  --  business , a chance to go into the Foreign Office , a farm in Sussex . Each time it was the same story ; there would come a moment when he was overcome by apathy and disgust , a moment when it was no longer possible to apply himself or even to have any interest any longer in what he had undertaken . Always he was aware of the world outside himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness of a whole nation and a whole civilization ; and then he would plunge himself into dissipation and debauchery as if by doing so he could emerge once more , clean and fresh . For a little time it was effective , but he came presently to have the name of being vicious and undependable , a rake and waster , and then one day when he had wakened from a long bout with drink and women he sailed for America , from which his mother had come ; and since that time he had not seen England again . What he sought in America was a vague thing , which became clear to him only after he had married and spent years there . It was , he thought , something which came down to him in his blood , a heritage from his grandparents . He had run away from England partly because Europe had become insufferable and partly because he had hoped to find in America a country and a people that were less tired . Dimly he was aware of an impulse to return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which went back to his youth ; and always in his mind , what he sought was associated with the small energetic figure of his grandmother , not the Countess of Nolham but Mrs. " Ten percent " MacPherson ; and so he came at last to Grand River which was the only town that he really knew in America . She had left Grand River as a girl of seventeen to accompany her father to California to find gold and she had come back to Grand River after she had married MacPherson and was fabulously rich , to build herself a huge turreted house overlooking the Ohio River . There Ransome 's mother had been born and her brother , and there his grandmother had always returned , no matter what glamorous adventures or99what brilliant people she had encountered in New York and London and Paris . There she returned after her husband had served as Ambassadorto the Court of St. James ' , for Grand River and the huge turreted house she loved better than any place in the world . Long after she was dead Ransome thought of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never known during her lifetime , for she haddied on the day he was wounded the second time in Flanders when hewas still only a boy of twenty . And the older he grew , the more hesuffered , the more he came to understand her . He understood that she had had a simplicity and an integrity such as he had never encountered in any other person . It was her integrity that forced her always to return to Grand River where she knew everyone . That was her country . The people of Grand River were the people she knew and understood and loved . That was the world in which she felt at home , where she could barter with the tradesmen and call half the population by their Christian names , where she could , when the spirit moved her , take off her famous pearls , go down into her own vast kitchen and bake a cake or make pancakes which were better than the most expensive chef could create . Of all her grandchildren he had been her favorite , and because he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summerafter summer with her in the turreted house in Grand River , summerswhich were a mingling of delight and misery because he had there a freedom which he had never known in England and because he earned in the beginning the mockery of the other boys for his neat and elegant Eton accent . Long afterward he came to understand that his childhood had been extraordinary , divided as it was between an English public school and a thriving town in the Middle West . There were moments when it seemed to him ( during those bitter , clinical examinationswhich he made of himself ) that this experience lay at the root of all his later misery and defeatism and neurasthenia . It was in a way simply one shock and change after another , a kind of perpetual readjustmentwhich was too much for the stability of any child . It was like a childhood divided between a Manchu family and a Scottish Presbyterianhousehold . Because she had loved him she had spoiled him , and when old MacPhersondied she took him over as her own , talking to him sometimestooas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , telling him in the evenings when they dined alone in the huge ugly paneled dining room stories out of her extraordinary life . Sometimes they were stories of the Nevada mining town where she had run a boarding house for miners at the age of twenty , sleeping always with a revolver beneath her pillow ; and sometimes they were stories of the King or of ambassadors and prime ministers . She was eighty-two when she died and during the last summerhe spent with her , the very year the war began , she told him things she had not told him before , things which perhaps she had never told anyone . It was as if she was aware that she was dying and felt the necessity of confiding to him many things which otherwise might have been lost forever . Among them was the story of her marriage . When she was nineteen she had found herself alone in a small Nevada mining camp , her father dead in an accident , with no money at all and so , because she was a good cook , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pay . And among the miners there was a young fellow of Scottish descent from Pennsylvania , a big brawny good-looking young man who fell in love with her , and presently she fell in love with him too , so much in love that there was never any other man in her life . " It was a little place , " she said , " just fifty or sixty shacks on the side of a rocky canyon and there were only seven other women in the camp and none of them better than they should have been . If you 're lucky , my boy , you 'll fall in love in the same way with a girl who will be just as lucky if it happens to her , but it does n't happen very often . . . not to one person in ten thousand , so do n't hope for too much . There was n't any church in the place and there was n't any preacher nearer than Sacramentoand that was a good three hundred miles away , so we did n't wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw your grandfather as a young man , but no woman in her right senses would have sat about waiting . She 'd have been a fool if she had . . . . " And then she discovered that she was going to have a baby and suggested that after all they had better leave the mine for a month and go to Sacramento to be married . " He did n't want to go very much , " she said . " He had a strange feeling that if he kept on digging he was going to strike it rich . I guess he rot felt in his bones all the time that the gold was there . He kept putting me off and saying he 'd go next week or the week after but I was determinedI was going to be married before the baby was born . He was always like that . When he had something big on his mind , he let everything else slide until he got it done . That 's how he was successful in whatever he undertook . He would n't give in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he courted me . Well , a month passed and then another month and then a third and then I decided that the time had come to take affairs into my own hands , and so one morning I packed up everything and took my pistol and went to the mine . He was working there , finding traces of gold and excited because he knew there was more where it had come from . So I pointed the pistol at him and said , Jamie MacPherson , we 're going to go to Sacramento to be married ! ' At first he just looked at me as if he could n't believe what he saw was true , and then he sat down and began to laugh . I never saw a man laugh harder . He shook and shook and went on laughing until I said , Hurry up and get through with it and come down the hill and pack . ' So he came , still laughing , and packed up his things and we set out for Sacramento on two mules . It took us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with hardly any trail at all . And all the time I kept possessionof the gun and most of the time he kept laughing . Afterward he told me that he 'd never loved me so much as when I stood there pointing the pistol at him . He 'd never had any intention of not marrying me , and I knew that too , but I knew how he put things off . " Well , we got married and went back to the mine and pretty soon I had a son who was your Uncle Edward . He 's always been pretty tough and tenacious . He had to be , I guess , to stand all the jolting on that trip to Sacramento and back . And two days after he was born your grandfatherstruck the lode , and with a son and a million-dollar gold mine he was something to watch . I thought for a couple of days he was going to burst . " I guess your grandfather never regretted the marriage . It brought him luck and sometimes when he was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway I was in love with him all my life , just as much as I was in the beginning and I still am now . Sometimes in the night I wake up IO2and think about him and me and the days back there , and it 's almost as good as living them all over again . " As Ransome grew older , she became to him the most vivid figure in all his memory , far more vivid than his own mother , her daughter , for with the daughter 's generation the softening process had already begun . Ransome 's mother liked Europe better than Grand River . She married an Englishman , against the will of her mother , and slowly she lost what character she had and became merely the appendage of a tradition . She was dead now and there were moments when Ransome found it dilii ( ult to remember her very clearly  --  a pale woman who grew a little more sad each year , lost and rootless . In the end , just before her death , she chunk secretly . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River after the War to find his grandmother or to find what she had been and what she had stood for , but he never found her nor did he find any of the things she had been . He discovered that in a powerful fashion she had given her own color to the town ; his impression of the place had really always been an impression of the old lady herself . When he returned he found neither her simplicity , nor her sense of equality , nor her integrity and her downrightness . He found instead a town that was an imitation of Europe , a place in which there was no longer any simplicity and people were valued not for their character and their eccentricities , as they had been in her time , but for their money . And he found the same sickness that he found in Europe , the same weariness and recklessness , the same despair stifled by drink , the same misery among the working people . In a city a little over a hundred years old he discovered the maladies of cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some ways it seemed to him worse than the old cities , for it was senility imposed upon adolescence and so it became grotesque and exaggerated and sometimesterrifying . He found no faith here either save in the automobile factory and the stock market . And insanely he married . Now in Ranchipur , years afterward , there were moments when it seemed to him that his marriage had never happened at all , so dim and so unimportant had it become . But he knew that he had married partly103because Mary Carstairs had caught his fancy for a little time and partly because he had wanted to settle himself into Grand River to rediscover that lost world which had been his grandmother 's . He took his wife to live in the old turreted house , closed and empty since the death of old Mrs. MacPherson . He did his best but it did not work . He knew afterward that it could never have succeeded and that the fault was his , because he remained forever a stray and an outcast in the community to which his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically , he saw her clearly in all her superficiality , her cultural shallowness , her snobbery , her trivial ambitions , her reckless barbarity . He had deceived himself for a little time but the deception could not have lasted ; and she in the end found him a tedious prig who would not take her to England , to the world that was his by right and which she found , from a great distance , so glamorous . And so one day he had quietly gone away and she divorced him . It was all as if it had never happened . And almost at once she married the son of the president of the automobile factory , and now she lived , not in the old turreted house which was pulled down , but in an imitation French chateau furnished by decorators from New York . From Grand River he had gone into the Far West to the country where his grandparents had been married . He had expected to find a new country but he found that it was already old and not very different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big of frontiers and democracy but these things , he discovered , no longer existed in reality . In two or three generations the things they boasted of were gone forever , as if they had never existed ; and a little way from the town where his grandmother had kept a boarding house he found coal mines where starving miners and their wives and children were shot down by gangsters imported from the East and paid by a pious Baptist who had so many millions that he gave them away wholesale , not to the starving miners who did an honest day 's work , but to charities and good works which might gloss over the greed and hypocrisy and dishonesty upon which the vast fortune was built . Now and then , here and there , Ransome had found a single old man or old woman who had known that vanished world which had existed for so short a time , never in Europe but only in the West of America. 104 JBut their point of view , their very manners were regarded as obsolete and eccentric and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicityhe found in them might have grown something splendid and wonderful . That was why he had loved Aunt Phoebe Smiley the moment he saw her in Ranchipur , that and because she made him think of his grandmother . In his heart he knew that he was more American than English and that in spite of everything he had always been a stranger in England , rebelling against rigid formulas of living , economic inequalities and the system of caste which at moments seemed to him as uncompromising as the system he found in India . He was not European at all but neither was he a good American , accepting the American faith in panaceas , or deceiving himself as Americans did . Nor did he accept its worship and awe of success and wealth . He was neither one thing nor the other but only , as he knew bitterlyin his heart , a dated and useless liberal in a sick world which demandedviolence and ruthlessness and revolution to set it right -- a disappointed idealist , solitary and bitter toward his fellow men because they were greedy and hypocritical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , slowly and grudgingly , to the knowledge that he himself was useless , paralyzed by his own dark pessimism , as useless even as the holy sadus sitting naked on the steps at Benares . In Ranchipur he had found peace for a little time . In Ranchipur he had come dangerouly near to accepting that death in life which the Hindus offered , but in time that temptation had passed and now the danger was gone . He had been saved , he knew , because out of his own bitterness and despair he had discovered what it was to hate ; and out of that , he was aware , strength might come , for in his time hate and violence were the only means by which the great sickness might be cured . It was Raschid 's capacity for hate which attracted Ransome to him in the beginning , for the big Muslim came of a race and a faith which had never placed faith in gentleness and nonresistance . Its hate , its zeal for reform had never degenerated like that of Christianity into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith looked upon greed and hypocrisy and knavery as infinitely greater crimes 105than adultery or polygamy or perversion . The Christian church , thought Ransome , having profited again and again by crimes against humanity , now overlooked them in its morbid concern over sex . Raschid had faith , he had power . He was the new Islam , yet he was as old as Mohammed . He himself had no faith , for there was none in the Christian world . But he was beginning to know hate , and through hate he might be saved . On his way home he went around by the music school . Once he was rid of Mr. Das he would listen to the music alone , for the singers never addressed him . It was Jemnaz Singh and his two apprentices who again played and sang for him , and this time there was no lightning and no thunder . Outside the rain fell with a faint steady roar , destroying at last even the violence of the wind , and against the accompaniment of the rain Jemnaz Singh , exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atchcan , sang a song of thanksgiving to Krishna for the deliverance from drought and famine . It was an ancient song , thousands of years old , of which Ransome understood scarcely a word since Jemnaz Singh sang in the tongue of the Rajput warriors , but while he listened peace began to come once more into his spirit , for there was something eternal in the song which said , " Nations come and go . Kings rise and fall . Millionaires come into being and are destroyed overnight , but we , the Earth and the people , go on forever . " It was dark when he left the music school still wearing the garland of marigold and jasmine . The spectacle of a European man garlanded with flowers driving a five-year-old Buick through the monsoon rains did not strike him as ridiculous . Once the newness wore off , once you had ceased to be merely a tourist , there was nothing ridiculous in all of India . It was so ancient , so vast , it sheltered grudgingly so many peoples , so many faiths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed up in an indiscriminate fashion , as the Hindu faith quietly swallowed up Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha . At the smaller bridge near the zoo he was forced to stop and wait while one of the Maharajah 's great Rolls-Royces , spattered with red mud , rolled heavily across it . Inside , sitting rather like wax works beneath the top light , sat two people , a pretty blonde woman of no age at all and a heavy blond man with a purple face . The woman stared at the old robBuick as they passed without even changing her expression . The man took no notice but kept on making notes on a folded bit of paper . Ransome thought , " It 's the Eskeths . They 've been taken to visit the waterworks . " He would not have recognized her if he had not known that it could have been no one else . It was not that she had changed greatly but that the face he saw was a dead face , like a mask made with great realistic skill . The perfectly done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white silk was too perfect and too unspoiled to be worn by any woman in the midst of an Indian monsoon . Not knowing that he was in Ranchipur , she could scarcely have recognized him in the man driving the sunburnt old Buick with a garland of marigolds round his neck . Perhaps she would not even remember him . A good deal had happened to them both since they last saw each other . " She is , " he thought , " exactly as I knew she would be . " Thinking of her , he stalled the old car when he attempted to start it , and once it was stopped he made no effort to restart the motor but stayed there for a long time near the cast-iron statue of Queen Victoria carrying an umbrella and a reticule . The river was no longer a still green canal , reflecting a mosaic of stars ; it was moving now , yellow and turbulent , lapping higher and higher against the low flat steps which led from the water up to the jewel-box shrine of Krishna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Presently , step by step , it would rise to the level of the road and of Krishna 's temple , until you could hear its roaring all through the damp hot nights . There was a story that once , long ago , during the rule of the wicked Maharajahs , the river had not stopped at the level of the road but had risen and risen until the temple of Krishna was drowned , and the roaring water , bearing trees and dead beasts and men , had swept over the whole city of Ranchipur . It must have been , he thought , a splendid and savage spectacle  --  that of an angry Nature destroying what the puny hands of man had raised . And afterward there had been famine and pestilence and death . He regarded the dumpy statue of the Queen and thought , " If that happenedagain the good Queen , the housekeeper of a whole empire , would be drowned like the temple of Krishna . " But it could n't happen again , for the Maharajah , fearing such a dis- 107aster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river and left it moving quietly through the center of the town , like a cobra crossingthe garden path . Dreamily he fell to thinking of Edwina and of himself as they had been long ago , just after the War , and the thought of them as they were then made him feel suddenly sad and immensely old . He had always liked her and for a time he had been in love with her , and looking back now from a great distance it seemed to him that perhaps if their lives and their ancestry and the time in which they lived had been different , they might have loved each other profoundly and been married and found the stability which neither of them had ever found . But he knew that with his strange spells of melancholia and debauchery he would have made a wretched husband , and that she with her upbringing and giddinessand lack of any moral sense would have made any man a dreadful wife . How could they have been faithful to each other when there was nothing in life in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without scruple or remorse , and then suddenly they had become bored and the whole thing had come to an end , leaving them the best of friends , with so little interest in the adventure that , so far as he could remember , they had never spoken of it again . And now , thinking of it , it seemed to him that they had scarcely ever been alone . Always they had gone about in crowds as if solitude held some terror for them . It was Edwina and her sort  --  his own sort for that matter  --  who had driven him in the end from England and from Europe . The sick ones ... but no sicker than all the rest , the millionaires , the politicians , the bankers ... . " We were the bright young people , " he thought . " We were the first of Modern Youth . And now look at the God-damned thing . " Gradually the sound and the sight of the yellow rushing water in the wet twilight seemed to hypnotize him , and he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge into the wild stream and never be seen again . No one would ever find your body ; the crocodiles would see to that . This was the time to do it ; in a day or two , if the rains held , it would be full of snakes and floating- deb'ris and even the bodies of those animals who had escaped the vultures and the jackals only to be devoured by the crocodiles . It was the first time for months that the idea of suicide , io8 once continually with him , had returned . It would be easy and rather magnificent to slip over the edge and disappear . Certainly no one at home would miss him  --  neither Mary safe in the security of her Grand River French chateau , his brothers nor his father . Very few would miss him here in Ranchipur . Perhaps Raschid and the Smilcys and Mr. Jobnekar , perhaps even the Maharajah . But after a week or two his death would make very little difference even to them , for he was iii no way a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Raschid and Mr. Jobnekar were necessary to the future of India and the Smileys , whose death would leave half the poor and wretched of Ranchipur bereft and lost . No , logically , there was no reason why he should not destroy himself , save that he no longer wanted to do it . Through the mist of his thoughts and the roar of the river he was aware of the sound of little silver bells and the clop-clop of horses ' hoofs , and then a tonga passed him and a hearty voice shouted a greeting . Still at a trot , the tonga rattled across the bridge into the gathering darkness and rain , but by its lights he could see that it was a gay little tonga painted bright red and decorated with bits of looking glass . And the voice and the great figure huddled beneath the too low roof he recognized as that of Raschid  --  Raschid the Saracen , the Warrior , born too late and too soon , driving home from his office to his wife and his seven handsome children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Queen Victoria , feeling suddenly cheerful again . At home he found that John the Baptist and his friends had replaced the tiles the monkeys had thrown from the roof of the shed and were huddled inside , gossiping and playing the flute . In the house he found two notes . One was from Mr. Bannerjee asking him to dinner on Thursday to meet Lord and Lady Esketh . The other bore the Maharajah 's turban , star and scimitar and was a summons to the palace to dine there with the same distinguished visitors . As he finishedreading them darkness came down outside in the garden , suddenly , like a curtain . Switching on the lights he noticed that mildew had alreadyformed on the wall of the dining room . For a moment he fancied that the river had already begun to roar and that he could hear it . Against the faint sound came the thread of music from John the Baptist 's flute . For a long time he stood quite still listening , as if to catch still109another sound , fainter than the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the sound of things growing , of roots thrusting , of buds bursting , of vines writhing with vitality  --  the sound of a whole vast continent come to life with the rains . It was the last dinner of ceremony at the palace until the monsoon was over and important people began once more to circulate back and forth in dusty trains across the burnt red plains of India , not humble people like the Smileys and Aunt Phoebe and " Dirks and Hodge , " or even people like Mr. Jobnekar and Raschid Ali Khan  --  for they never went to hill stations where it was cool , high above the clouds which flooded the plains  --  but viceroys and millionaires , and generals and maharajahs , and people like Lord and Lady Esketh . No dinner of ceremony would have been held so late in the year save for the untimely visit of the Eskeths and the request of His Highness ' friend , the Viceroy , that they be entertainedsplendidly . No one expected to find much enjoyment in it , neither the Maharajah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raschid whose own vitality made almost everything seem enjoyable , but least of all the old Maharani and Lady Esketh . For Her Highness it meant that she would have to be magnificent and a little pompous and polite all evening , and long ago she had ceased to find pleasure in any of these things . For Lady Esketh it meant nothing at all , for even that first faint curiosity about the bizarre magnificence of India was satiated now . The person to whom it brought the greatest enjoyment was one who was not invited at all . This was Miss Hodge . At seven-thirty she was already seated on the verandah of the bungalow opposite the great palace gateway , her face a little flushed with excitement , embroidering and waiting for the first vehicle to arrive . A little earlier in the evening she had been upset again by the sound of the wild military music and there had been another stifled incoherent scene with Miss Dirks over leaving the gate of the front garden open so that she might see the guests as they arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , that it would be too dark to recognize any of the guests , but this argument had no weight with Miss Hodge ; she knew every vehicle from the tonga which Mr. Jobnekar hired by the month to the purple Rolls-Royce which was used by im-I IOportant guests like the Eskeths , and she could imagine the people inside . This time the strange unsatisfactory quarrel had ended without a climax , without tears or reconciliations , leaving behind it a sense of incompletenessand misery . Seated on the verandah , Miss Hodge was taking a superior attitude and trying to forget it all , but somehow she could not and her heart there was a sense of shamed triumph . Again she had  --  V ( m a v it ton ; the garden gate was open so that she had a clear view of the palace di iveway . She kept talking to herself about Miss Dirks , not audibly , fur bliss Dirks sat just inside the window , but with such fervor that her lips moved to form the words without her knowing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the gate closed so that no passerby could look into the garden . It was an exaggerated neurotic feeling . You 'd think , instead of asking simply to have the gate open , you 'd asked her to walk naked a ( loss the great square by the cinema . It was perfectly ridiculous , Miss I lodge told herself , and morbid and showed no sense of proportion . If there . had been any reasonable objection she would have yielded without a word . Sarah certainly knew that she scarcely ever disagreed with her . But this time surely she was in the right . That was why , after they had quarreled , she simply walked out of the house down the path and opened the gate . Sarah could have gone out and closed it again , but she would only have opened it once more . She could not allow herself to be forever browbeatenby Sarah . Now and then she had to assert herself . But Sarah had n't closed it . She had simply looked at Elizabeth as she re-entered the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she was taking her revenge by being tired and dignified , perfectly polite but cold , so that if Elizabeth attempted to begin a conversation it would die almost at once , chilled and frostbitten by the tone of Sarah 's voice . Nevertheless Miss Hodge was glad she had asserted herself . It brought her a sense of excitement and palpitation . Ever since she had walked down the path and opened the gate her heart had been beating too rapidly and her cheeks had been hot . Opposite her beyond the gateway the huge mass of the palace , glitteringnow with lights , rose black against the stormy sky . For a moment IIIthe rain had ceased and the wind fallen and here and there you could see little patches spangled with stars between the broken flying clouds . In the covered gateway two of the Maharajah 's horse guards , turbaned and dressed in scarlet and gold , sat their black horses silent , immobile , their lances , carrying the purple and gold pennons of His Highness , pointing straight upward , as motionless as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who never shaved , and now on duty they wore their long black beards neatly folded into little nets beneath their chins . For twenty-five years Miss Hodge had seen them there , day in and day out , and she never quite come to take for granted their lean straight bodies , the proud narrow-nosed faces , the handsome tunics of scarlet and gold . They were men , beautiful men , fierce and bearded , who lived on horses , and all that was too much for Miss Hodge 's romantic nature . She had no idea why they fascinated her , and because she was a little ashamed of the stormy feelings they roused in her she never attempted to discover what or why it was . It was a muddled emotion , partly literary by way of Flora Annie Steel and partly mere glandular reaction . Sometimes , when Miss Dirks was out of the room , she would stand at an upper window , push back the curtains and look at the Sikhs . Each time she peeped she felt faintly excited , her heart beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly like taking a drug , and like taking drugs the peeping had become a habit and a necessity . Slowly she had come to know the Sikhs apart , although they were all of a type  --  lean , hawkfacedand tall . She had never even heard their names , but as time went on she invented names for them herself , good English names because she had never heard any Sikh names . She had her favorites . They were called John , Geoffrey , William , Herbert and Cecil . Some of them she had seen grow from boys into middle-aged men . Now and then one would fail to appear and never be seen again . Occasionally there were new ones , whom she would study carefully each time they came on duty , giving them each a fair chance until she had rejected them or listed them among her favorites . Cecil had been the favorite of favorites , and when he left the regiment to go back again to the North she experienced for weeks afterward a sense of depression each time she looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on a holiday and would return , but he never did . She had not even any way of discovering what had become of him . While she watched the two horsemen standing beneath the great lanterns of pierced copper , the guests began to arrive . She recognized the great form of Raschid Ali Khan huddled in the gay little tonga ornamentedwith bits of looking-glass , and Mrs. Raschid all in white , sitting beside him ; and she knew the Dewan 's old-fashioned French motor , and Ransome 's five-year-old Buick which had belonged to Monsieur Descans , the Swiss engineer , and Major Safti 's mud-spattered Ford , and the Packard which she thought must contain the General , and the baby Austin driven by Mr. Banncrjee with his handsome wife at his side , and presently , with a sudden excitement , the lumbering purple RollsRoycewith Lord and Lady Esketh inside . The light inside the car was turned on and so she had a glimpse of them , the famous millionaire peer and his fashionable wife . She knew all about them . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " bright young people , " and at one time a great friend of the Prince of Wales , for she kept up on her news of Court and Society . She knew every birth and death in the " Morning Post " which arrived in Ranchipur a month or two after it had been printed , in a world which she had never seen and among people she would never know . Last of all came Mr. and Mrs. Jobnekar clopping along in their hired tonga . Then after waiting a long time she turned and said , " That seems to be all the party , Sarah  --  the Eskeths , Mr. Ransome , the Raschids , the Bannerjees and the Jobnekars . " There was no answer from Miss Dirks and Miss Hodge thought , " Oh , so she 's not going to speak to me ? That 's carrying things a bit far . " When she turned to look she saw that Miss Dirks was sitting with her eyes closed . Her book on new methods of teaching algebra had fallen into her lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frightened , Miss Hodge jumped up and called out , " Sarah ! Sarah ! " Miss Dirks opened her eyes and seemed to come back from a great distance . " Yes , Elizabeth , I 'm sorry . I was thinking . " 113 cause the gesture wiped out a little her shame for the childishness of her friend . The palace was an immense structure set clown in the midst of a vast park laid out long ago in an attempt to imitate the lushness and the well-ordered disarray of a great English estate . Turrets and domes and spires rose without restraint or balance from a great mass of galleries , arches and balconies in a style which included something of North Africa , something of Persia and something of India . If you saw it first by daylight it struck you , if you were a European , as a kind of architecturalnightmare ; if you saw it by night with the stars overhead itr the blue Indian sky and all the lights glittering in the hundreds of windows , it was a fabulous and enchanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all the hardness of brick and stone melted away into shadows , its huge bulk rose above the trees on moonlit nights like the magical city in the " Tale of the Fisherman . " The park itself , with banyans and mangoes and eucalyptus trees and palms taking the place of the elms and oaks and cedars of an English park , was no less fantastic than the palace . In the beginning the Scotch gardener employed by the Maharani had tried , stubbornly and with heroism , to make English plants and shrubs and trees grow in the reddishheavy soil , but in the end India would have none of them and one by one they shriveled and died beneath the burning sun . Even the little lake had a bottom of cement so that the precious water would not seep away during the dry season , and it raised toward the brazen sky , not the cool pellucid surface of an English pond bordered by sedges and flags , but a face that was pallid and dead and green and faintly streaked by the oil spread on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year like this one , when the monsoon came late and water became more precious than wine , the little pond was allowed to evaporate altogether , leaving a shallow shell of cement , the ugliest travesty of a lake , with the gawdy little pleasure boats stranded here and there beneath the the presence of galloping troupes of sacred monkeys , but slowly , as he ceased to be a tourist and began a little to " You 're not feeling well ? " " Yes , I 'm all right . Just tired , that 's all . " She sat up straight and picked up her book . " I 'll make you a cup of tea , " said Miss Hodge . " Do n't bother . " " Yes , I will . You ca n't stop me . " And she went off to the kitchen to heat the water , trembling and filled with remorse , ashamed of her petty victory over the open gate , wanting to make amends , to apologize , to regain the ground which had been lost between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thinking , with her eyes closed , fighting pain . It had grown worse of late and now for a long time she knew that there was no use any longer in combating it by power of will or in pretending that it did not exist . It was there all the time , now withdrawinga little way , now returning to attack her with savagery . She no longer believed , even in moments when it withdrew a little , hat it would pass away presently and leave her well again and strong . She had known perfectly well for weeks now that she should have gone to a doctor long ago , but in all Ranchipur there was not a doctor who would understand such things save Major Safti , and she could not face the ordeal of undressingand being pawed over by a doctor who was not only a man but an Indian and young and good-looking . She might have gone to Bombaybut in Bombay there were only men doctors , and after all , in the whole of India and the East , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not face it . The very thought of it made her feel ill . She would rather die first . The pain was bad enough but she could have borne that alone , as she had borne many things in her life which were worse , but she was tired too and troubled and frightened and there was no one that she could go to , no one she could tell about it , least of all Elizabeth , who would grow silly and hysterical and make it all the worse by fussing and showeringher with unwanted little attentions that would never allow her to forget the pain , even when it went away for a little time . In a little while Miss Hodge returned with the tea . It did nothing to ease the awful gnawing pain but it made Miss Dirks a little happier be-114 11 H5know India , he came to understand that the fantastic palace was not only exactly right but that it was a triumph of architecture . It had none of that distressing , lonely , barren look which his own Belgrave Square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgian facade beneath a tangle of flowering shrubs and vines ; nor did it give the effect of the government buildings in Delhi , constructed in the hope of impressingIndia and succeeding only in looking like Regent Street set down amid the magnificent ruins of the Mogul Empire . The palace belonged there , in India , with all its fantasy and extravagance and disorder , as if it had been born of India herself out of an excess of vitality . It was as right as if , like the mango and banyan trees that replaced the dead oaks and elms , it had grown out of the very soil of the country . If you had planted a bit of the seed from which Indian palaces grow in the reddish heavy soil , surely this fantastic structure would have sprung up , a giant among palaces . Presently Ransome discovered that not only was it right ; it was beautiful . It had been built against the heat and so the doors and windows were enormous and the ceilings high , and distributed through the center of it there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water trickled in fountains all day and all night . Arica palms pushed their way upward through orchids and hanging vines toward the light that fell from above the open marble galleries , and in the center of each there was a marble basin where goldfish swam above flowers made of jade and chrysoprase and other semi-precious stones in designs taken from the old Mogul palaces at Agra and Fatepur-Sikri . High up , in gilt cages , hanging from the arica palms there were myriads of birds , the extravagantly colored birds of India , and above them suspended from the marble eaves there were great nests of Indian bees , living perpetually in one gigantic swarm , crawling over and over one another , until presently one by one they died and were replaced by those which had hatched in the center of the swarm . In all Ranchipur there was no refuge so cool as these damp shaded gardens , open at night to the sky , where the brazen sun never entered . All about the open courts clustered the rooms of the palace  --  on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their entourage , below stairs big rooms which were useless and empty save I16for a strange conglomeration of furniture and objets d'art . They were like vast warehouses in which furniture had been thrust away without plan or discrimination , and so cabinets and embroideries and vases of marvelous and lovely workmanship , brought long ago out of the old deserted palace of the wicked Maharajah , found themselves standing side by side with atrocious bits of art moderne . Paintings of the Munich school hung above priceless bowls and vases of jade and agate and pink quartz collected by the Maharani ; Persian tapestries from the time of Abkar ornamented walls opposite windows adorned with Nottingham lace . Some of the horrors the Maharani had bought herself long ago when she first went to Europe to the great expositions which were held to exploit the horrors turned out by machines ; the complicated slickness of the objects had impressed her , but later when she grew used to Europe and her own taste came to assert itself she knew that nearly everything she had bought was a horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the overflow of palace treasures , in these big desertedrooms where no one ever came . Some of them had come to her as gifts from Edwardian visitors and from Indian societies whose causes either she or the Maharajah had helped at one time or another . In the far end of the great hallway , which ran the whole length of the palace , there was a room where the gentlemenwho came to dinner left their hats and in the corner of it was a group of objects which never failed to arouse Ransome 's mirth . It contained a Landseer of two bloodhounds and a terrier , a magnificent Chinese god in bronze , an elaborate modern statue of Psyche in alabasterprobably purchased from a peddler in the street in Naples , and a Mogul prayer rug of the most exquisite design and color . One by one the guests arrived , coming up the great staircase of white marble into a room that was all blue , the color of Indian night , with the Maharani 's famous collection of Mogul paintings set into the walls among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which overlookedthe park with a view of Mount Abana in the distance , and across the great windows were hung nettings of white cord to keep out the giant bats and defeat the curiosity of the sacred monkeys . From the centerH7 1of the room hung a huge chandelier of crystal , blazing with light and filled with thousands of bees . Just beneath it the rulers of Ranchipur stood to receive their guests . The Maharani wore a sari of white bordered with silver , Mahratta fashion , with a giant fish-tail train which passed between her tiny feet and swept behind her as she walked . And she wore no jewels but emeralds  --  emeraldsin her ears and about her throat , on her wrists and fingers and even on her toes , emeralds collected here and there throughout the world to satisfy her passion for jewels , from Fifth Avenue and Bond Street and the Place Vendome , from Moscow and Jaipur and Peking . Tonight she was not the spirited old lady who played poker like a professionalgambler in a mining camp  --  shrewd , witty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the depths of her nature , still half-savage , who was a great queen . She was a small person , made with the delicacy and perfection of a Tanagra , yet now she gave the illusion of stature and majesty . She carried herself erect with the sureness and poise of a woman who has never known the tottering heels of fashionable Parisian bootmakers . Ransome , regarding her from the doorway as she stood in the blaze of light from the bee-filled chandelier , thought again , " The last queen . " In the West it was the fashion of queens to be as nearly as possible like middle-class housewives . In that lay their last security . The ancient Dewan was already there and Raschid and his dark modest little wife and Mr. Bannerjee and the cold and beautiful Mrs. Bannerjee , and the Maharajah himself , looking old and tired and full of dignity , all in white with a single great diamond , set round with emeralds , blazingin his scarlet Ranchipur turban . And there were staff officers and aides-de-camp and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of all the group it was Mrs. Bannerjee who caught his attention . She was standing against the wall beside one of the great windows netted against the giant bats , very still and aloof and beautiful like a woman out of one of the miniatures which adorned the wall . She was tall for an Indian woman and very fair-skinned and there was an air of insolence and contempt about her which was at once provocative and irritating , and an air of stillness and indifference which permitted her to dominate any room. 118 jFor a long time she had fascinated Ransome far more than any woman he had encountered in India , and it had happened without the faintest effort on her part . To his weariness it was not only her beauty which held an appeal ; her aloofness , her air of detachment , as if she endured life without enjoying it , stirred his curiosity . It was as if she were always just beyond his reach , mocking him , a new adventure , something he had never before experienced . Falling in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too strange to one another and would , he knew , always remain so no matter how profound a physical intimacy they might know . One might as well have hoped to fall in love with a beautiful statue made of ice , yet the sight of her always excited him , raising a kind of perverse passion to conquer her , to humiliate her , to violate her and bring her pride to earth . He knew well enough that this would be an exciting thing but how it could be accomplished he had not the slightest idea . Again and again he had tried to discover some approach to that glacial summit upon which she appeared to have her existence . He had talked of the Swadeshi movement in which she displayed an interest ; he had tried talking of philosophy and love and of the animals  --  the Pekinese dogs , the parrots , the ibises , the cranes and the honey bear  --  which she kept in her garden , searching for something which might interest this childless beautiful woman ; but it never led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the conviction that in everything  --  in thought , in feeling , in background and in emotion  --  there was no way of reaching her . Sometimes he thought , " She is India . One day when India is reborn she will come alive " ; but that awakening was , he knew , something which neither of them would ever see because they would both be dead before it happened . And sometimes when he was alone and had been drinking he would think , " She is really nothing at all . She is simply beautiful and lazy and stupid . " She never spoke save to answer a question and she was never made uneasy by long silences as Western women were . She would sit watching and listening or drifting off into some realm of meditation beyond the comprehension of the others , indifferent , outwardly bored and yet somehowmore complete than anyone else in the room . There were moments when the steady level gaze of the black eyes grew disconcerting , as if , by her mere presence , she had the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her , and render them trivial and idiotic . Tonight when she found Ransome staring at her she looked at him for a moment beneath her long lashes , inclined her head in an arrogant gesture of recognition , and seating herself on a divan took out a neatly rolled pan of lime and betel leaf from a box of jade and began to chew . In most Indian women there was for Ransome something cowlike in their taste for pan , but with Mrs. Bannerjee it was quite different . Watchingher he was aware again of the old excitement which always made him feel hot and a little suffocated . He thought , " She hates me because I am not an Indian . " And then across the room , among all the brilliant clothes , he saw the Eskeths come in . His Lordship , stifling in a swallow-tailed coat , looked bleary and purple and rather like a peevish bull . Beside him his wife appeared incredibly fragile and pale . Then for the first time in nearly fifteen years Ransome really saw her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead of emeralds she wore against the white of her gown a mixture of diamonds and emeralds and rubies , very nearly as magnificent as the jewels of the Indian queen . Against the deep blue of the wall , beneath the blaze of brilliant uncompromisinglight from the crystal chandelier , she was all white and pale gold , as beautiful as Mrs. Bannerjee but in a fashion as different as it was possible to be . With the Indian woman one had intimations of fire , sullen and smoldering somewhere beneath the ice , but with Edwina Esketh one divined almost at once that if there had ever been any fire it was extinguished now forever . It was her boredom which struck you almost immediately  --  a certain deadness of reaction to everything and everyone about her , as if she had experienced too much so that nothing , save perhaps jewels and clothes , had any longer any power to stir her . When she smiled at the Maharani it was a tired smile full of sadness , but without self-pity . It was a smile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so kind to us . I do n't know what we should have done otherwise " ; and the voice was curiously tired and flat . The Maharani laughed , a full throaty laugh : " It 's nothing . We 're pleased to do anything we can for a friend of the Viceroy . " There was 120lire in her dark eyes and vitality in her voice , and Ransome thought , " She 's twice Edwina 's age but she 's the younger of the two . " Even when Edwina spoke it was as if she spoke automatically , with a perfect grace and politeness and even a charm that was a little threadbareand worn because it had been used so many times , for so many centuries . There were moments when the weariness became almost an insult . Then she turned and saw Ransome , regarding him for a moment blankly and then with growing interest as slowly she understood that this was a face out of her past which she had once known very well . For a moment she came almost alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody told me about a person called Ransome who was living in Ranchipur but I never dreamed it was you . " " I wondered if you were going to remember me . " " It 's been a long time  --  seven or eight years . " " A good many more than ten . " She laughed , " And now we 're all middle-aged . " " Not quite , but very nearly . " For a moment she seemed to brighten , as if suddenly the sight of someoneout of her old world had set her heart to beating more rapidly . It had been a small and intimate world , gay and wild and sometimes despairing , but small at least and friendly , without these hordes of strange and boring and important people whom she had seen since she married Esketh , day after day , for a moment or two and then never again . " What are you doing here ? " For a moment he hesitated . No one had ever asked him that question before and now in a moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing in particular ; a little painting , a little drinking , a little messing about . " " It does n't sound very exciting . " " It is n't . " " You must meet Albert . " " I met him once or twice long ago when I thought I was going to become a great business man . He probably does n't remember me . " Lord Esketh did not remember him , but then it was his habit to remember only the people whom he might use or from whom he might 121 gain something , a little group which each year grew smaller until now it contained only a handful of bankers , the royal family , a quite large group of unscrupulous politicians and two or three men more powerful than himself , whom he respected because they had made greater fortunes than his own . To anyone save those few , he no longer troubled even to be civil . If you were not among them you felt that he gave even the time to say " How d' you do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed too closely for his dignity and comfort by Mr. and Mrs. Jobnekar , the Untouchables , looking rather like a pair of bright-eyed mice . He had met Lord Esketh before and they did not care for each other , since neither yielded anything to the vanity and egotism of the other . " They 're both preposterous , " thought Ransome . " But the one is evil and dangerous . The General is a little like the Great Auk . The Empire is built . They do n't need him any more , and now they 're leaving it to Esketh to destroy it . The " small " white dining room to which the guests were led was an immense room with great arched windows on two sides like the window of the blue room , covered with nettings in which a great bat entangled itself now and then to struggle and squeak until it was freed by one of the servants . On one side the windows opened into one of the courtyards from which the sound of falling water rose among the betel palms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park and distantly of the great tank and the square with the cinema on one side and the sinister old palace on the other . The rain had stopped now for a time and the lights of the square were swimming in the tank . The dinner was Indian because Esketh had requested it , a dinner typical of Ranchipur , with its famous curry of crayfish , sugared guavas and hearts of palm ; in the distance on the roof of another wing of the palace there was an orchestra , organized by the Maharani herself in defiance of the tradition which allowed musicians to play only in groups of two or three . There were thirty musicians in it playing lutes and drums , Indian violins and flutes , even bowls of soapstone tuned by lowering and raising the level of the water in them , and the lowly melodeon which had come to India long ago with the missionaries to accompany 122 the singing of hymns and had long since become the traditional Indian instrument for dancing girls and for playing hymns to Shiva and Krishna . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the palace , distantly , into the white marble dining worn . Ransome found himself between Mrs. Bannerjec and Mrs. Jobnekar so that he sat diagonally across from Edwina Esketh and the old Maharajah . The nearness of Mrs. Bannerjee stirred him faintly but lie had no more success with her than he had ever had . She was silent , eating elegantly and rather greedily , taking no notice of the party , her lovely Ik.uuls dipped now into the rice , now into the sauce of the curried crayfish , now into a sweetish dish made of coconut . Mrs. Jobnekar was pleasant and chatty but with Mrs. Bannerjee beside him and Edwina across the table he found his mind wandering away from her , so that sometimes when she asked him a question he had to rouse himself violently to give an intelligent answer . About the middle of the dinner he became aware that Edwina was watching him now and then , stealthily , speculatively , and that when he glanced in her direction she turned back at once to the Maharajah . Remembering back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been when she came down to the farm in Sussex . Then she had had the same porcelain white and gold beauty , but she had been alive , with a wild , hysterical kind of life , as if she felt that there was not enough time to encompass all the excitement , the adventure , the love there was to be had . And he thought again , " She is just what I imagined she would be . " That was her tragedy and his own  --  that they had both burned the candle at both ends for too long . Now on the verge of middle age , there was nothing left to burn . They had been greedy for experience and cold-blooded , and at the same time ( an odd combination ) they had been both disillusioned and foolish . There had never been any romance in anything they did , and he was aware now , when it was much too late , that neither of them had ever known what love was like because without romance , without sentiment , there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensual desire too quickly satisfied . To love , to make love endure , one had to be a little drugged by something which perhaps had no existence in reality . Either by nature you took willingly to the drug or you used it deliberately , hypnotizing yourself , the way you might work yourself up on a1 123night like this with the wild barbaric music in the distance and the sound of the water falling among the arica palms and the squeaking of the bats which entangled themselves in the nettings . He thought , bitterly , " We 've had no luck , Edwina and I. We had all the romance , all the sentimentality knocked the hell out of us before we ever began . " He had never thought of it before but now he saw himself from a great distance as he had come back from the War , bitter and unhappy , greedy for women and pleasure and experience , as if somehow he had had to make up for what he had lost during the three best and most romantic years of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could blame you for trying to get back what belonged to you , snatching pleasure and experience wherever you found it , in whatever form , with that old hysteria always inside of you , that feeling that life was too short and that you might have only another hour or two to live . The old ones had never known what it was and the young ones would never know . But he knew and Edwina knew . The wounds in his thigh and in his back were nothing ; the flesh grew again somehow making itself whole . But the spirit was different ; somewhere in some book he had read long ago something which came back to him now : Duns la damnation le fey est la moindre chose ; le supplice pro pre au damne est le progres in fini duns le vice et duns le crime , 1'ami s'endurcis- sant , se depravant toujours , s'enfoncant nccessairement duns le mal de minute en progression geometrique vers l'eternite . That was it  --  that was Edwina 's case and his own . Suddenly he heard the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the distant music , even above the amiable chatter of little Mrs. Jobnekar to which he listened with only half an ear . Esketh was shouting at the Maharani and it occurred to Ransome that perhaps she had been baiting him , as she baited the General . " It 's a damned outrage ! " Esketh bellowed , and Ransome , seeing the twinkle in the black eyes of the old lady , thought , " It 's no use his trying to bully her . " The methods he used in the West would come to nothing here , save that they would amuse Her Highness . Esketh 's face looked swollen , and Ransome thought , " He 's ill . There 124 is something the matter with him . No man who was n't ill would shout like that . " In the protruding blue eyes there was a dull look as if they were covered by a film . And he wondered if Esketh made scenes like this with Edwina . Then the dinner was suddenly at an end and the Maharani in her white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long train of her Mahratta sari trailing far behind her between the tiny feet covered with emeralds from the four parts of the earth . In the room with the blue walls the entertainment had already begun , and seated on a small dais with her back to one of the huge arched windows sat Lakshmi Bai , one of the great singers of India . She sat cross-legged and wore a sari of blue and silver . She was neither a beautiful woman nor a plain one and she was no longer young , but neither her age nor her appearance were of importance in her performance . It was not a woman that one saw and listened to but a work of art , in which every tiny detail contributed a little part toward the whole  --  the scarlet lips , the lacquered nails , the glimpse of jeweled foot from beneath the blue and silver sari , the exquisite style with which the beautiful hands , more delicate and more sensitive than the hands of any European , picked the strings of the lute . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside him now , was interested , it seemed to him , for the first time , in something , a creation , which was very like herself , possessing the same half-decadent perfection . They alone in the room were silent , watching , and listening , for the Indians looked upon the music merely as a background for conversation and talked among themselves , and the General and Esketh had no interestin such goings-on ; and sitting beside her , Ransome was acutely aware of her perfection , of her breeding and poise , of her clothes , her jewels , her hair , her grace of manner and the way she sat , leaning back a little , listening and watching . It seemed to him suddenly that he had discovered the very essence of her existence . He thought , " She is the last example of something which will soon be gone from the world because there is no longer any time or place for it . " She was not , like Esketh , a kind of crude fungus growth , sprung up overnight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product of hundreds of years125of leisure , of privilege and responsibility won and carried on by generation after generation . And now even the civilization , the epoch to which she belonged , was nearly at an end and there was no longer any place for her , or for himself for that matter , and both of them were touched by the decay of something which was too old , from which even his grandmother in the vast turreted house back in Grand River had not been able to save him . They were , he knew , both rotten at the core , and suddenly it occurred to him that it was Esketh and his crude gods that were destroying them . Presently Lakshmi Bai finished singing , and as she left the room a little band came in and seated itself in front of the dais , and then the two dancing girls appeared . Like the singer they were not young , and one of them was definitely old . They were mother and daughter who had come long ago from the temples of Tanjore into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor their plumpness had anything to do with the beauty of their dancing . If they had been young and beautiful , thought Ransome , their beauty would have distracted you ; you would have been aware of bodies rather than of the archaic patterns , thousands of years old , refined now to the point of decadence , which their bodies made as they danced . Again none save Ransome and Edwina paid any attention to the performance , and in a little while first one and then the other of the two dancers discovered their interest and put a certain fire into their dancing . They danced the legends of Krishna and the Gopis and the story of Rama and Sita , but there was no longer any realismin their dancing , for each incident , each action , had become thousands of years ago merely a pattern , a filigree , exquisite in itself and related to nothing . It was a pure art beyond which there was nothing save decadence , destruction , and a new beginning . When they had finished and gone away again with the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes closed , and presently Ransome asked , " When are you leaving ? " " The end of the week . We 're taking the Victoria from Bombay . " " It 's a pity to meet again and then separate almost at once . " She gave a little laugh that was at the same time a sigh : " Well , that'sthe way the world is nowadays . " She told him about the visit to India , about coming to Ranchipur 126 because of the Kathiawar horses , about the heat , the dust , the misery and the boredom of the long official dinners . " I do n't see how you emerge from it all , looking as if you 'd come out of your own house in London in the middle of the season . " Again she laughed : " It 's simple enough . It 's nothing but a question of money . I have two maids with me and one of them is an excellent hairdresser . It 's different from the old days when I did my own hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You looked just as well then . " " I was younger then . It did n't matter so much . " " It does n't matter now . " She looked at him slyly and then laughed : " Just the same I like it better this way . I 'm luxurious by nature . I like all the things money brings . " He wanted to ask , " All the things ? " but had not the courage . They had not recovered enough lost ground to risk a question so intimate . All the same he knew that she was talking to him as she would have talked to no other person in the room . There was a kind of bond between them after all , an odd feeling that they belonged to a small and dying world which together they would defend to the very end , even though there was no end save defeat and decay . The others in the room could not know what it was . Slowly he became excited at seeing her again , at having someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to analyze , to justify , someone who understood exactly how desperate you were , how useless , how rotten . " You must come round to me and have tea some afternoon , " he said . " I live in a damp mildewy old Georgian house and mess around with paints . It 's very untidy but it might amuse you . " " Why do you stay here through the monsoon ? " He grinned : " I do n't know . I might as well be here as anywhere else . " " I 'll try to come . I 'll have to squeeze it in somehow . There 's so much arranged for us " ; and she looked at him almost as if she were appraising him and thinking , " Could it be worth while for us to begin all over again ? Could we ever recapture what is lost ? " He did not say , " Bring your husband , " because he did not want Esketh there , impatient and bored , destroying this feeling between them. 127 J " Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She lighted a cigarette . " Are you by any chance going to Mr. Bannerjee 's to dinner ? " " Day after tomorrow ? " " Yes , " and with a sensation of satisfaction he saw that she was pleased . " What 's he like  --  Mr. Bannerjee ? " she asked ; " I mean inside . I can see from the outside  --  a rather fussy little man who looks Chinese . " " It would need a whole book to describe him  --  a kind of symbolic book . He 's the Indian who is lost between the East and the West . " She was silent for a moment and then she said , " Who is that man over there . The one who looks like a pale copper Apollo ? " He knew without looking whom she meant , for the description was inspired . It was the Major . He was talking to the Maharani , by command , Ransome knew , so that she would not be bored . He told her about the surgeon and she listened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without taking her glance off the Major . He praised the Major 's qualities , but after a moment he was aware that what he was saying did not hold her interest . He saw that it was not the Major 's virtues which interested her . Her blue eyes had a fixed expression in them as if she were speculating , appraising the clean goodlookingyoung Brahmin doctor . And Ransome felt suddenly angry and jealous because somehow she had slipped away from him , and he thought , " I did n't know she was as bad as that . " " He looks very romantic , " she said . " Well , he is n't . He 's a surgeon and a scientist . No one could be more cold-blooded . " And then growing brutal he added , " Love to him is just copulation  --  something to be studied with scientific detachment . " And almost at once he knew that he had said exactly the wrong thing to kill her interest in the Major , and he thought , " Slut ! " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the roar of falling water . It was as if a gigantic waterfall had struck the palace . The rains had begun again . She laughed and raised her voice against the downpour : " It 's not much like the good old English drizzle . Is n't there another room we might go to ? I hate sitting here , shouting , with everybody listening . " 128 " We might take a look at some of the other rooms . It might amuse you . Her Highness would n't mind . I 'll ask her permission . " The Maharani was talking now to the Dewan about the new wing that was to be built at the Girls ' High School , and when Ransome asked her permission to take Lady Esketh through the lower rooms she gave a little laugh : " Of course . Go where you like " ; and as he turned away she said , " Good luck , " and then returned to her conversation with the Dewan . He found himself suddenly confused by the remark . It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort  --  sensual , decadent , coldblooded , promiscuous . " It annoyed him as insulting to Edwina , and then it occurred to him that the old lady was right and that it might be agreeableto have happen what the old Maharani had hinted at , not only agreeable but a necessity . It had to happen . So he told the aide-de-camp that he knew his own way and that they needed no one to accompany them . They went from one to another of the deserted empty rooms belowstairs , to the great Durbar Hall , all done in gold leaf and sandalwood , to the courtyards drenched now in the downpour , and presently into the smaller rooms where treasures and monstrosities stood side by side . At first he felt nervous and excited , as if instead of being experienced and jaded he were a boy again , aware of desire for the first time , timid and ignorant . Presently they talked less and less of the things about them as if the conversation were too artificial and in the heat talking against the roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a while they walked in silence save when he spoke absent-mindedly and without interest or conviction , to point out some special treasure or some incredible horror . At last they came to a small room at the far end of one wing of the palace just beneath the room where a little while before the Maharani 's band had been playing . Edwina said , " Let 's sit here for a moment and have a cigarette . I 'm exhausted by the heat . " Sc they both sat on the divan and after the cigarettes were lighted they both fell silent until at last the silence became unendurable , when Ransome said , " Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? " 129 She laughed , " Of course I am , you ninny . " For the first time in many years he was aware of a romantic feeling . He said , " You 're looking very beautiful  --  more beautiful than you were then . " " It 's a long way from Tipton Farm . We 've both come a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were meant to be , you know , the two of us meeting again like this in a Maharajah 's palace . Something about the whole evening  --  the music , the dancers , the rain . It 's set me going . " She laughed . " It 's all very Elinor Glyn . " " Do n't do that . " " Even to the tiger skin , " she said , kicking the skin on the floor with her toe . " You 're a perverse bitch . Anyway it 's a panther skin . " But inside him the excitement kept on mounting . She laughed again : " In the middle of the monsoon  --  with the heat and the rain . It 's all very provocative and savage . " He rose then and closed the door and pushed a chest against it and put out the light . Then he made his way toward her in the darkness . " Wait , " she said . " Do n't be in such a hurry . Mind my cigarette . " Upstairs , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the old Maharajah for a Kathiawar stallion and three mares , and the bargaining was not going too well . His passion for horses had begun long ago when as a boy he had never missed a running of the Grand National . As a boy he had stood in the crowd watching the arrival of the rich , the powerful , the fashionable . As a boy , when he had a holiday , he would cycle for miles across country simply to catch a distant glimpse of pink coats flying over a hedge . And later on as a young man , selling cutlery and cotton goods in the Far East , he was driven always by the knowledge that one day he must have horses , because horses were a kind of label , a label which no Simpson had worn since the race of Simpsons had existed . One day he meant to have a racing stable and a half-dozen hunters and the prettiestand most fashionable woman in England for a wife . And to have these things one had to have a great fortune. 130JHe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was the peer of any woman in the British Empire for position , for sporting qualities , for smartness . He had come a long way , Albert Simpson of Liverpool . He had bought his hunters and his racing stable and his wife and his tide , and now he meant to buy the four most beautiful Kathiawar horses in existence . But it seemed that the old Maharajah did not understand bargaining , at least not the methods Lord Esketh had learned long ago selling cutlery to Chinese merchants in the Malay States . He was willing to sell Esketh three mares and a stallion of the Kathiawar breed but not the ones the great Lord had picked out after three or four visits to the stables . He was a shrewd judge of horses and he had chosen the finest stallion and three of the best mares that existed in the world . He was angry now because he could not have his way and baffled and furious because for once he had set his mind on something which he could not buy simply by offering more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased , stimulated by one discovery after another . It was always humiliating for him to encounter someone richer than himself , and doubly humiliating when he was forced to bargain with the person . He knew well enough that the gentle old man sitting opposite him could have bought him up  --  his jute and rubber and munitions and newspapers and steamship lines  --  for cash and still have a great fortune left . It was annoying too that the wealth of the old gentleman existed in concrete form , in reality , and not as credits and papers in a complex tangled system which even Esketh himself did not at times understand . His own wealth might be increased a million pounds one day and decreaseda million pounds the next , without much rhyme or reason . But the old gentleman sitting opposite was not troubled by depressions , disastersand financial blunders for he was quite independent of that gigantic clumsy fallible structure which the West called big business . It was like dealing with a tough old peasant who owned his land and had a sock full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant , was down to brass tacks and the realization of the fact made Esketh feel shaky and insecure . He was a man who could not gracefully accept a sense of inferiority , and he was ill . And His Highness did not pound the table and shout . He did not 131grow angry nor did he talk of his horses being worth four times their real value . He did not lose his composure . He was suave and smiling and dignified . He did not even talk of the value of his horses at all , because to him they were above price . " I can not sell you the stallion and the mares , " he said , " because I am very attached to them . I bred them myself . If I sold them to you I would be throwing away the product of fifty years of work and selection . They are the most beautiful Kathiawar horses in the world , perhaps the most beautiful horses in the world . To me they are , and so they are to my friend Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I let them go it would break his heart . You see , quite aside from anything else , I am unwilling to do that . " Esketh crushed out his cigar with a vicious gesture which said , " To hell with your friend Mohammed 13egg ! To hell with all of you ! " Aloud he said , " I will pay you anything you like . I will build you a school or a whole railroad system . I will feed your starving poor . " " We have no starving poor , you see . " " I 'll pay you what you like . " It was as if his passion for horses had slowly centered itself in the beautiful stallion , Asoka , and the mares , as if he could not live if he did not have them . " It is not a question of money . You , Lord Esketh , who have a stable should understand what I mean . " " I do n't want to take back to England a string of second-rate stock . " The Maharajah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-rate stock in my stables . You need have no fear of that . If you take back to England the horses I am willing to sell you , they will be as good as the best horses in England . " Esketh started to answer him angrily and then thought better of it for with this old man he felt strangely unsure of his ground . In his shrewdnesshe knew the Maharajah was sure of his , and slowly he was beginning to feel that the old gentleman knew all about him , everything there was to know , more perhaps than Edwina knew or even himself , things which he would have preferred to keep hidden . He said , " Then I must take the mares and stallion Your Highness will sell me and be satisfied . " " I 'm quite sure that you 'll be satisfied with them . You 'll find them132wonderful and beautiful creatures  --  intelligent , capable of any endurance . It would be interesting to cross their breed with some of your best racingstock . Let me know when and how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only ask you not to ship them now , during the heat . It would be very hard on them . " " Then , there is n't anything more to be said ? " " No , I should like to please you . I 'm sorry about Asoka but I could not break Mohammed 's heart . " And then very quietly he said , " Please let me make you a gift of the other stallion and the mares . It would give me great pleasure . " The blood rushed into Esketh 's face and he felt a wild insane desire to shout , " Keep your horses and be damned ! I 'm not accepting gifts from any bloody Indian ! " But he was uncertain whether the Maharajah had spoken from sincere generosity or whether he had meant the speech as an insult , the condescending gesture of a king to a tradesman . His anger , confused and impotent , was roused not only by the suavity of the old Maharajah but also by the memory of a man dead now for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always treated him thus , courteouslyand condescendingly ; and sometimes Edwina herself treated him in the same fashion  --  Edwina , who owed him everything , whose bills he had paid when he married her . " Thank you , " he said , " I could n't accept that . You have been too kind already . " " As you like , " said the Maharajah gently . " But I meant the offer sin-cerely . " And suddenly Esketh felt , from the manner of the Maharajah and the tone of his voice , that he had been made to seem boorish by his refusal . The little scene had put him somehow , mysteriously , into the position of a small shopkeeper or a moneylender who valued everything in life in terms of shillings and pence . And it made him seem an awkward , bumptious boy . In his other mission Esketh had no greater success . The Dewan was an immensely old man , with a long and beautiful white beard , who dressed always in white and looked rather like one of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex- 133 actly how old he was but he had been important and powerful in Indian politics for fifty years , and he was still shrewd and vigorous . For twenty- four of the fifty years , ever since the Maharani had driven out the Brahmin Dewan and caused a scandal he had been prime minister to the Maharajah of Ranchipur , helping him to build and reform and bring peace and order and prosperity to his people . The old Maharajah ac- complished things by simplicity and directness , but the Dewan was Machiavellian . Believing that the end justified any means , he succeeded by craft and intrigue where the Maharajah in his simplicity often failed . In his pride as an Indian he desired to accomplish the same good ends as his master , but he lacked his master 's faith in the goodness of men and he had a mischievous delight in intrigue for intrigue 's sake , and so for fifty years , while he had accomplished great things , he had had fun . In his faith he was a devout Hindu , not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hindu purist , for he went far back for his faith to the very beginnings of the religion when it had been simple and strong and good , uncluttered by superstitions and defeatism and innumerable gods , ranging from Vishnu to the phallic symbol set in a mud shrine at the crossroads . He ate no meat and lived a simple life , apportioning his day like the Greeks , into periods of action and repose , of intellectual and physical exercise . He had been known to rise and leave political conferences because everyone had talked too long and the hour had come for him to be alone and reflect . And so , whatever immense age he may have reached , he was still wiry and spry and brilliant . To him Esketh was simply another game . As soon as the Englishman mentioned Bombay mills he knew what it was he wanted . But he pre- tended that he did not understand , forcing Esketh to put aside all delicacy and crudely show his hand . The old Dewan knew all about the mills , more even than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended that he knew nothing at all and was astonished to hear that the Japanese competition was cutting into their markets . He forced Esketh to come into the open and say that he would like him to use his influence with the Khojas and Parsees in Bombay to make them reasonable in their demands . The old patriarch listened to him quietly with a gentle smile while he 134 explained that if he took over the mills and put in the latest methods of action and organization they would pay . " It would mean work for thousands of starving Indian mill workers , " said Esketh . " But I can not undertake it unless I can buy into the mills at a reasonable price . " He agreed with all Esketh 's arguments , even with his threats , but lie committed himself to nothing and gave him no encouragement until at last Esketh , after much roundabout talk , said , " Perhaps you 'd be interested in working together with me . I should see that you would not go unrewarded . " " How ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profits of the mills or some such thing . " Now the old gentleman had gotten what he wanted . He had forced this powerful millionaire from the West to propose bribery like any shabby merchant in the bazaar . With a twinkle in his black eyes , he said , " No , you see , in my position it is impossible to meddle in business . " And his smile seemed to say , " I should not mind meddling in business but'what you propose is unsound . I know a thousand better investments . " " Then you are unwilling to help me ? " " If the opportunity comes to put in a word for you , I shall not overlookit . " But Esketh was aware that he had accomplished nothing whatever , no more than he had accomplished with the old Maharajah . For the second time he had been unable to buy what he wanted . He had come to Ranchipur to swelter , traveling five hundred miles through heat and dust , and nothing had come of it . He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found the Maharani dismissing her guests . Edwina and Ransome came into the room at almost the same moment and , noticing them , he thought , " Ah , she 's found one of her own kind . Now there 'll be hell to pay ! She 'll be grand again for days ! " He walked over to her and without a word to Ransome , he said , " We 're going home now . " " I 'm quite ready whenever you are . " 135Before they left Ransome managed to say to her , " You 'll be coming to tea with me on Thursday . " She smiled , " If I can manage it . It 'll be difficult . " She was smooth and serene , all white and gold porcelain again , as if nothing whatever had happened . As he said good night to the Maharani she looked at him for a second , her eyes dancing with amusement , just long enough to say without saying it , " I know what you were up to below stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something in her look made him feel cheap and clownish . To her , what had happened below stairs was funny , like a cheap dirty story . When the guests had gone Her Highness dismissed all the aides-decamp , the ladies-in-waiting and her friends , the two old Princesses of Bewanagar , and stayed for a moment alone with her husband . It was one of those moments , so rare when , alone , they needed no longer to be King and Queen but simply husband and wife , humble people who might have lived in the quarter of the Untouchables . The proud old lady seemed to shed all the majesty , all the pride she had shown a little while before . Instead of speaking English or French or Hindustani they spoke together in Mahratta , the language they had both spoken as children long ago in the dusty sunburnt villages of the Deccan . " How is your gout ? " she asked . " A little better tonight . " But he sat down all the same , to ease the pain in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of next week . You should n't stay any longer in this heat . " " If the rains keep on we can go . " " You did n't give in to him about the horses ? " " No . I did n't give in . " " The Viceroy sends us some odd packages now and then . " " He 's obliged to . He ca n't help himself . " " This Esketh is the worst in a long time . " The old man was silent for a moment , reflecting : " He 's not a very happy man . " 136The Maharani chuckled : " And while he was bargaining with you like Bunya , his wife was downstairs behaving like a bitch in heat . " The Maharajah looked amused : " With whom ? " he asked . " With Ransome . " " Ransome ! He 's not a very happy man either . If it made him happy ... The Maharani chuckled again : " It did n't . " Then they went away , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left empty and silent save for the wild sound of the rain and the buzzing of the wild bees in the great crystal chandelier , until an Untouchableboy , coming in to free a giant bat entangled in the netting , put out the lights . In the hallway outside the old gentleman 's nurse , Mr. Bauer , was waiting with his wheeled chair . Mr. Bauer was a big blonde fellow about thirtyfouror five who had been with the Maharajah since the day , five years before , when His Highness found him teaching people to swim on the beach at Ouchy . His Highness had the Indian liking for beauty and he preferred to have near him a nurse who was pleasant and handsome to one who was dull and scrawny . Bauer was placid and conscientious and amiable and he possessed the same beauty as Asoka , the stallion . It had worked well since the beginning , but the Maharajah was troubled sometimes lest his nurse become bored in Ranchipur , for he could not see how Mr. Bauer fitted in any possible way into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bauer pushing the chair , they went along corridor after corridor until they came at last to the wing of the palace which overlooked the town . Here in the antechamber were waiting Major Safti and Raschid Ali Khan , the Muslim and the Brahmin sitting side by side , smoking cigars and exchanging stories . His Highness greeted them , saying , " Gentlemen , if you will wait for a moment , I will have Mr. Bauer put me to bed and then I 'll talk . You see I am a little tired . " The silver bed was placed near one of the windows where the Maharajahmight look out over the park and the town . When the Swiss had137put him into it and arranged the nettings at the windows and over the bed , he said , " Is that all , Your Highness ? " " Yes , Bauer . If you 'll tell the doctor he may come in now . " " Good night , Your Highness . " " Good night . " In a moment Doctor Safti came in : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . " " Yes , my knees are better . " " You should n't have stood up all the evening . " " I only stood when it was necessary . There are certain politenesses one has to observe . " " Quite right . Still Your Highness can do as he pleases . " The old gentleman laughed : " It 's not as easy as that . You 'd soon find out , Doctor , if ever you 'd like to change places . . . . " He made a little gesture : " But that would n't work . You could do my job but I could never do yours . " " What Your Highness needs is a change . You should get off to Carls-bad . " " I shall as soon as I 'm able . " When the Major had finished examining him and saw that his medicineswere arrayed properly on the lacquer table beside him , he bowed and turned to go . " Wait , Doctor ! " " Yes , sir . " " Sit down . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Your Highness . " " It 's about something serious . " " Yes , Your Highness . " " Why have n't you ever married , doctor ? " Major Safti grinned : " I do n't know . " He seemed to reflect for a moment , as if he had never thought about it before : " When I was in England there was nobody suitable and then when I came here I was so busy at first it never occurred to me , and now I 've got used to not being married . " " But what do you do about it ? Light your cigar , you 'll feel more comfortable . " 138Major Safti grinned again : " Thank you , sir . " He lighted the cigar and then said , " Well , at first it was difficult , but I 've had it fixed up now for a long time . At first it got in the way of my work and then I found a girl . That was three years ago . Everything 's been fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divined that he was full of curiosity . " It 's Natara Devi , " he said , " one of the dancers from the school . You know , Your Highness , the little one from the North with blue eyes and very black hair . " The Maharajah smiled : " Very pretty too , but dancers are expensive . They have to lay aside money for their old age . " Major Safti grinned again , a little sheepishly ; " She does n't ask much  --  a trinket now and then . I think , sir , she 's in love with me . " " Are you in love with her ? " The Major thought for a moment : " I 've never considered it before . No . . . I do n't suppose so . She 's a nice little thing . " " Then it would n't make much difference if you gave her up ? " " No , she is n't necessary . . . not Natara Devi herself . Any pretty , goodnaturedwoman would do . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't object to being married ? " " No . . . not if I liked her . But you see it 's difficult . I 'm a Brahmin and not orthodox . I 'm not religious at all . My mother has talked to me about getting married but she 's never been able to find anyone . There was always something wrong . You see , I could n't properly get on with an orthodox woman and I would n't ask her to try to get on with me . I 've got a lot of ideas that most Indian women and their families would n't put up with . " " Yes , that 's true , " said the Maharajah . " But I know a girl who might suit . Her father is a friend of mine . He 's a great scholar , in Bombay , and her mother is an American woman from San Francisco . They met when he was working in the museum there . It 's difficult for the girl too to find a proper husband because she 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty ? " asked the Major . " Very pretty . She 'd make exactly the right wife . " 139
