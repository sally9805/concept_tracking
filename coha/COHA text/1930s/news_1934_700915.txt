Members of the board pointed out that if the reduction in rates was not achieved the fund for street lighting would need replenishment before the end of the year . To meet the estimated deficiencies , if they run as high as $9,000 , - 000 , the Aldermen figure that the license fees they intend to set up would yield several millions , but they pointed out that increased license fees in the past had not ful1 filled expectations . Accruals in various departments will yield more funds to meet the deficit , but some of the departments already have deducted their accruals . It is possible , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the end of the year , but only under the most favorable circumstances , with the reserve fund cut to $11,000,000 , and accruals running high , and license fees yielding substantial additional revenues . Meanwhile , the Aldermen 's finance committee , meeting at 10 o'clock this morning , will consider further the budget as proposed by the Board of Estimate , before reporting to the Board of Aldermen . Strategy Protects Salaries . It was said that although the committee might consider further salary cuts for some of the Mayor 's commissioners , adoption of the cuts was not believed likely . Some of the cuts proposed by Tammany Aldermen would put the salaries of the commissioners too far out of line with those paid to Tammany officeholders in county jobs , it was said , and the Aldermen do not want to reopen that subject . A move may be made by the Fusion minority in the boald to abolish the Crime Prevention Bureau of the Police Department .

Deutsch , from $4,500 to $3,500 a year , it became known yesterday . A veto by Mayor La Guardia of some of the cuts that the Aldermen will finally approve today is expected .

A group of physicians representing the New York Academy of Medicine conferred yesterday with Mayor La Guardia to protest against the cuts in the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday . The committee told the Mayor many of the thirty posts eliminated in the department were key positions , of vital importance to the maintenance of the city 's health . Dr. Iago Galdston , in a statement for the committee , quoted the Mayor as saying he was sure the Outs had been made only as a result of a misunderstanding by the Aldermen of the importance of the positions eliminated . The physicians pointed out that the Health Department budget , prior to the latest cuts , already had been reduced by a greater percentage than the budget of any other city department . Dr. Galdston said the Committee on public health relations of the academy would inset again today and issue a more detailed statement " to acquaint the people of the city with the Serious implications of the proposed action .

Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared the city had no alternative . He predicted adoption of a State sales tax at the coming session of the Legislature and said this might force the Legislature to reconsider and rearrange the entire tax system . " We have been talking about revision for a great many years without accomplishing anything besides weighty studies by commissions , " Mr. Deutsch declared , " and I would be cynical enough to predict that nothing would be done now , except for the fact that the burden of these taxes , and the new taxes which the State will have to impose in January , will be so heavy that public demand may drive the Legislature into a consideration and rearrangement of the whole tax system . " I can assure you that if the city . administration had " been able to accomplish rearrangement by itself , it Would have done so long since .

" I suggest , " he said , " that in some considerable measure the State ought to collect taxes from localities and pay back a percentage of the collection to the locality for its own use , in exactly the proportion in which it collects from the respective localities . have in mind particularly the income and inheritance taxes , and also a sales tax , If it be adopted by the State this year , which seems to me inevitable .

Mr. Schaap , in attacking the sales tax , declared the city adrninistration had chosen a tax that violated the principle that those best able to pay should hear taxation . Whereas the income tax gives an exemption for each dependent , he pointed out , the sales tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the citizen supporting several persons must pay a , tax on everything he buys for each dependent , as well as what he buys for himself . He argued that the tax would compel the stores to charge higher prices and that the yield , $40,000,000 a year , would mean exactly that much less spent for actual merchandise by the public in the stores , which would result in further unemployment . He predicted that the small stores on the City 's borders would be hit particularly hard , as well as the large department stores , for the benefit of stores in near-by communities and of mail-order housee.
