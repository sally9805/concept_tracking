BIRCHALI , Wireless to Tax Nay ' ' Data TIMES . BERLIN , Jan. ** German ; public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Spanish civil war had been fired by the German cruiser Koenigsberg on , New Year 's Day . That was also the day on which Vice Admiral Roll Carla took over the command of the German fleet . The dangerous naval situation thus developing was aggravated tonight by a report of the official news agency under a Salamanca date line that a German citizen named Lothar Gudee had been tried by a drumhead court-martial at Bilbao , sentenced to death and shot . The reason given for the sentence was that Gudee belonged to the Spanish Fascist organization known as the Falange Espanol . " According to witnesses , " says the official German agency report , " he went to his death like a hero . Just before the volley that ended his life was fired , he raised his right hand in the German greeting and cried , ' Heil Hitler ! Long live Germany ! Long live Spain ! ' The shooting can be characterized only as a cowardly murder . " Occasion of Naval Shooting The occasion of the naval shooting was an attempt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer , " as it is officially termed here , in accordance with the unannounced and unrecognized blockade that part of the German fleet has established off the port of Bilbao . The incident was made known by the German Government through the official news agency in these terms : " In pursuit of measures which German warships have undertaken because of the retention of a passenger and part of the cargo of the German steamer Palos , which was seized in violation of international law by Red Sppniqh naval forces outside territorial waters , the cruiser Koenigsberg on Jan. 1 , 1937 , called on the Spanish steamer Soton to halt . " The cruiser fired two blank shots and . when these did not succeed dropped several shells near the Soton . The steamer , attempting to escape , ran aground before the harbor of Santona and was voluntarily abandoned by her crew . Tb.g crew was landed by a Spanish fishing boat . " The Koenigsberg continued her patrol . Members of the Soton 's crew are not aboard the cruiser . " Examination of a map shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Bilbao on the Spanish shore of the Bay of Biscay . About half that distance further west is Santander , which , dispatches reveal , was bombarded today by a section of the Spanish fleet which has gone over to Generalissimo Francisco Franco 's side . This might seem to indicate a certain degree of cooperation between the German and Franco fleets . There is a seemingly well-authen The German answer to the AngloFrench memorandum regarding alien volunteers in Spain , it is learned today , is now substantially complete and may be delivered next Tuesday or at the latest Wednesday . It will be delivered simultaneously with the Italian reply to demonstrate the solidarity existing between the two countries . As far as can be learned today , the crux of the German answer will be an attempt to tie up the question of alien volunteers with all other forms of unofficial intervention in Spain , thus returning the whole matter to the London nonintervention committee . The answer , it is understood , is likely to be highly argumentative . ATTITUDE ON SPAIN // ticated report here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now concentrated in the Bay of Biscay off the northern coast of Spain . Obviously under instructions , German newspapers make no display of the naval shooting incident . In all of them it is almost ostentatiously buried in the midst of a lot of news from Spain . Nevertheless , it must be assumed  --  and the assumption is strengthened by increasing rumors on this point  --  that this action represents a definitely new policy that Admiral Canis was appointed to carry out and in favor of which Admiral Richard Foerster , former fleet commander , was retired under National Socialist pressure despite the supposed opposition of Admiral General Erich Raeder , naval chief of staff . This , if correct , would indicate the definite ascendancy of the Nazi party influence driving toward a stronger course in Spanish matters . The naval action certainly was intended as a blow to whatever prestige the former Madrid government , now domiciled in Valencia , still retains at home and abroad . Foreign Office Alters Tone Now that these naval incidents have occurred , all German authorities have fallen automatically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been to some extent a moderating influence hitherto , is changing its tone . Its semi-official Diplomatische Korrespondenz today has this : " German ships on the high seas can not be viewed as free game for overt acts on the part of the Red Spanish rulers . If Red Spain wishes to introduce such forms of intercourse , it must figure on conter measures until it returns to methods considered usual and necessary in international life . These German counter measures are nothing more than the application of measures like those first taken by the Reds . " It will probably even question why this Anglo-French move has been undertaken and protest against it as tending to put the powers to which it was addressed in the attitude of culprits . The further suggestion may be made that if any power should be on the defendants ' bench in this matter that power should be France . Reply Termed " Positive " Nevertheless , the answer is described in advance as " positive . " It is expected to promise German cooperation to halt the influx of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative the influence of alien agents , presumably both Bolshevist and emigrant Germans . Only by including these ' last , it is being argued here , will a definite solution of the Spanish problem be possible , and it is up to the non-intervention committee to work out the details . Thus everything will be left very much as it was except that new naval-incidents provide fresh facilities for the creation of a situation infinitely more dangerous . Amid these happenings the propaganda machine is not idle . It is announced that the president of the Aryan Peace Alliance , Rudolf Flebius , who advocated peace by rearmament , is about to undertake a tour of Western Europe and North America . He is prepared to discourse in English , French or German as desired . His view is that the British contention that what is happening in Spain is civil war and it obliges other countries to non-intervention is all wrong . Communism . is no home affair , he contends , but a pestilence that must be destroyed .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
