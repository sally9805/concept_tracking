Thanks to its never-say-die publisher and its A. F. of L. printers , the ruffled Brooklyn Eagle could thumb its beak last week at the C. I. O. American Newspaper Guild . Although about 300 editorial and business office Guildsmen were called out on strike after the Guild 's demand for a contract was turned down , Publisher Millard Preston Goodfellow worked through day and night with a punctured staff , got out the regular evening editions while as many as 250 pickets booed from the sidewalk . Ten were arrested for disorderly conduct . Printers pierced the picket line to prepare evening editions , reminded the Guild of the contract between the Eagle and the International Typographical Union , in effect until June 30 , 1938 . Failing to shut the plant , the Guild solicited funds by radio for its eleventh strike since it was founded in 1933 , dug in for a long and bitter labor struggle .
