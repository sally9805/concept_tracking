txt Preserving the Sunset . To give my baby girl beauty , God made breath-takingly lovely sunsets along the Hudson River opposite West 108th Street . To advertise their cars the Ford Motor Company , across on the Jersey shore , put up a huge crimson electric sign that leaped-into the heart of the sunset like a curse hurled at all the souls of men . I write to the Ford company , telling how its sign was wrecking the sunset from the Manhattan side . Seemingly as interested , in the creation of sunsets as in the production of cars , this company at once agreed to keep the sign dark for an hour longer each evening . I feel that the people living near the riverfront here and the frequenters of the park should know of this generous action . MARY M'DOUGAL AXELSON . New York , July 31 , 1934.
