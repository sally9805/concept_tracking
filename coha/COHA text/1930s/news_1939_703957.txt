At the same time they also continued to criticize the prices for admission , food and transportation inside the grounds .

Throng at League Exercises Several hundred persons attended the exercises at the pavilion of the League of Nations , 100-foot-high structure on a pentagonal base , surmounted by a circular colonnade ? the whole suggesting somewhat the lines of Grant 's Tomb on Riverside Drive . Flags of the nations in the League flew from the top of the building , and the speakers , together with Mrs. Wilson and other distinguished guests , occupied a blue and orange platform outside the main entrance . The audience sat on folding chairs in the open air . During the ceremony the chimes of the Cathedral of St. Pierre were broadcast from Geneva , Switzerland , the seat of the League . The speeches were broadcast , as were the addresses at the Danish Pavilion . Secretary Wallace described the League pavilion and in its home in Geneva as " monuments to a magn ficent vision " in a tribute to President Wilson 's " nobility of purpose . " If the last twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has been due not only to political conflicts in this country but to conditions abroad , where " the spirit of justice and forgiveness which Woodrow Wilson advocated was not fully maintained when the terms of peace were carried out . " " There was a deplorable lack of understanding of economic principles , " he said . " The bad economics made it exceedingly difficult for the nations in the League to be good neighbors and to do business with each other in a neighborly way . As time went on there was the failure of some nations that were members of the League to put long-run international welfare above temporary national expediency . There was the failure of the nations to disarm . There was the enactment by the United States of higher and higher tariffs , and the subsequent creation of new infernational trade barriers on every hand . " There was the failure of democracy among some countries in the League . Then came the rise of dictatorships , the flouting of the League and its principles , the withdrawal of powerful nations from membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations that had been League members . There was the death of freedom of speech and freedom of the ? press in the dictatorship countries . Barriers were set up preventing the free exchange of ideas and news between the nations of the world . i " Some day the peoples of the world will learn the Golden Rule . When that day comes , then it will be seen that the vision which led to the founding of the League of Nations was a lasting reality , that those who dreamed of the League as an instrument for realizing the brotherhood of man had hold of the same essential truth which so consumed the ancient Hebrew prophets with divine passion . It is in that spirit that we dedicate this League of Nations Building , for here , as perhaps nowhere else , is symbolized the hope of man in the World of Tomorrow . " Conveys President 's Greetings Secretary Wallace conveyed the greetings of President Roosevelt and said the President , unable to attend because of official duties , had asked him to act as representative . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League , who originally planned to come to this country for the dedication , had been kept at home because of the European crisis . Adrian Pelt , the League 's Commissioner General to the Fair , speaking on behalf of SecretaryGeneral Avenol , said it was probably a " bold " thing to set up a " monument " to the . League at such a time in world affairs , but he asked the American people to regard it as evidence " not merely of confidence but of faith in peaceful collaboration among nations . " Like peace itself , he went on , the League is passing through a crisis . But he predicted that historians of the future would find " a fruitful theme in discussing whether the League has been gradually paralyzed in the performance of its fundamental task of ' maintaining peace because the obligations for which it provided were too rigid or too extensive , because it was not universal or because its members shrank from the risks of today without foreseeing that those of tomorrow would be inescapable and far grater .
