The September issue of Life bears on its cover a caricature mask of Franklin Delano Roosevelt affixed to the sitting body of a boy doll . Between the doll 's outspread feet is a pie , upon which rests what might be an apple or a tomato . Caption : " Let 's See What a Good Boy Am I. " <P> Most striking is the life-like perspective of the group . The pie looks really edible . The doll 's hands look as if they could be grasped . Reason for this is that the design was not a painting but a color photograph of the objects , an innovation in magazine cover work . <P> Just when youthful Editor George Teeple Eggleston was toying with the idea of using colored photographs on Life 's cover , into his office walked Abner Joseph Epstein ( Dartmouth 1931 ) , nephew of famed Sculptor Jacob Epstein . He had made some paper masks of U. S. politicians , wondered if Life could use them . With him Editor Eggleston concocted the " Little Jack Homer " subject for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has taken the name Abner Dean , made the Roosevelt mask . A doll was bought from Macy 's . Christmas pies being out of season , a strawberry pie was substituted and a plum from an unemployed fruit vendor . At the plant of Powers Engraving Co. the group was posed against a yellow cardboard background before a color camera . Four exposures were made , one for each cardinal color , one for the black , upon transparent plates . The four plates , exactly superimposed , gave the result . Because the printer wanted to brighten the purple plum by reducing the blue , it came out red . Next month 's cover has been modelled by Tony Sarg , famed marionette maker . It is a figure of Life 's symbolic cherub , shouldering a football nearly as big as himself . <P> In his efforts to escape hackneyed and stilted media . Editor Eggleston has introduced two other forms of illustration in Life : caricatures modelled in tin , marionette groups in clay .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
