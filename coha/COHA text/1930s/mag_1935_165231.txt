Hastings , Sussex , where William the Conqueror defeated England 's Harold , is now a sleepy shore resort where the Norman horns are echoed only by the snorings of retired British colonels . Nonetheless , Hastings acknowledges its past with an appropriate tradition . There , every winter , the chess masters of the world face each other across their tiny polished armies in England 's most important tournament . By last week , each of the ten masters invited to Hastings had played nine matches , one against each opponent , and the tournament was over . Like Harold , England 's hope , Sir George Thomas had been defeated after a brave stand . Loss of his ninth and final game left him with 6 points , * in a triple tie for first place with Dr. Max Euwe of Amsterdam and Czechoslovakian Salo Flohr , Hastings winner for the last three years . <P> The two masters most notably missing from the Hastings tournament were Dr. Alexandre Alekhine who was resting for the match in which he will defend his world 's championship against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beefy Ewfimij Dimitriewitsch Bogoljubow . The gallery , watching the tables in the hush of the Hastings and St. Leonards Chess Club , were most interested in two equally famed players neither of whom did as well as might have been expected . Jos Raoul Capablanca , onetime champion of the world , lost two games and finished fourth , a point behind the winners . Fat , solemn Vera Menchik , world 's woman champion , was born in Czechoslovakia , brought up in Moscow , now lives in Hastings . She dismayed her neighbors by winning only one game , finishing just ahead of the two Englishmen who tied for last place . <P> * A win counts 1 point , a draw , a defeat 0 .
