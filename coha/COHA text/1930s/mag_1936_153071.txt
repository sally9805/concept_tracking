In Memphis last week Rev. Claude C. Williams heard that a Negro sharecropper named Frank Weems had been flogged to death in Earle , Ark. by unidentified vigilantes . Preacher Williams and plump Willie Sue Blagden , Memphis socialite and social worker , got into an automobile , started out for the funeral . They never got there . As they sat in their car in front of an Earle drugstore , sipping Coca-Colas , six well-dressed men drove up , seized them , commandeered their car , forced them to drive a mile outside town . <P> Taken across a field to a river bank , Preacher Williams was lashed 14 times with a mule 's belly-strap . Miss Blagden 's turn came next . The huskiest of the six swung the belly strap , laid four solid clouts on her back &; thighs . Miss Blagden and Preacher Williams were then told never to come back to Crittenden County . <P> Week prior , to 50,000 enthusiastic Democrats in Little Rock , Ark. , Preacher Williams ' home , Franklin D. Roosevelt had felicitated himself on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true Arkansas hospitality . " The brand of Arkansas hospitality accorded Preacher Williams and Miss Blagden last week swung the spotlight of national attention on the 1936 Arkansas sharecroppers ' strike which had been fumbling along unnoticed for four weeks . <P> Quick to pooh-pooh the furor over the Earle assault was Arkansas ' tobacco-chewing Governor Junius Marion Futrell . Negro Weems 's " funeral , " he sputtered , was only strike propaganda . Negro Weems , he had been informed , was still alive . Though he failed to produce the missing Negro , Sheriff Howard Curlin of Crittenden County nodded corroboration . Some even suspected that Miss Blagden 's beating might be a hoax . To prove her story she pulled up her skirts for Memphis photographers . To Arkansas . Attorney General Homer Stille Cummings sped Sam E. Whitaker to " investigate " the sharecroppers ' plight , although Mr. Whitaker had just finished a similar investigation . <P> An old story is the long struggle of the Southern sharecropper for the right to buy food , gin &; sell his part of the cotton crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still older is the story of the sub-subsistence living level of some 2,000,000 Southern tenant farmers . But a newer and somewhat brighter tale is that of the incipient cropper colony movement , both public and private . <P> In Arkansas , the Resettlement Administration has planned three " model communities . " Most advanced Federal settlement is the Dyess Colony , 18 mi. from Osceola , named in honor of the late State WPAdministrator William Randolph Dyess , killed in the crash of the The Southerner airliner five months ago ( TIME , Jan. 27 ) . At Dyess last fortnight 480 neat-looking cropper families gaped at Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt , who , beaming with pleasure , addressed a few words of encouragement , shook hands with one &; all . Wrote Columnist Roosevelt in her diary , My Day : " They have a community house , a recreation hall , and a small hospital . All of these expenses are prorated back on the general expense of the land and house . They will begin to pay back in the course of the next few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
