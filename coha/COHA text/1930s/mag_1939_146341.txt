Anglo-French unity of command was spotlighted brightly enough to be visible as far as Berchtesgaden as little General Maurice Gustave Gamelin , Commander in Chief of all French land , sea and air forces , arrived in London one day last week for talks with Britain 's Chief of the Imperial General Staff , John Standish Surtees Prendergast Vereker , Sixth Viscount Gort . In full regalia the generals met in London 's Victoria Station . Together they toured Sandhurst and Aldershot where Lieut . General Sir John Dill showed off his latest tanks . General Gamelin peeped inside one , did not get in . At the spectacular Aldershot Tattoo , General Gamelin in a white-plumed hat took the salute while tanks , armored cars , caterpillar trucks , motorized antiaircraft units whirled past in the glare of searchlights . <P> In London , at the Trooping of the Colour , General Gamelin watched from a balcony beside Queen Mary . Also present at the Trooping , although not in uniform , was Germany 's General Walter von Reichenau , who was in London to attend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal talks between General Gamelin and Lord Gort at the War Office . It was also taken for granted that they would confer with General Kiazim Orbay , Inspector General of the Third Turkish Army , unless he had come to London just to see his tailor . Their theme : military tactics of Britain , France and Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean . Bang-up climax was a demonstration of Anglo-French naval power as units of the French Atlantic squadron for the first time since 1918 joined the British Home Fleet at Rosyth .
