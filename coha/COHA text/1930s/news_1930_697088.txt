txt Beaten on oil and lumber , the tripartite Republican - Democratictrade combination in the Senate succeeded in raising the sugar duties . Five . Republicans and four Democrats have had a change of heart since January , when they were satisfied with the existing . duties . Now the combination has fixed its figures lower than those of the House bill in the expectation or certainty of an easy compromise in conference . It is natural to fear or suppose that this reactionary step in tariff remaking will be followed by others . ' if the whole sugar-consuming public can be " soaked " for the benefit of the cane sugar and beet sugar patriots , why ca n't the independent oil producers get their share of the swag , as well as the lumber people , at least the Dill-Jones soft-wood altruists ? Even the disconsolate boot and shoe and hide and leather phalanxes may pluck up heart . Senator SMOOT , who has been Casablanca on the burning deck for so long , must smile again - es for a moment he atope dodging cinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all ? If he has such dreams , he had better get rid of them . Whatever the errors or the underlying motives of the Democratic-Insurgent Coalition , joined in the vote against the Smoot amendment by four regular Republicans as well as the irregular Insurgents , ALLEN and CAPPER , it has served the country well in resisting the imposition of higher rates on certain articles of general consumption and the removal of others from the free list . Is it likely that its members are going to let their labor be thrown away , or that they will meekly yield the common advantage to this alliance of Bickerers ? If they have the patience and public spirit , let alone the political shrewdness which may be attributed to them , the original Coalitionists will oppose to the last the jacked-up sugar duties if retained in the conference report . A new source of delay , for which they have no responsibility , has appeared . If , just as the Senate tariff bill seemed to be nearing completion , a strong effort is made to undo some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give up the contest without a determined struggle . Nor , from the-Mere point of honor , can it afford to be jockeyed out of one of its cardinal victories . It is true that Republican reactionaries , though aided by a handful of Democrats , must be held responsible for whatever of popular displeasure and political penalty may visit this deliberate sacrifice of the general to the particular interest . By 3 to 1 the Republicans of the Senate showed that no national political considerations could interfere with their pretty little regional business deal . They cared nothing for the Administration , nothing for the national Republican party , nothing for the United States as a whole . From the strictest partisan point of view the majority of the Democratic Senators might be expected to take a certain pleasure in the success of these Republican grave diggers . Yet it would be better policy as well as patriotism to stick steadily , for once , to the poor old downtrodden consumer . He may be trusted to remember and distinguish between the party that tried to help him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
