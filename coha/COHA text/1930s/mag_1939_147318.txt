New York City 's little Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia jammed his hat on his stubby stubborn head , and flew west . At Chicago last week he descended to do a little troubleshooting . At lunch in the Hotel Sherman he sat down with 700 advertising men . At his left he had Mayor Kelly , who had a World 's Fair at home five years ago ; at his right he had Charles G. Dawes , whose brother Rufus successfully financed Chicago 's Fair . Little Fiorello 's job was to convince them all that New York 's is a lot better . Said he : <P> " Do n't believe these stories about hamburgers selling for a dollar and a half . They cost a dime and they 're not transparent or synthetic . . . . We have put a soul into this Fair . . . . It is the last word in the application of the genius of man . . . . Our Fair will not be remembered for any hootchy-kootchy dance-and a fan means nothing to us . " <P> In several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World of Tomorrow cost more than thrice Chicago 's $47,000,000 Century of Progress , is twice its size , and at the end of its first year will probably have a deficit three times as big as Chicago 's $5,000,000 . ( The Century of Progress closed its second year in the black . ) Fond of booming , expansive ciphers , honey-tongued Grover Whalen prophesied for his Tomorrow 60,000,000 customers , when he unveiled his big show last April 30 . Today the books of the Fair give an instructive financial history of the biggest world 's fair ever . Set up like most world 's fairs as a supposedly self-supporting promotion enterprise , like most , it is far from breaking even . Beyond the halfway mark ( August 9 ) , the Fair 's figures revealed the reason for Mayor LaGuardia 's Chicago plea . They showed in round numbers : <P> Paid admissions ... $6,220,000 <P> Concessions ( 8 to 25% cut of gross business of restaurants , amusements , etc. ) ... 1,800,000 <P> Fair 's concessions ( gross of Perisphere and other Fair shows ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , water , maintenance , etc. ) ... 850,000 <P> Resale of electricity ( submetered to exhibitors , etc. ) ... 420,000 <P> Space rentals ... 250,000 <P> Royalties ( on souvenirs , etc. ) ... 90,000 <P> Miscellaneous ... 165,000 <P> Total Operating Revenue : ... $10,710,000 <P> Payroll ( 6,000 employes , recently reduced from 7,000 ) ... $3,810,000 <P> Purchase of electricity ( from Consolidated Edison ) ... 100,000 <P> Operation &; maintenance ( cleaning , repairs , power , equipment , rental , promotion , etc. ) ... 1,615,000 <P> Interest ( on bonds &; bank loans ) ... 320,000
