txt Senator Huey P. Long today ordered the Legislature to meet next week and declare a two-year moratorium for debt-burdened " survivors of the depression , " as a step in his " share-your-wealth " scheme . The " Kingfish " said his moratorium plan would particularly benefit persons struggling under the weight of old debts , but " I mean all debts , " he added . " We 're going to arrange it so a man can get a moratorium not to exceed two years by applying to the Louisiana Public Service Commission , " he explained . " He 'll have to show ' that there 's good reason for the moratorium . If he does n't get the relief he thinks he should , he 'll be able to appear in court . " Student Loans Exempted . " What about the student loans at VI a head ? " ( the loans Long made to hundreds of students so they might accompany him to the Vanderbilt game in Nashville ) he was asked . " I 'm glad you brought that up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to fix it so the moratorium wo n't apply to debts under $8 . " When asked whether the remission of debt fell within the scope of the Public Service Commission , constitutionally created to regulate operation of public utilities , Long retorted : " Oh , that 's all right . We 'll either have them do it , or we 'll create a special board to do it . " We 're taking care of vendor 's liens in an amendment we 're going to pass to the 1934 Home Mortgage Moratorium Act . This will be some-1 thing else . " Holds " Burlesque " Election . Abe Mickal , Louisiana State University football star , was " State Senator " Mickal tonight , " eligible " by Senator Long 's decree to sit in ' the Legislature 's special session . Long said that " if he had anything to do with it " Abe " would sit . " Mickal , who sat recovering from an injury on the sidelines today while Louisana State was defeating George Washington University , 6 to 0 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from East Baton Rouge Parish " by an assembly of fellow-students that the " Kingfish " declared was a " citizens ' mass meeting . " The Senator said that Mickal would sit as a Senator when the Legislature meets , probably Monday night , that he would receive the customary $10 per diem , and that his name would be placed on the Senate electric voting board . Mickal , 20 years old , a junior student from McComb , Miss. , who Came to America as a child immi-1 grant from Syria , was designated I " successor " to former State Sena- tor J. Y. Sanders Jr . of Baton Rouge , foe of Long and elected Tuesday Representative of the Sixth District . The title " Senator " was bestowed on Mickal in an uproarious burlesque show which Long capitalized as a. chance to poke fun at Sanders and his other political enemies . Long had his personal attendant , Joe Messina , sign a " citizens ' mass meeting call , " summoning " all electors and all who ought to be electors " to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an election to fill the vacancy caused by the election of Sanders . The " mass meeting " was held in the university 's Greek theatre . Senator Long drove to the amphitheatre amid student cheers , handed a copy of the " Call " to " Ed " Khoury , Syrian compatriot of Mickal , and 1931 L. S. U. football captain , and told him to read it to the meeting . It was a satirical parody on the " red-hot " citizens ' mass meeting call issued by Long 's Sixth District foes a year ago when Sanders was named " Citizens ' Congressman , " Governor Allen having failed to set an election after Representative Kemp 's death . Messina opened the " meeting " as temporary chairman , and then turned it over to Khory , who read the " call . " Burns Bennett , drum major of the L. S. U. Band , jumped up with a copy of a resolution Long had dictated placing Mickal in nomination . Adoption was moved . " I second it ! " Long bellowed from a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all opposed keep quiet ! " commanded Khory . The opposed kept quiet . " Meeting adjourned ! " shouted the " Kingfish . " " No , no , speech ! " - pleaded the students . Long ascended the rostrum . " Governor Allen 's been a friend of mine , " he said , " but he 's been too high-handed about not setting an election for the Senate from East Baton Rouge . We just had to fill it . If I have anything to do with it , Abe will be seated at this extra session . " He was asked later whether Mickal was legally old enough , whether he was n't a resident of Mississippi and whether he was n't an alien by birth . " Oh , that does n't make any difference , " he replied airily , saying he did n't know the answers to all three questions .
