txt Enrolment in High Schools . Mrs. Barnard 's splendid summary of the history of the American high school in yesterday 's Magazine Section was a superior example of historical reporting . I noticed that in sketching the phenomenal growth in high school enrolment she said that by 1930 the high school enrolled 46 per cent of all the boys and girls between the ages of 14 az  --  d 17 in the country . She continued , " And today it is estimated to have well over half . " Just how much over half is indicated by figures prepared by Emery M. Foster , chief of the Division of Statistics of the United States Office of Education , who , in the April number of The School Review , is quoted as estimating that by 1934-35 " the proportion of the population of appropriate ages represented by the enrolment in public and private secondary schools has probably mounted , during a five-year period , from slightly more than half to seven-tenths .
