Like any other businesslike airline , K. L. M. ( Royal Dutch Air Lines ) likes to run from city to city by the most direct route . But last week its new special London-Warsaw plane service was routed via Copenhagen , Gdynia and south to the Polish capital , avoided the direct route across Germany . <P> Reason for the detour : In forced landings in Germany on the Vienna-London run , Jewish passengers with through tickets were taken up by the Gestapo and disappeared . Presumably they wound up in concentration camps .
