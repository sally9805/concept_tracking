txt Business of Procter &; Gamble Co. during the past three weeks has been considerably above normal in all departments . " Herbert G. French , vice president , said . " Better than normal " business currently . following the only slight recession in sales in the first months of the pronounced general business slump , adds considerable assurance that sales for the year ending June 30 will at least equal and probably exceed record sales of $202 , - 213,831 reported for year ended June 30 , 1929 . Net profits for this year , considering both the report for the first six months ended December 31. 1929. which showed earnings of $11,639,819. and current operations , should be in excess of $21,000,000 , which would set a new high record and compare with $19,148,933 for year ended June 30. 1929 . Such earnings would be equal to about $3 25 a share on the common stock after allowing for preferred dividends . Earnings for the last fiscal year were equal to 52.89 a share on the common stock , which was split five-forone last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slightly above normal because of company 's guaranteed employment plan which assures employes 4S weeks of work a year , is now down to normal . This guaranteed employment plan was adopted in 1923. 55% of Year 's Net in First Six Months Although company previously had not reported earnings for six months periods , it is understood that in past years it earned about 55% of its year 's net in the first six months of its fiscal year . If this should hold true this year , and every indication is that it will , net for six months ending June 30. 1930. should approximate 59,500,000. which would bring the year 's total to above $21,000,000 . The company is maintaining a good ratio of profit to sales . Various economies in manufacturing have been effected in recent years which are now reflected in decreased operating expenses . For the year ended June 30 1929 , company earned 9.47 cents per dollar sales , as against 8.63 cents in the preceding year . For this year the ratio will probably be larger , and may be better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable for Proctor &; Gamble . Raw materials which the company uses are slightly lower than last year . while prices of soap and other products sold by P. &; G. have not dechned in sympathy . May Declare Stock Dividend In the light of good earnings prospects for this year , an extra disbursement , in the form of a stock dividend or possibly 2 , , ; - , or 3%- , is likely to be declared in the latter part of the year . Within a year and a half the company will have increased its production facilities by onethird . Its Baltimore plant , now under construction , will ship its first products by August 1 . and its Long Beach , California , unit , building of which began a few weeks ago , should be in production by late 1931 or early 1932 . Each of these plants will cost approximately $5,000,000 and will be complete soapmaking units , producing every Procter &; Gamble product for consumption in its territory . With completion of its Baltimore and Long Beach plants the company will have its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretofore been handicapped in its operations in the Pacific coast region by long-haul shipping charges . Once production is begun in this section the company should obtain a much larger business as sales in the western states have heretofore constituted a small part of its operations . The Long Beach plant , in addition to supplying the requirements for the Pacific coast area , also will serve as a shipping point to the Orient where the company does a large business . Procter &; Gamble also obtains many of its raw products from the Orient which con be processed and partially prepared at the Long Beach plant before being sent to other plants for final manufacture . This should mean quite a saving as heretofore the company has had to ship these raw materials in their primary state to its plants inland which resulted in heavy shipping charges .
