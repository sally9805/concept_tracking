In spite of large corps of professional blood donors , and well-stocked blood banks , hospitals often need blood for emergency transfusions . Last week Dr. Harry Davis of the University of Tennessee Medical School at Memphis , reported that he had used a common medical waste product , ascitic fluid , as a successful substitute for blood . <P> Ascitic fluid is a clear yellow serum , similar to blood , but more watery , containing neither red nor white blood corpuscles . It collects in the swollen abdomens of persons suffering from dropsy , a condition resulting from cirrhosis of the liver or certain types of heart disease . To relieve pain the patient 's abdomen is tapped , and the fluid drained out . Often as much as 410 ounces is withdrawn , and the patient is glad to get rid of it . <P> The fluid , said Dr. Davis , can not be given to patients who need red blood corpuscles , but only to those who suffer from shock due to loss of blood and who need to maintain a normal amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filtered and typed , just like ordinary blood . Transfusions have been given to nine patients suffering from such diverse ailments as kidney infections , alcoholism , malaria , cancer and gunshot wounds . One man even acted as his own dropsy donor , when Dr. Davis removed 34 ounces of fluid from his stomach , promptly pumped them back into his arm . <P> Ascitic fluid is not so good as whole blood , because it is not so rich , but it has two important advantages : 1 ) it can be obtained " without cost " ; 2 ) it can be safely refrigerated for periods as long as five months , while ordinary blood deteriorates within two weeks . " Thus it can be moved long distances , as in the case of a war , so long as it is safely cooled , " concluded Dr. Davis .
