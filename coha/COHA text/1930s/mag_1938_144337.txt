THESE BARS OF FLESH-T . S. Stribling - Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> Andrew Barnett was a portly , ruddy-faced , middle-aged Georgia politician . When he was in the legislature he fathered a bill requiring all county superintendents of schools tohave college degrees . But when he voted for a measure compelling farmers to put up fences , the opposition gave him such a hiding it was a wonder he was elected school superintendent afterwards . People voted for him for the same reason that women were kind to him-because he was big , good-natured , could n't quite take care of himself . But as school superintendent Andy had to have a college degree . Leaving Matilda and the kids in Georgia , he registered in Megapolis University 's summer school , where he made a small sensation by giving homely accounts of his troubles to strangers , discoursing amiably on the superstitions of Negroes and the laws of practical politics , keeping his appreciative eyes open for the beauties of Northern womanhood . <P> Andy was no mental giant . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simp Barnett . Since he bought newspapers only when the newsboys shouted something that interested him , his knowledge of current events was sketchy . But with his unhurried way of talking , his patient attempts to find out if acquaintances had any kinspeople in Atlee County , he made friends , soon found himself written up as an expert on folklore . Before he knew it he was an unpaid ghost writer for the high-pressure , racketeering Dr. Fyke , who wrote books on sex and income , on how to make people notice you , and who conducted experiments in telepathy with a pretty , unmoral girl named Marie Redeau . Andy could not do Dr. Fyke 's work , but when he persuaded a rival professor to do it his feat so tickled the dean that he was given a class of his own-in practical politics , where he talked about his own campaigns . Andy was very well pleased with the way things were going , especially his love affairs , when he ran into trouble . One day he told a nice-mannered young reporter that university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the country , and out of a job . <P> Until this point in These Bars of Flesh readers are likely to enjoy Thomas Sigismund Stribling 's 13th novel as a satire on Southerners and educators , and to enjoy it most when it approaches farce . But Author Stribling sets his stage for comedy only to get moodily mystical , rings in some queer high jinks involving a stolen television device , Russian spies , long-winded philosophers and spiritualistic seances , until the line between what he is satirizing and what he is taking seriously becomes blurred . When the medium goes into her last trance , and even Simp begins to talk about the triumph of spirit over matter , readers are left wondering whether Author Stribling is kidding them , Simp , or himself .
