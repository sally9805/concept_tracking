txt Politicians were so agog over Governor ROOSEVELT 'S message to the Legislature , and were so convinced in advance that he would attack President HOOVER , that they find what they want , whether it exists or not . The Governor explicitly refuses to hold any individual or group or party solely responsible for our present condition . It is true that he laments a lack of the right kind of leadership . But will any Republican weakly admit that the demand for a leader is the same thing as a violent denunciation of Mr , HOOVER ? Besides , the Governor 's language is broad and comprehensive . He refers to " the leaders " of American thought in govern " merit and in business " who have come short . Toward the end of his message he is emen more inclusive , speaking of the duty of " leaders " ' in business , finance , agriculture , 4 ' labor and government . " Indeed , a careful reader of the message would find more points of accord with the President than ow disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of localities to take care of local needs is emphasized . Governor ROOSF:vELT was primarily addressing the Legislature and the people of the Stale of New York . He was endeavoring to inform them of the actual state of the public business and of our social needs in the existing emergency . As a prudent administrator should , he was fixing his eye first of all upon the problems of State finance . We are facing a large deficit . It must be made good by added and higher taxes . What these ought to be , in the Governor 's opinion , he briefly indicates , deferring details until he presents the Executive Budget to the Legislature . Upon the necessity of several thorough reforms in the banking laws and the banking practices of New York he has strong convictions which he tersely expresses . - Most of the other subjects which he takes up in his message are strictly for this State . It is the Governor of New York who is speaking , not a candidate for the Presidency discoursing largely on national topics . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , Mr. ROOSEVELT does take occasion , in the course of discussing State affairs , to reveal something of his general political and social philosophy . These expressions will be eagerly seized upon by both friends and opponents . The former will read into his statements a spirit of moderation and constructiveness which the times require . Those who have suspected him of radicalism , or of a purpose to seek political support from Western agitators , will pounce upon one rather vague phrase of his . It is where he speaks of the need of restoring " economic liberty " to the individual citizen . Is this a cautious dilution of " economic slavery " which extremists have been taking as a favorite political complaint ? Probably not . Governor ROOSEVELT is a man of warm , humane sympathies , but not one to allow emotion to becloud his intellect . No upsetting plans , no Socialistic proposals , however mild and winning in form , could appeal to a public man who warns the Legislature against destroying or tearing down , except in order to rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his message that " thi " American system of economics an'i " government is everlasting .
