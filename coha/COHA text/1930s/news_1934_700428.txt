In making public the report the Controller stressed that it in no way gives an accurate picture of the city 's straitened financial condition . Within a few weeks , he said , he hopes to make public an accurate , Atatement of the city 's finances " so clear and comprehen- , sive that any one who will take the trouble to read it can be fully in- I formed " as to just how the city , stands financially . Covers Walker Rule . " Just by coincidence , " the Controller said , " the summary covers the last eight years of Tammany rule , including the full term in office of former Mayor Walker . " The outstanding feature of the eight-year period , according to the report , is the huge increase in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of 1926 it rose to $2,368,437,704.48 as of Dec. 31 , 1933 , an increase of $802,583,978.38 . Last year , the report shows , the city received a grand total of $1 , - 100,212,037 .65 from all sources and paid out a total of $1,058,599,127.11 . This represented a reduction in receipts of some $480,000,000 as compared with 1932 and a reduction in expenditures as compared with those of that year of some $517 , - 000,000 . The largest share of the revenue for 1933 , $640,300,148.31 , came from real estate and personal property taxes  --  from assessments on realty collectible with taxes , from water rents , State aid for schools , franchise fees , licenses , fines and penalties of various sorts . Of this-total $2,192,419.83 came as the city 's share of the State beer tax . The rest of the receipts was made up of borrowings from the public , the pension funds and the sinking funds . Re Favors Publicity . " The form of this report is not of my devising , " said the Controller in making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the city as it deals only with the cash summary of what the city received and what it expended . In my opinion , there should be nothing secret about any financial report dealing with the city , and I intend later to issue a clear and comprehensive statement of all financial dealings in which the city has an interest , so clear , I hope , that any one can understand it . There was some question about issuing this report at all , but we finally decided to do so . Remember , it only reflects conditions up to Dec. 31 , 1933 , just before we took office . " In 1933 , the report showed , the city 's debt was increased by $89 , - 915,000 , materially less than in any of the preceding seven years . On the other hand debt redemption during the year was only $16,165 , - 487 , less than a quarter of what it was in 1932 . This was mainly owing to the abandonment during the year of the Delaney plan of fin- ancing subway construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eight year record of nearly a billion dollar increase in the city debt showed that subway construction accounted for more than half the total , the figure being $548 , 660 000 . Improvements in the city 's water supply system added $95,354 , - 000 to the debt ; dock improvements 545.736,000 ; school construction $172,747.125 , and what was described as " various municipal projects , " namely , " hospitals , the Brooklyn Municipal Building , Stc. " $120,779 , - 800 . It cost the city $2,040,000 , added to its debt , for plans for the Brooklyn-Staten Island tunnel , since abandoned . Sewer and highway debt charges totaled $65,870 , - 000 and home and emergency work relief . all in the last two years added $86,000,000 to the city debt burden . Last year 's expenditures naturally were lower for the various city departments than they had been for some years past due to the economy moves of the O'Brien administration . These expenditures naturally closely followed the department budget appropriations . The report makes no mention of the size of the 1934 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reopened by pending legislation ? in other words , the LaGuardia administration 's economy bill .
