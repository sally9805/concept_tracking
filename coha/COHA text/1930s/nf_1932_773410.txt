txt // conditioned response , or the more complex forms of behavior . We have already pointed out ( Chapter III ) that the anatomical structure of the human hand is extremely important in the development of human activities . The high degree of flexibility of the hand , coupled with a highly developed brain , results in the possibility of a great variety of responses in man that can not be equaled by any other animal . We need only think of the highspeed typist , the skilled mechanic , the artist , and the sculptor to realize how far man has been able to advance his culture because he possesses a facile hand and a highly complex nervous system . This combination has perhaps played a greater role in the cultural advance of man than any other mechanism in his possession , unless it be conceded that the language mechanism surpasses it in importance . Yet it is problematical how far man could have developed his language processes had he not first possessed hands capable of variable manipulation which permitted the fabrication of tools and weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the building of houses . In the first responses of the infant , the finger , the hand , and the arm activities are quite uncoordinated . For several weeks the thumb , as a rule , plays no part in the grasping reflex and is usually enclosed by the fingers . When a slender object , such as a pencil or the nurse 's finger , touches the palm , the grasping reflex of the four fingers may be so strong that the infant can sustain its entire weight . When not directly stimulated , the hands are more frequently near the face . If the infant is active , the hands move in a random fashion , to the mouth , // above the head , and frequently strike the face in various places . ' We have seen ( p. 135 ) that the infant may , even in the first few days , push with its hands against a pain-inciting stimulus on the face , though this reaction is not well established . Out of these casual bits of behavior we may trace the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the hand is in random movement , it comes in contact with a small object , the object would be grasped , and further random movements might carry it to the mouth . Even if the object does not come in contact with the mouth , the infant is receiving stimuli of contact and stimuli of moving muscles ( kinesthetic ) which are becoming conditioned . At the same time , the neuromuscular system is maturing . These two factors , maturation and practice , can not be adequately separated in our analysis . Add to these contact with the mouth and the consequent sucking reactions , and you have the beginnings of coordinated movements . Furthermore , the object may be seen ; that is , it stimulates visual receptors which stimulation leads to the further conditioning of the eye-hand coordination . These various factors ? tactual , visual , kinesthetic ? are consequently being organized into the control of movements . At first there is no definite reaching for objects . The sight of the object may lead to random movements of the arms , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random movements may bring the hand in contact with the object . The playful activity of handling and seeing leads to the more definite reaching and grasping movements . The activity gradually becomes more confined // to the precise movements , and the random movements drop out . At a still later date the infant will reach for objects that are outside his range of contact . If they are already familiar or attractive , he may extend the reaching movements so far that he topples over , if he has been sitting alone . The reaching may continue while he lies in this sprawling position , but there is no progress at this stage of his development in the form of crawling or other locomotion . The develompent of eye-hand coordination in adults is illustrated by numerous acquisitions of habits , such as the use of tools , or the skill of the dentist or surgeon . In the laboratory the experiment is most easily conducted by the requirement of movements opposed to those most frequently made with reference to the object as seen . For example , if prisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaced a given amount to the right , and the subject is instructed to raise his right hand quickly and touch a vertical line placed at arm 's length directly in front , he will raise his hand as much to the right as the displacement . As his hand comes into the field of vision , that also appears displaced to the right and must be moved to the left to touch the line in spite of the kinesthetic cues which report that the first movements should have been correct . With repeated trials in rapid succession , the error of movement is diminished until at the end of about 30 trials the hand is carried directly to the line . If now the prisms are removed , the error appears to the left of the line , but it is more quickly eliminated . At the beginning the adult subject comes to the exGenesis // periment with definite eye-hand coordinations already established . The relation between the visual and kinesthetic cues is upset by the prisms The formation of the kinesthetic responses with the new visual stimulation , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established . This situation is also illustrated by the mirror drawing experiment , in which the subject is required to trace a figure while viewing the hand and figure in a mirror . ( Valentine , Experiment 29 . ) Reference should be made at this point regarding right and left handedness . Numerous theories have been proposed , some of them based upon social and some on biological grounds , to account for the fact most persons give preference to the right hand in the first year or so in the handling of objects . This is a later acquisition , but it can not be satisfactorily explained on the basis of such social factors as imitation , or the manner in which the infant is carried by the mother or the nurse . The occasional left-handed child , and the persistence of this dominance of the left hand , would refute the former hypothesis , while ' the lack of uniformity in the manner in which infants are handled would make the latter even more dubious . Among the biological theories the only one that appears acceptable is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left cerebral hemisphere . In cases of lesion in the corpus callosum ( the band of axones which connects the two hemispheres ) it is found that the individual retains normal control of the movements of the right side of the body , but the control of the left side is diminished . This would indicate two important functions of the left hemisphere ; namely , that 1.54 General Psychology it controls the right side of the body , and also that it exercises some control of the right hemisphere . Thus , the lesion , which cuts off communication between the two hemispheres , results in the diminished coordination of the left side of the body because the dominant left hemisphere can not function in these movements . In the case of left-hand dominance , it is assumed that the right cerebral hemisphere dominates and thus exercises a more perfect control over the left side of the body , as well as partial control over the left hemisphere . Locomotion. ? The typical infant exhibits a series of locomotor activities grading through crawling , creeping , and finally walking upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the infant reaches for objects and tumbles over on the floor , he has begun his locomotor development so far as conditioning responses are concerned . In reaching for objects while lying on the floor , he may roll over . This may , or may not , bring him nearer the object . Stretching or vigorous reaching resembles the early stages of crawling . Usually , however , the legs play little part in the crawl at first . The hands and arms seem to be the most important . Before the ' infant can crawl , he may raise his head and shoulders by means of his hands and arms . This usually results in pushing himself backwards away from the object , but nearer some other object . In this way the combination of tumbling , rolling , and crawling makes up the sum of locomotor activity . If at this time footnote " Valentine , W. L. , " The Development of Locomotion . " Movie film prepared at Ohio State University . Burnside , L. H. , " Coordination in the Locomotion of Infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 2 , pp. 279-374. // the infant is stood upon his feet , he stands upon his toes with his heels well off the floor , when he supports his weight at all . If he is tilted forward slightly , he may lift both feet at once . The alternate movement of the legs develops later through a series of rather uncoordinated movements . When creeping begins , the legs serve little purpose save as a partial support for the body , though some infants get the knees under their bodies earlier in the process than others do . The crawl gradually develops into creeping . Soon after creeping is fairly well organized , one foot frequently will be brought forward and , naturally , to one side . This may develop into a new type of locomotion . One infant was observed to swing his body between one foot and his hands , thus traveling at a good rate of speed . Frequently , both feet are brought into operation and the infant travels on his hands and toes more easily than he could upon his knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant is balanced upon his feet and supported by the hands , he will walk , but his gait will resemble that of the tabetic . His legs shoot out to the side or too high . Week by week , it will be seen that the coordinations improve until he is able to walk without support . Hrdlicka ' 9 collected a large number of anecdotes regarding children who run on all fours , more like the lower animals . Though this resemblance to the lower animal 's mode of locomotion is rather striking , it should be recognized that the human infant adopts this method only accidentally , and not because he is passing through a lower animal stage . One infant sat with his right leg . // drawn close to his body , the left leg extended to the side , and both hands on the floor to his right . He would then swing between hands and left foot , extend hands and foot forward , and swing again . He could travel by this method as rapidly as could another infant by creeping . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg , then the other . She would use this method even after she could walk upright , apparently because she was still a bit unstable in the upright position . Sooner or later the child learns to walk upright because his skeletal structure is such that this is finally the easiest and most satisfactory mode of locomotion , and it also leaves the hands free for other functions . Evidently the nerve patterns , particularly of the cord and cerebellum , are developing during this period , just as in the tabetic they are degenerating . Some infants are reported who never " learned " to walk , but one day got up in the middle of the floor and started off . Just how much development of the neuromuscular system , and how much learning or conditioning have to do with the adjustment to walking has not been accurately determined . It would appear that here again we can not distinguish between those factors due to maturation of the neuromuscular system and those due to the effects of practice or learning . Both are important . The sensory-motor processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate only a few of them . An object at a distance is the visual stimulus , which , through reaching , crawling , and creeping , has finally led to the more efficient walking response . Later other stimuli set up the same response . But the walking process itself involves a mass of sensory-motor responses that // have become so coordinated and are so complicated that it is next to impossible to describe them . The pressure of the foot upon the floor initiates a group of sensory responses , which lead to muscular contractions that preserve balance . These become associated with the impulses from the semicircular canals . As the body swings forward in walking , the stretching of the tendon Achilles and the pressure on the ball of the foot stimulate receptors that lead to motor responses . The patellar reflex is also involved . Therefore , not only efferent impulses from the cortex down the pyramidal tracts , but also afferent impulses from proprioceptors are important . We may assume that the basis of walking is in the inherited connections of the nervous system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual . The mechanism of vocal response. ? The organs of speech are more complex than is generally appreciated by one who has not studied these mechanisms , involving not only the vocal cords and tongue , but also the whole diaphragm , mouth cavity , and nose as well . The vocal cords , which more nearly resemble two lips , are located in the larynx , one on either side . The sound is produced by the vibration of these lips as the air from the lungs is forced between them , when they are contracted or drawn together . The lungs , however , act as a resonating chamber as well as a bellows , thus amplifying the sound and giving some of the voice quality , which distinguishes one voice from another . The vocal cords simply supply a complex of vibrations , or noise , and it is by means of a system of resonators that these vibrations are properly amplified to produce the many // sounds that are combined into speech and Iater into spoken language . The pharynx and nose are rather constant resonators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence their importance be greater in some sounds than in others . The greatest variability comes through the changing form and size of the mouth cavity . The importance of these resonators is forcefully illustrated by a recent invention to be used by persons who have suffered the destruction of the larynx . Usually a tube has been inserted into the trachea below the larynx through which they breathe . To this is attached a rubber tube leading to the " artificial larynx " ; this tube resembles an ordinary briar pipe , of the Dawes variety , the stem of which is held in the mouth . Within the bowl of this is a thin ribbon of rubber . Of course the subject had previously learned to talk . Now , as he speaks , his lungs expel the air in the same controlled manner as by a person with a normal larynx , and the mouth cavity and lips are formed naturally . The result is the vibrating of the rubber ribbon and the proper resonance of the mouth , which produces words that are practically as distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference is that the artificial larynx produces a monotone , while the pitch of the normal larynx may be . considerably varied . Development of speech. ? We have described rather briefly the mechanism involved in vocal response . It now remains to see how these responses are developed . The first cry of the infant has already been referred to , which is rapidly developed into a distinct cry that seems to be closely associated with discomfort as the initiating // stimulus . Opposed to this is a soft sound while feeding . Later the infant utters many sounds that resemble principally the vowels , a sort of crowing and gurgling that is repeated as he lies unheeded in his bed . We may presume that these are due to some internal stimulus , or feeling of well-being , or that external stimuli set up the response , though the exact nature of the stimulus can not always be determined . These vocal responses themselves set up two systems of stimuli , the auditory and kinesthetic , which initiate a repetition of the response . Through these repetitions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds become more definite or coordinated . One of the early developments is " mama . " In one infant this occurred during a period of illness , though he certainly had never heard the word . The syllable was usually repeated several times , as " mamamam , " generally ending in gyn . Whether this became conditioned as a signal of his distress by the help of attendants is uncertain . Another factor that plays an important part here , as perhaps in all conditioning , is the social factor generally known as imitation . Anyone who has observed a child and his attendants carefully has found that the adults frequently repeat what the child does . This affords a new stimulus to the child , for he hears his own sounds without the kinesthetic ' response of actually making the sounds himself . In this way an association is established between sounds made by himself and the same sounds made by another . After this process is established , it is a short step to making sounds that others make that he has never made . I60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensory-motor response should be distinguished from those responses , vocal or manual , which have a social significance , as language . Many of the early responses may be considered language in this sense in that they serve as social stimuli to other individuals . The cry of mama may be conditioned with a state of discomfort and being cared for . On the other hand many accurately pronounced words may be mere vocalizing . We say that they have no meaning for the child . He has merely learned to say them . Broadly speaking , language may be considered as any response that serves as a stimulus to another individual and that has been conditioned with a particular situation , though usually we refer to verbal types of response.20 Language , therefore , may be best conceived as a highly socialized way of dealing with objects and situations . It is not only a form of response , but also a form of stimulation of other individuals , which has many advantages over the non-verbal forms of stimulation and response . In the first place , it leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . One can talk or signal another at the same time that he is throwing a spear or using tools . This means greater cooperation of the individuals of the group who may be involved in the same project . In the second place , language makes possible communication in the dark , around corners , and , through modern invention , at great distances . Finally , language requires less energy than would be necessary if the acts symbolized had to be footnote " Weiss , A. P. , A Theoretical Basis of Human Behavior , Chapter XIII . R. G. Adams and Company , 1929. // performed . If the child desires something that is out of his reach , he may merely ask for it . The adult can describe a former experience , or give directions for the building of a machine , or direct the activities of a nation . ' The conditioning of vocal sounds into a language habit is illustrated by the following example . The child first learned to drink from a glass when it was held to his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presented . " Do you want some milk ? " In time he came to reach for the glass , which evidently meant that he wanted milk . He saw the milk , reached for it , and the glass was held for him . Later the word , " milk , " evidently meant milk , even though the milk was not in sight . His wants would be more easily understood , if he could say milk . Various sounds were made ( vocalizing ) which frequently led to someone saying milk and getting it for him . His first satisfactory utterance in this case was " mut . " Others repeated it and got the milk . Soon this became a word in his little community on all occasions where milk was involved . The boy who delivered milk to the house he named the " mut-boy . " This was as truly a language habit as though he had spoken properly . It was conditioned by its frequent occurrence as a stimulus with an object . That the word was not properly pronounced , but tolerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's manual habits . He may use a hammer in imitation of an adult , though so inadequately that he accomplishes little , save the marring of the furniture . That he may footnote ' de Laguna , Grace A. , Speech , Its Function and Development . Yale University Press , 1927. // recognize his inaccuracy , though unable to correct it , is shown by his attempts to get an older person to say the word correctly for him . Many of these words are hardly inaccurate pronunciations , but new words that develop accidentally . The sound made with reference to a certain object is quickly picked up by others and becomes a language habit . The words dume ( good ) , potish ( pencil ) , shashy ( handkerchief ) , hahum ( hammer ) , and pouchy ( spank ) are of this character , developed by one boy and remaining a part of the family vocabulary for several years . Much of the so-called " baby talk " may be classed as absurdities of the adult that are foisted upon the infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will quickly develop the same type , except for his early inability to control his vocal apparatus . The child referred to seldom made a grammatical error or used a faulty expression until he went to school . We have selected only a few of the types of response to illustrate the process of conditioning new responses . We may consider , however , that the total behavior of the adult is a combination of responses that have been acquired in this manner . There is a modicum of heredity in that he has certain neuromuscular equipment to develop along some lines more easily than along others . He has inherited a physcial organism that is adapted to the type of development that we call human , the most important of which is the elaboration of the higher brain centers and the development of the speech mechanism and manual structure . Through the development of language and manual dexterity , the human organism more completely dominates his environment than is the // case with any other animal . If he is cold , he artificially adapts his environment to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , and finally heating them . Problems 1 . Pick out one of your own dominant types of behavior , and trace its development from the first types of activity that you as an infant were capable of performing . What were probably the major conditioning stimuli ? 2 . Make a list of verbal responses that are truly language but are not words found in the dictionary , or have a widely different meaning in different parts of the country . Try to explain their origin as social stimuli . 3 . Do children learn to walk upright , or is this type of locomotion hereditary in the human species ? Marshal the facts on both sides of the argument . What is your final conclusion ? 4 . The swimming of a young duckling or of a dog is practically perfect the first time he enters the water , but man generally learns to swim . How would you account for this difference ? What are the characteristic differences in the behavior possibilities of each species ? To what would you apply the term instinct ? 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he lacks the proper vocal organs for speech . If we could transplant human vocal organs to a dog , what would be the possibilities of his language development ? 6 . You can pick up the pencil on the table and write your name with perfect ease . Enumerate the various factors that would render this behavior less perfect if any one of them were destroyed . CHAPTER V The Motivation of Behavior Stimuli as triggers. ? Why do we do what we do ? Why does the young man go to college , and why does he elect psychology as one of his subjects for study ? He will usually say that he goes to college to get an education or a B. A. degree , and that he elects psychology because he thinks it will be interesting , or that he needs the credit . Neither answer is entirely correct , of course . Why does a man work ? Not merely to secure food and shelter ordinarily , though that is one of the first causes . We are constantly asking such questions and seeking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best years of our lives to satisfy the ambition for wealth , fame , notoriety , or to fulfill an ideal . Men sacrifice their lives to rescue the lives of others , or to win them to their religion ; they face danger or certain death in wars to make the world safe for a certain religion or for a political issue . Why are men so ambitious ? Why do they have such impelling desires ? We have already referred ( p. 141 ) to the fact that certain conditions of the organism must be presupposed before certain specific stimuli will result in the specific response . We call some of these physiological conditions of the organism physiological tension , urge , or drive . Thus , hunger , or the need for food , resulting in rhythmic contractions of the stomach , is a drive which ultimately 165 // leads to food-getting , provided the correct response is hit upon . Activity in the sex glands furnishes the drive which ends in the adaptive response of copulation under the proper external stimulating conditions . A drive at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue depends upon the stimuli furnished by the external environment . If food , or the stimuli connected with the food supply , is present , more or less definite responses will lead to the elimination of the hunger drive . The sex drive , also , will first be manifested as random or varied activities , but if one of the opposite sex is present , or objects associated with the sex object , the responses will be more direct with reference to these stimuli . Not all drives terminate in responses of equal definiteness or uniformity when the drive is present for the first time . The hunger drive is usually more directly satisfied than the sex drive , apparently because the food-getting responses are more nearly ready to function , while such drives as that resulting from a high rate of metabolism , the " feeling of well-being , " may result in general activity which takes the form of play , vocalizing , and so forth , and may lead to the development of any of a number of reaction patterns . For this reason it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human organism . Any classification must be based upon the resulting behavior . As this will vary according to the environmental conditions , our classifications are but tentative at best . Drives and motives. ? It is convenient to make a distinction between drive and motive . The drive is merely the physiological condition , a tension , which results in // irritability and general activity . The motive is the more psychological condition , derived from the drive in which the satisfying object has become an objective toward which the individual reacts . A hungry animal placed in a puzzle box makes all sorts of random responses . When he finally hits the latch , he is given food . We can not say he was possessed of a motive to get food . With successive trials he is activated not only by the hunger drive , but also by the objective , food . The suckling infant is dominated by the physiological condition , hunger . The laborer is working in order that he may buy food , so that he may eat tomorrow or next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sex , and many other conditions in his social life . Motive , therefore , is an outgrowth of the behavior of the individual , founded upon drives , and the behavior patterns which have been acquired during his life history . , Motives may be extended to all sorts of situations . Instincts and drives. ? Another question may arise as to what is the difference between drives or motives , and instincts . According to the descriptions of instincts given by some authorities , there is little difference . It has been pointed out ( p. 140 ) that there are no specific behavior patterns other than simple reflexes which can be considered innate adjustments to particular situations . Pillsbury has described instinct in much the same terms that we have defined the drive or motive . He further shows that the behavior becomes definite because the varied reactions bring about a new situation . The " appropriate response " is hit upon which brings about a new stimulus and a terminal response , one that is satisfactory or appropriate to the conditions of the organism . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and function of the individual concerned . With repetition this terminal response becomes more definitely selected . Instinct in this sense is at first a close parallel to what we consider the drive ; the later development , on the other hand , corresponds more nearly to the motive . Instinct , however , always refers to the innate or inherited factors . While we must recognize that all behavior rests ultimately upon the original nature of the individual , it is impossible to separate , in any particular event , what is innate from what is acquired learning . Furthermore , the distinction is not necessary for the study of behavior so long as we recognize that there can be no behavior without specific structure . The animal is hungry . This condition leads to random behavior which ultimately brings food and thus " satisfies " the condition , and we say that the response which brought food was " appropriate . " Positive and negative responses. ? We have already had occasion several times to refer to the fact that the organism reacts to certain stimuli by withdrawing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward or accepting the object , or stimulus . These are characteristic reactions that need to be emphasized as of the greatest importance in the development of behavior . In the unicellular organisms , such as the amoeba and the paramecium , we say that they react to a strong light by moving away from it ( negative heliotropism ) . To a drop of acid they react in a similar way , while to bits of food they display a positive tropism , or movement toward the food particle . We have found that the infant accepts the breast , and that his eyes follow a bright object . // On the other hand , he withdraws his foot if it is pinched , or pushes away the object , or struggles to remove the object when withdrawing the member so stimulated is impossible . Positive responses are movements toward a stimulus , which increase the stimulus or bring other stimulation which we interpret as favorable from the standpoint of the individual reacting . Negative responses are those which tend to eliminate the stimulation that is unfavorable . Each satisfies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing about more favorable stimulation , and the negative by reducing the unfavorable stimulation . Without this distinction it would be impossible to conceive of the development of behavior such as we see in the adult human being in his complicated adjustments to an ever-changing physical and social environment . Some fundamental drives. ? According to the foregoing description , all drives result in general activity , and it is only with repetition under the proper stimulating conditions that these internal conditions become associated with specific forms of response . This , however , is no obstacle to a tentative classification and description of some drives as fundamental to the development of human behavior . By fundamental we mean those drives that are basic or primary in the sense that they are the first manifestations of conditions of the organism which may later be the important factors in the development of other drives or motives . Hunger. ? We have seen that the condition of hunger is responsibile for varied movements of the infant , which may be described as a general restlessness , until hunger // is removed . Certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sucking movements also indicate that there are some rather definite patterns of response ready to function . In observations of infants , as well as of older children and adults , this seems to be the only drive which is equipped with a fairly well organized response , which leads to an end satisfying the need of the organism . Cannon and Washburn 1 have shown that the condition we know as hunger is associated with rhythmic contractions of the stomach when it is empty . A small rubber balloon attached to a rubber tube was swallowed by the subject . When the balloon was inflated to fill the stomach , and the free end of the tube was attached to a tambour recorder , which wrote upon a revolving drum , tracings of these contractions were recorded . The " sensations of hunger " are pretty definitely established as resulting from these contractions . It is also possible that the tissue needs promote activity more directly , as well as through the stimulation , by these rhythmic contractions . Wada 2 has also shown that not only do these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hunger pangs , but that there is a direct relation between the periods of contraction and the general explicit bodily activities ( Figure 33 ) . One subject , after being thoroughly accustomed to swallowing the baloon and tube , slept in the laboratory during the experiment . He had footnote ' Cannon , W. B. and Washburn , A. L. , " An Explanation of Hunger , " Amer . Jour . Physiol. , 1912 , Vol. 29 , pp. 441-454. 2 Vada , Tomi , " Hunger in Relation to Activity , " Arch . Psych. , 1922 . No. 57. // had dinner at 6:00 p. m. and the experiment started at 10:45 that evening . At 12:15 some body movements were recorded . From then on until morning most of the body movements occurred at the height of the stomach contractions . Two other subjects lay on a couch and read all day . There were numerous body movements at contraction periods , while practically none occurred during t he quiescent cycles . Ligon 3 has recently published results of experiments to test the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run a maze . The time required to reach the exit where the rat might or might not obtain food was taken as the criterion of the drive . The rats were fed all they would eat , once a day . Six , 12 , or 21 hours later they were placed in the maze . Figure 34 presents representative learning curves under these three conditions . It will be seen that the rats that had not been fed for 21 hours reached the food box each time more quickly than either of the other groups . The rats were also placed each day just before the figure // maze test in a revolving cage , which would measure the degree of activity of the rats in terms of the number of revolutions of the cage . The group which had been without food for only 6 hours averaged 143.1 revolutions ; those which had not been fed for 12 hours averaged 121.8 revolutions ; the third group averaged 219.7 revolutions . Ligon believes that these two sets of data indicate that two separate drives are operative , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other the " feeling of well-being " ( activity drive ) . This would account for the fact that the rats that had been fed 6 hours before the maze test did better than the second group . This assumption agrees with the statement above that the general physiological condition associated with an excess of energy is responsible for spontaneous activity . The rats which had been fed 12 hours before the experiment had begun to lose this general activity drive and figure // were not yet sufficiently hungry to be driven to their highest degree of activity . Thirst is also a tissue need which creates a drive of a similar character . We usually refer thirst to the dryness of the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat , though the need for water may be more generalized . The general depletion of the moisture of the bodily tissues that results from extra exertion may not be readily identifiable with any specific locality , yet there is a felt need for water . Sex. ? Certain other tissue changes , particularly the development of the reproductive organs and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are responsible for the general irritability which we are accustomed to consider the sex drive . While the development of the testes in the male and the ovaries in the female are generally considered the chief causes of the sex drive , other tissue changes affecting the whole organism and resulting in the so-called secondary sex characteristics undoubtedly exert an important influence . We say that the boy ( or girl ) becomes conscious of himself . The same is true in the case of hunger , only the hunger drive develops more rapidly and more readily culminates iii a consummatory response . The sex drive develops slowly , and , aside from numerous reflexes , does not develop into a definite pattern of response that is biologically significant until much later in the life of the individual . The characteristic manifestation of the sex drive in the youth is general irritability , but he begins also to react differently to the external stimuli , particularly with reference to those of the opposite sex . Whereas he may // have treated both girls and boys alike , he now begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls . They may be a disturbing element in his environment ; he reacts negatively , because he finds he can not adjust to the new situation . He later has " his girl " because he finds it is easier to adjust to one girl than it is to girls in general , and also , perhaps , because the one is a more dominant social stimulus than the others for the time being . He is also frequently overcritical , even at college age . Insignificant details , dress , manners , color of hair , and so forth , are magnified in importance , as against the total personality of the girl . These are merely symptoms of his difficulty of adjustment . In addition to these visual and more general stimuli resulting from social relations with the opposite sex , bodily contacts bring new stimulations . Embracing and fondling lead to further stimulation and increase of the sex drive . Where the person is ignorant of the meaning and source of these exciting physiological conditions , such exploring alone is responsible for the completion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tensions . Among certain Australian tribes the function of sex is not known . Pregnancy is supposed to be the result of touching certain trees where spirits reside , which enter the body of the woman .4 As civilized society is based upon the family , it has set up certain standards of conduct and accompanying taboos . In our own society , marriage must be delayed , and consequently " petting " is frowned upon as immoral . To what extent proper sex footnote ' Hunter , W. S. , " The Modification of Instinct from the Standpoint of Social Psychology , " Psych . Rev. , 1920 , Vol. 17 , pp. 247-269. // education might remove these dangers is still an important problem . The question is frequently raised as to whether hunger or sex is the stronger drive . Several investigations with animals indicate that if the animal figure is placed in such a position that he may run to food or to the opposite sex , he will choose food , provided he has been deprived of food for any length of time . Tsai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take the path leading to a receptive female only 23 per cent of the times , while they chose the food path 77 per cent of the times . Moss has studied the strength of these drives by the strength of induction shock the rats will tolerate in order to reach the goal . Warden and his associates are continuing investigations of drives at the present time . They use the obtruction box shown in Figure 35 . An induction current of constant intensity is used in the grid B. The animal is placed in compartment A and door di is opened . If he crosses the grid to plate E , this automatically opens door d2 permitting the animal to reach the reward , which 1 76 General Psychology may be food , water , or an animal of the opposite sex . The strength of the drive is determined by the number of crossings the animal will make in order to reach the incentive stimulus.6 Other physiological conditions as drives. ? While both sex and hunger conditions serve as rather definite drives to activity which lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the environment , there are several other less well-defined conditions which also produce activity , though they are not always so easily classified . We have seen that the general tonicity of the organism , which we frequently refer to as a feeling of well-being , is manifested by general activity , often thought of as playful activity . This frequently takes the form of vocalization in the young infant , as cooing and other contented sounds , and of whistling , singing , and shouting in the case of older persons . The opposite condition of fatigue is more likely to lead to rest and sleep , though in many cases it is manifested by restlessness when it evidently causes excessive tensions and stimulations . Bodily temperature is another factor which displays the characteristic of the drive . A temperature above or below a certain optimum results in restlessness or general activity until the proper temperature is again restored . Likewise , internal pains , abdominal pressures , and the like may be considered tissue conditions which come under the category of drives . This raises the issue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same category . footnote Valentine , W. L. , " The Hunger Drive . " ( Warden 's Experiment . ) Movie film prepared at the Ohio State University . // We say that temperature is a drive when we refer to the internal condition which , in reality , is effective only through its stimulation of certain receptors . How many receptors must be stimulated to satisfy our definition ? If only a part of the body is cold , we may still refer to the condition as a drive . In this case , can we limit the condition to the stimulation of one receptor , or at most a few , such as an area stimulated by a cold pointed rod ? The responses are very much the same in both situations . The specific stimulus results in a response which ultimately creates an adjustment to the stimulating condition . In a later chapter ( Chapter VII ) we shall see t hat in those types of behavior which we have chosen to call organized response the complex stimulating situation , involving the stimulation of several types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to one stimulus rather than to another . This " readiness " is very similar to the tension we call the drive . We must recognize this similarity though we retain the term drive for those internal tissue conditions which are responsible for t lie random behavior described . Development of motives. ? In all the preceding cases we have shown that the drive results in a more or less general activity with little or no prescribed pattern of response . After the response has once become adaptive That is , after a response has been made which alleviates the condition ? the next time the behavior may become more direct with reference to the performance of this act . In this case we say that the behavior is motivated with reference to the end to be served . When he is hungry , the infant seeks the breast , the adult seeks // food . The external stimulus now becomes an important factor in the motivation . In the experiments reported , the animals reached the goal , food or mate , because of the general activity which originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also true that in many cases , at least , the animal 's behavior was motivated by the goal itself , particularly after the experiment had been repeated several times . In such cases an increase in the stimulation by the goal may motivate the animal to still greater activity in order to reach it . This is the assumption underlying Warden 's experiments to test the strength of the drive . Kohler also found in his experiments with apes that , if the task were too difficult for the animal , he could often be induced to a successful performance by the adding of more fruit as an incentive . In adult human experience the effect of the stimulus is often seen in cases in which we refuse to work for certain lures , which would partially , at least , satisfy our needs , while a sufficient incentive appears to arouse the internal condition , or drive . The sight of food , or the odor of its cooking , we say , makes us hungry . This effect of increasing the motive is also illustrated by the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were required to add columns of figures as rapidly as possible for 46 days . Each girl was paid a small amount each week . Furthermore , three prizes were awarded to the three who added the greatest amount . Thereafter , each girl was awarded a prize every time she exceeded her previous best record . These prizes were footnote ' Flugel , J. C. , " Practice , Fatigue and Oscillation , " Brit . Jour . Psych. , Mono . Sup. , Vol. 13 , 1928. // increased each week : 1 penny the first week ; 11/2 pence ( lie second week ; 2 pence the third week ; and so on . l'sually practice of a function is accompanied by an increase in proficiency , rather rapid at first , then less and less improvement until no further improvement is to be observed . We say the limit of the practice effect has been reached . In the experiment cited , however , the rate of improvement at the end of the 46 days was as great as at the beginning . Any stipulated reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with it . As the reward was increased each week , its value was presunnably kept constant . Acquisition of motives. ? Most of the motives of modern man have presumably been acquired from his association in the family and immediate environment , which gradually extends to a wider sphere through the medium of language . We may , however , suppose that in the life of primitive man the motives we have described played a very important part in the development of his behavior . Food-getting for the immediate satisfaction of hunger may be extended to accumulating food . Likewise , the sex drive leads to the seeking of the mate , hut later the mate not only motivates sex activity , but also becomes a possession in whose defense he will fight . One may observe similar behavior in the child with regard to possessions . Not only hunger and thirst are satisfied by obtaining food and drink , but many other comforts are attained by objects which are supplied by the parent . Clothes protect from cold , and toys furnish playful activity for excess energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the satisfaction of the wants of the child . Some of these objects , and most // other objects that the child meets , become objects of possession . " Mine " becomes the word applied to all objects to which the child is attracted . It is not necessary to presuppose an instinct of collecting or hoarding to account for these attachments to objects . These attachments are formed by what we have earlier described as the conditioned response . Some objects satisfy certain drives , but other objects also become associated with this behavior without respect to their intrinsic value . Shelter. ? We may again presume that our primitive man was motivated to build himself a house . The desire for a permanent shelter came about through his withdrawal from pain-inflicting , or dangerous , situations . The child may find shelter and protection from strangers and other annoyances by hiding under the table or behind the chair . This does not mean that either the primitive man or the child is motivated by an instinct of shelter or flight . The drive of pain and intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection or removal of the unfavorable stimulus in the case of primitive man ; discomfort , the maladjustment in the presence of strangers , results in similar reactions in the case of the child . As houses are the social inheritance of civilized man , he does not necessarily build his house merely because he is motivated by the primitive desire for shelter . As he has always lived in houses , they have become essential to him through habit . This is carried so far that many people could not alter their present mode of living without suffering great hardships . To sleep in the open on a cloudless night would be next to impossible for them . Flight. ? We have indicated above that the child 0 // manifests fear of strangers , certain objects , and situations . It may be asked , why does the child develop these fears ? Is this an instinct to flee from danger and certain other situations , such as a dark room , furry animals , and snakes ? We must again refer to the statements in the preceding discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preceding chapter . If the child touches the hot stove , he will withdraw . At a later time the sight of the stove may set up the withdrawal response before it is touched . Other objects may also cause pain . In time some objects are known to be harmless , but all new objects may or may not be harmless . Thus two sets of objects set up withdrawal , or the seeking of protection : those objects which have already caused or have been associated with pain , and those which are unfamiliar , and hence may cause fain . Clothing. ? Closely related to the motivation for shelter is 1 hat for protection of the body in the form of clothing . The most common theories presented of the origin of the habit of wearing clothing are modesty and protect ion from cold . To these Dunlap s has added the theory hat clothes were first worn as a protection against insects , as clothes made of grass are worn in tropical countries . Though authorities disagree , it is quite probable one or both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical peoples wear clothes , though they are not needed as a protection from the cold . Furthermore , they are not averse to removing their footnote ' Dunlap , K. , " The Development and Function of Clothing , " Jour . Gen. 1'epeh .. , 1928 , vol. 1 , pp. 64-78. // scanty garb for purposes of swimming , dancing , or participation in athletic sports . Whatever the original motive for wearing clothes , it is a fact that clothes assume an importance through their habitual use . Not only are they worn for the purpose of protection from harmful stimuli , but they assume through custom a definite relation to modesty and refinement . In relation to modesty and the bearing upon sex stimulation , it is doubtful that the exposure of the body is very important , except as it is a violation of the habitual procedure . Conformity. ? The foregoing statement suggests another motive of social origin which has ' far-reaching importance in the behavior of man today . We call it fashion , style , or the desire to conform to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our primitive man may have found himself confronted with the necessity of cooperating with other primitive men in order to secure food or defend himself from the enemy . Even the tactics of the enemy would require adoption , to some degree , of his methods . He would also discover that his neighbors , whether friend or foe , reacted in certain ways that were beneficial to them , and these methods would be imitated . Little by little he developed a habit of imitating , first those most like himself and to a less degree those more removed in similarity . Finally , not to conform , or inability to conform , became disturbing and resulted in a maladjustment to the social group . While the necessity for conformity in civilized society does not always show itself as essential for the satisfaction of fundamental drives , we do learn to imitate at an early age . We have seen that the infant learns to imiThe // tate by being imitated , and thus learns the behavior of his immediate group . He adopts the family mannerisms , language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best get what he needs by conforming to the group . To the extent that his conformity is adequate , we say that he is making adequate social adjustments . The imitation of the group for the purpose of securing satisfaction for fundamental drives has further consequences in that the individual develops this habit of conformity to the extent that he is restless or dissatisfied when he is unable to conform in the less important details . This is particularly evident in the problem of dress . The color of the cloth , the cut of the vest , and other little details are matters of great moment . The same trend is also observed in other forms of behavior . A grade of C is a gentleman 's grade , and to win honors may be as undesirable as to be forced to wear last year 's coat . One conscientious student , who was interested in his work , remarked that he found it embarrassing to get good grades , because he felt isolated from his fellows , though he wanted to do the work . These are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways in which we are motivated to conform . Most of them never occur to us as distinct problems unless we fail to conform . If we are in a group where the conversation and attitude of the others are dignified , we assume a dignified mien ; if the group is carefree , we likewise become carefree and lose our stilted manner . In either case , if we are unable so to adjust our behavior , we are uncomfortable . Preeminence. ? The habits of imitation , which motivate so much of our behavior , are also to some extent // in conflict with the opposite motive , that of expressing our own individuality . Just as we develop a desire to conform , so do we also develop a desire to be preeminent in certain other respects . Man is first concerned with satisfying the inner drives of hunger and protection from harm , and later he is dominated also by the drive of the reproductive functions . We have seen that the child at an early age develops a dominating interest in himself . All things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon , he is still largely dominated by this same motive of self-interest . Hence , it is to be expected that he will strive to got for himself all the advantages possible . He struggles with other men for the possession of food or shelter ; he must compete for the desired mate . In later civilized groups this competition applies to many other wants that have been acquired . So we see that a habit of striving to be the " outstanding man " develops as a natural consequence . ' While this characteristic of preeminence or superiority is directly related to the struggle to satisfy some more fundamental drives , it becomes more generalized into the habit with reference to the individual as a distinct individual in contrast to other individuals . He may no longer strive for food or for the wealth with which to satisfy his fundamental needs , but he may still work to maintain or gain a position of dominance in the group . He also has built up a desire to be recognized as an individual . His name is important to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that men who are paid a commission or a piece price will increase their production ? or efforts ? when a competition is established for a prize , such as a banner or medal for service , in spite of the fact // that their increased sales or production would mean increased wealth with which to satisfy their needs . During the War millions of men were thrown together with their lives directed by the rules of the army . They were dressed in uniforms ; they maneuvered " as one man " ; their distinctions were quite effectively eliminated . The result was an almost universal attempt to acquire distinction . Not only were chevrons , epaulets , and medals of distinction highly regarded , but men of the ranks violated regulations in every way possible in order to mark themselves as " outstanding men . " A bit of ribbon would be seen attached to a buttonhole , a silver chain with half-franc pieces dangled on the wrist , or the cap was modified contrary to specifications . Rules of conduct were also violated in many cases for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of motives. ? Where there are many drives and motives , there is always the possibility that more than one will be making demands for action at the same time . In primitive types of behavior the hunger drive and the sex drive may both be insistent . The satisfaction of the one may leave the other unsatisfied , or it may even make its later satisfaction impossible by removing the organism from the presence of the proper object . We have seen that , in the case of the experiments with animals , this was true . When both food and a mate were presented , the animal was required to select the one at the expense of losing the other . In other situations he was required to disregard the drive for avoiding pain in order to reach the object which would satisfy the other drive . In daily life we are constantly faced with similar conflicts between motives . In football the player must sacrifice preemi1.86 General Psychology nence for good teamwork ; a student must choose between doing his work and having a date ; on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accomplishing some task which will bring satisfaction at a later date . How do we deal with these conflicts when they arise ? In many cases it is merely a matter of relative strength of the motives concerned . Shall I play golf today or continue to write ? The golf motive may be strong because of many reasons ? the need of exercise , the association with friends , and the ambition to better the score I made yesterday . On the other hand , the writing motive is also strong . I have promised to finish this chapter today ; there is other work that is pressing ; I have made a habit of doing a certain amount of work each day and have an ambition to succeed . If I play golf , I satisfy the urge that I have developed in that direction , and I may find that the work does not suffer as a consequence , in which case both motives eventually are satisfied . If I remain at my work , however , the golf may be entirely forgotten for today . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to the situation , and the other merely ceases to exist . The stimulating situation , golf , is forgotten . The reduction of the conflict is not always so simple , when the drives or motives are particularly insistent . Sometimes each motive influences the behavior in part , so that the resultant is more or less confused . This often occurs in our speech when we make slips of the tongue . For example , a man was disappointed in the dinner which his host had supplied . During the course of their conversation they drifted to politics , and the guest remarked that " Roosevelt would always give a man a square meal . " // Because of the social restraints , the sex drive is frequently unsatisfied and as a result influences the behavior directly attributable to other motives . The student often finds himself restless and unable to stick to his study without necessarily understanding the underlying drive to his restlessness and anxiety . Worry , depression , and illness often follow such conflicts . If , however , he is able to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motive for study , the situation is reversed and the sex drive becomes a motivator of his work . Freud has suggested the term sublimation to describe these cases in which the activities of one drive become associated with another motive and thus indirectly satisfy the original drive . While he has undoubtedly overestimated the importance of the sex drive in relation to many motives of human experience , it certainly does play an important role in the motivation of human behavior . When the sex drive is not directly satisfied , other activit ies may originate which become conditioned as motives . A young man in love may either fail in his work or becoine more efficient , depending upon whether the love motive becomes associated with success in his profession or remains an isolated factor . A drive may find its outlet in art , literature , and religion , provided the stimulating situations relating to these fields are present for the individual . This only means that the general activities set up by the drive may lead the definite response along certain lines and thus , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sufficiently reduce the energy of the organism that the original drive is reduced . Ideals. ? So far we have been concerned with drives and // motives which are satisfied by relatively immediate ends . Hunger , sex , and the need of protection may lead to the establishing of motives for accumulation of wealth , conformity to the customs and traditions of the community , and the satisfaction of other selfish ends . But man is capable of more highly developed forms of behavior . What about his ideals and aspirations for things immaterial ? Are art and religion merely the satisfaction of physiological drives , such as hunger and sex ? Though these may exert an important influence , or may frequently be sublimated by artistic or religious motives , this would be explaining human behavior too simply . Ideals may be defined as motives with reference to more remote ends . Let us take the question of altruism as opposed to the individualism we have been emphasizing in the preceding pages . We found that the child develops a notion of possession . Objects and persons become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that his needs are supplied by these objects . By the process of conditioning response , the securing of satisfaction of his wants , these attachments are multiplied . Those objects that are rejected as harmful form another class of objects , which do not belong to his world . Gradually the child extends his world . To the members of his family he adds friends whom he considers as members of the family . In time the town , the school , and the country become a part of his world . They become attached . Consequently , the adult plants trees he will never see mature ; he willingly supports schools , though he may have no children ; he donates from his earnings to relieve suffering of people he never sees ; and he makes sacrifices for his friends without necessarily expecting // any other reward . We say that such an individual is public spirited , or that he is governed by altruistic motives . Such motives are built up from more individualistic motives , but through the habits that have been evolved they only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likewise with the religious and artistic ideals , or motives . Aside from the more primitive aspects of religion wherein man strives to protect himself from some impending disaster , or to provide future benefits , in the higher types of religious behavior man develops more remote motives or ideals . We have seen that man differs from the other animals in the possession of a superior forebrain , and that in consequence his behavior is capable of enormous complexities which set him apart as unique . Starting with the bare satisfaction of immediate needs , he develops habits which create demands beyond this satisfaction of biological needs . A reverent attitude and moral and esthetic ideals are essential characteristics of the more fully developed man . Many excellent men will argue that they do not possess these ideals , particularly the religious ideals , but we are not quarrelling over definitions of terms . We measure a man by the qualities of his motives and ideals , not by the names he applies to them . Our only interest here is concerned with the origin and development of motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the mere vegetative organism by virtue of his greater equipment , to become motivated toward more remote ends which bring satisfaction only indirectly . Volition and will. ? It remains to say a word about what is frequently understood to be volitional activity , // or behavior resulting from an act of will . These are common terms , but a little consideration will reveal that they refer to situations already discussed . The rat crosses the electric grill to obtain food ; the student continues at the dull task in order to make the grade , or he decides to go to class on a bright spring day , though he would prefer to take a walk with better company . Each situation is the expression of a motive , and the accomplishment of the act depends first of all upon the strength of the motive . We might say , therefore , that will is another term for motive . If the will is strong , the motive is strong . In case there is a conflict between two or more motives , and one motive is chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ordinarily , however , we rate will power by certain social standards of values . If the student , in the above example , goes to class when he is sorely tempted to go for the walk , we say that he has exhibited a strong will ; but if he takes the walk , he has yielded to temptation . As a matter of fact , the case must rest upon the circumstances involved . In the last analysis , it seems to be a question of how much punishment he will endure to satisfy the motive . The strength of the motive depends upon the habits that have been acquired with reference to the particular situation , and the end to be attained . One develops a habit of working under difficulties , of going to class regularly , or of completing a task in a specified time . On the other hand , a great deal depends upon the value of the goal . The work may be important as it leads to a valuable reward . But what we call the will is the developed capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon the strength of the drive , the contribuThe // Lion of other motives , and the alignment of habits of response to similar situations . Thus one may display a strong will in one situation , but a weak will another situation in which the demands are quite different . Conclusion. ? We have seen that there are three stages in the development of motivation in human behavior . First , there are the physiological conditions of the organism , or drives which result in general activity . The response which removes the physiological condition is considered the adaptive response . Second , the end situation , or goal , which satisfies the organism , may be more or less directly sought , in which case we say that the individual is motivated . This includes both the condition of the organism and the direction of activity toward the object . Motives may be of the nature of drives with reference to objects which have been associated with such responses as have previously removed the physiological condition or drive , or they may be derived with reference to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioned with reference to specific objects . Finally , motives may not satisfy directly any physiological needs , but more remote ends , or ideals . No line of distinction can be drawn between these three stages . Such classification is for convenience of discussion only . Nothing has been said concerning emotion and its influence upon motivation , for the reason that until we have examined the nature of emotions it would be inexpedient to present a clear case for emotion .

We say that one man is selfish , or an egotist , while another is generous , or an altruist . What constitutes the real difference in the two individuals ? Disorganized Response ? Emotion In the preceding chapters we have been concerned with the mechanisms of development of definite patterns of response , such as the coordination of eye and hand , learning to walk , and the development of language , as a means of adapting the organism to its physical and social environment . We have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of habits which extend the complexity of behavior through the formation of motives and ideals . And we have also had occasion to note that situations frequently arise for which the individual has no ready response . The situation is unfamiliar , or there may be a conflict between two or more lines of action . These situations for which the individual has no ready response result in diffused or disorganized reactions , which may accompany the coordinated , organized response , or may more or less completely dominate the total activity . Thus , while I am writing , someone is playing the piano in the next room . The music interferes with my work . My motive is to write this chapter within a given time . I am in the habit of writing and I have a fairly good notion of what I wish to do , but I have never been able to concentrate successfully on one task in the presence of music , good or bad . I find myself following the harmonies , or tapping the rhythm . In the present instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two lines of activity , I find I lose my train of thought ; a sentence is disarranged ; I strike the wrong keys ; and I frequently find I am trying to write in the same rhythm as the music . Again , after several weeks ' absence , a man is returning home ; he walks through the station with the expectation of meeting members of his family . He is animated ; his walking is more vigorous ; his breathing is tense . We say he is excited , thrilled , or expectant . In both of these instances there is fairly satisfactory adjustment ; each of us performs his task , the one to write and the other to walk through the station . But in each case there is a certain amount of diffused activity ; it is a partial maladjustment . To this diffused or disorganized behavior we usually apply the term emotion . Identity of emotions. ? It should be understood that human behavior had been observed and categorically described long before there was any scientific description of behavior possible . One of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fine distinctions which has been considered the province of the literary man for description , and of the actor for portrayal . A list of the emotions which these people have delineated would include love , hate , anger , scorn , joy , fear , sorrow , grief , consternation , wonder , sacrifice , astonishment , and admiration . At first glance it appears as though these are all as dissimilar as any types of behavior could be . A critical examination , however , will show that in each one of these cases , even including love and hate , there is a similarity in the maladjustment of the individual experiencing the emotion . The man in love is not an efficient man ; the Disorganized Response ? Emotion 1 95 man who becomes angry and loses his head is likely to lose more than his head . This maladjustment has been expressed differently by different writers . Some have called it a " breakdown " ; some a " disorganization " ; but all are agreed that what the names refer to is something more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and hate , a hated object . While both are examples of confusion or maladjustment , each is characterized by a certain degree of organized adjustment toward its object . It therefore becomes the task of the psychologist to point out the common elements in the various situations with reference to the behavior of the individual who is said to be experiencing the emotion . While we yet have much to learn , we are now convinced that the similarity of these various situations lies in the lack of adjustment or organization in the behavior category known as emotion . Thus , we would say that there are not many kinds of emotion , but only one , and that the other non-emotional characteristics make it convenient to use , among others , the terms listed above . Disorganization in a situation of danger. ? Emotion , considered as a disorganized response , may be better understood , if we take an example in which the reactions are violent and the disorganization more pronounced . Let us take an incident that occurred to a young man while walking along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile seemed to have been rather oblivious of his surroundings . Possibly he was thinking of the earlier evening 's et t ertainment . Suddenly a loud noise issued from the darkness in the gutter close beside him . There was an instant tension of // his muscles as though to leap , but he turned in the act of investigating this strange sound . The second time the sound occurred , he realized that it was a human voice . He attempted an inquiry , but his chest was too high , owing to the sudden intake of breath , and he had no control of his own voice . In a short time he became partially adjusted to the situation and was able to inquire what the man wanted , though his legs were trembling and he still had a lump in his throat . Incidentally , he found that the man was drunk . The constituents of the situation in this case are : 1 . The sudden presentation of a situation for which the man was not prepared . Had he merely met a policeman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been in the daytime when he was accustomed to many people and many noises on the street , the situation would have been quite different . 2 . He had no ready response and was not able immediately to adjust to the situation . If similar situations were of frequent occurrence , and he had acquired the habit of reacting in a definite way , he might have thus acted on this occasion . 3 . There was a conflict between two opposing responses : ( a ) fleeing from danger , that is , a conditioned withdrawal response from loud noises as indicating painful or harmful stimuli ; ( b ) investigation , which in this case we may presume is the result of habits formed with reference to his nightly duties as a night police reporter . A demonstration of disorganization. ? The following experiment , which the author once performed with a group of students , serves to emphasize certain other characteristics that are frequently displayed in emotional acDisorganized // tivity ; namely , that the adjustment of the subject of the emotion breaks down with reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he consequently misinterprets the specific events before him . The following details of the experiment are important . The students were called from the laboratory into the lecture room . There were a hundred ordinary classroom chairs arranged in ten rows with a narrow aisle on either side . In the front of the room was a platform extending the full width of the room . On this was a long demonstration desk . At one side of the room were two doors leading into the hall , and at the opposite side of the room were the windows , five feet from the floor . The one at the end of the platform was open . The students were scattered in the first five rows . The lecture was purposely dull , consisting of a review of instructions for laboratory procedure . It had been prearranged that in about fifteen minutes the janitor was to come in to sweep . He and the instructor were to have an argument ; the janitor was to draw a gun ; a man outside the open window was to fire a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to come to the instructor 's rescue . After the lecture had proceeded for some time and the students were settled into their accustomed attitude , the janitor came in and sprinkled sweeping powder across the front of the room . The instructor told him that he could not come in then , but the janitor replied that he had to sweep , and the class had no business in there at that hour . Then he went out . The students seemed to enjoy the parley between the janitor and instructor . With a great deal of embarrassment the lecture was finally under way again , when the janitor returned with his broom . 1 98 General Psychology This time the instructor came down from behind the desk and attempted to interfere with the janitor , who pushed at him vigorously with the broom . The instructor attempted to grapple with the janitor , but the latter stepped back and drew his revolver . At the same time the man outside fired his revolver near the open window . The students , A and B , rushed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there first , with the result that A and B went to the aid of the janitor . The remainder of the students had already started the rush for the doors , but as the chairs were quickly disarranged a near riot was produced and some of the girls were unable to escape . An observer in the back of the room was able to head off the rush , though one man got outside of the building . The two students finally managed to pull student C off the janitor . When the students were again assembled , they were asked to write exactly what had taken place . They realized by this time , of course , that the whole affair had been a hoax . In every case they gave a surprisingly accurate account of the lecture and every event up to the point at which the janitor displayed the revolver . One report ended cryptically at this point with the statement , " Then I left . " Some stated that the instructor drew the gun . One said both the janitor and the instructor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . One said he could not tell who fired the shot , but that he saw smoke . ( This was possible , but the smoke must have been ten feet from the fight . ) Student C was certain the janitor fired , for he " had hold of the gun when it went off . " One girl was observed surrounded by chairs , unable to escape , and looking with an expression of great horror on the // scene as the janitor and student scuffled . Her report was no more accurate than the others . Organized and disorganized behavior. ? The chief characteristic displayed by these students was that they acquired a confusion sufficiently great to prevent an accurate report of the events . This confusion we have previously referred to as a diffused response . It is typified by lack of organization . In other words it is the opposite of what we describe as attentive behavior . ( Chapter VII . ) When we are attending , we are adjusted to the situation . Our total response is organized , while in emotion the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unorganized response , there are all gradations . I may be writing ; everything is working smoothly ; I have the paragraph clearly outlined ; my fingers play over the keys , not rapidly , but at least with ease ; my whole posture is organized for this particular activity . Then my neighbor begins playing the piano again ; I am slightly distracted ; perhaps I hit the wrong key , or I lose the plan of my sentence . Though I continue my work , I am slightly disorganized . I may say that I am irritated or confused or distracted by the outside interference . Again , I may be elated over the progress I am making ; I am developing a statement with which I am greatly pleased ; my enthusiasm may become so great that I can scarcely wait until I have finished writing it . Here again we have a diffused response , though we do not recognize it so readily as belonging in the same category as the former . Either may reach the stage where there is complete disorganization . ( Valentine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those students who ran from the // room certainly displayed organized activity . This may be quite true , but in that case we could not say that they experienced any emotion . Only to the extent that their running was frantic , haphazard , or in other ways something besides mere running , was their behavior disorganized or emotional . A person may be crossing the street and find it wise to step quickly or run , in order to avoid being hit by an automobile , without the arousal of anything he would call an emotion . He merely displays a satisfactory , organized response . At another time , he may be angry at the driver for his carelessness , or frightened because the escape was considered close . His anger or fright is something more than the behavior described as running . Instinct and habit in emotion. ? The fleeing from danger is frequently explained on the basis of instinct . We have already pointed out that the concept of instinct can not be satisfactorily employed as an explanation of human behavior . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous experiences with similar situations in which pain was the consequence . In the young infant , withdrawing from or rejecting painful stimuli is considered a native response . In the adult , this type of response has developed into more complicated habits . He still jerks the hand or foot away from a painful stimulus , but he has learned to escape more complicated dangers by more devious reactions . A more important aspect of the situation , and one which frequently has led to the instinct assumption , is that in emotion the behavior is on a lower level of performance so far as the total behavior pattern is concerned . With the disorganization , the individual resorts // to the more primitive types of reaction , not merely those that are instinctive , but the more firmly established habits . He may undergo morbid changes in the respiratory and circulatory functions , as well as changes in the secretions of the glands ; the skeletal muscles may be under greater tension , or more relaxed . These are purely physiological changes in adjustment . He also , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an ugly beast ; he clenches his fist , strikes , or bites his antagonist . On other occasions he weeps , humbles himself before the other person ; he may flee , lie , steal , or beg . Later he is chagrined at the recollection of his behavior . These are extremes of behavior which we do not expect from the better class of people , even under the more extenuating circumstances . Nevertheless , the professor reprimands the student who has irritated him , and regrets his own behavior in his quieter moments . It is not a question of whether this behavior is instinctive . We can easily see that it is more elementary or primitive than the individual displays when properly organized or adjusted . By " better class of people " we refer to that group , regardless of their social or educational status , who are able to maintain a satisfactory total adjustment . Each individual under the conditions of emotion fails to maintain this superior organization . His behavior therefore displays those types that resemble the child 's , or inferior individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . Disorganization and motivation. ? What can we say of those situations in which the emotion seems to excite the individual to use higher levels of activity or more intensive effort ? It is common belief that not only the pleasant emotions , such as love and elation , but even // anger , fear , and great bereavement may function to increase the drive toward some set objective . A student may be goaded to do his best because of the anger aroused by a professor 's sarcasm or because of his fear that he will flunk the examination . The lover turns from his former shiftless habits and becomes a serious , industrious worker . If emotion is a breakdown in the normal processes of adjustment , how can we account for such seeming contradictions as these ? The answer is twofold . First , the breakdown need not be complete , and , second , the partial disorganization may , itself , become a stimulating agency . Whether this latter will be true depends upon the organizing power that has been developed by the individual in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fallen in love , " while others succeed for the same reason . The importance of training in organized behavior in the face of emotion-provoking situations is excellently illustrated by an account of an exciting episode related to Professor Stratton , who treats the incident as significant of the function of emotion . A more accurate interpretation would be that it illustrates how , in spite of the emotional situation and the resulting excitement , the man was able to " pull himself together . " The maintenance of organized influences resulted in strenuous activity , but in another individual the reverse might have been true , disorganization dominating , in which case a tragedy would have ensued . The facts in the case , as reported to Professor Stratton , ' are as follows : A short time before breakfast R was footnote Stratton , G. M. , " The Function of Emotion as Shown in Excitement , " Psych . Rev. , 1928 , Vol. 35 , pp. 351-366. // sitting alone before the fireplace . Alice , six years old , came in and stood with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and over these she wore a flannelette dressing gown . She came a little too near the fire , and without an instant 's warning , the whole back of her outer garment was enveloped in flame . At the very instant that R saw the flame over her shoulder and heard her outcry , there came the memory of the terrible burning of his sister and another child , together with the " feeling of condemnation of garments of this sort . " There was a sudden " automatic impulse to action . " Four main alternative possibilities presented themselves together : smother the flame within the garment itself ; smother it in a blanket or something similar ; flood the whole with water ; or pull off the garment . The fourth alternative was settled upon as offering the greatest chance of success . His whole action system , he reports , operated for the twofold task of keeping the flame from her face and removing the garment by stripping it off over her head . This was accomplished with more hard jerking and hauling than was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garment was torn off . R also reports that the burning of his own hands , and the danger of setting the house on fire were recognized , hut they were of minor significance as compared with the main task . He also believes he resorted to rather mart iculate , but vigorous vocalization . In this case we find R behaving in a fairly organized fashion . He was able to perform the task successfully , to stunt-non his resources for the occasion , though he undoubtedly displayed many uncoordinated and useless movements . Let us assume that his previous training // the hospital where she was pronounced dead . He then returned home , only to collapse on his own doorstep . He declared that up to this time there had been no sign of disorganization or maladjustment in his own behavior . This may be doubted , but the facts of the case warrant the belief that the major activities constituted a wellorganized response while that was needed . With that situation passed , and with the fatigue resulting from the strain in making the adjustment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in maladjustment situations. ? We have frequently alluded to some of the in ernal changes that take place during disorganization , as well as the vigorous response of the skeletal muscles . It is common knowledge that one sweats when angry or excited . The heart beats faster and respiration is increased , or , if breathing is inhibited , there is a tenseness about the chest . The face becomes flushed or blanched , and tears may be in evidence . It is also noted that one frequently loses his appetite , not only when he is worried or angry , but also when he is overjoyed or excited . As these responses result through the action of the autonomic nervous system , they suggest that this must play an important role in emotional behavior . Though in physiology it is customary to refer to the skeletal nervous system as that portion that supplies the striped muscles , and the autonomic nervous system as t hat division which is directly connected with the smooth muscles ? such as the ciliary muscle of the eye and the muscles in the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glands , it should be understood that anatomically these divisions are integrated into one complete sys206 General Psychology tern , with the brain dominant . In other words , the autonomic nervous system is not exactly autonomous , as its name would imply . Its chief characteristic , however , is to conduct impulses in rather a diffused manner to the internal organs . It will be remembered that the autonomic system consists of three divisions . From the mid-brain and medulla oblongata , nerve fibers are distributed to the tear glands and dilator , muscle of the pupil , and , by the vagus nerve , to the heart , stomach , and other visceral organs . This constitutes the cranial division . Along either side of the cord throughout the thoracic and lumbar regions are small ganglia , or groups of cells , which are connected with the cord through the spinal roots , and are also interconnected with each other by a nerve trunk . Still other ganglia are to be found within the diaphragm nearer the visceral organs which they supply . Nerves from the cord may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ganglia , and thence the impulse may pass by a second neurone to the viscera . Through the mediation of these ganglia , nerve impulses may be more widely distributed . This division is generally known as the sympathetic division , though the name is rather confusing . The third , or sacral , division originates in the sacral nerves of the cord and supplies the organs of the lower abdomen ( Figure 36 ) . The functioning of the autonomic nervous system differs from the skeletal system in two important respects : 1 . It functions more slowly . This is not wholly due to the slow nerve conduction , but partly to the slow response of smooth muscles . figure // 2 . Whereas stimulation through the skeletal system is specific , stimulation through the autonomic is more general . Stimulation of the sympathetic system , for example , results in an increase in heart rate , cessation of digestive activities , an increase in the secretion of glycogen from the liver , and numerous other responses . Another characteristic of the autonomic system is the antagonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sympathetic overlaps at its upper end with the cranial division and at its lower end with the sacral division . Wherever an organ is supplied with two divisions , one serves to augment the activity and the other to inhibit it . Thus , the heart beat is increased by nerve impulse through the sympathetic , but is inhibited by a similar impulse through the vagus nerve of the cranial division . Cannon has clearly demonstrated by experiments upon animals the intimate relation between certain activities of the animals which he considers emotions and the functioning of the autonomic nervous system . If a cat were fed and then the stomach and intestines were observed by means of the Roentgen ray , it was possible to see the rhythmic contractions in the process of digestion . However , if the cat were in any way disturbed , the contractions of the stomach ceased . This was particularly evident when a dog was allowed to bark at the cat . The cat hissed , bared its claws , and ruffled up its back , which actions Cannon interpreted as signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stomach ceased . Glands of internal secretion. ? Cannon has also shown that certain glands , particularly the adrenals , are very // closely related to those activities which he describes as the emotions of fear and rage . The adrenal glands in humans are about the size and shape of a lima bean and are located just above the kidney . As the blood passes through the gland , the secretion is absorbed and carried to other internal organs , where the autocoid of the secretion acts as an exciter or depressor of the organ . As it takes longer for this autocoid to reach any organ than for an impulse through the sympathetic nervous system , the effect occurs somewhat later . Cannon found that when this secretion , adrenin , was injected directly into the blood stream of a cat , it manifested all the symptoms that are present when the cat has been barked at by a dog . There was increased heart rate , cessation of digestion , increase in blood sugar , and an increased tonus of the skeletal muscles . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cat , an analysis of the blood of the cat showed an increase of adrenin , which was accompanied by the symptoms enumerated . On the basis of these and similar experiments Cannon concludes that the adrenals are " emergency glands . " That is , a situation of danger is a stimulus for vigorous response , which includes , through the sympathetic nervous system , the cessation of digestion and the throwing of the blood supply to the skeletal muscles to meet the emergency . At the same time the sympathetic nerves I o the adrenal glands cause an increase in their secretion which reinforces the action through the sympathetic system . From the standpoint of practical considerations C'annon 's conclusion is not difficult to understand . At the moment of danger is no time to digest food . It is // had been different ; that , as a child , he had learned to fear fire ; had never learned to meet new emergencies ; and had never developed a sense of responsibility for others . His performance in this situation would have been quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective . On the other hand , if it had been his business to strip flaming garments off children every morning , he would have been able to perform the task on this occasion with greater precision and less violence . He would not have thrown the girl upon the floor , nor resorted to " rather inarticulate , but vigorous vocalizing . " Delayed disorganization. ? In many situations such as that just described , the individual reacts adequately and with no apparent emotion , but after the crisis is past , the emotional reactions dominate . An automobile driver may react quickly and correctly at a moment of imminent danger and then be unable to drive as soon as traffic is again cleared . In this case , it is probable that , with the passing of danger , the motive for the highest degree of coordinated activity is no longer present , and the general breakdown follows . Had the danger continued , the individual might have been able to maintain the adjustment , though it is also possible the strain might prove too great to be endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driving one evening , a car a hundred yards ahead of him " side swiped " another car and turned over . When the young man arrived at the scene of the accident he found all the uninjured spectators apparently helpless in the situation ; that is , they were highly disorganized . He took charge , directed the men in lifting the car , and he , himself , pulled a girl out from under the car , placed her into his own car , and took her to // more important to draw upon the reserve supply of energy that the organism has stored , and this is what Cannon finds occurs so far as the physiological functions are concerned . Though Cannon has clearly demonstrated the function of the autonomic nervous system and the adrenal glands in situations that may be interpreted as emotion-producing situations , his assumptions are at variance with our interpretation . Cannon believes that the stimulus of the emotion-producing situation arouses nerve impulses connecting with the cerebrum , and thus sets up the emotional reaction . At the same time connections are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses . These latter are important , according to Cannon , as emergency reactions . It is our contention that these reactions are also important constituents of the emotion itself . It is the total behavior of the organism which constitutes the emotion . The cerebrum is , of course , the dominant integration mechanism , but to the extent that we have violent muscular and visceral responses , these are an important factor in the total emotional reaction . Several authors also frequently speak of " visceral disturbances " in emotion . There is no more reason for referring to visceral responses as disturbances than to say that we have a muscular disturbance in walking . The visceral reactions are merely a part of the activity of the total organismal response . Similarly , respiratory and circulatory reactions are neither the cause nor the effect of emotion , but are constituent parts of the emotional response . What typifies the emotion is the complete or partial disorganization of the response . When the reI ) isorganized // spouse is completely organized , we say that the individual is adjusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contest , or the laborer performs a ' task that involves great muscular effort , neither is characterized by what we would call an emotion , yet the visceral and circulatory activities are much the same as Cannon found in the case of the enraged cat . Both men perspire ; their breathing and heart rate are increased ; and , if we could observe the visceral reactions under such circumstances , we would find the same inhibitions . We know , for example , that it is injurious to the digestive system to undertake strenuous physical exercise immediately after eating because of the cessation of the digestive processes under such conditions . The principal difference is that th emotional activity , or disorganized response , is likely to be more vigorous than any ordinary form of labor . Blood pressure experiments. ? A simple experiment which illustrates the truth of the statements made in the prececling paragraph is the determination of the blood pressure under different conditions of stimulation of the subject . This determination can be made by use of the sphygmomanometer , an instrument which measures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rubber sleeve or bag is wrapped around the arm above the elbow . This sleeve is attached by a rubber tube to the mercury column , or a dial which registers the equivalent pressure . The sleeve is inflated until the pressure upon the arteries is sufficient to interrupt the circulation . The sleeve is then slowly deflated until with each pulse the blood is just forced beneath the sleeve . The point at which the blood is forced under the sleeve may be ob212 General Psychology served by means of a stethoscope applied to the artery below the sleeve . The height of the mercury column at this point measures the maximum , or systolic , pressure , which occurs with each heart beat . If the sleeve is still further deflated , a point will be reached at which the blood escapes continuously beneath the sleeve , and the rush of blood can no longer be heard . This point is taken as the minimum , or diastolic , pressure ( Figure 37 ) . If the subject remains quietly seated and the pressure and pulse rates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse and the systolic pressure become slightly lower . After 15 or 20 minutes they remain fairly constant . There is usually little change in the diastolic pressure . If any slight disturbance occurs at this figure // period ? such as a slight electric shock , a loud noise ? or if the subject is asked an embarrassing question , the pulse will be found to increase from 2 to 5 beats per minute and the systolic pressure will be increased approximately 10 millimeters of mercury . Frequently , these changes will take place in spite of the declaration of the subject that he has not been disturbed . If , after the pressure has returned to normal , the subject is required to step up on a chair 5 or 6 times , it will be found that the systolic pressure has again increased about the same amount as in the former instance . Under either condition the change in pulse rate and blood pressure is about the same , though one might be considered a shock or slight emotion while the other could have no such interpretation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Certain electrical changes have attracted considerable attention as possible delicate measures of emotional response when the overt behavior of the subject would not betray the presence of emotion . If two electrodes which are connected with a battery and a sensitive galvanometer are applied to two parts of the body , the galvanometer will show any slight changes that take place within the circuit . These deflections of the galvanometer may be due to either of two causes . The resistance offered at the contacts with the skin may vary as the result of changes in moisture of the skin , or there may be actual electrical currents produced by internal activities . Darrow 2 has demonstrated that both changes // may occur . The variation in the resistance is the result of the reflex action of the sweat glands in the skin . The change in electric potential is probably the result of metabolic activities in nerve and muscle . Under the usual experimental conditions the galvanometer readings are found to vary considerably even when the subject remains apparently passive . This variation may be due to irregularities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . Slight movements of the subject , a deep breath , or any slight disturbance will cause a deflection of the galvanometer . It is necessary , therefore , to take into account the extent of the deflections under specific conditions and to subtract from these the normal or usual deflections . If single words are pronounced to the subject , to which he must respond with an associated word , the deflections are more extensive for words which deal with maladjustments or worries of the subject , such as examinations , inadequate sex adjustments , or financial worries.3 Whether this method could also be applied to the study of the degree of activity in work situations , such as computation or study , has not been adequately investigated . ( Valentine , Experiment 4 . ) Pneumographic studies. ? The respiration may be recorded by a pneumograph placed upon the chest . This instrument consists of a hollow rubber tube , which may be fastened around the chest , and connected to a tambour which records on a moving paper the changes of volume of air in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chest and a second on the abdomen . In this way the depth of breathing is also registered ( Figure 38 ) . Under various conditions it is found that breathing either may be increased in rate , may vary in depth , or there may be a change in the inspiration-expiration ratio ? that is , in the relation of the periods of inspiration and expiration . Recently , attention has centered in the inspiration-expiration ratio , as it is now considered the most reliable index of emotional disturbance . In the case of disorganized response in emotion-provoking situations , the inspiration-expiration ratio is supposed to be increased . ( Valentine , Experiment 10 . ) Several investigators have attempted to use one or more of the above-mentioned methods for the purpose of de-figure caption-Apparatus for recording respiratory and circulatory changes . The upper line on the smoked paper is the breathing record ; the second line , changes in blood pressure ; the third line indicates points at which stimuli were applied or conditions changed ; the lover line indicates time in seconds . // tecting lying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon the assumption that a subject is more disturbed when telling a falsehood than when telling the truth ; that he will be more disorganized when confronted with the facts of some crime , if he is guilty , than he would be if innocent . The results are not entirely conclusive . The experiments carried out in the laboratory are usually too artificial , though this is not always the case.4 The so-called " lie detectors " consist of the assemblies of the same techniques that have been described . All of these attempts to substitute the scientific methods for the old " third degree " are hopeful , but the problem is so complicated that little can be expected until more thorough investigations are made . Psychologists are not yet agreed as to just what is being measured in so-called emotions . We can not assume that bloodpressure records , breathing curves , and galvanic phenomena are a true index of truth and falsity . If the accused is attempting to recall a date , these records may or may not vary in the same order they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of its importance and because of the intricacies of the problem , it is one of the most interesting in present investigations . ( Valentine , Experiment 11 . ) An experimental study of fear reactions. ? The following experiment is a good illustration of the laboratory methods in which several measures are combined .

Since any muscular activity will be accompanied by electrical changes , each heart beat is recorded . Any other electrical changes are also recorded as described above in the galvanic skin reflex . An electrical pneumograph recorded the duration of each inspiration and expiration in breathing . The inspiration-expiration ratio ( I/E ) is computed by dividing the duration of the inspiration by the duration of the expiration . Thus , in the present study , the normal ratio was found to be .65 to .85 . Table VII gives a. comprehensive picture of the results . It will be seen that the heart rate was increased suddenly as a result of the fall . The rate of breathing decreased , but the respiratory ratio ( I/E ) increased from .74 to 2.08 . This increase is a commonly observed phenomenon in such experiments , though a decrease in the 1/E is also reported in some emotional situations . The general galvanic effects are marked .

Those conditions which are commonly referred to as pleasant or unpleasant are often confused with emotion . The preceding discussion has dealt only with those disrupted responses which are of a pronounced character . Pleasure and displeasure , on the other hand , refer to those forms of behavior in which there is either a positive or a negative adjustment with reference to the stimulating object , with really no reference to the organization or lack of organization of behavior . Pleasure or displeasure is a way of adjusting to the situation ; and the behavior involved is not // emotional as long as the adjustment is effective . We say that we like certain foods , and dislike others ; a student enjoys one subject of study , and finds another uninteresting or a bore to him ; some impress us agreeably , while others affect us indifferently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasurable forms of stimulation : old try to avoid ( are negatively adjusted to ) the displeasurable . We are emotional in these situations only when we add confusion to our behavior in dealing with t hem . However , we learn to like new articles of food , which at first were decidedly disagreeable to us ; the student develops a genuine interest in the subject that at the teginning he considered an arduous task to be endured ; we develop new habits and new friends . It is true that K , we may continue to work at a disagreeable task , or to look at a picture we do not like , but this is because we are adjusting for some more remote end . A man may play gulf because he is positively adjusted to the game itself , or he may play for the reason that he has learned that it will result in a good appetite and the enjoyment of his dinner . Another reason for inferring that pleasantness and unpleasantness are a matter of adjustment is furnished by the characteristic response to the stimulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reponse . The normal reaction to sweet is the acceptance f the substance , while bitter sets up a rejecting response . I I owever , we may become so adjusted to low intensities tf these that we pick at a sore on the skin or press against an ulcerated tooth in order to produce a slight pain . One may also endure pain with great satisfaction , pro:220 General Psychology vided it is in some way connected with habits that make it , for him , a successful adjustment . He may undergo severe hardships on a hunting trip , because his ability to endure the severe weather is recognized as physical superiority . On the other hand , all sensations which are pleasant at moderate intensities may become unpleasant when the intensities are sufficiently increased . A mild perfume may be pleasant , though a negative reaction is evident when the intensity is greatly increased . Classification of emotions. ? An attempt to classify emotions , as we have shown , is confronted with the important difficulty that , in so far as any response is emotional , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially very much alike . The names given to emotions usually refer either to the character of the stimulating situation or to the final outcome of the behavior of the individual . Thus , fear refers to the dangerous , or supposedly dangerous , situation , and flight . Anger refers to a similar situation , but the reaction is one of attack . It will be possible to analyze only a few of the emotions as illustrative of the characteristics involved . Fear and rage. ? We have seen that the emotion of fear is not characterized merely by the response of fleeing or hiding . If a man were pursued by an ugly bull , but were easily out-distancing him , he might even be thrilled by the experience . In other words , this would be a situation for which he possessed a ready response . If , however , he were not so sure of his safety , the bull would become a different stimulus and other responses would be added to the fleeing response . Our fleeing individual might run faster , but he would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the attendant visceral changes , might become so violent that screaming , praying , or even fainting , among other possibilities , might result . In rage or anger we meet with the same possibilities . Fighting is usually looked upon as the characteristic : finger response , but one may fight for the sheer pleasure of it , or because it is a part of one 's code . A prize fighter who " loses his head , " either through fear or anger , is almost certain to lose the fight as well . Anger is closely allied to fear in that both arise in response to danger . If we can deal with our enemies effectively , either by avoiding them or overcoming them , there is little occasion for emotion . If we can not avoid them , we may have to fight them . The emotion , as disruption , is very much the same in either case . Love. ? The emotion of love is usually associated with sex stimulation . To speak of a sex emotion is again somewhat misleading , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or disorganized response . Stimulation through the sacral division of the autonomic nervous system and the influence of the sex glands may play the larger part in the behavior , though , as emotion becomes more intense , the sympathetic division also assumes an important role . The emotion is a general diffusion of activity , but the stimulus is a definite sex object and may involve a definite sex response . Many of the so-called emotions might better be classed as motives or drives . The conditions that set up the responses that are frequently named emotions of love may actually lead to such disorganization as comes in the category of emotion . In this case , the emotion is like any // room certainly displayed organized activity . This may be quite true , but in that case we could not say that they experienced any emotion . Only to the extent that their running was frantic , haphazard , or in other ways something besides mere running , was their behavior disorganized or emotional . A person may be crossing the street and find it wise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit , by an automobile , without the arousal of anything he would call an emotion . He merely displays a satisfactory , organized response . At another time , he may be angry at the driver for his carelessness , or frightened because the escape was considered close . His anger or fright is something more than the behavior described as running . Instinct and habit in emotion. ? The fleeing from danger is frequently explained on the basis of instinct . We have already pointed out that the concept of instinct can not be satisfactorily employed as an explanation of human behavior . In the case of flight from danger , the response has been developed by previous experiences with similar situations in which pain was the consequence . In the young infant , withdrawing from or rejecting painful stimuli is considered a native response . In the adult , this type of response has developed into more complicated habits . He still jerks the hand or foot away from a painful stimulus , but he has learned to escape more complicated dangers by more devious reactions . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently has led to the instinct assumption , is that in emotion the behavior is on a lower level of performance so far as the total behavior pattern is concerned . With the disorganization , the individual resorts // to the more primitive types of reaction , not merely those that are instinctive , but the more firmly established habits . He may undergo morbid changes in the respiratory and circulatory functions , as well as changes in the secretions of the glands ; the skeletal muscles may be under greater tension , or more relaxed . These are purely physiological changes in adjustment . He also , on occasion , bares his teeth , snarls , utters sounds like an ugly beast ; he clenches his fist , strikes , or bites his antagonist . On other occasions he weeps , humbles himself before the other person ; he may flee , lie , steal , or beg . Later he is chagrined at the recollection of his behavior . These are extremes of behavior which we do not expect from the better class of people , even under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student who has irritated him . and regrets his own behavior in his quieter moments . It is not a question of whether this behavior is instinctive . We can easily see that it is more elementary or primitive than the individual displays when properly organized or adjusted . By " better class of people " we refer to that group , regardless of their social or educational status , who are able to maintain a satisfactory total adjustment . Each individual under the conditions of emotion fails to maintain this superior organization .
