MAGNA A STORY IN THREE PARTS BY ZONA GALE PART II T HE day was as rich and sweet as spring , a spring day returned to June . By nine o'clock Alec was at the door with a roadster and he turned it towards the country . " I thought you wanted to see America , " said Magna ; " America is expected to be in towns . " " We have lots of time to see towns , " said Alec . " Years of time . . . . " He said no more of that . " One thing , " he added , " we must do . I 've promised to drop in on Great-aunt Elizabeth . Right ? " Assenting , Magna thought , " I wo n't tell him that I 'm engaged to Bolo till after we 've been there . " Great-aunt Elizabeth Pethner lived on a farm with her tiny invalid husband , Uncle Joel . The house was low and old , with trim green surroundings ? nothing broke the line of the green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neat porch Uncle Joel sat , small , inert in body , almost drunken in mind . " Hey ! " he shouted at Magna . " Been out here since six o'clock , waiting for ye . Got some new beehives , got a new calf , got a new wren-house , got two hundred growing lambs . . . . So this is the young man , is it ? He 's a Pethner all right . Short arms , long thumbs , stubborn chin . I bet you eat your vegetables one at a time at the table , All the Pethners do . " Great-aunt Elizabeth came to the door , huge in her gingham , with flour on her arms . Without greeting the guests , she attacked her husband . " Joel , " she said , " why do n't you ask them to sit down ? I vow you 'd let these poor young folks stand up till they dropped . Do n't you pay any attention to him , " she added , " sit down anyway . " " Hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to anyhow . " While he questioned Alec about his father 's family , Great-aunt Elizabeth beckoned Magna into the house . Over her pies at the kitchen table , this woman went on : " Well , child , you 've got a good prospect . " " I 'm not selling anything , " Magna laughed . " Oh , yes , you are . Every woman is . They talk grand , but it means the same . The whole thing is selling . Do n't you let ' em tell you it is n't . " " Selling what ? " Magna demanded . " Oh , your disposition and your pretty face and your ways of making a man comfortable and keeping house and bringing up children . I know it sounds old-fashioned , but marrying had been done quite a while . " " Love is older than marriage , " said Magna . " What about that ? " " Look here , Magna , " said Great-aunt Elizabeth . " You can love any one of a dozen men , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy . It sounds sordid but it is done . " " Did you do that ? " Magna asked . Great-aunt Elizabeth 's face was so stern that its dimples seldom showed . But they showed fleetingly as she said , " Well , I took Joel . And he was n't much , land knows . And sometimes I think I could have been just as happy with Jed Hamlin or Dick Barker or Tim Potts . That 's why I 'm talking to you now . You think one man is the world and all , but ten years afterward you could n't tell why you picked him . And ten to one you wonder why you ever married him . " " Do you wonder ? . . . " Magna stopped . " When he insists on getting stung by bees , and when he wo n't sell his critters till they eat their heads off , and when he uses the bath towel I like best and asks for ham and eggs for supper every single night of his life  --  yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " Great-aunt Elizabeth 's face changed . " Why , Joel could never have got along on earth without me , " she said . " I tell him if he 'd married one of those good-for-nothing Sufferin girls , he 'd have been dead , without my care . " She looked out the window . " If Joel had married Tiny Sufferin , " she said , " and I had married Tim Potts or Dick , I 'll bet I 'd have gone over and took care of Joel when he got sick . Tiny was no good in sickness . Joel needed me as it turned out . " Magna laughed . " You love him , " she accused her . " I do not , " said Great-aunt Elizabeth . " I 'm used to him . " Was that it ? Was it like that for everyone ? All the pang and the thrill gone into mere habit ? " Then you have your mother and father to think of , " this woman finished ; " they have n't much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A girl has lots of things to think of , getting married . " Magna jumped up . " You may think of marriage that way , " she cried , " but I think of it as the biggest adventure there is . Why  --  death is nothing to it . It 's the whole thing . " Great-aunt Elizabeth looked at her with attention . " Why , child , " she said , " do you think of it just as an adventure ? Why you poor little thing . It 's lots more than that . " They stared at each other across the fifty years between them . And yet in her heart Magna now echoed her Great-aunt 's conclusion : " You stick to this Alec Pcthner , " Great-aunt Elizabeth said . Magna stood in the doorway and looked into the orchard . The late trees still showed some bloom in this slow-moving June . She and Alec must walk there for a little before they drove on . What joy to be in that lovely place , in any lovely place with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in love with Bolo . In love with him . . . . " But did this mean that she was not in love with him any more , she wondered . She went down into the orchard . She began to call back those first days with Bolo . Days in the snow , when he had walked home with her . Those first evenings together . Talking , dancing , dining  --  all the magic of first days . Then that twilight when she had gone to see his office  --  the little snug room , the bare room that he had tried to make habitable . " I want to tell you right here , " he had said , " so that I can always have it to remember when I sit here at my desk : I love you . " It had been blooming so quietly that she had hardly known it herself until he told her . It had come as no surprise , but rather as something to have been taken for granted , already habitual . When they kissed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was quiet , natural , even awkward  --  nothing of heroics , of romance as she had imagined it . Just habit  --  already habit , even in its first hours . Her reddish gown moving among the trees Alec must have seen , for he was coming towards her through the orchard . When she saw him , the pang that claimed her was swift and terrifying . She trembled and was afraid and was glad to be afraid , and she stood waiting for him , trembling . Nothing like this had she known when she had seen Bolo coming towards her . " Should n't you hate to be proposed to in an orchard ? " Alec asked . " Should I ? " said Magna . " Why ? " " Well , you might think the orchard did it and not the man , " said Alec . " Still , just as you say . " " Now I ought to tell him about Bolo  --  now I ought to tell him , " Magna thought . Instead she said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " said Alec . " Let 's look for a slum . " Uncle Joel came hobbling to show them the bees , the lambs , the calf . " After a while I 'll tell Alec about Bolo , " Magna thought . But later it seemed absurd to bring up the matter when no one was saying a word about engagements , when Alec was talking on so impersonally of the Hebrides and the Scotch mists . He did say again , and in a tone of content , " You 'll like the Hebrides " ; but anyone might say that . Yet not in that tone . ... Well , she would tell him before they reached home , before Bolo came that night . They lunched at a country cottage , turned into a place called " Grandmother 's . " They sat together in an ugly room mistakenly crowded with furniture believed to be beautifulmerely because it was old . There seemed to be dust of spinning-wheels on the sandwiches and dust of melodeons in the meat . The drinking water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked dusty . " I like my dishes washed , " said Alec , " not merely hand-painted . " " How absurd of you , " said Magna . " These people got theirs all washed up as early as the American Revolution . " " Lord , but you 're educated , " Alec said . " Most Americans say the Revolution , as if they defied you to produce another and suspected you if you did . " Magna thought , " Now how can I burst out just here and say , ' Pardon me , but I 'm engaged to Bolo Marks ' ? " They drove on down the afternoon this was as near as Magna could have retraced their direction . She knew only that this was the first day of her life on which she had experienced thrilling happiness . She found herself laughing a great deal and saying things which seemed to her inordinately clever . Once she thought , " But that is the way with a drunken man  --  everything that he says seems clever to him . Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but usually he was silent and absent or turned on her one of his sudden moments of concentration , so that she trembled . When he was silent she thought , " Now , why is it that I ca n't interest this man ? " and was certain that she was no more to him than a stranger . He stopped the ear on a hillside , looking down the valley to the town . The sun was low , in the deep places lights were beginning to come out . The valley was like a night-blooming flower , unfolding as the sun went down . Magna fell silent , and thought , " Now . " " Get out of the car , " said Alec brusquely and opened the door . He led the way through the long grass , to the very edge of the slope , spangled with blue flowers . He flung himself down and stared over the valley . He was looking towards the west , and at length he said : " That 's where I was going . Away on there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Magna . But she was looking into the valley too , for every time that she looked at him she could think of nothing else . " Love , I suppose , " said Alec . " Money , too . What else does a man look for ? " " Were n't these things in the Hebrides , then  --  and in Scotland and London ? " " Money , maybe  --  a little , " he told her . " But not love . " So . No girl in Scotland , very beautiful . . . . He began speaking slowly , not looking at her . " Two boys in a police court . One said , ' I got here because I never had anything  --  no chance . ' The other said , I landed here because all my life I 've had just what I wanted . ' Well , I 'm like the second chap . All my life I 've had just what I wanted . But now I 'm afraid that I want something I 'm not going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " When I was a little chap in the mountains of Harris , " he went on , " I used to plan how I 'd walk through the woods and meet a beautiful lady , and she 'd give me everything in the world . Well , I 've met her . In the woods , too . That 's curious , is n't it ? ? meeting someone where you 've always thought you 'd meet her . " Still he did not look up . He went on : " I was a decent kid . I wish I 'd been decenter . Every man wishes that when the time comes to tell a woman . " He got to his feet and came towards her . And now she would have cried out , would have told him if she could , would have run from him . But she stood where she was , silent . And Alec came swiftly towards her and took her in his arms . " One day ago , " he said , " I met you one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , trembling , miserable , ecstatic . But suddenly the misery was the strongest . Up through the fire , the hot breath , the suffocation , the joy , there rose the misery of the moment and beset her . For one instant there had been the pang and the light , then the darkness . " Bolo , Bolo , Bolo , " she cried out loudly , there in Alec 's arms . " What of him ? " Alec asked and did not move from her side . " I 'm promised to marry him , " she brought out . But she did not move either , did not try to struggle away . So Alec said : " What of that ? " " But Bolo . . . " " What of him if I 'm the one you love ? " She stared up at him . " Look here , " said Alec . " Nothing means anything to me save your loving me . If you happen to have promised Bolo to marry him and then find that you love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we ca n't help that . I ca n't think of him , you see . I think of you . This is not between any man and me  --  it 's between you and me . " " But Bolo . " " You ca n't think of Bolo . You come first and I do  --  if you love me . Well  --  you do love me . " She kept looking in his face , as if she might read there some answer to what she asked . Yet she asked nothing , and he kissed her face so near to his , so childish , so questioning . " You do love me , " he challenged her again . " Oh , Magna  --  this is the way . No ' getting acquainted ' ? no growing accustomed  --  no waiting for this or that . Just finding each other out  --  among all the rest . Is n't it so with you  --  is n't it ? " This time she said , " Alec . . . Alec . " They watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaze of lights trembling as in water . They said little , and when she spoke all her trouble was in her voice : " You see  --  I do n't know . It 's only that I feel something that I 've never felt before  --  it 's terrible and it 's wonderful and if it 's love , it 's a wickedness to let it go . But I thought I loved Bolo  --  only it was n't like this . It was all still and different . " " You love me , " said Alec . When they went down to the valley , he went with assurance , saying : " You 'll tell Bolo at once . Magna , do you know that I almost told you this last night when we walked through the wood to meet Bobo . Would you have thought I was a maniac ? " She said slowly and sleepily , " I think even then everything that you did would have seemed right to me . " Their way lay near to the Oak Opening where the picnic had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight , looking about them . There were the ashes of their fire . And about it the others could still be imagined , Great-aunt Elizabeth , Uncle Jasper , Uncle Sven , Uncle Steven , Aunt Marty , Aunt Taffy . All dumb and stupid and talking of nothing , around the ashes of a fire . " Alec , " she cried , " did they ever love somebody  --  those Pethners , here last night ? " " Lord love them , I do n't know , " said Alec . " They did n't look it . Let 's not talk about them . I knew this when I first saw you crossing theopen space there , with the sun on you . " " And I did  --  I did too ! " " We 've wasted twenty-four hours , " he cried . " No , we have n't , " she said . " We 've had them . We even had last night , when you were talking to mother and dad and I was upstairs listening . " " And I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would not think of Bolo . She would think of nothing but that hour . Yet when Alec would have walked again along that path where they had first walked together to meet Bolo , she would not go , but ran swiftly back to the car . They drove into the town , and the streets were filled with people , crowding , milling , talking in another mood from that of the daytime . Horses were trampling in the street , saddled or blanketed . " The pageant again , " said Alec . " The Forty-niners . Lord , it seems a lifetime since last night . " She said nothing . The pageant to which she and Bolo had looked forward together . . . . In a block of the traffic a group of newsboys stood on the curb , calling their wares . There seemed to be some special selling power in one of their headlines , which they shouted again and again . In the raucous voices Magna suddenly caught , or thought that she caught , the name Pethner . She leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page in great letters : Petliner . The boy sprang to the running board as she called him . There it was : Earl Pethner Charged With Murder . " It would be Earl , " Magna said vacantly . They turned off the main street and read under a street lamp . A girl , someone employed in the town  --  Helga Griffiths , that little pretty one , in the ten-cent store  --  dead . And Earl Pethner had been with her  --  had been apprehended . " Let 's go home , " said Magna . And as they drove she said , " They 'll all be so ashamed to have you know . " But she was thinking , " Bolo will have heard  --  he 'll be at the house . " There was a light in the back of the shop , and so they drove there . The front part of the place was in darkness , but back by the little office , there was huddled a group of figures , all talking , all hushing one another : Pethners , gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They turned and welcomed Magna and Alec with gutturals and trebles as of a kind of relief and with rebukes that they had not arrived before . They were all there  --  all the family , seated on boxes and barrels , telling and retelling it , and hearing it again . Even little Uncle Joel was there , standing by Great-aunt Elizabeth , who had somehow taken charge . " He took your father and mother home from the pageant last night , " she addressed herself to Magna . " He brought us home  --  we told you that . " Andris shouted loudly , not to have his importance taken from him . " Jasper saw him after that , " Great-aunt Elizabeth went on , to the newcomers . " Right by the post office , " Uncle Jasper spoke up confidently ; " and he . . . " Great-aunt Elizabeth overbore him , and her clear tones went right on : " Jasper said to him , ' How 'd you like the pageant ? ' like that . And Earl said ' Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything more . On up the street  --  oh dear , oh dear . " " I see him after the picnic , " Uncle Sven volunteered . " That was before I did , " said Uncle Jasper witheringly . " Well , I see him and spoke with him , " Uncle Sven insisted . " Only he did n't say anything much . " " To think of the sweet child he was and all , " said Aunt Marty . Her black wig was askew and this she made no effort to correct , but looked out from under its waves , weeping and shaking her head and driving the wig ever more from its place . " Who found ' ern  --  who found ' em ? " cried Aunt Faith , offering her ear-trumpet to everyone ; but no one would take it . However , Great-aunt Elizabeth answered : " She was lying in a Morris chair in the parlor , fully clothed  --  fully clothed , " she repeated severely . " Her father came down at six o'clock this morning to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to his work . He works in the match factory " . . . " Well , keep a-going , keep a-going , " said Uncle Joel testily . His wife transferred her attention to him . " You 've heard this twice , " she told him . " Well , you get something new in every time , " said Uncle Joel . " For shame , Joel , " said Aunt Marty without winking . " And through the crack in the open door he thought he saw something . It was his daughter 's dress  --  her blue dress . There she lay in the Morris chair , fully clothed , and she had been dead about six hours . " " How can they tell that ? " Uncle Jasper demanded aggressively . No one paid any attention to him . " But when had Earl been there ? " cried Aunt Marty . " He had n't been there in six hours back , for pity sakes . What time would that have been ? " She told off the hours on her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Great-aunt Elizabeth continued . " Helga 's mother told him that Helga had gone to the pageant . She went with Arty Mines  --  that boy that used to clerk in the hotel , before the Jeffersons took it over . . . " " Keep a-goin ' , " said Uncle Joel . " And so Earl said he would wait . Mrs. Griffiths went to bed and left him sitting there  --  at least that 's what she tells . And that 's all they know . " With her yellow hair and her made-up cheeks and chin , Aunt Taffy spoke from her seat on the counter . " Anybody see him go there ? Anybody see Earl go there ? " " Nobody that 's confessed yet , " said Great-aunt Elizabeth . Uncle Jasper snorted , " Confessed ! " " And , oh , " Aunt Marty wailed , " to think it had to happen in our family . And to happen just as Cousin Alec comes . " " Such disgrace , " boomed Uncle Steven . " I ca n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He ai n't hung yet , " said Uncle Jasper . " The girls have all but slipped the noose , though , " Uncle Joel muttered . Seated near the worn desk where the accounts were kept , Ethna and Andris had taken no part in this . Now Ethna spoke , leaning forward from the waist , her hands resting on her knees . " I keep thinking about Earl , " she said . This produced a silence . All had been thinking of the event , of the disgrace , of the headlines , of anything , it seemed , but Earl . " He do n't deserve to be thought about , " said Andris . " Ungrateful puppy . " " He was Ernestine 's boy and she left him in our care . He 's never had a mother  --  nothing but a pack of aunts about his heels . He 's never had a real father . If that girl 's murdered by Earl Pethner , all the Pethners done it . " " / did n't do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower lip and stared at his hands , as if they had been the accused . " They told us , " said Andris loudly , " to keep away from the police station and not to try to see him until bail is fixed . " " Yes , and it 'll take all we 've got to raise his bail , " said Uncle Jasper . " We ca n't help it if it does , " cried Uncle Sven loudly . " It 's our own brother 's child . " " If we ai n't got it , we ai n't got it , " Jasper went on muttering . " I 'd like to be counted in on that , you know , " said Alec . Aunt Marty wailed , " The first thing the Pethners in America ask Alec to do is to hail them out . " " Not all of us , " said Uncle Joel . " Joel . " ' said Great-aunt Elizabeth . " We 're all to blame , according to Ethna , " said Andris sourly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Earl I 'm thinking of , " Ethna went on patiently . " What he must be going through now . What he must be going through . " " They tell us to keep away . " Aiidris went back to it . With a word to Alec , Magna slipped over to her mother and spoke with her . Ethna nodded and rose and left the room with Magna . In a moment Alec joined them outside . " Earl 's father was n't of much account , " Ethna said , " but he would n't have left him alone now , not if there was any chance of seeing him . " At sight of Alec 's car she drew back . She was one of those , of whom a few remain in remote places , who will never ride in a motor-driven vehicle . A train of cars was nothing to Ethna , or a steamboat  --  she had crossed the ocean in her twenties to visit her grandparents in Denmark . But a motor car she would enter no more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ground , " she would say , or , " Folks that do n't use their legs wo n't have any , next thing . " So Ethna and Magna and Alec walked through the streets and down town to the police station or , as it is known in these parts , the calaboose . Now , near as it was to the hour of the opening of that night 's pageant , the streets were at the height of their crowding and jostling . Bands blared at either end of the two business blocks , and the rivalries of the opposing ends of this thoroughfare had resulted in outbursts of decoration designed to fix the supremacy of each spot as a business center . Color , light , noise , movement  --  the town was at holiday . Ethna and Magna followed Alec through the chaos , Ethna 's square figure and hatless head and large unmoved face as individualized as one with a mask . Masked figures shouted at Magna and twitched at her sleeves and tried to lure her to join them . Magna walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret , now wretched at the thought of facing Bolo , who would he sure to be at the house on her return , now sorry and ashamed and shocked as she remembered Earl . " I 'm thinking only of myself , " she thought . " It 's of Alec and Bolo that I 'm thinking and I 'm forgetting Earl . " At the station house a crowd had collected , who were being held back by the chief of police , a man who deepened one 's respect for the law since its insistence could so dignify him . Large , good-natured , human , there had conic upon this man a certain nobility of carriage and expression , a gravity , a poise which revealed his identification with order . He was the small-town policeman at his best . " Mr , Curry , " said Ethna , " we have come here  --  I and Magna and our cousin from Scotland  --  to see Earl . Earl Pethner . " " Yes , yes , Mrs. Pethner , " said the chief kindly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little suburb . " We are obliged to keep everyone away from him for the present . " Now his eye fell upon Alec , and the word Scotland reverberated . " From Sco'land , did you say ? " he exclaimed , in an accent of broad Scotch . " Lately ? Ye do n't say . My own mother , Mary Roberts , came from there in her day . Well , well , Sco'land , and Earl 's own cousin . I think I may make an exception . " Ethna and Magna he admitted himself ; but Alec chose to remain outside . It was to live with Magna all her days , the sight of Earl , that large young man , lately so complacent , so swaggering . Now he lay face downward on a blanket spread on the bare floor . He was not moving , seemed not to be weeping ; but he was not asleep , for he heard them . " Now my lad , none of that , " said the chief , though he did not say none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you . Brace up , brace up . " Earl looked out at them , his face swollen and drawn . At once when Chief Curry had gone back down the passage and had locked the doors as he went , Earl began to talk loudly , his loose mouth moving about with his words . It was doubtful whether or not he knew that he was talking with Magna and her mother or later could have told who it was who had come to see him . His great need seemed to be to get something said . " I ca n't understand this , " he said thickly . " If anybody 'd told me .. . I tell you , I ca n't take it in . Me  --  do you understand . Why , I always wanted to be a carpenter . " For a breath he contemplated the enormity of this difference , as if he thought of the safety and the commonplace of the trade of carpentry . " And now look , " he went on , like a little boy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . T had no more idea of killing her than I had of killing myself . I could n't keep away from her . When I took hold of her I wanted to crush her . I thought about her all the time . I waited for her . Then she came in with that ass  --  Art Mines it was  --  and she laughed at me , and I ordered him home , and he was afraid and went ; and she cried and said she hated me . But I do n't know how it happened . I was crazy about that girl  --  I was crazy about that girl . " He began to moan and whimper . " Do n't talk , do n't try to talk , " Magna had been saying . " Do n't say any of this to anybody , son , " Ethna said heavily . Ethna thought for a moment , as if she were trying to pack in one word all that might be said to him . " Hard things come , " she said finally . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of them . Just those two . " She reached out and patted on the bars and turned away . Magna spoke to him , but he did not seem to hear her . Chief Curry was at the door saying , " If you please . " I Rack through the streets , and now the parade was passing again , that long line of men and women of Forty-nine . Well , they had gone across the desert and the mountains , had buried their children by the way , and had laid down their own bones in the alkali of dead lands  --  and for what ? For what ? To make a carnival for the people in celebration of that history ? To bring into the world men like Earl who snivelled out behind bars , " I was crazy about that girl " ? " Poor lad , " said Ethna . " He got mad for love . Some are taken that way . There was a youth in our town . . . " While the revelers jostled her and the horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he twenty years old some twenty-odd years before , and in his grave now these many years . He was a lad who had got it in his mind that to love and to die were the one as fine as the other , and so , though he and his sweetheart , Minna , were as happy as doves , did n't he kill her and himself , leaving a wrinkled-up note to say that they were married in death . " Please hurry , please hurry , " Magna cried and ran on before them . Only last night , she thought , everything was so peaceful , so sweet . And now their world had been broken about them . At the shop their absence had been noted , and its cause suspected , and now they were beaten upon by the Pethner questioning . How did Earl seem , look , and above all , what had Earl said ? Ethna was the spokesman . " Said nothing , " she declared . " But  --  nothing ? " " Not one word . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How did he look ? " " Same , same . " " It 's impossible , " Great-aunt Elizabeth burst out . " Earl must have said something . You need n't tell me . . . " " Said not one word , " said Ethna and folded her veined hands . When she entered the shop Magna had scanned all the faces . Bolo was not there . She inquired for him , and her father told her with a scowl that he had not been there , had had the grace to stay away . She ran across the yard to the house , but no one had seen him . She called on the telephone , both the little hotel where he lived and his office . He was at neither place . He must have been summoned to some patient , she decided , but it was not like Bolo to send no word . She felt an intense relief , and yet she must tell him , tell him something . If only all the Pethners would go home . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that they knew and speculating on all that they did not know . " Just think , " said Aunt Marty , " last night we were all together for a picnic . And to-night we are all together for a murder . At least . . . " And though Great-aunt Elizabeth had recited to everyone all the facts at her command , now on leaving she suddenly turned to poor Aunt Faith 's ear-trumpet , waving about so helplessly , with no one to take the trouble to talk into it ; and Great-aunt Elizabeth seized on that , and into it told the whole story again , with many interruptions from Aunt Faith who , it developed , had thought all the time that it was Earl who had been murdered , and who brightened visibly when she learned the truth . At Iast they all went away , Uncle Joel inquiring of his wife if she had remembered to buy yeast . And when he had been sharply rebuked for thinking of yeast at such a time , he observed audibly that there was no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had a murder in the family you could at least get out of setting bread . But Great-aunt Elizabeth pretended not to hear . " I hope you folks 'll all come in again when you need something , " Andris said , his shop urbanity claiming him even in the teeth of family disgrace . " I 'm getting in some nice early strawberries , " he could not forbear to add . When they had all gone , Magna and Alec went over to the house while Ethna and Andris locked the shop . The pageant was still going on , and now the rockets were blazing and spangling the sky . " Last night , " said Alec , " you and I did n't know  --  or did we how  --  how soon we should belong to each other . " " Last night , " Magna said , " Earl told me about that girl  --  Helga . " She waited . " Last night , " she thought , " Bolo thought that I . . . " Where was Bolo ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethna bustled out to the kitchen and brought in coffee and cake  --  as something real and abiding in a world of change . Now Alec took Magna in his arms and said to her parents : " I could n't wait a decent time . I told her to-day . " For the first time that evening the face of Andris broke into its old smile . " Thank God , " he said , " the whole world is n't sunk . " He had been withdrawn and morose all the evening , but now he kindled , drank coffee , ate cake , cut an awkward and laborious turkey-wing , and in his reaction from the strain , was even at his old trick of trying to make a joke . He pointed at Ethna . " She 's a good girl , " he said . " She 's fat too . A good many of her would weigh a ton . " He looked about with bright expectation . No one smiled . He sighed patiently . No one ever laughed at his jokes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock Magna stood at a window . Bolo would not come now  --  she should not have to tell him until tomorrow . But it was as if the word had gone to him that he need not come to see her that evening , that he need never come there again . Yet he had Griffiths . In Alec 's arms , as he said good-n spell and d sheforgwasot them all.d in her new done nothing but to he himself  --  gay and tender  --  and to love her . What would this mean to Bob  --  o She knew . Alec came and stood beside her . The moment that he was near her the world changed . She thought , " I 'm mad about him , " and stopped there . That was what Earl had said of Helga When Alec had gone up , and Magna turned to say good-night to her mother , she saw that both her mother and father were waiting to say something to her . And though since Alec 's word her father was in the best of spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unbearable wistfulness , as if she were asking her daughter 's pardon . Magna waited . The tittle room was very still . Outside , the last of the rockets were popping , and the tramp of the feet of the home-going revelers came from the pavement , together with the roll and honk of cars . The Descendants of Forty-niners had finished an evening of doing their wayfaring ancestors proud . Now Andris began stepping about the room , kicking his feet , moving the chairs , clearing his throat . He wound the clock , felt of the window catches , closed a door which might have stood open . Ethna sat patiently , her veined hands crossed ; but at last her husband 's antics became too much for her and she exclaimed crossly : " Well , why not tell her then and have done ? " But first Andris must have his joke . " When you were a little thing , " he said to Magna , " you were very fond of your papa . And he was fond of you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the game . He 's going to tell you something . " He laughed pleasurably and looked for her smile . But Magna said wearily , " Yes , yes , daddy . What ? " He stood before her and suddenly lifted and dropped his arms in one of the few un-American ways that he had kept . " Magna , " he said , " my father came to this country a poor man . He left me nothing . Well , I built me up a good little business  --  your mother and I , we built it up . You know thatyourself . And now in our fifties , what do we find ? Ourselves  --  youwithout anything . It is true  --  mother , is n't it true ? Without anything . Not but just the dollars to clear ourselves and after that nothing . " Magna said , " Dad  --  mother -- is that true ? " She remembered Great-aunt Elizabeth 's words that morning . She was wrung for them  --  her father so bright-faced , so busy , her mother so patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darlings , " she said , and then cried , " But you should n't have sent me to school . And I have n't been in a hurry about getting a job . " " You have done better than that , " said her father . " Better than that . " She looked at him . " Alec , " he said , " your marriage with Alec . Do n't you see what it means to us now ? " Her father had placed his hands on his waist and was smiling , bending forward from the waist like a little mountebank . She could have cried out against him , could have struck at him . But her mother merely looked at her with that air of incredible wistfulness . " So that was why . . " said Magna . " That was why , " cried her father . " I felt in desperation  --  I ? that you must not marry this Bolo , who could give you nothing but a bad practice , and that not for years yet . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was why . " " But for that , " her mother put in timidly , " your father liked Bolo . And me  --  I liked him very well . I should never have said a word . . . " She stopped , in a kind of loyalty to Andris , as if in whatever was being said by him she must bear her part and share his words . Andris went on : " So then when this Alec was to come here  --  I knew well his father 's standing , from the Pethners of Clyde I knew that . And I said to myself , if only . . you see ? But I did not hope for such quick work , " he added na  --  vely . " That does not matter , " cried Ethna swiftly . " It is very encouraging , " Andris insisted . " Why , it was only yesterday that you and Bolo came to me . . . . You are a good girl , Magna , " he ended , wagging his head . Magna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , even before their exclamations and her mother 's haste towards her , she was pale and dry-eyed . " Do n't think I blame you , " she cried . " It is only I. You have done nothing . You never let me know of this  --  but I have done wrong by myself and by Alec  --  and by Bolo . I am not good enough for either of them . Oh , why did you tell me this  --  no ! I 'm glad that you told me . Oh , " Magna cried , " I 'm so miserable . " She had no habit of going to either her father or her mother for comfort . It did not occur to her to turn to either of them now . She threw herself down by the table and laid her head on her arms ; and her mother came and smoothed and stroked at the linen tablecover near her . But her father stepped about the room , now here and now there , his face one blank of amazement . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used no influence on you . You ca n't say that 1 did . I only told you now so that you can share our rejoicing . " " Andris , " said Ethna , " I should think you could step upstairs to bed now . Magna 's tired . " He went off , muttering and a little indignant . Ethna stood for a moment longer , smoothing at the linen table-cover near Magna 's head . " Go to bed , mother , " Magna said . Ethna stopped and whispered to her : " You marry any man you please , " she said . " Your father  --  is a good man , " she ended abruptly and followed him upstairs . Magna sat in the little room . How extraordinarily quickly one could change one 's life , change everything . There was Earl last night at this time , and there was Earl now . There was Alec , last night , here , drinking coffee , and now there he was , upstairs , thinking of her in the new way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in her room , as she lay there listening to Alec 's voice . And Bolo  --  Bolo had been happy in the thought of her , and perhaps he was still happy , thinking that she belonged to him  --  oh , no , he must not think that . She must find him , must tell him the truth  --  that it was Alec now , that she had so suddenly chosen . . . . Had she chosen ? Or had something chosen for her ? The ancient sense of inevitability seemed about to give her refuge . But to leave Bolo in his fool 's paradise  --  that she must not do . She went swiftly to the telephone and rang up the little hotel . Dr. Marks had not come in , had not been in the whole evening . There had been several calls for him . She rang his office number . No answer . But as she listened to the recurrent ringing , knowing how it sounded and echoed in the snug little room , it seemed to her as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could not possibly have gone away without leaving her some message . Something had happened . Something had happened ! Then , with fearful suddenness , the recurrent ringing at the other end ceased in a curious shattering sound , a tingling of a telephone bell , a crash of the instrument . Then silence . She sprang up . She could not call her mother without her father 's questioning , and certainly she could not call him for Bolo . She slipped out of the house , in the warm night , and ran down the street . Bolo 's office was but a half dozen blocks away . The streets were not yet emptied , and the sight of Magna , in her reddish gown , her bright hair about her face , brought cries from a few revelers who thought her one of them . One or two knew her and called to her as she ran , but she made no answer . Her shortest way lay through the main street , and this way she took , regardless of the idlers who still hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with her  --  there was no one whom she wanted to go with her . She ran through the lighted streets and reached the stairway to Bolo 's office . The stairway of this old building was dark and steep . She groped her way up . She had been there but once , on that day when she and Bolo had told their love by Bolo 's desk  --  thedesk from which she was sure that the telephone had just gone crashing down . She made her way up the hall  --  oh , what one in that interminable row of doors was his door ? She felt her way along , tried a door when she thought she had reached his , found it locked , tried another . Now she heard a sound , hoarse and querulous , a long rattle and ring , as a telephone is rung when the receiver is off the hook . Then it was as she had thought  --  the instrument had fallen or had been pushed . Guided by the sound she got to his door , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was faintly lighted by the lamps in the street . Near the desk on the floor she thought that she could discern the hunched and crumpled figure of a man . " Bolo ! " she cried . " Bolo ! " Like a breath more than like a word , she heard someone answer . ( To be concluded )
