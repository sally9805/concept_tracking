Japan 's little Premier , Nobuyuki Abe , is a definition of inconsistency . His breakfast begins by being Japanese ( bean soup , pickled eggplant , rice ) and ends Occidentally ( soft-boiled eggs , a glass of milk ) . His house ( suburban , neither big nor small ) is typically that of a Japanese military man , but is cluttered by a very unmilitary hobby-scores of canaries and red sparrows in pretty cages . Premier Abe drinks a little but not much , smokes a little but not much , exercises a little but not much . He is a general , but he has never been to war . <P> Month ago Japan 's senior statesmen drew this indecisive character- " blinking , " as the Japanese say , " like a bull drawn into the sunlight from a dark stall " - out into the open to be Premier . He had an awful time making up his mind about a Cabinet ; it took him 29 hours , cost him 2,047 yen for 590 bottles of beer , three barrels of sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten strings of dried cuttlefish and six telephones-all but the telephones consumed during conferences by eager candidates , hangers-on , advisers . <P> This very quality of indecision was just the reason why Nobuyuki Abe was chosen : he would be pliable . But those who chose him did not realize that under him the whole Government would degenerate into machinery for vacillation . Since U. S. Ambassador Joseph Clark Grew gave Japan a piece of the U. S. mind on Oct. 19 , the Japanese have wavered worse than before . <P> First they said they appreciated Mr. Grew 's sincerity . Then they contradicted his points . Premier Abe talked with Foreign Minister Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura and it was announced that conversations would be held with the Ambassador . Then the Army talked with Premier Abe and it was announced that they would not . Foreign Minister Nomura would talk with Ambassador Grew privately , informally . No , the Foreign Minister was " too busy " ; he would not . Last week he did . <P> By this time the U. S. had become infected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grew had threatened economic pressure if Japan did not change her policy in China . Second ( official ) reports said he had not made any threat . <P> When all this had simmered down to a broth of truth , something like this remained : The Japanese were greatly impressed by Ambassador Grew 's speech . The Government wanted to do something about it at once . But the Army ( which usually prevails ) wanted first to install Puppet-elect Wang Ching-wei in China-accomplish the New Order , and then discuss it . Every Ambassador pays a routine call on a new Foreign Minister ; hence last week 's conversation . The talk was entirely friendly , and there was no threat . But Ambassador Grew again made clear the nature of U. S. complaints and the temper of the U. S. public . And another thing he made perfectly clear was that there is some talk in the U. S. that when the abrogated Trade Treaty of 1911 lapses in January , it might be followed not by a new treaty , but by an embargo . To tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's war for them is not to threaten him .
