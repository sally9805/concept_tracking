There is no Federal law against nepotism. * A Senator or Congressman may load the Government payroll with relatives as heavily as his conscience or his constituency will permit . Some family jobholders actually work ; others only draw pay . Among the most industrious Capitol clerks is Mrs. John Nance Garner who gets $325 per month for ably serving her husband , the House Speaker , as secretary . Senator Robert Marion ( " Young Bob " ) La Follette got his training for office as his late great father 's secretary . In some Congressional families public service is an honest vocation . In others it is admittedly a racket to swell the family income by means of the clerk-hire allowance . <P> Weeks of agitation against nepotism in the House where members are allowed $5,000 per year to staff their offices produced results last week . A resolution by North Carolina 's Warren to open the April payroll to public inspection was adopted . This was brought about largely by a series of crusading dispatches by inquisitive United Pressman Raymond Clapper , whose digs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who pays his wife , son or daughter to clerk for him wrathfully refuses to discuss publicly the details of the arrangement . Newsmen had to puzzle out the House 's payroll for April by themselves . They found : One hundred members with clerks of the same name , presumably wives , daughters , sons , brothers or sisters on the payroll . Six members ( Ohio 's Brand , Louisiana 's Fernandez , Texas ' Garner , Texas ' Williams , Minnesota 's Christgau , Kentucky 's Thatcher ) with two namesakes hired . Democratic Floor Leader Rainey paying his wife Ella $208.33 per month as secretary . Chairman Collier of the Ways &; Means Committee paying Laura Collier $180 per month . Chairman Vinson of the Naval Affairs Committee paying Mary Vinson $116.66 per month . <P> Resident Commissioner Osias of the Philippines and Delegate Wickersham of Alaska following the Congressional practice . <P> No indication of how many nieces , nephews , aunts , uncles or in-laws members had been able to tuck into the payroll under other names . Tully Garner , the Speaker 's son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the list 's publication Son Tully , who tends his father 's Texas ranch , was dropped from the nation 's service . <P> Nepotism also runs high in the Senate where blood relatives are listed as secretaries to Kentucky 's Barkley and Logan , South Dakota 's Bulow , Tennessee 's McKellar , Minnesota 's Schall , Delaware 's Townsend , Florida 's Trammell* , Iowa 's Brookhart . Last week the case of Senator Brookhart was a large campaign issue in his State 's Republican primary ( June 6 ) . <P> The principal opponent of a Brookhart renomination is Henry ( " Himself " ) Field who operates in Shenandoah a large general store and a broadcasting station ( KFNF ) . Using his radio to ballyhoo his goods Storekeeper Field sells seeds , prunes , typewriters , hams , shirts , overalls , shoes paints , tires , pigs et al . His bargain announcements over the air bring country crowds flocking from miles to Shenandoah , much to the dismay of shopkeepers elsewhere . Candidate Field has never been in politics before , counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
