Across the street in the White House , foreign words and wars were the main concern also of the man who had set the State Department to working overtime . Having previously decided that he wanted an extra session of Congress and what he wanted it to do , Franklin Roosevelt 's major job in Washington was to deal with the reverberations , political and international , that followed his announcement in Chicago of a new foreign policy ( TIME , Oct. 18 ) . <P> In Chicago he had used the words " quarantine " and " concerted effort , " which gave isolationists and passive-peace advocates a jolt .
