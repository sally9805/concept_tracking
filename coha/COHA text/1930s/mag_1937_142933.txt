In Philadelphia one day last week a pilot named George Townson took off from an airport in a plane that resembled an ordinary biplane . He circled the field , landed normally , few minutes later took off again . While he was in midair , watchers on the ground saw the upper wing begin to revolve like the vanes of a gyro . This time George Townson landed in the steep , space-saving drop characteristic of a gyro , came to earth gently . <P> Christened the " Vertaplane " by its inventor , Gerard Post Herrick ( distant kin of onetime Ambassador to France Myron T. Herrick ) of New York City , the craft has a strong pylon with a vertical mast which holds the top wing firmly in place for ordinary flying , and when released allows it to revolve on a bearing for a gyro landing . By virtue of a starting mechanism in the wing which starts rotation on the ground , the Vertaplane can make a gyro takeoff as well as a gyro landing . It weighs 1,700 lb. , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration : " For ten years we have been searching for the missing link of safety in aviation . We hope that it is the Vertaplane . By flying as an airplane and landing as a windmill plane it would seem to combine the advantages of both . " A group of Government scouts , newshawks and tradepaper reporters felicitated the inventor , expressed keen interest , hoped the ship 's inventor could design it for greater payload . It is now designed as a two-place plane .
