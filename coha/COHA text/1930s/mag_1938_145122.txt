Many U. S. periodicals are published for adults and a few for children , but hardly any specifically address the in-between group called Youth .

It condenses from grownups ' newspapers and magazines articles that are believed to be particularly interesting to youth . Youth Today also will pick a boy and a girl of the month . Girl of the Month for October : Alma Sheppard , 12 , of Hanover , Pa. , who drove her father 's trotter to three world 's harness racing records . Boy of the Month : Edward Higgins , 11 , of Pueblo , Colo .
