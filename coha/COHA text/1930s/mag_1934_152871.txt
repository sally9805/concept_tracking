Students at Middlesex School , Concord , Mass. , are not allowed to play the races . Nonetheless when a horse named Granite Son won a race at Chicago last week , a Middlesex boy cashed a bet of $739.70 . Middlesex masters wondered what to do , until they learned the extenuating circumstances . <P> Last year , young Robert Cudahy persuaded his father , son of the founder of Cudahy Packing Co. , to buy him a little chestnut race horse from a man who owed a feed bill of $170 and wanted to sell the horse for the bill . This summer , 14-year-old " Bob " Cudahy marked out a quarter-mile track on the Onwentsia Club polo field , had the family chauffeur hold a clock while he rode his horse around it . Later he sent the horse to the racing stable of one of his father 's friends , had the trainer let a jockey exercise him . Because in his nine previous starts he had never done better than fifth , none of the Cudahys except young Bob bothered to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week at Lincoln Fields . Young Cudahy 's winnings came from a $6 bet divided across the board , on Granite Son . The Cudahy chauffeur , the Cudahy nurse , each bet 50 , won $108.07.
