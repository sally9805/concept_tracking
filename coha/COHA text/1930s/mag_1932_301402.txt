Licking their chops at the thought of Christmas presents still to be bought , the print-makers of the U. S. made jubilee last week . They did it by lodges . The Society of American Etchers held their with annual exhibition in New York 's National Arts Club . <P> The Philadelphia Society of Etchers had their annual exhibition in New York 's Grand Central Galleries . The Chicago Society of Etchers held up their end with an exhibition in the Chicago Fine Arts Building . The American Print Makers Society showed their sixth annual crop of etchings , lithographs , woodcuts . For the tenth year , the Brooklyn Museum showed " Fine Prints of the Year , " an international anthology of Continental . British and U. S. prints chosen each year by Critic Malcolm C. Salaman for the European section , for the last two years by Curator Susan A. Hutchinson for the U. S. In all these shows prices ranged from $10 to $50 . <P> For every U. S. citizen who buys a painting or a piece of sculpture , probably 500 buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prints are comparatively inexpensive . Even in a city apartment a portfolio of 100 will fit in a bureau drawer . Because of their fluctuating value they appeal to the trading instinct latent in all collectors . But the appreciation of the graphic arts has this difference from the appreciation of painting : a man may have a sound knowledge of Renaissance painting without knowing the difference between tempera and gesso . But a print collector can not appreciate what he has in his portfolio unless he knows a great deal about the technical processes involved . A finished print is the result of three artistic processes : composition , engraving , printing . <P> The late famed Joseph Pennell used to say that an etcher who did not print his own plates was not an artist but a manufacturer . The collector sees but half the beauty in a Whistler etching until he realizes how elegant Jimmy deepened his blacks by rebiting with stronger acid , lightened unnecessary lines by brushing them with varnish . <P> The London Studio has just published the first two handbooks in a series on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art students the books contain little that any first-year student in an art school would not know , are of great value in showing the general public how prints are made , what to look for in the finished proof . Most interesting are the tipped-in photographs showing Etcher West and Woodcutter Leighton at work , pictures of all the etchers ' and woodcutters ' tools . <P> Everyone knows that an etching is made by scratching lines through the wax " ground " on a copper plate with a needle , then biting the exposed lines into the plate by dipping it in a bath of nitric acid . Few people know that the etcher 's needle should never scratch the plate itself ( unless he is making a drypoint ) . Depth of line for increased blackness is all done by action of the acid . A goose feather is the best possible tool for brushing away microscopic gas bubbles while the plate is in the bath . Much of the effect of Whistler 's etchings is due to the fact that he was a superb wiper , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess ink from his plates before each printing .
