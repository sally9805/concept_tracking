SEC has long been anxious to stop partners in brokerage firms from margin speculating . Last week the New York Stock Exchange issued a new regulation to satisfy SEC . It forbade general partners of member firms from trading on margin through their own or other member firms . ( Like other investors , they can , of course , trade on borrowed money if they obtain it elsewhere . ) Exempt from this rule were specialists and certain technical transactions . The Exchange warned partners that the brokerage accounts of their close relatives would be scanned to see that the spirit of the new rule was observed .
