 | Let 's Put Executives Back to Work Condensed from The Forum John T. Flynn Author of " Graft in Business " THERE HAVE BEEN notes of discontent , lately , at the wages that are being paid to the men who run our great corporations . Some of these men are , of course , able executives , but a whole lot more of them are stuffed shirts . A banker who in 19 29 took yoo , ooo , ooo of capital into the stock market for clients and bought stocks at the very top , only to see much of the investment wiped out a few weeks later is not , after all , worth the millions he collects for his talents , There is a kind of notion that what the corporation executive gets is a matter which concerns only his stockholders , who must pay the bills . The answers to this are obvious . First of all , the stockholders , as a rule , not only do n't know what the executive gets but ca n't find out . Next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . They are too numerous , too scattered , too unorganized . There is a humorous little theory that they own and control the corporation which is very much like the legend that the electoral college names the president . The corporation is controlled , as a rule , by the executives or bankers or a small clique of promoters : These executives , it must be remembered , are mere employes . They are as much employes as the office boy . It is quite unusual for the executives of large corporations to own any important proportion of the corporation 's stock . In one of the Standard Oil companies all the high executives put together owned , some years ago , only one-fifth of one percent of its stock . In the United States Steel Corporation the board of directors do not own as much stock as the employes . In the Pennsylvania Railroad no executive owns as much as one-tenth of one percent of the stock . These executives are hired men - employes who are handling other people 's money , and who hold positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salaries they get ? Here are some general figures . Insurance presidents : The highest salary is szoo , ooo a year . The average presidential salary of the 15 largest companies is $ ' 70,000 . Railroad presidents : A very few got over yoo , ooo before the depression . At least one got $i50,000 . Quite a few get around $So , ooo . Telephone and telegraph presidents : The highest salary is $z 50,000.  | Heads of the leading operating companies get from $z5 , ooo to $75,00o a year . Banks : The salaries of presidents of large banks run all the way from $25,00o a year up to $ioo , ooo and more . Industrial corporations : Salaries around $50,00o would be the rule in this field . But there are many men getting over yoo , ooo . If a corporation president is to play a grand role , surrounding himself with magnificence , a number of houses , and all the " makeup " which is essential to impress upon the world his consequence , then it must be conceded that $aoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be conceded that it is quite enough . But there is another important consideration to be kept in mind . It is the distinction between direct compensation and indirect compensation . This is the area in which the most serious abuses grow up . These indirect and generally secret kinds of compensation take three forms . First , there are the bonuses of which we have heard so much . There are cases like that of Charles E. Mitchell , who in 1929 got a salary of $roo , - ooo , and then $a , i6o , ooo additional bonus checks . The late Elbert H. Gary never got , I understand , a salary from the steel corporation exceeding $zoo , ooo a year . But in one year he collected enough bonus to make his whole yearly compensation come to $425 , 00 . And Mr. George W. Hill , President of the American Tobacco Company , collected in a single year $2,000,00o in cash and stock bonuses . The next method of obtaining extra compensation may well be illustrated by the recent case of Col. Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a corporation , like the mayor of a city , has at his disposal large contracts for purchases . It is the easiest thing in the world for him to route these purchases to companies which he owns , or in which he has a large interest . Let no one say this is rare . Stewart and other oil executives organized a company which bought millions of barrels of crude oil and then sold it to their respective companies at 25 cents a barrel profit . The third kind is , perhaps , the most common of the forms of extra compensation . It is also the most deadly form , one which skirts the edges of dishonesty . It is that form of money making which is open to the executive who is willing to gamble in the stocks of his company , who is willing to use the opportunities which his position of trust gives him to make sums beside which his salary is insignificant . Again the practice is all too common . Few executives can become mil-  | lionaires on their salaries ; yet many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these abuses would entail a good many changes in our method of doing business , to say nothing of a change in our whole attitude toward the acquisitive man . First of all , we have got to take some pretty severe measures , somehow , somewhere , to get back into our social consciousness an understanding of the simple concept of trust . The average employer is pretty settled in his view about his employes being employed in any other work which might conflict with their duties . If we will understand definitely that these corporation executives are employes , employes paid large sums for their ability and their trustworthiness , we shall begin to realize that these men are bound in decency to yield a degree and quality of trust of the highest order . Whether an executive is worth $ioo , ooo or twice that much may be open to question , but this at least ought to be closed : that when he gets $zoo , - 00o a year , he should be expected to give not only his undivided interest and loyalty to the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profit which amount to nothing more than glorified graft . The compensation of all high executives , as well as all the facts about their stockholdings in their corporations and the amounts of such stock bought and sold , should be in every report to stockholders . Also executives of corporations should be prohibited from serving on the boards of directors of other corporations . More important than all , I should like to renew a suggestion I made some years ago , that in every corporation there should be two boards of directors . One of these should be an executive board of directors which actually directs the business , elects officers , and fixes policies . Then there should be another board of directors which represents the stockholders , the bondholders , and the workers . Its functions should be merely to have the right to call for information , to instigate audits , to examine any part of the business , and to exercise a veto on salaries , wages , and all elections of officers , as well as on activities of officers . The aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , this executive employe , who has been " running away with himself , " in his place .
