FORTY YEARS OF PSYCHIC RESEARCH- Hamlin Garland-Macmillan ( $3 ) . <P> Whether or not convicts in the death-house can be counted on to tell the truth about their past , men who have survived three-score- &-ten; are more serious than their juniors on the subject of the future . After that lonely milestone , many an agnostic joins the comforting company of the faithful . But last week stout-hearted Hamlin Garland , though he is five years beyond the warning mark , still kept to his lifelong agnosticism . This intransigence was the more remarkable because for 45 years he had been an eager investigator of spiritualism . Last week he submitted his lifetime 's report on psychic research . Its sober findings will be respected by followers of both camps but will give little aid &; comfort to either . <P> Author Garland was a young ( 31 ) writer in Boston , " a novelist , holding a keen interest in positive science , " when he was approached by a friend who was a spiritualist , asked to join a circle for the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also agreed to join , Garland went along . Thereafter , in many a darkened room ( and sometimes in a daylit office ) , he heard , saw , felt many a queer thing . Scientifically curious , he kept records of the seances he attended . In Forty Years of Psychic Research he has rewritten those records into a " plain narrative of fact . " Though he has changed " psychics ' " names , supplemented his written record with his memory , he goes bail for the essential accuracy of his facts . Says he : " If these supernormal events are illusory , then all the events of my life are illusory . " <P> For those familiar with the popular literature of spiritualism , what Researcher Garland has to tell will be nothing new . He and his fellow-researchers did what they could to cramp the mediums ' style , by tying them to their chairs , tacking their skirts to the floor , putting rustly newspapers on their laps . In spite of these bonds tables gyrated , pianos played , " ectoplasmic " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &-gone; characters on " the other side . ' ' Investigator Garland was impressed but noticed some incongruities . " I confess that it was a bit surprising to find Socrates and Julius Caesar writing messages in commonplace English for the benefit of an elderly citizen of Washington . " It was hardly less surprising to hear Roosevelt I admitting that 1912 was " great times but these are greater . I stand , behind my cousin . " <P> Garland 's conclusion : the phenomena are inexplicable but their interpretation is too hopeful . Spiritualism naturally draws people who have been bereaved , but their faith is " a fairy story with a heartache in it . " Garland thinks mediums are often sincere but are probably subconscious frauds . His guess at the queer things he heard , saw , felt : " They all originate in the seance room and have not been proven to go beyond it . "
