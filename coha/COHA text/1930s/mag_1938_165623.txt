The U. S. people may be suckers for free lunches and one-cent sales , but they do not go out of their way to get free education . Nor do they often work up an appetite for warmed-over ideas . Consequently , the gratuitous revival last week of a school of thought that had its heyday more than 40 years ago made news . As the Henry George School of Social Science bought a $50,000 building in Manhattan for schoolhouse and headquarters , disciples of Georgism disclosed that the single-tax doctrine today has some 21,000 student followers throughout the U. S. , is growing rapidly . <P> Henry George ( 1839-1897 ) , who proposed to end depressions and poverty by levying a single tax on land values , thus freeing the land for productive use and restoring to capital &; labor the profits wrested from them by landowners , was nearly elected mayor of New York City in 1886 . After his death , his creed languished . Only a handful of believers were left when in 1932 one Oscar H. Geiger , a businessman , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught them one course with George 's Progress and Poverty as the text , died at the end of the year . Next year the school got a new director and a business manager , soon was giving free lessons , mostly to middle-aged people , in Y. M. C. A. 's , settlement houses , clubs , schools . Today there are classes in some 200 U. S. cities and seven foreign countries , and 5,000 people study Georgism by correspondence . New teachers can not be trained fast enough . Honorary president of the school is venerable Philosopher John Dewey . <P> Director is burly Frank Chodorov , quondam schoolteacher , traveling salesman , manufacturer , editor , who constantly has a pipe or cigar in his mouth . Director Chodorov last week had a simple explanation for Georgism 's revival : its simplicity . So simple that the school claims the man-in-the-street can be trained to teach it , Henry George 's doctrine , according to Mr. Chodorov , sweeps aside the " academic gibberish " with which orthodox practitioners of the " dismal " science of economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry George School is free from propaganda : " We do n't make the students swallow anything they do n't like and we do n't mind arguments . " Enrolled in the school are Communists , Republicans and in-between shades . Warring equally against land monopoly and collectivism , Georgism makes its greatest appeal to lawyers , teachers , public accountants , businessmen .
