txt There is nothing Inflationary In the Treasury 's plan to use a portion of the gold " profit " to retire the outstanding national bank note circulation , in the opinion of Wall Street bankers . On the contrary , It is believed that the Treasury has found in the plan a means of utilizing the gold " profits , " which are generally regarded as explosive with potentialities for inflation , to simplify the currency system and to retire a part of the government debt without increasing the credit base or expanding the currency . In the plan the Treasury , it is pointed out , has reverted to an original purpose of the Federal Reserve Act , the replacing of the national bank note circulation with Federal Reserve notes . This original purpose was lost sight of during the war , when there was need for additional currency , and has since then been neglected . Offset in Two-Part Operation . The reason given in the financial community why there will be no inflation involved in the retirement of the national bank notes is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using its gold to retire the 2 per cent consols and Panama Canal bonds the Treasury will be increasing the reserves of national banks . This by itself would be inflationary , for it would further expand the credit base . But the same banks which receive these extra funds will be compelled to put up cash with the Treasury for the retirement of the national bank notes that they had outstanding against the 2 per cent bonds . This operation will mean a loss of reserves for the banks , and the result wilt be a virtual balance , leaving the banks with no more reserves than they had before . As for the effect of the operation , upon the currency , it is described as involving merely the elimination of what has been described as an " abortive " form of paper money . 11 To the extent that the retirement of the national bank notes creates a shortage in the available supply of money in circulation it will be met by the issuance of Federal Reserve notes in the normal manner . Currency Simplifying Long Urged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced by the retirement of national banknotes from circulation , has long been urged by bankers and economists . The circulation statement of the Treasury lists nine different kinds of circulation , excluding gold certificates , which no longer circulate legally . Included in the varieties of paper money in use in the country are silver certificates , United States notes , Federal Reserve notes and national banknotes . An obstacle which has stood in the way of the earlier retirement of national banknotes was the fact that the national banks made a substantial profit on the circulation privilege . Upon the bonds which they pledged as security they received 2 per cent interest , while the currency which they were permitted to issue could be lent out at a profit . At the present time , however , there will be little protest from national banks at the retirement of their circulation . The banks already have on hand more funds than they can profitably lend or invest and have of their own accord been retiring their circulation rapidly in the past two years . Neither the Chase National Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest national banks in the country , had any banknotes outstanding at the end of 1934 . The Chase had $18,120,000 circulating notes at the close of 1933,1 none the year before , and $16,176 , - ' 650 at the end of 1931 , while the National City had $25,000,000 circulation at the end of 1933 , $2,000,000 at the end of 1932 , and none the year before . First National Bank on Dec. 31 , 1934 , had $372,000 circulation , against $9,931,050 the year before , $9,921,980 two years ago , and $8 , - 471,500 at the end of 1931 . Other large institutions also have progressively retired their currency , but in the aggregate the total national bank circulation has been declining only during the past year . On March 7 , there were $865,350 , - 945 national bank notes outstanding , of which $17,075,945 were held by the Treasury in process of redemption . The high record yearend figure was $970,601,088 at Dec. 31 , 1933 , to which it had risen by progressive stages from $719,037 , - 730 at the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of currency was $819,273,593 at the close of 1915 . Apart from the fact that the Treasury 's operation will effect a retirement of a portion of the government 's debt , bankers saw the possibility that the plan might to some extent benefit the government bond market by creating a demand for new issues by national banks to replace the circulating bonds which are being retired . The government will effect a saving in interest by the retirement of the bonds , although it will lose some revenue which it received from the tax of one-half of 1 per cent which national banks paid upon their circulation . Bankers here recognized last night the possibilities that the use of gold profit by the Treasury might lead to temporary misunderstanding in financial markets at home and abroad . It has been so generally remarked by economists that the gold profits contain the potentialities for inflation that there may be a tendency , some bankers suggested last night , for the markets to jump at once to the conclusion that the current plan involves inflation . It was thought likely that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its gold profits , the stabilization fund , to stand guard over both the dollar and government bonds today when the markets give their first response to the news . For a long-range viewpoint the most important aspect of the Treasury 's plan to retire the national bank note circulation , most bankers and economists felt last night , was that it would permanently dispose of a substantial part of the gold profit derived from the devaluation of the dollar . The product of a bookkeeping operation , the $2,800,000,000 of gold profit has been regarded as holding out perilous temptations to Congress . Since its use for nearly all purposes , including the retirement of ordinary portions of the government debt , would have been inflationary , bankers have been worried , about its mere existence . ' An ingenious use which is now planned for the gold profit , whereby the inflationary effect is directly offset by a corresponding deflationary effect , involved In the retirement of a part of the currency in circulation , drew admiration from bankers and economists who had been mistrustful of what the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold profits remaining after this operation will be those already set aside for the Treasury 's $2,000.000,000 stabilization fund . Since the need for this fund is daily demonstrated in the fluctuations of the foreign exchange market , it is felt that there is little danger that Congress will cast covetous eyes upon that particular fund .
