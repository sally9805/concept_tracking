About the land last week was circulating an emblem for citizens who do not become " NRA Members-We Do Our Part . " It was a black buzzard labelled " Non-member - We do n't " . Its designer was Adam Cooper Warfel , 42 , a mechanical engineer employed in St. Louis by Hartford Accident &; Indemnity Co. who draws cartoons and posters for fun. * Engineer Warfel mailed his emblem to Washington and forgot about it . Fortnight ago salt-tongued Recovery Administrator Johnson went to St. Louis , made an NRA speech in which he said : " <P> " ' Chiseling ' may be a slang word but chiseling is the chief threat to this movement . From your good town of St. Louis there came to my desk the other day a drawing of a turkey buzzard-a sickly opposite of the blue hawk . In his loathsome talons is a chisel . . . . Nothing more apt has come to this administration . " <P> * Designer of the Blue Eagle was Charles T. Coiner , Philadelphia artist . Its originator is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Liberty Loan propagandist and now a chicken-raiser at Pawling , N.Y .
