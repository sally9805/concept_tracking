DOES the buzz of a bee recall an unfortunate encounter , or is it a reminder of sweet music in a blossomdecked meadow ? To a beekeeper , and there are some 800 , - in the United States alone , no music more welcome . Many laymen , however , have not had the pleasure of having their nds in a hive of bees , and to them every buzz is a signal of danger . Since early Bible times the honeybee has been a symbol of industry , and honey a simile of plenty . The study of honeybees and their remarkable life history has inspired philosophers , whose writings are replete with references to them. * But modern research now enables us to pen a new chapter about them . In the United States today these bees yield about 100,000 tons of marketable honey annually ; but in helping maintain our agriculture they are of even more importance . They may be likened to the enzymes in our food , small and mysterious , but highly essential to our well-being . EARLY EXPLORERS BROUGHT BEES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North America when the Spanish explorers arrived . Settlers coming in later expeditions brought them , and at first the Indians called them the " white man 's fly . " Since then they have followed man in his migration and settlement of every part of the United States and Canada . Until recently these insects ' chief usefulness to man was their production of honey and beeswax ? no mean service , since for centuries honey was virtually the only available sweet . But now , as pollinating agents , they perform a far more important duty . In the pioneer stages of American agriculture , bumblebees and other native pollinating insects that fed upon nectar and pollen were plentiful everywhere . But the planting of vast areas which once were forests , prairies , and swamps with fields of grain , orchards , and gardens upset the delicate balance of Nature . Wide-spread cultivation of single plants in huge acreages brought about an abnormal condition of insect population . Injurious species , afforded an enormous food supply , prospered and multiplied until now serious insect pests menace almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm crops , particularly fruits . Unfortunately , these materials kill not only harmful but beneficial insects . The toll includes honeybees and other wild bees , as well as the efficient bumblebees ? all the insects that carry pollen from one blossom to another .  | Even yet we scarcely realize the dependence of many plants upon insects to effect pollination . The cutting of wood lots and the clean cultivation of our fields have added to the difficulty of survival of our useful insects , with the result that more and more dependence has to be placed upon the honeybee , the only pollinating insect that can be propagated and controlled . SEX LIFE OF THE PLANTS Some plants bear only male flowers , which produce pollen but no fruit , and female flowers in the same species occur on a separate plant . To set fruit , pollen from the male plant must be carried to the female flower . Some plants simultaneously bear both male and female flowers , but still require cross-pollination to set fruit . Then there is a third class in which both sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can set fruit with their own pollen . But in many plants pollen from another is necessary to set a full crop of fruit or seed . The blossom of the apple , for example . contains both sexes , but in most varieties the pollen produced is not suitable for pollinizing its own blossoms . Its flowers must be fertilized by pollen from an entirely different variety . Thus , if blossoms of the Grimes Golden are cross-pollinated from the Jonathan , a good set of fruit should result , but the pollen of the Stayman produces little or no fruit when transferred  | to the Grimes Golden . When all pollen except its own is excluded , the Grimes Golden produces little or no fruit . " THE PRIESTS OF THE FLOWERS " " The priests of the flowers " honeybees have been called , since they perform the marriage ceremony of the plants . Although the honeybee is by no means domesticated , it is easily controlled . Consequently , millions already are being moved from one section of the country to another and placed in orchards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale a pollination package , a wire cage filled with bees . The grower distributes the requisite number throughout his orchards , opens the cages , and leaves the rest to the bees . Hundreds of full colonies are rented to orchardists during the peak of the blooming period . The bee has also largely replaced the camel's-hair brush in pollinating cucumbers under glass . Were it not for the work of the honeybee , most of our apple , pear , plum , and cherry orchards would bear poor crops , the growing of certain forage crops would be unprofitable , and the variety and quantity of our vegetables would be materially reduced . BEE CITIZENS OF MANY LANDS Honey and beeswax are produced over a wider geographical range than any other agricultural crop . There is scarcely a country in which honeybees are not kept . They inhabit the Tropic and Temperate Zones ,  | they are found in the deserts , on the mountains , in the plains , and in swamps , and as far north as Alaska . Scattered over the world are several distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Color Plate VII ) , and Cyprian . All races , everywhere , react in almost the same manner . A skillful beekeeper can succeed in Australia as well as in Ohio , provided he keeps an eye to the weather and studies the local flora . If honeybees are properly handled , there is no more danger in caring for them than in raising chickens . However , the belief that bees learn to know their master and will not sting him is without foundation . During the active season the average life of a bee is six weeks . The first two weeks are lived almost exclusively within the hive ( Plates II and VI ) , but thereafter the bees pass most of the daylight hours in the fields when the weather is good , in search of pollen and nectar . Since the beekeeper rarely opens the hive more than once a week , there is little opportunity for the bees to become acquainted with their owner . Some persons are so constituted that one sting may prove highly dangerous to them and require immediate medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be dangerous to most persons , a bee sting on the eyelid , the lip , or the face does not enhance a person 's beauty . THE WEDDING FLIGHT OF A QUEEN During the active season , a normal colony contains one queen , a fully developed female ; thousands of unreproductive worker bees , which are females only partly developed ; and several hundred drones , or male bees ( Plate II ) . The queen is endowed with great powers of reproduction , since she can even produce male progeny without mating , but she can not produce female bees , workers or queens , without going through the marriage ceremony . Thus , the maligned drone is indispensable to the completion of the immortal cycle of the honeybee . Upon the wedding flight of the queen depends the subsequent development of the colony . On a bright spring day the virgin queen emerges from the hive and soars away to seek a mate from among the hundreds of drones cruising about in the warm sunshine . Blissfully , perhaps , the drone is seeking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuation of his race . A moment after mating , the drone dies and the newly mated queen at once becomes a widow . But this one mating enables the queen for the rest of her life , three or four years , to perform her maternal duties . A few days after returning to the hive , she begins egg laying , slowly at first ; but at the height of her career she may lay as many as 1,500 eggs a day and maintain this rate for days at a time ( Plate III ) . She lays two kinds of eggs . One kind is unfertilized and hatches into a drone , or male bee . Mating has no influence upon this part of her family . Her sons are not the sons of her mate or husband , and are consequently fatherless , but they can claim a grandfather . The other type of egg is fertilized by the queen with a male cell , of which she retains an almost unlimited number in a special organ of her body . The fertilized egg hatches into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or neuter bees , and queens come from the same kind of egg . Yet the two show marked differences . The queen has the function of reproduction ; the worker bee has not . The queen bee possesses teeth on her mandibles , or jaws ; the worker bee has smooth jaws . The worker bee has pollen baskets ( Plate V ) ; the queen lacks them . The worker bee has a straight , barbed , unretractable sting ; the queen has a curved , smooth sting . The worker bee loses its life after stinging , but the queen does not ( Plate IV ) . A worker bee takes 21 days to develop from the egg to the adult , while a queen , who is much larger , requires only 15 or 16 days . The colony itself has the power of determining whether a fertilized egg shall develop into a queen or a worker bee . During its normal existence , only one queen is necessary to maintain the population of a colony . Unlike the worker bee , who lives but six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more years , but eventually she also becomes old and decrepit . Then a new queen must be raised to carry on the life of the colony . HER MAJESTY IS FED " ROYAL JELLY " The raising of a new queen is entrusted to the worker bees . An egg or a newly hatched larva less than three days old is selected . The cell in which the larva is deposited is broken down and enlarged and the heiress apparent is given special care and attention from this time on . For the  | first three days worker and drone larvae are fed royal jelly , a milky white secretion from the glands in the heads of worker bees ( Plate III ) . After the third day a coarser food , such as nectar and pollen , is given them . The queen larva , however , are fed royal jelly exclusively throughout the larval stage , which lasts five and a half days . The difference in diet during the two and a half days , therefore , determines whether the larva will develop into a bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or one that has the function of reproduction but lacks all maternal instincts , for the queen becomes virtually an egg-laying machine . There is no evidence that she has anything to do with the regula tion of the colony . She gives no attention whatsoever to the raising of her young . She does not help feed them , nor does she gather stores , or take part in the defense of her family . These duties fall exclusively to the lot of worker bees . From the endless flight of bees at the entrance of the hive , it would appear that most of the energy of the colony is consumed in the rather hazardous task of gathering nectar , pollen , and water ( Plate IV ) . However , the work done by the corps of young bees approximates that of the field bees , since every conceivable task within the hive must be performed by the bees not yet old enough to fly . The hum of industry within the hive continues throughout the 24 hours . Before the queen lays , each cell which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it shines . Since she lays 1,500 eggs a day , and it requires three days for the egg to hatch , there may be as many as 4,500 eggs in the hive to be cared for at one time . The number varies with the season . Upon hatching , the young bee is a foot less and blind larva and as such goes through an intensive feeding period of six days ( Plate II ) . Thus the nurse bees are taking care of six different sets of 1arvee , each age group requiring special care and food . Within six days a larva will increase in weight as much as 1,500 times and there fore it requires constant feeding . After the sixth day the larva is given no more food ;  | a porous cap is placed over the cell and it spins its cocoon . In this stage it remains for 12 days , developing from a wormlike grub into a fully matured worker bee . Thus the period from egg laying to maturity is 21 days , and there will be 12 sealed-in age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The nursery duties occupy only a portion of the available work ers . Others build new comb from the wax which they themselves secrete . Hundreds of new cells are necessary to store incoming nectar . The bee that brings the nectar from the field does not de-posit it in the cell , but gives it to a nurse bee , who , in turn , places it in that part of the hive where the process of conversion into honey will begin . THE HIVES ARE AIR-CONDITIONED Newly gathered nectar generally contains so much water that , if it were immediately stored , it would soon ferment . The bees , therefore , remove the excess moisture , largely through a well-organized and effi cient system of fanning ( Plate I ) . In the midst of a good harvest a hive may lose one-fourth as much during the night as it gained the previous day . The temperature is regulated much more closely than in most modern homes . The bees are able , even with a range of 50 de grees outside , to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of normal . The warm weather of midsum mer finds each colony well equipped with a cooling system composed of a corps of fan ners , because the temperature for brood rearing must be maintained uniformly throughout the active season . Transforming nectar into rich , mellow honey requires more than the evaporation of excess moisture . The bees add certain enzymes which convert the complex sugars of the raw nectar into simple sugars , known to the chemist as dextrose and levulose . When honey is eaten , these sugars are therefore absorbed without any preliminary digestion , that having taken place in the body of the bee . The skillful bee chemists not only preserve for us the sweetness of the flowers , but the perfume , the mineral salts , and certain  | nitrogenous products which the plants liberate in the nectar . All these ingredients are processed in the laboratory of the hive so that we have many varieties and colors of honey ( Plate VIII ) , each peculiar to its flower , each with its distinctive bouquet , color , and characteristic flavor . EVERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in maintaining the colony , which , being a selfsustaining community , imposes upon each individual certain health , sanitation , and protective duties . A temperature of about 93 degrees Fahrenheit must be maintained in that part of the hive where the queen lays and where all the young bees are reared . This is a concentrated area near the center of the hive , spherical in shape , its size depending upon the population of the hive and the season of the year . After a cell has served as a cradle for the birth of a young bee , it is thoroughly cleaned . Abnormal larvae are not permitted to mature as deformed adults , but are removed from the hive . Sick and ailing bees are also encouraged to leave and to die outside . Any bees that die while at work are immediately carried out and consigned to the winds . When they are from a week to ten days old , the bees venture into the outside world for the first time , usually on short flights of only a few feet in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to use their wings and no doubt also note the location of their homes . Toward the close of their duties within the hive young bees appear more often at the entrances until they eventually take over the duty of defending the colony ( Plate I ) . Several dozen may assume this responsibility . A SHORT AND BUSY LIFE On their first trip to the field , young bees gather water or propolis . The latter is a resinous , gumlike material called bee glue . garnered largely from the buds of various plants and trees . It is used to close the cracks in the hives , to smooth over rough places , to cement the combs securely in place , to regulate the size of the entrances the better to guard the hive , and to control the temperature .  | The next duty is that of gathering pollen and , finally , nectar . In an emergency the field bees can resume nursery duties again , but when a bee becomes old enough to work in the field it usually dies in its boots , literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with fluffy golden hair . After four weeks in the field it is darker , much of the hair has been worn from its body , and its wings are tattered and torn ( Plate VII ) . Eventually it will no longer be able to sustain itself in flight . Thus its life span is measured largely by the amount of work done . The bees reared late in the fall , when there is little or no work to be done in the fields , live all winter . Whenever plants are in blossom and it is warm enough for the bees to fly , they go forth at daybreak and continue until nightfall , or until it becomes too cold or rainy to work . Drop by drop the nectar comes into the hive . The storage of more food than the colony can consume for its own needs seems an incredible task , yet in a favorable locality strong colonies have brought in as many as 25 pounds of nectar in a day . A steady stream at the entrance continues day after day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bees have flown eight and a half miles away from the hive in search of food , although usually they forage within a mile or two of the hive , going no farther than necessary . A SINGLE-TRACK INSTINCT In gathering nectar and pollen , the bees do not fly aimlessly , as butterflies do , from one species of flower to another . If a bee starts working on dandelions , for example , it will continue throughout the trip to visit only dandelion blossoms , and in all likelihood it will continue working on dandelions as long as it can obtain a modicum of nectar or pollen . Another bee from the same colony may concentrate on apple blossoms , in which case it carefully avoids the blossoms of pear trees or other varieties . It may even have to fly over acres of dandelionstudded meadows before reaching another apple tree , but its instinct keeps it to a single track . Such constancy makes the bee a dependable pollinizing agent . If it collected indiscriminately from the flowers , its work would be less effective ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple would not benefit the blossom of the pear , and vice versa . Changes in atmospheric conditions , or in the plants themselves , may cause a wholesale change in the work schedule . Some plants secrete nectar only a few hours a day , while other plants may continue throughout the day ; and , since bees wisely seek the richest source of nectar , they may suddenly desert one plant for another that proves more tempting . The richness of this sparkling drop of nectar , which the blossom offers to the bee in exchange for the pollen from another blossom , causes the bee to accept the highest bidder . Although bees invariably effect pollination in the blossoms from which they obtain either nectar or pollen , the latter is so indispensable to the welfare of the colony that the bees are compelled to visit countless numbers of flowers which secrete little or no nectar but which do furnish them with pollen . Thus the bees pollinize numerous varieties of plants . WHY A BLOSSOM " WEARS " PERFUME The worker bee is particularly adapted to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hair ( Plate V ) . Many of the hairs are long , lacy , and branched ; spikelike hairs even grow between the facets of its compound eyes ( page 426 ) . When a bee alights on a flower that has abundant pollen , the pollen grains become entangled in its numerous hairs , and in gathering a load to carry back to the hive , the bee brushes over the stigma of the blossom , inadvertently transferring to its sticky surface grains of pollen . For this act the blossom lives and offers its alluring perfume and enticing nectar . Shortly after pollination is effected , the blossom wilts . After thoroughly covering itself with pollen , the bee hovers above the flower for several seconds , combing the pollen from itself and packing it securely in the two pollen baskets on its hind legs ( Plate V ) . Thus it can carry two pellets , each almost as large as its head . " BEE BREAD " IN THE HIVES PANTRY Upon reaching the hive , the bee inserts its hind legs into a cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young bee , with its head , rams the pollen into a compact cake into the bottom of the cell . Pollen is not mixed with honey . It is stored in sep- arate cells close to the brood nest , where it is readily available to the nurse bees ( see text , page 406 ) . The pollen furnishes the fat and protein in the diet of the honeybee , while the nectar supplies the carbohydrate . The adult bee can sustain itself on a pure carbohydrate diet , but the developing bees must have the other two ingredients . Pollen stored in the hive is often referred to as " bee bread . " Early in the spring , when the alders and willows are putting forth their fuzzy catkins , the bees go forth to search for food so that the queen may start egg laying . From then on , progress depending upon the weather and the amount of food avail able , brood rearing continues at a constantly accelerated pace . Within a few weeks the hive be comes so populous that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more space in which to store honey . With food available from myriads of flowers , but with no place to store it , the bees prepare to relieve the congestion . The time has come when some must go . This corresponds to the time when fledglings are pushed over the rim of the nest and made to seek their own way in the world . But with the honey bee the young are left to carry on in the es tablished home , and it is the old queen and the flying , or older , members of her family who search for other quarters and begin the labor of constructing a new home . The first indication that swarming may be imminent appears when thousands of bees cluster at the entrances , literally loaf ing . The hive boils over with bees . Inspec tion within reveals the presence of several pendulous peanut-shaped queen cells ( Plate III ) , an almost infallible indication that the hegira is about to take place . Each queen cell holds a prospective heiress , pos sible successor to the old queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters do not wait until the heiress actually arrives , however , but on the first bright warm day after the queen cells are sealed a mighty commotion heralds the issuance of the swarm . This usually takes place from 10 to  | 12 o'clock in the morning . Most of the bees that have attained fly ing age ( and this includes virtually all the field bees ) rush out of the hive , tumbling over one another in their eagerness to taste the thrills of the grea adventure . Back and forth in front of the hive , in sharp straight flights , they take wing until thousands are in the air , the queen with them . Likely as not , this flying entangle ment will shortly move toward some tree or fence post . A few bees settle , and then a few more , until within 10 to 15 minutes all have alighted in a tightly packed mass . Shortly after the swarm settles , scout bees fly in all directions to search for a new abode , or , being fore minded , they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place already has been located , the bees may take to the air again within a few minutes . Assuming a formation that looks like a hazy smoke ball 10 to 20 feet in diameter , the swarm gradually works its way through the tree tops and , clearing all obstructions , seems to float like an enormous soap bubble , making a " bee line " toward its new home . If the scouts fail to find a hollow tree or a cozy nook in someone 's attic , the bees will continue to hang at their first stopping place for several hours , or even for several days . Should the scouts fail entirely in finding habitable quarters , the bees may decide to " camp out " and build their comb in the open air . All the young bees , the brood , the honey , and the combs , including interest and good will , are left in the parent hive . Within a few days , a new queen issues from the oldest of the queen cells . Apparently aware that she is born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear the hive of any possible rivals . She makes a thorough search for queen cells and mutilates each by tearing a hole in its side . She may even render the occupant hors de combat by giv ing her a fatal thrust with her sting . THE VIRGIN QUEEN PLANS HER WEDDING A few days after emergence the young virgin queen selects a day for her wedding flight ( see text , page 405 ) . She usually chooses a clear , warm , quiet day because  | her honeymoon is short , and she must make the most of it . Only when she leaves the hive with a swarm , probably a year hence , will she have another occasion to fly . Mating always takes place on the wing , and if conditions are such that the queen can not fly she will die a virgin . The strongest drone is her mate , for the queen is a good flyer , and the weak are thus eliminated in this wise provision to maintain the strength and vigor of the race . Before the queen has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the drone will have fallen to the earth dead . There is an old saying that the drone no sooner becomes a husband than he is a corpse , and the queen no sooner a bride than a widow . Because of her specialized duties and the fact that she does not engage in outside work and is not subject to the hazards of weather and enemies that might prey upon her , the queen may live to the ripe old age of three or four years . When she becomes too old , or when she can no longer produce queen and worker bees , or if she becomes accidentally crippled , the bees will raise another queen to replace her and for a while both mother and daughter may work side by side in the hive . But this arrangement does not last long . The old queen will shortly disappear . The marked differences between the queen and worker bee , both of whom come from the same kind of fertilized egg , have already been mentioned ( see text , page 405 ) . Their difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is armed with a straight sting , the end of which is barbed like a harpoon ( Plate IV and page 427 ) . When a worker bee stings , it can not disengage its sting . The violent effort of tearing itself loose from the well-anchored sting so severely damages the tissue of its body that it dies within a few minutes . Normally it can sting only once , and in doing so it defends not itself but the colony . A QUEEN FIGHTS ONLY A QUEEN The sting of the queen , instead of being straight and barbed , is smooth and curved . It is constructed so that it can easily be withdrawn when she uses it . The queen seemingly does not realize that she possesses this very effective weapon . She may be picked up and handled as harmlessly as a kitten . Her instinct to battle is aroused only in the presence of a rival queen . If the queen gets into the wrong hive in returning from her mating flight , a royal battle is sure to ensue , and the two queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The worker bees make no attempt to protect their own mother . Here again is the survival of the fittest . Close observers say that when two queens in a rough-andtumble battle get into such a position that both are apt to receive a fatal thrust , the bees separate the two and then let them come together again until one or the other has the advantage . If the mother queen is slain , the intruder , having proved her superiority , is allowed to take the place of the former queen . If the queen used her sting indiscriminately , she might easily lose her life in meeting an enemy with which she could not cope . If she were being handled by her keeper and attempted to free herself by stinging him , he might instinctively retaliate by crushing her frail body . Should he do so , it would jeopardize the future life of the colony , especially if there were no larvae in the hive from which a successor could be raised . For her protection . therefore , she depends upon her own daughters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so fatal to the well-being of the colony . THE DRONE IS A DINER-OUT The drone usually is regarded as a lazy individual , but , after all , he is the father and is entitled to certain respect . He gathers no food , nor does he help defend the family ; he has no tools to collect sweets nor has he a sting to defend even himself . During his brief existence , however , he has certain privileges not accorded his sisters . He can safely visit neighboring colonies . Neither workers nor queens are accepted in other hives , but during the breeding season drones are allowed to come and go as they please . When the breeding season is over , and the honeyflow comes to a close , the bees become more economical with their food supply , which must carry them through the long , cold winter . Then they drive all the drones from the hives , thus dooming them to perish soon for lack of food and shelter . The person who can recall the names and faces of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80,000 individuals the bee instantly recognizes every member . It is evident that recognition is not p 416 through the sense of sight ; instead , it is effected by the more highly developed sense of smell . Every colony has a distinctive family odor , different from that of every tither colony . If a strange bee attempts to enter a hive , the guards at the entrance detect its alien odor and drive it away ( Plate I ) . When a colony is divided into two parts , the parts placed in separate hives and given queens that are sisters , the bees in each half develop different odors . Within a week 's time they become total strangers to each other . Were the halves united again , the bees would disregard the existence of any relationship . It sometimes happens that a beekeeper unites two or more colonies , which separately are too weak to produce a crop or to survive a hard winter . The usual method is to place one hive on top of the other , inserting a sheet of newspaper between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and , in doing so , they " rub noses , " but the holes at first are not large enough for the bees on either side to engage in combat . The apertures permit the mingling of the odors of the two units , so that by the time the holes . are large enough for the bees to pass through , the two parts have an identical odor . Thus union takes place peacefully . " CORONATION " OF A NEW QUEEN If it becomes necessary to place a new queen in a colony , it is essential that she be properly " introduced . " The old queen is removed at least an hour before the newcomer is " presented . " In this interval the colony discovers that it is queenless and it may start constructing new queen cells . Even though the colony desires a queen , it would not do to release the usurper , because her strange odor would antagonize the bees and endanger her life . She is placed in a wire cage to protect her from assaults . Although her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed her by inserting their tongues through the meshes of the wire . After the queen remains in this cage for two or three days , she will have lost much of the odor of her former hive and acquired that of her new abode . Even then her actual release must be accomplished quietly and without excitement . Her cage is provided with a plug of soft candy . Two or three days are required for the bees to tunnel through . Meantime the odors have mingled , and the queen can walk out on the combs of her new home without undue risk . Honeybees help perpetuate their race by their insatiable desire to gather nectar . Unlike bumblebees , hornets , yellow jackets , and wasps , honeybees can not live from hand to mouth . They must store enough food during the summer to keep the colony alive throughout the winter . Of the four other insects just mentioned , all the individuals in each colony die at the approach of winter except the young mated queens , and these simply crawl into protected places where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among honeybees , only the drones die in the fall . The queen and the workers live and are semi-active throughout the winter ( see text , page 411 ) . It is important , therefore , to gather enough food during the summer to maintain the colony during seasons when insect activity largely ceases . At the end of the swarming season , which coincides with the height of the breeding season , the queen lays fewer and fewer eggs until fall , when the rearing of the brood entirely ceases . Cold weather has overtaken the colony by this time , imposing changes in its organization to cope with low temperatures . Individual honeybees die of chill at temperatures well above freezing ; in fact , they seldom fly when the temperature is lower than 45 degrees Fahrenheit . Hence the colony must maintain a life-sustaining temperature when the thermometer dips to zero or lower . REGULATING WINTER TEMPERATURE During the active season the bees spread over the entire interior of the hive ; when winter comes , they gather in a spherical , compact cluster with the queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sort of insulating shell to prevent escape of heat . Those on the inside are in looser formation . Those in the center carry on muscular activity , which generates sufficient heat to keep the bees from chilling . The bees do not permit the periphery of the cluster to fall below 57 degrees Fahrenheit ; thus the colder the outside temperature becomes , the more muscular activity they must perform to maintain warmth . The bees composing the insulating shell change places at frequent intervals with those of the interior .  | The average colony consumes from 30 to 50 pounds of honey during the winter and early spring , the quantity depending upon its strength , prevailing temperatures , and the condition of the hive . A thoughtful beekeeper packs his colonies in sawdust or other insulating material ( see page 413 ) , or places the bees in a properly constructed cellar during winter . Thus he decreases the consumption of honey and prevents the bees from aging too rapidly , insuring them sufficient vitality in the spring to renew brood-rearing activities . The U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies in the United States . This number will require about 165 million pounds of honey for its own consumption during winter ; and , to carry on brood rearing and honey production during the active season , will need double this amount . Thus honeybees in this country gather some 500 million pounds of honey to maintain themselves during the year , without a drop being available to place on our tables . The marketable crop of honey in the United States varies widely from year to year , but a fair average is about 200 million pounds , making a grand total of approximately 700 million pounds credited to the labor of this insect . It has been estimated that if a single worker bee could gather enough nectar to make one pound of honey , she would have to work every day in the year for more than eight years . and in doing so she would travel approximately three times around the earth . BEEKEEPING BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY These astounding figures indicate the tremendous benefit honeybees render to our agriculture . To gather so much honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected . Therefore it can be understood why honeybees are of infinitely greater value to the community in which they are kept , in producing crops of  | seed and fruit , than they are to their owner , who is paid in honey and beeswax . The supposition that the keeper of bees has nothing to do but watch the honey and money roll in is fallacious . Keeping bees is a specialized job , and one must have an inherent love for them . A thorough knowledge of bee behavior , gained only through experience , is a primary requisite . Attention must be given to a vast number of details . There are plenty of griefs in connection with the business : the loss of bees during the winter is heavy ; diseases of bees take a large annual toll ; and wax moths , which destroy the combs , cause further losses . The operation of an apiary requires close personal supervision . Thus the production of honey is largely a oneman affair . In favorable localities , however , honey production is as remunerative as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nectar , only about two dozen species furnish honey in market quantity . The layman thinks of a spacious garden as a rich haven for honeybees , but often such is not the case . All the flower gardens in the beautiful city of Washington probably would maintain not more than two dozen colonies of bees . Honey production on a commercial scale must be carried on where there are many acres of a plant from which the bees can obtain more nectar than is needed for their immediate requirements . In most sections of the United States there is usually one particular flower from which the bees produce a surplus crop . In carrying on brood rearing , and in obtaining enough honey for their own needs , they visit flowers of endless variety . Bees freely visit apple blossoms , for example , yet apple-blossom honey is practically unknown . There are too few apple blossoms , and the blossom period is in early spring when honey requirements of the colony are so great during brood rearing that the bees consume the nectar as rapidly as it is gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the most concentrated honeyproducing section in the United States is that surrounding the Great Lakes , where the white Dutch clover , the common variety that grows so abundantly on our lawns , reaches the peak of perfection . There the bees also produce a surplus from alsike clover , sweet clover , basswood , buckwheat , and occasional crops from raspberry and milkweed . Another rich area is on the Pacific coast , where the heavily scented orange groves furnish thousands of pounds of highly flavored honey . The foothills of California supply sparkling sage honey and a bountiful quota of alfalfa honey comes annually from the Imperial Valley . The whitest honey of all , often waterwhite , is produced from the fireweed , which grows in the burnt-over forests of Washington and Oregon . The Intermountain States send to our eastern and foreign markets carloads of alfalfa and sweet-clover honey , heavy and flavorous . The Dakotas and the surrounding States rank high in large crops . There 100 pounds a colony from sweet clover ( Plate VIII ) and alfalfa is not unusual , and crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favorable seasons . Many kinds of honey plants occur in the Southern States , where the honeys run the gauntlet of the color scale . Usually the honeys from the South are dark , spicy , and highly flavored . Probably no other food is produced over a wider area than honey . Wheat , corn , milk , and potatoes are almost universal , yet their production is restricted to areas having certain soil and climatic conditions , whereas the mountains , the swamps , the deserts , the wind-swept plains , and the Tropics all add their quotas of honey . Surely no other food has such romantic associations . Every drop of honey has its origin in the bosom of a delicate flower , where it has been exposed to the rays of the summer sun and bathed with the morning dew . You have only to close your eyes and picture fields of clover , and fill your lungs with the perfumed air from myriad nodding blossoms ; or in memory to walk again through scented orange grooves to realize the origin of this incomparable food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
