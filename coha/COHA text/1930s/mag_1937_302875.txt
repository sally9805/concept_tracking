The first real dentists in this country were two Frenchmen who arrived during the Revolutionary War with Rochambeau 's fleet . Before that , and long afterwards , barbers , blacksmiths and jewelers pulled the teeth and made the plates of the colonists . Those " tooth-drawers " traveled from house to house , farm to farm , town to town . In their packs they carried an assortment of human , calf and hippopotamus teeth . <P> Last week the arrest of four men in Albany , N. Y. revealed that this sort of itinerant dentistry is still going on , despite the fact that 59,000 U. S. graduate dentists have offices which practically any patient can reach . If the patient is too ill to travel or , like President Roosevelt , very important , the dentists may go to him. * But this is considered extraordinary dental practice . Nonetheless , there are no laws to prevent licensed dentists who can not gather the $3,000 necessary to equip a regular office , from putting their equipment in satchels , packs or motor trailers , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the cases of the Albany itinerants , none had licenses to practice anywhere . None had dental training . Nevertheless they found patients who were willing to be fitted for plates and dentures in their parlors and kitchens . Two of the four practitioners were second offenders . All were subject to fines , to prison terms . <P> <P> * In the White House is a completely equipped dentist 's office , installed by order of President Hoover . All the Roosevelt family have their teeth cared for there by Dr. Ralph Whatley Malone of the Xaval Dental School .
