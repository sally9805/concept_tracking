Clad in scarlet , white and gold vestments , his tall mitre on his head and his tall golden crosier in hand , Archbishop Joseph Francis Rummel of New Orleans stood one day last week on the wharf of small Chauvin in the parish of Terrebonne . Behind him stood 1,000 bayou Catholics with 500 of their children all in white , ready for their First Communion and Confirmation . On the waters before the Archbishop bobbed the shrimp fishing fleet of Bayou Little Caillou . Raising his staff with a gloved hand , Archbishop Rummel intoned Latin , French , English . <P> Few days later the shrimp fleet sailed forth on its annual run into the Gulf of Mexico , its pious shrimpers proud that for the first time in its history the blessings of the Church had been bestowed upon it by a high prelate in full panoply instead of a plain parish priest .
