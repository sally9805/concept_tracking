txt // Cuneiform 1 writing . ? While the Egyptians were developing one alphabet , another had taken form in Mesopotamia , the fertile land between the Tigris and the Euphrates . The name Mesopotamia means " between rivers . " Here , one after another , the great Assyrian , Babylonian , and Persian empires held sway . They have left behind them inscriptions on stone and on clay tablets in strange characters that have been named cuneiform , which is Latin for " wedge-shaped . " These , too , for a long time could not be deciphered . Again the puzzle was solved by a lucky " find . " About sixty years ago , Sir Henry Rawlinson , then a young English lieutenant with an interest in Oriental lore , was sent to Persia to drill soldiers . On the face of a huge rock he spied an inscription in three languages , which proved to be Persian , Mede or Scythian , and Babylonian . At great risk to life and limb he climbed the rock and through several years copied and deciphered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylonian language and to the cuneiform writing . Relics in cuneiform date as far back as 4500 B.C. Some , it is asserted , can be placed as early as 6000 or 7000 B.C. If this is true , they are older than the most ancient Egyptian writings . // These wedge-shaped characters were cut in rock with : i chisel , or were impressed upon soft clay with a reed . The clay bricks were then baked or sun-dried , and the result was a letter or a document on a neat brick . Abundant cuneiform relics have enabled us to decipher most of the early history of Persia , Babylonia , : Ind Assyria . The Phcenician and Hebrew alphabets . ? It remained for the genius of the Phoenicians to take the I i i al step and bring the world a real alphabet . This enterprising Semitic race once lived in Syria . Tyre and Sidon were their principal cities . The Ihcenicians were great traders and had almost a monopoly of the commerce of the Mediterranean basin from about 1600 to 900 B.C. They even sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very shrewd and intelligent . It is not known for certain whether the Phoenicians took their alphabet from the Egyptians or not . A certain similarity in the form of several characters makes it highly probable that they did . The important fact is that the Phoenicians reduced the symbols to 1 wenty-two , each one representing a single sound . The Ihoenician is therefore the parent of nearly all the alphabets of any importance today . The Hebrews , a closely related Semitic race , borrowed t heir alphabet from the Phoenicians . The Greeks , too and here is where we are getting close to home ? also : iclapted the Phcenician characters not later than 700 B.c. , adding several signs not contained in the 1'lioenician . The legend is that a Phcenician prince named Cadmus , crossing to Greece in search of his abducted // sister Europa , founded the city of Thebes . With Cadmus came his native alphabet , which he introduced to the Greeks . At any rate , the Romans took their alphabet from the Greeks , and it is the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we use today in our own language . Let us see how the Greek and Roman forms of a few letters developed from the Phoenician : ' lurn the " ox " this way : - v-  , ana you nave a ruae picture of an ox-head . Turn this upside down and you have -A ( A ) . Turn the " house " this way : ' ) , and you have a nice hospitable , open-front house for summer . Do you see the camel 's head and neck outlined in 7 ? Now look again . Turn 7 around and it becomes f . Why turn it around ? Because the Semitic races wrote from right to left . The early Greeks imitated them , but later changed to the left-to-right style . In doing so , they faced several letters the other way , too . The Greek names of the letters are evidently taken from the Semitic . Aleph , Beth , and so on , have definite // meanings in Hebrew , but Alpha , Beta ( etc. ) mean nothing in Greek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see two significant things . First , the Hebrew names of the letters are the initial sounds of the words that they mean . You find the same principle in rhymes for chil-dren : A is for Alfred and Arthur and All , B is for Bertie and Bessie and Ball . Secondly , the word alphabet is simply Greek for your " A B C 's , " except that it stops with B. EXERCISES 1 . How did mankind get along for thousands of years without writing ? 2 .

THE GREEK AND ROMAN ALPHABETS AND OUR OWN The Greek and Roman alphabets . You have been introduced to some of the characters in the Greek al-phabet . It remains to be seen how the Romans adapted this . There were two main forms of the Greek alphabet , the Eastern and the Western . Settlers from Chalcis in Eubcea 1 founded a colony in Italy about 800 B.C. As the Chalcidians used the Western alphabet , it was from this colony that their letters later spread to Rome . The Romans at the time of Caesar and Cicero had only twenty-four letters . The character I had two sound values . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hook on it for the other . This produced J. The Roman alphabet had no W , but when this character was needed for another distinction in sound , it was very easily created . How ? The Roman capital U was always made in the form V. Look at some public buildings and you will see that this form is still preserved in stone carving , where it is easier to chisel than the rounded form . To V ( i.e. U ) add another V. What do you get ? W. A double-U , precisely . The Russian alphabet is also derived from the Greek . The English alphabet . ? As we have seen , our alpha-bet of capital letters is simply the Roman with slight changes . But what of our small letters and our script // or handwriting ? Let us trace briefly the development of these forms . All through the Middle Ages , the Christian monks in the monasteries copied and recopied the works of Roman authors , thus preserving them for posterity . Ilad it not been for the patient labors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been lost to us and school children of today would have been denied the Latin the works of " joy " of reading in Cesar , Cicero , and Vergil . In their copying , these monks developed some beautiful hand-work . From one style of the monkish letter-ing came our small letters . The form of letters known as italics was derived from the Italian handwriting of the fifteenth century . Our script is an outgrowth of these italics . One form of handwriting called the black letter is still used in Germany . This was the form in which the first printing was done , in the fifteenth century . Fortu-nately for us , the black letter was displaced by our present form in England during the sixteenth century . Look into a German book and you will see why we say fortunately . " The French , Spanish , and Italians use the Roman // type and the same script that we use . The clumsy black-letter type and the German script are slowly but gradually being displaced in Germany by Roman type and English script . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esting to note that the general form of the letters has often been determined by the material on which writing was done . Early man scratched on stone , clay , or wood with some hard substance , such as bone or ivory . Later , he learned the use of metal and chiseled on stone . Have n't you seen cartoons in which Ab , the primitive man , is delivering a ton of love letters to his sweetheart , Bee ? If Bee broke the engagement and returned his letters , she broke Ab 's head , as well as his heart . The verb write originally meant " to scratch , " and the noun book comes from the Anglo-Saxon boc , mean ing " beech ( tree ) . " From these two facts we get a clear indication that the primitive Anglo-Saxons wrote chiefly by scratching on beech bark . You have seen how the wedge-shaped letters of the Assyrians were determined by the fact that they were carved on stone or pressed into clay . ' The Roman capitals were mostly straight lines , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier forms of C , R , and S were ( ( , . , and But the Romans had other writing materials besides stone . From the Egyptians , the Greeks and the Romans had learned the use of papyrus , upon which they wrote with ink . Papyrus was a thick-stemmed reed which grew in abundance in the delta of the Nile . By cutting this up into strips , the Egyptians made of it a service-able , but perishable , writing material . // The Greeks and Romans also invented the wax t ablet , on which temporary notes and communications were scratched . A layer of wax on wood could be neatly scratched with a sharp stilus . The wax was then smoothed over with the blunt end of the stilus and could be used again . Have you ever thought what a task it was to pub lish a " book " in ancient Rome ? A roomful of slaves would copy by hand from dictation . These copies would then be corrected by a " proof reader . " From these copies others would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prodigious labor an edition of a thousand copies could be produced . Compare this with our publishers ' ad vertisements today for a " best r ( 'ller " : Second hundred thousand ! Our Roman book would then be done into scroll form , with a piece of papyrus peeping out with the title of the work . A Roman library would thus con14ist of a number of " cans , " each containing several scrolls . Gradually , papyrus was displaced as a writing ma terial by parchment , which was far more durable . ' I'I-e Roman author Pliny tells us an interesting talc of the origin of parchment . About 200 B.C. , King Ptolemy V. of Egypt , jealous of the growing importance of the library of Pergamum in Asia Minor , forbade the exportation of papyrus . The wily people of Pergamum sought a substitute and discovered that the tanned hides of animals made an excellent surface for writing . // The story is probably untrue , but it is certain that the word parchment , which designates this sort of writing material , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Pergamum . " It was on parchment that the monks copied the works of Roman authors . At the same time , they changed the form of books from the scroll to the leaf-page , as we now have it . We have today parchment manu scripts dating from the fourth to the fifteenth cen tury A.D. The art of making paper was brought from China . The Arabs learned it from the Chinese and first in-troduced it into Europe about 900 A.D. Paper can now be made from straw , rags , wood pulp , bark , and other materials . At last , about 1440 A.D. , a German named Gutenberg in-vented the printing press . He cut each letter of the alphabet on a separate block and used these pieces of type over and over again . An exact copy of Gutenberg 's press was dis played at Chicago 's Century of Progress Exhibition in 1933 . Little by little the printing process was improved and perfected . Gutenberg needed months , perhaps years , to turn out one copy of the Bible . Thousands can now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day and observe the amazingly speedy and ingenious process by which books are printed . // The importance of the discovery of printing can hardly be overestimated . It has given man 's knowledge : i chance to expand . Without printing , our great plan of universal education would be impossible . Learning is no longer confined to the few , but is open to all who can read and write . Printed books contain for us today i he whole span of man 's knowledge and imagination . Other alphabets . ? In the history of the world there have been about two hundred and fifty alphabets , of which some fifty still survive . About half of these are found in India . You have already heard of several ? the hieroglyphic , Ilie cuneiform , the Phoenician , the Hebrew , the Greek , I he Roman , the Russian , the black letter , and the English . The Arabic alphabet is another and the Sanskrit ; mother . The Turks formerly wrote in Arabic characters . Now they are compelled by law to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters of the c ' hinese , on a laundry check or in pictures ? This writ-ing is really just about as mysterious and puzzling as it looks . Chinese writing requires from four to five thousand different alphabetic signs . Consequently , a bright young Chinese student at the age of twenty-five has progressed about as far in learning to read and write as an American child of ten . We have heard recently that a movement for " spelling " reform in China proposes to reduce the number of signs to one Thousand ! It seems strange that China , which has produced great philosophers , has not devised a better phabetic system . An alphabet originating in early Scandinavia was composed of letters called runes . Two runic signs crept // into Anglo-Saxon . One of these , called the thorn letter , had the form p and represented the sound th . As this letter is similar to a y , it has been revived to represent old English . If you see a place that calls itself Ye Olde English Tavern , read the first word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thorn letter . Besides the Roman , there are still other alphabets in use today for special purposes . Such are : shorthand , . the Morse code for telegraphy , and the Braille alphabet . for the blind . These are just as truly alphabets as the Roman : that is , they are symbols that represent the sounds and words of the language . Phonetic languages and alphabets . ? A perfect al phabet would have only one symbol for each sound and only one sound for each symbol . If you will think merely of the different sounds for ough and of the differ ent spellings for the sound ee ( as in see ) , you will realize how far from perfect our English alphabet is . Think also of our many silent letters . Our fore-fathers pronounced the gh in such words as brought and daughter . We no longer pronounce the gh , but we continue the old spelling . Attempts at spelling reform are blocked by the enormous number of books in exist ence with the traditional I spelling . The spelling thru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language can be pronounced according to certain definite rules , it is called a phonetic language . Latin and ancient Greek were phonetic . Among modern tongues , 1 What does traditional mean ? // Spanish is a well-nigh perfect phonetic language , Italian is nearly so , and German is a close runner-up to Italian . French is as big a sinner as English in having many silent letters , many spellings for the same sound , and many sounds for the same spelling . The perfect alphabet is the international phonetic alphabet , which has one symbol for each sound and one sound for each symbol . Any language may be written in the phonetic alphabet . If you know the alphabet , you can read an entirely strange language and pro-nounce it correctly . This alphabet is therefore of great service to the foreigner studying French or English . Would it be of much use to the student of Spanish , I t alian , or German ? You should know the answer . Let us consider a single example of how a Frenchman studying English would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spellings of the sound ee are reduced to one symbol : i . Conclusion . ? Have you observed that the races Bich made significant contributions to the developc'lit of the alphabet likewise dominated the history f civilization in ancient times ? At one period , the : f 1 ) tians were the most powerful people in the civiz.ed world . At another , the Assyrians and Babynians dominated the center of civilization . In // succession came the great power of the Phoenicians and the glory of the Hebrew race , to be overshadowed in turn by the Greeks and the Romans . It is precisely the alphabets of these peoples that are the high lights in the history of the alphabet . Our Western civilization stands upon the foundation reared by the Greeks and the Romans . And it is the Roman alphabet , borrowed from the Greek , that the . greatest nations of Europe and America use today . EXERCISES 1 . Where did the Romans get their alphabet ? 2 .

CHAPTER FOUR THE RICH ANCESTRY OF ENGLISH The early Celts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-Saxon conquest and the beginnings of English . ? The Danish invasion . ? The Norman conquest . ? Words taken into the language from the Danish and Norman-French . ? Periods of the English language . ? Loss of inflections . I. HOW THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE WAS BORN The early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain . ? When Julius Caesar invaded Britain ' in 55 and 54 B.C. , he found there a long-haired and long-mustached race of warriors , who fought from two-wheeled chariots and stubbornly resisted the Roman legions . These were the Britons ( in Latin Britanni ) , who belonged to the great Celtic race that had at one time occupied wide-spread areas in Europe . You will remember that the Gauls , also conquered by Casar , were likewise Celts . Do you recall what happened to the language of the Gauls ? A somewhat similar fate befell the language of their Celtic cousins in Britain , as we shall see . The Celts were a sensitive , imaginative people , and it is to the Celtic element that we owe much of the imaginative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means ? The Welsh , Irish , and Scotch of today are still largely of Celtic blood , as well as the Cornish , the Manx , and the people of Brittany . 96 // Uprisings in Gaul recalled Caesar from the island . It was not until a century later that the Roman legions of the Emperor Claudius returned to conquer the island and make it into a Roman province . The great Roman mill ground again , the island was Romanized , and Latin became the official language . Notice that the " English language " has not yet ac tually entered the scene . But the English of today still hears traces of these early periods of the history of the " right little , tight little isle , " as the English love to sing . From the ancient Britons we still have the words bald , crag , crock , down , glen , and ton ( or tun ) , together with others less common , including druid and bard . Do you know what a bard is ? The Roman occupation of Britain lasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the crumbling of the great Roman empire . The Latin of that period has left its impress on the language largely iii the names of places ; for example : Latin castra camp ) appears in Chester , Winchester , Lancaster , Leicester . Colonia ( colony ) appears in Lincoln ; portus harbor ) in Portsmouth ; vices ( village ) in Warwick and Greenwich ; vallum ( rampart ) in Walton ; strata ( via ) ( paved road ) in Stratford , Stradbroke , and others . The word street itself comes from strata . The words lake , will , chalk , and mile also probably date from this period . Before the Roman influence again enters Britain , ( , vents of historic importance take place in the " tight little isle , " and Britain becomes England . // With the might of Rome withdrawn , Britain became the prey of marauding Germanic tribes from the con-tinent . Do you remember the table of the Indo-European family ? 1 These blond Germanic warriors were tall , powerful , brave , and fierce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . On a mountain top near Detmold , in North Germany , stands an heroic statue of Hermann the Liberator , one hundred and fifty feet high , with sword upraised , visible for miles around . Hermann had routed the Roman le-gions and freed Germany from the threat of Roman domination . The story goes that the Britons , in 449 , had first in-vited the Jutes , 2 a North Germanic tribe , to aid them in defending themselves from the Picts , a savage people of what is now Scotland . With the way open , two other tribes from North Germany , the Angles and the Saxons descended upon the Britons and virtually drove them from their homeland . These Germans were like the camel in the fable . The Britons had let the camel ge his head in the tent . Do you know the rest ? It was in the speech of these Anglo-Saxon invader that the English language had its beginnings . The beginnings of English . ? The Angles and Saxon spoke Low German dialects . ' In an incredibly shor time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had driven the unhappy Britons into virtual exile Do you remember what became of the Britons ? The names of the various kingdoms founded by the // invaders still survive as the names of English counties . Wessex was settled by the West . Saxons , Sussex by the South Saxons . Can you not.giiess , then , what Essex and Middlesex mean ? The , Angles . settled in Norfolk and Suffolk ( the Northfolk and the South-folk ) . Find these six kingoms on the map of England . The Angles and Saxons could read and write . They used the runic 1 alphabet until their conversion to Christianity in the seventh century , when they adopted the Roman letters . At this period the influence of Latin , the language of the Roman Catholic church , entered for a second time into the English language . From the church and from commerce with Rome , the seat of the church , came such words as : bishop , church , monk , priest , butter , cheese , wine , cook , sock , pepper , plum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap , cup , pine , plant , pillow.2 Whenever you are given lists of words such as the // foregoing , you are not expected to memorize them . Just look them over and realize how many familiar words that are row wholly " English " have come to us from numerous foreign , sou rces . The Danish invaeicn. - Shortly after the reign of King Alfred ( 871 ? 901 ) , , the , island was for a while in the grasp of , Seanrxinavian ' invader* , Danes and Norse-men , who seized the kingship . Among these Scandi-navian kings was Canute ( or Knut ) . Do you know the story of King Canute and the ocean ? If you do not , look it up in a history of England and report on it to-morrow . At this period , a few Scandinavian words entered the language . Among these words are anger , cake , call , cast , clumsy , curl , die , dirt , fellow , get , happen , ill , kid , root , skill , skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important of all was the introduction of the verb form are , and the pronoun forms they , them , and their . Instead of are , the Anglo-Saxons used ' beoth or sindon . We still have the root form be , in some forms // of this verb , have n't we ? And if you study German , you will learn that the Germans still say wir sind and . pie sind for we are and they are . An important influence of the Scandinavian occupation was the impetus it gave to the breaking-down of inflections . ' The Danes and the " English " ( as we shall now begin to call the Anglo-Saxon inhabitants of Britain ) used largely the same root words , but with different inflectional endings . As they mingled in daily life , the two peoples could converse readily by stressing the root and disregarding the endings . This tendency has continued in English until our language now has fewer inflections than any other well-known Indo-European tongue . The Norman conquest . ? Early in the tenth century u band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrested from the French a large t erritory in northern France , which became known as Normandy , the land of the Normans , or Northmen . Ilere they settled , and even adopted the language of the French , which they naturally spoke with a dialectic utterance . This tongue is known as Norman-French . In 1066 , William the Conqueror , Duke 2 of Nor-mandy , crossed the English Channel and overthrew the Saxon king , Harold , at the battle of Hastings . William at once established himself as ruler of England . 11 kinds of offices were filled with Normans . Eventu-:111y Norman-French became the language of the Court , I.l the schools , of literature . Meanwhile , the conquered people , the Anglo-Saxons , went on speaking their native tongue . // But , as they mingled in the market place with the French soldiers and Court retainers , they picked up many French words and added them to their language . Many of these words are in such common use today that it may surprise you to learn that they are really " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , they are now just as truly English as you are American , though your parents or grandparents or great-grandparents were born in England , or in Ger-many , or in Italy . Among these Norman-French words are those that have to do with war , such as arms , battle , captain , ' soldier , enemy , officer , peace , army , navy . Others refer to the Court , the government , and the law , such as duke , mayor , court , govern , council , sovereign , reign , state , people , accuse , appeal , plead , judge , justice , jury , crime , prison . A very interesting group is composed of the names of various meats , while we have retained the Germanic word for the live animals . These are : Curiously enough , the word beef in the course of centuries has become so identified with English life ( the English have been the great " beef eaters " ) that the modern French borrow the word back into French // as rosbif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the words contributed to English by the Norman-French are several that were originally Celtic . These words had survived in French from the speech of the Gauls , who had been conquered by the Romans and had adopted Latin . ' You will recognize how com-mon these words are : barter , budget , car , cloak , clock , garter , mutton , piece , truant . The Norman-French added many synonyms 2 to the Anglo-Saxon words . Observe these pairs : Do you not feel that the Anglo-Saxon words are all more " homely " that is , " homelike " ? The Normans also gave us such widely used words as roast , dine , supper , feast , chair , sir , madam , master , mistress , honor , tower , castle . While the absorption of these French words was on t iie whole a great gain , there were some losses . Pict uresque old English compounds were pushed out by Ilie French immigrants . For example , wanhope gave way to despair , gold-hoard to treasure , book-hoard to library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked so pale and wan . " Here was replaced by army , sciphere ( ship-army ) by navy , and sige by victory . It is interesting to note that the cognates of here and sige // still survive in German : Heer ( army ) and Sieg ( vic-tory ) . The German also still preserves the power to make picturesque compounds . What we call a " thimble " is in German Fingerhut ( finger-hat ) , and a " glove " is Handschuh ( hand-shoe ) . Wehmut ( woe-mood ) means " sadness . " Sometimes the German tendency to form compounds is carried to alarming lengths . How should you feel if you had to buy in Germany a Schnellzug zuschlagschein ? all one word ? You would be buying an " extra fare ticket for express trains . " The introduction of Norman-French words also definitely stopped any real growth of English words and confirmed the habit of extensive borrowing that has made English the most composite ' language in the world . But this , too , may be counted a gain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-pression . English may well be called the melting pot of languages , as America is the melting pot of peoples . On the whole , the influence of Norman-French on English has been decidedly beneficial . English comes into its own . ? For a long time the . lords and ladies of the Court despised the English vassals and their rude speech . But as time went on , the sturdy character of the English people and the English language asserted itself more and more . The dialects were many . A man from the North could hardly under-stand one from the South , but it was still English . In the thirteenth century the nobles of England were compelled to give up their French possessions . This had the effect of making all the inhabitants of the island feel that they were English and that the French // were foreigners . Finally , in 1362 , Edward III had Parliament pass an Act which made English the official language of the law courts . The victory was won . By this time the Midland dialect spoken around London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of the Angles , who had been numerically t lie largest of the Germanic invaders .

HOW ENGLISH GREW AND CHANGED Periods of English ; changes in the language . ? We may distinguish several periods in the growth of Eng-lish . These naturally shade into each other , but this is the simplest division : Anglo-Saxon 450-1150 Old or Early English 1150-1350 Middle English 1350-1550 Modern English 1550- Do you think that you can read the English of all these periods ? Let us try it and see . Here is a passage from the Gospel according to St. Mark in Anglo-Saxon : And eft he ongan hi set were sae laeran . It is literally a foreign language , is n't it ? Let us give it again , with another sentence added , and with a translation into modern English . Note the different word order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorn letter . ' And eft he ongan hi set were s e Iran . And afterwards He began them at that lake to-teach . And him wws mycel m@negu to gegaderod , And ( about ) Him was a great crowd ( many men ) gathered , swa at he on scip Bode , and on hire sae so that He on ship went , and on that lake wses ; and eall seo m@negu ymbe pfti s was ; and all that crowd around that lake wses on lande. was on land . Only the words and , he , him , on , and to have come down to us with their spellings unchanged . // Now let us look at a specimen of Old English : Hit corn him on mode , and on his mern thonke , It came to-him in mind , and on his chief thought , thet he wolde of Engla tha methelmen tellen. ' that he would of England the noble deeds tell . This begins to look more like " English , " does n't it ? We also see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words come closer to their present-day dress . ress . Now let us glance at some examples of Middle Eng-lish : In a sourer seson whan soft was the sonne , I shope me in shroudes , 2 as I a shepe were . Piers Plowman ( middle of fourteenth century ) . His wyf and eek his daughter hath he left inwith his hous , of which the dores weren fast y-shette.4 CHAUCER , Canterbury Tales ( fourteenth century ) . Surely you can read these without a translation ex-cept for a very few words ? We have spoken of the loss in English of the ability to form compounds with native words . It was during the Middle English period that a book appeared en-titled The Agenbite of Inwit . Of course , agen is the old spelling of again . Let us translate this title into the Latin derivatives that we should use today : The Re-morse of Con-science Again-bite In-wit Remorse is really Latin for again-bite ( or backbite ) iuid conscience for in-wit ; that is , " what you know within yourself . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but go to the I.n tin . // With the dawn of the Modern English period come the great writers of the reign of Queen Elizabeth , of whom Shakespeare is the king . You can read Shakespeare today . To be sure , we have modernized his spelling to a certain extent , but by his time the grammar and sentence structure of the language had become fairly fixed . Yet we have evidence that the pronunciation of his time varied in many respects from ours . If Shakespeare 's ghost should return to us , you would have great difficulty in understanding his speech . You would disgustedly declare that he did n't speak English . Let us take a single instance . In Shakespeare 's King Henry IV ( Part I , Act II , Scene 4 ) , the following dialogue occurs : Pours . Come , your reason , Jack , your reason . FALSTAFF . . . . If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries , I would give no man a reason upon compulsion , I. This does n't seem to make much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare 's day , reason was pronounced so that it sounded like raisin . Falstaff is making a pun . Of course , we have added many , many words since Shakespeare 's time . Of this we shall have much to say later on . On the other hand , many words familiar to him have now almost dropped out of use . Have you read some historical novels ? If you have , you must have noticed how the author conveyed the flavor of bygone days by sprinkling into his tale some antique words . Surely it makes you think of gentlemen with swords and embroidered doublets , and of ladies with huge ruffs around their necks , to read : " In Booth , " quoth he , // " I know full well thou art sore afraid . And ill it be seems thee . Wouldst thou fain cozen me ? By my halidome , I trow thou art no caitiff , varlet ! Eftsoons thou shalt requite me for't . " The loss of inflections . ? Now let us look at some Anglo-Saxon inflections . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is interesting to note how faithfully the German has preserved the old endings , while the English has discarded most of them . The only modern English relics of the Anglo-Saxon . j endings are the ? s of the plural of the noun , together with the ? ' s and the ? s ' to indicate possession . Instead of the other endings we use prepositions , such as of , to , and for . Of adjective inflections we have nothing left except the comparative and superlative degrees ( larger , largest ) , and these and those as the plurals of this and that . Notice how many adjective endings are still retained in German . In Latin there are thirty-six forms of some adjectives ! Let us also examine one specimen of verb inflection : // Anglo-Saxon Modern German Modern English is haefde ich hatte I had u hnfdest du hattest thou hadst he haefde er hatte he had we hmfdon wir hatten we had ge ha fdon ihr hattet you had his haefdon sic hatten they had The sole English remnant of a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form is no longer in current use . In fact , virtually the only English inflections still surviving are the plural and possessive forms of nouns ( e.g. boys , boy 's , boys ' ) , the present participle in ? ing ( e.g. seeing ) , the past forms of verbs ( e.g. walked , saw , have seen ) , and the objective forms of pronouns ( as , see him , and he sees me ) . We also have the ? s , as in e sees , and the peculiarities of the verb to be ( I am , ou are , he is ) . If you study a foreign language , you ill at once be struck by the greater number of inflec-ions , ' especially of the verb . This tendency to dispense with endings has gone so n r in English that we readily turn a verb into a noun , r a noun into a verb , without change in form . For example : Verb into Noun I cut it . I made a cut in it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love her . I have a great love for her . Noun into Verb He used his hand . Hand me that . Put paper on the wall . Paper the wall . // Other languages , you will find , have distinctive forms for the different parts of speech . Two examples will be sufficient : GERMAN : ( Noun ) Ich habe einen Wunsch . ? I have a wish . ( Verb ) Ich wunsche zu gehen . ? I wish to go . FRENCH : ( Noun ) L'amour est la vie . ? Love is life . ( Verb ) Aimer c'est vivre . ? To love is to live . By Shakespeare 's time the grammar of our language was fixed . Very few changes in the form of words have occurred since that time . The great and significant changes have consisted in the importation of new words . We have already seen that English developed very early the habit of borrowing words from other tongues . But the early importations from Latin , Celtic , Scandinavian , and Norman-French were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from French set in as early as 1300 . But it was reserved for the period known as the Renaissance , or Revival of Learning , which reached England in the sixteenth century , to confirm English in its role as the Great Borrower among languages .

CHAPTER FIVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in confirming the habit of extensive borrowing from Latin , French , and Greek . ? Bor-rowings from other sources . ? The composite character of modern English . I. THE RENAISSANCE ; WORDS FROM LATIN AND FRENCH The effects of the Renaissance on English . ? The Renaissance , or Revival of Learning , which began in Italy and spread all over Europe , was marked chiefly by a frenzied interest in the literature of ancient Greece and Rome . The monasteries , where the monks all through the Middle Ages had been patiently copying and recopying the works of Greek and Roman authors , ' were ransacked for these treasures of antiquity . The world was again illuminated by " the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome . " This revival resulted in an enormous increase of activity in the world of art and letters . The best minds of every country were stirred to the production of poems , dramas , works of scholarship , and great paintings . The England of the sixteenth century num-bered among its writers the illustrious names of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know these names ? From this furious rush of intellectual activity came 116 1 // new ideas and new conceptions . The old words of the language were found quite inadequate to cope with the rapid and energetic expansion of thought . New words must be found . As we have seen , the English language had become " lazy " and no longer troubled to make compounds with native Anglo-Saxon words . It was easier to reach into the pockets of some other language and grab a handful of words . Where did men turn ? Naturally , to the Latin and Greek . We have seen that Latin words , usually in their . French form , had been coming into the language since V the Norman conquest , and especially since 1300 . From about 1500 they were usually taken directly from the Latin . Latin and Greek authors were at this period regarded as models of style , thought , and expression . What is more , the clergy and all educated persons still spoke Latin , as well as English and French . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words to express their new ideas . To the Greek they also turned , to some extent , for the vocabulary of science and philosophy . Many words " coined " at this time have been since discarded . But many have been retained , too , and he habit of borrowing , thus established , has been con1 inued to this day . Of the words used by English writers during the latter half of the thirteenth century , only twelve per cent are not Anglo-Saxon . Today , : bout fifty per cent of our vocabulary consists of Latin derivatives . The Anglo-Saxon and Latin elements in English compared . ? While the Anglo-Saxon element makes up less than fifty per cent of the total vocabulary of Eng- 1 // lish , it is well to note that nearly all the commonest ideas of everyday life are expressed by Anglo-Saxon words . Consider these examples : a , an , the , of , for , by , at , to , with , from , in , on , through , under , over , before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , he , she , this , that , where , when , and , but , or , nor , good , bad , old , young , strong , weak , short , high , great , small , father , mother , sister , brother , son , daughter , child , man , woman , house , home , night , day , sun , moon , bed , room , fire , water , sea , land , earth , winter , summer , dog , cat , field , garden , stick , stone , wood , thing , hand , foot , eye , ear , tooth , mouth , lip , hair , flesh , bone , arm , be , have , do , go , come , see , live , love , say , speak , make , break , sing . We could not do without any of these , could we ? Imagine trying to substitute Latin derivatives for some of our homely Anglo-Saxon friends . It would convey a different shade of meaning to call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aged instead of old , juvenile instead of young , robust instead of strong , feeble instead of weak . Imagine calling your home your domestic habitation or your domicile , or asking for aqueous fluid instead of for water ! And what Latin words would take the place of father and mother ? Shall we call them our paternal ancestor and our maternal ancestor ? It is true , then , that in general the Latin , and also the Greek , words have a learned air about them . When we are writing on scientific , philosophical , or economic ' subjects , we are sure to use a great many Latin and Greek derivatives . Yet there is great danger in overemphasizing the learned character of the Latin element in English . Many words in very common use are of Latin origin . 1 Do you know what economic means in this sense ? // Why do we put common and use in italics ? Because they themselves are of Latin origin . Glance about you . The table , the chair , the wall , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the paper , not t o mention the chalk and the eraser , are all from Latin , or else from the Latinized form of Greek words . Look out at the street , with its automobiles , its large buildings , and the people passing by . The words we have just mentioned , and many others that you will meet , are derived from Latin . The advice is sometimes given : " Avoid Latin deriva-tives ; use brief , terse , rugged Anglo-Saxon mono-vIlables. " 1 Do you know what the joke is in this ? It is that the giver of the advice has not used a single Anglo-Saxon word in his advice except the word Anglo-Saxon . Rugged is the nearest approach to it , for that is a Scandinavian word , but it is not a monosyllable . The founders of our government leaned rather heavily on Latin when they wrote the Preamble to the Constitu-tion : We the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and i . h , blish this Constitution for the United States of America . In addition to this , our country ( whose very name is Latin ! ) is ruled by a President , a Senate , and a Congress ( or House of Representatives ) , and the three main branches of the government are the executive , the legis-lative , and the judicial . Why are many of the words above in italics ? You // have guessed it . Because they are all of Latin or Latin-French origin except government , which was at first Greek , but was borrowed into Latin . ' Though many common words come to us from Latin , and even from Greek , 2 it must be admitted that in the main the Latin-Greek element in English is of the learned character . Let us see how far you could get on Anglo-Saxon words alone : If you lived in the woods , far away from civilization , you could get along almost all your life without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cook a and eat your food , drink water or milk , feed the dogs , cats , horses , and cows , do whatever work was needed through the day , go to bed at night to sleep and dream ? but you could never go to school , for there you would meet a Greek word coming to us from the Latin . All the words in this passage are Anglo-Saxon except the words Latin and Greek themselves and the nouns civilization and school . It is a hint of the learned char-acter 4 of our Latin and Greek words that school and civilization are defined in Latin-Greek terms . The Latin and French element in English . ? As we have seen , English began to assimilate ' Latin and French words at a very early period . From 1300 on , French words ( which were mostly of Latin origin ) began to pour into English . After 1500 ( as we have seen ) these new words were mostly taken directly from the Latin . // Let us look at these examples : Can there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin or from the French form ? Now look at these lists : Can there again be any doubt whether the English words come from the Latin or from the French form ? Now look at these examples : Now a doubt begins to creep in . French or Latin ? In such words as those above , it is undoubtedly true // that the English forms have been influenced by the French endings ; yet it is just as reasonable to say that the English words have been derived from the Latin as to say that they come from the French . The Latin word is clearly the basis in each case . Here is another group : Latin French English color couleur color honor honneur honor favor faveur favor You would undoubtedly say that our English words come direct from the Latin , would n't you ? But stay ! Have you forgotten that in England they still spell these words colour , honour , and favour ? The u is an indication of French influence . Now for one more group : Latin French English generalis general general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forme form explorare explorer explore continuare continuer continue descendere descendre descend What shall we say of these ? Is naval from the French form , or is it simply the Latin word minus the ending ? is ? Is descend from descendere or from descendre ? Indeed , it is impossible in many cases to say whether we have taken a word from the French or from the Latin . In all such cases , it is more natural to say that , it is a Latin derivative . // Our Latin derivatives are so numerous that it would be impossible to gather here even those that are in very common use . In Chapter VI we shall meet many of the Latin roots that have given us hosts of English words . But it will interest you to look here at some Latin words that have come to us unchanged : alumnus index plus animal janitor minus antenna pastor senior apex cancer junior apparatus bonus inferior arena series superior auditorium maximum alias camera minimum alibi circus major extra focus minor item genius Some of these preserve their Latin plurals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we often get a much better insight into tile true sense of many words if we know their origin . For example , let us give an English translation of the Latin words from which some of these were taken : janitor a door-tender pastor a shepherd bonus " a good thing " junior younger senior older , elder plus more minus less alias otherwise alibi elsewhere If you establish an alibi , you prove that you were somewhere else . If you read of Michael O'Toole , alias // EXERCISES 1 . What was the Renaissance ? 2 . What was its chief effect on English ? 3 .

Mention a few English words derived from Latin without change of form . 10 . Mention a few characteristic English derivatives from French . II . WORDS FROM GREEK AND OTHER SOURCES The Greek element in English . ? The Greek element can by no means be overlooked . As we have seen , the vocabulary of science is largely drawn from Greek , though much of it is Latin . Therefore , most of our Greek derivatives are even more " learned " than our Latin words . But this is far from being wholly true . Consider these common , or fairly common , words that are all originally Greek , though most of them have come to us // from their Latin or French forms . ' The very air 2 that you breathe is Greek . Look around your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plates and dishes4 were Greek ? Or your butter , oysters , celery , asparagus , ' marmalade , cherries , dates , currants , and chestnuts ? Did you ever go to the theater ? The program tells you the names of the characters in the drama , whether t is a comedy or a tragedy . Perhaps the orchestra or the organ played some music before the show and in the pauses between the acts . What lovely tones ! Now , Iou't be an idiot and get into a panic when I tell you // these are all Greek . That wo n't do you an atom of practical good . Save your zeal and your enthusiasm for better ideas . However , I do n't blame you ; you have my sympathy . But be economical of your energy . Yes , these are all Greek , and so are electricity and its dynamo . The systems and methods used in solving life 's problems are Greek . And so is your stomach ache and the physician who diagnoses your symptoms and cures you . Automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life has its Greek words , including athletics and politics . And when you get your diploma from this school , you may realize it . If you do n't , you might as well jump into the ocean ! Yet , while many more or less everyday words corn ; from the Greek , it is in the field of science , invention , and philosophy ( itself a Greek word ) that we hav : especially drawn upon the Greek for new words ts express new ideas . This can be seen in the followin. list of Greek derivatives : telegraph thermometer artery telephone barometer mechanics photograph chronometer automatic anatomy atmosphere architect biology oxygen periscope geology hydrogen osteopathy geography antiseptic chiropractic physics antitoxin gyroscope physiology neuralgia autogyro psychology pneumonia aerodrome botany bronchitis microphone astronomy rheumatism static microscope anesthetic heterodyne Look at the last nine of these , which have all bee added to the language within the last few years . Th. // periscope is especially well known in connection with the submarine . But we are more or less impartial ? submarine is a Latin word . Osteopathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' autogyro ( or auto-giro ) , and aerodrome 2 are concerned with aeronautics , 2 which is also a Greek word . But dirigibles is a Latin word , while aeroplane 2 or airplane 4 is half Greek and half Latin . Microphone , static , ' and heterodyne are products of radio , which was itself named from the Italian form of a Latin word . Do you see why radio should have an Italian name ? Again , we have gone to the Latin for other terms in connection with radio , such as amplifier and antenna . Practically every wide-awake boy and girl will know the scientific terms that we have just mentioned . When we have finished this chapter , you will have a chance to display your knowledge . Did you notice how , in these Greek words , the same parts kept repeating themselves ? You saw , for in-stance , several occurrences of tele , graph , phone , meter , logy , scope , ge(o) , and anti . In the next chapter it will be brought home to you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements , whether from ( ; reek or Latin , will enable you to determine the mean-ing of hundreds of English words . Furthermore , this habit of borrowing scientific terms // from the Greek and Latin is almost universal in the well-known European languages . Therefore , a knowl-edge of the meaning of the original elements will increase your vocabulary in several languages . Let us look at a few examples : Who invents these words ? Perhaps the inventor of the device himself , perhaps a writer on the subject or an expert in the field . And once a new word catches the popular fancy , it " sticks . " Derivatives from other sources . ? While the Latin . / French-Greek element provides by far the greatest proportion of borrowed words in English , there are numerous other sources from which the English vocab ? ulary has enriched itself . The English have always been great traders and colonizers . English ships have brought back the richee of Africa , the Orient , and the South Sea Islands , and with their cargoes they have carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this , if Spanish or Portuguese merchants and explorers have found a new ' word in distant lands , the English have pounced upon ' it and made it theirs , too . // It would seem that scarcely a land in the world has not contributed some of its native words to English . I t is noteworthy , too , that many of these words have come to us through the Frech . This shows that the French have not been far behind the English-speaking nations in their eagerness to borrow . Suppose you were to read this passage in a story : The schooner entered the bay under full sail , a beautiful sight beneath the sapphire sky . The skipper - st ood by the capstan , monarch of all he surveyed , while the pilot held her keel on an even course . What cargo did she carry in her hold ? The fruits of many Countries ? bananas , oranges , lemons , leaches , apricots , dates , and cantaloups ?

This is all good " English , " is n't it ? There is no uggestion of a foreign language about it , is there ? But et us look at the romantic history of many of these ? ords , and we shall see how English is an harmonious ' lend of many tongues .

Is n't this a marvelous array of languages that have contributed to ours ? Look at the following lists of words ( pages 133 ? 134 ) with their sources and you will be still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the wealth of nations to enrich our own vocabulary . In some cases it is difficult to determine accurately the source of a word . For example , we have taken the words banana and zebra from the Portuguese , but the // Portuguese had already borrowed them from West African dialects . In such a case , we feel that the words are more characteristically African than Portuguese . You are not expected to memorize the words in these lists , but only to gain from them an idea of how every corner of the earth has contributed to our language . I n some instances , notably the Scandinavian , the list could be extended to several hundred words . We could also add other languages of which you have never heard .

All languages are borrowers , more o less . Modern Persian , Rumanian , and French are clos ; runners-up to the champion English . Of course , other languages borrow from English . French derivatives from English , mostly recent , include : baby , bifteck ( " beefsteak " ) , boxe ( " boxing " ) , bouledogue ( " bulldog " ) , bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foot-ball , rosbif ( " roast beef " ) , sandwich , smoking ( meaning " dinner jacket " ) , sport , wagon . // Curiously enough , some of these ( such as cream , roast beef , and sport ) were French words borrowed long ago into English , but in English they have assumed such a specialized sense that the French have borrowed them back in the new meaning . German has borrowed boycott , lift ( " elevator " ) , steward , tea room , week-end , and others . Whenever an idea receives world-wide prominence in one country , as the idea reaches other countries the word goes with it . Thus the modern conception of sport ( athletic competition , horse racing , boat racing , hunting ) springs from the customs of the great Englishspeaking races . Hence , as other nations adopt our sports ( witness the modern Olympic games ! ) , the word goes with them . We may estimate that derivatives or borrowed words compose about fifty to sixty per cent of our entire vocabulary . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , about fifteen per cent are Greek , and the remaining five per cent includes those from all other sources . The result of this extensive borrowing has made the English vocabulary extraordinarily rich . We have words for all ideas and for every shade of meaning . We have a wealth of synonyms . We have words to convey every " flavor " of meaning . By selecting just the right words we can clothe our thoughts so that they will look exactly as we want them to look . Consider these two expressions of the same idea : I. The roar of the breakers on the shore smote our ears like the boom of cannon from afar . 2 . The reverberations of the plangent waves along the coast resounded in our ears like the detonations of distant artillery . // Do you not observe a wholly different flavor ? Try to analyze the difference . Tell what impression the first version makes on you as compared with the second . Which seems the more impressive ? Which do you think really fits the idea better ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different gar-ments . We know it is the same person , but his ap-pearance in the two suits is very different . We have seen 1 that in general the Anglo-Saxon ele-ment is more homely , while the Latin element is more learned . Yet this is not always so . Sometimes the Latin word is commonplace , while the Anglo-Saxon word has a quaint and poetic flavor that is lacking in its Latin synonym . For example : LATIN : A sign of his power . A reddish color . ANGLO-SAXON : A token of his might . A reddish hue . We may lament the fact that the poetic flavor of the word token is being destroyed by its use in many cities to represent street-car fares . So language changes . We have also seen that a scientific or philosophical discussion will inevitably call for numerous Latin and Greek derivatives . These words are brought into the language to mean certain definite things and to convey certain definite ideas . This is a great gain and prevents misunderstanding . We did not name the telephone the " far-sounder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we borrowed , from the Greek and Latin respectively , the words that meant the same thing . Thus we had for those inventions definite names that could not be confused with anything else . All these foreign elements have been harmoniously blended in English , the " melting pot " of languages . // Hach new word melts into the language . The result is eloquence , breadth , and flexibility 1 of expression be-yond that of any other language on earth . More than ever should you realize by now the de-sirability of enlarging your vocabulary and of increasing your powers of expression . And more than ever should you appreciate the advantages of foreign language study . EXERCISES How great a proportion of modern English is composed of Latin or French words ? Of Greek words ?

Hybrids . ? Popular etymology . ? Clipped word forms . I. WORD FORMATION : ROOTS , PREFIXES , SUFFIXES , AND COMPOUND WORDS How language changes . ? We have learned how different speech habits in different localities have , in course of time , produced new dialects and new languages out of old ones . ' Scores of tongues have grown from a parent speech that we call " Indo-European . " Even in the last fifteen hundred years our own English has developed from some old German dialects , and within two thousand years French , Spanish , Italian , and other tongues have grown out of Latin . We have learned that the English of a few hundred years ago was different from our present-day speech in spelling , pronunciation , and vocabulary . Old wordhave been lost , new words have been added , words hav : changed their form and pronunciation . ' Language ialways changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much slower today . ' Yet no living language ever stands still . You have only to rea. the newspapers to find new words added to our languag ; almost daily , as a result of our changing concepts an . ' as a result of new ideas , inventions , and discoveries . i See pages 48 ? 53 and 64 ? 66. 2 See Chapter IV , especially pag : 106 ? 112. 3 Can you recall why this is so ? See page 65. 4 Compa the Renaissance , pages 112 and 116 ? 117. 142 // Word formation : roots , prefixes , and suffixes . ? In the next chapter we shall learn how words often change their meaning as time goes on . But before taking up this most fascinating phase of our subject we are going t o take words apart and see how they are made . That is to say , we are going to study word formation . Our primitive ancestors , you will remember , ' in their first attempts at speech , used only monosyllables that we may call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first efforts ; verbs and other parts of speech came later . ' Still later it was found that two or more root ideas could be put together to make one word . In course of time , several words grew from one . Consider , for ex-ample , what we have done with the Anglo-Saxon root word kind ' : kind , unkind , kindness , unkindness , kindly ( adjective ) , kindly ( adverb ) , unkindly , kindliness , kinder , kindest , unkinder , unkindest , kind-hearted . We have made several words from kind by the use of prefixes ( " placed before " ) and suffixes ( " placed after " ) . Sometimes a prefix or suffix was originally a word . For example , the suffix ? ly was in origin the mane as like ( Anglo-Saxon lie ) . In the case of kind-hearted we have formed a compound word . Now , take the prefixes and suffixes away from the root and see what the force of each one is : un = not , the opposite of er = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ est = most ly = like , in the manner of // You will recognize at once that these same common Anglo-Saxon prefixes and suffixes have been extensively used to form new words from root words , with an al-teration of the meaning . With our extensive apparatus of prefixes and suffixes we have made many words out of few . When we have borrowed new words , we have not hesitated to attach to them some of our native prefixes . Thus , from the Latin-French derivative just , we form unjust and un-justly ; from the Latin-French firm , we make firmness , firmly , firmer , and firmest . Furthermore , we have a complete grammatical ap-paratus for building up the forms of new words . When we borrowed the verb boil from the French , for example , we at once produced boiling , boiled , and ( it ) boils . Other languages , too , possess their batteries of pre-fixes and suffixes . English , the Great Borrower , has also adopted many of these from Latin , Greek , and French . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt its array of native prefixes and suffixes than to attach our own . Thus , in taking from Latin into English the verb compete , which already contains the Latin prefix corn ? , we also take competitor , competition , and competitive . We use these foreign suffixes in ways to suit ourselves . Take the word nationality . We say that this is a Latin derivative . Yet no such Latin word existed , though the elements in the word are all Latin . There was a Latin suffix ? alis , from which we get ? al , as in naval or legal . ' There was a Latin suffix ? ( i ) tas French ? ( i ) te , from which we get ? ( i ) ty , as in liberty ( Latin libertas , French liberty ) . Thus , by adding // al + ity to the Latin stem nation ? we produce nationality , though no such word as " nationalitas " existed in Latin . But we speakers of English are not too particular . Some prefixes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever . Take the FrenchGreek suffix ? ist . We add this to Latin words ( dentist , feminist ) , to French-Latin words ( socialist , communist ) , to Italian words ( pianist , violinist ) , to Arabic words t algebraist ) , to Russian words ( bolshevist ) , to proper names ( Marxist 2 ) , as well as to Greek words ( strategist , Baptist ) . It is true that , in the main , we are consistent . For the most part we use Anglo-Saxon prefixes and suffixes with Anglo-Saxon words , Latin prefixes and suffixes with Latin words , Greek prefixes and suffixes with Greek reek words . But we also feel free to mix them up I t will . Compound words . ? As soon as we add a prefix or a suffix to a root word , we have in the broader sense a compound word . We have also seen that two root elements may form true compounds , as in brok ; enhearted . There is a natural tendency in t ile Germanic languages to form i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this capacity for forming compounds . As we have seen , where we say thimble , the uerman says /-'i ngerhut ( finger-hat ) ; where we say glove , the German // says Handschuh ( hand-shoe ) . Such words are very pretty and picturesque . We have also see , . such com-pounds as Weltschmerz , Wanderlust , and Wiedersehen , l literally world-pain , wander-desire , and again-seeing . The Germans have developed this tendency to such an extreme that they often combine several root words into one long word . Mark Twain made fun of this by making up comic German compounds , such as Hoch-obenhoftrompeterin , " the wife of the chief high court trumpeter. " 2 The tendency to form root compounds was largely halted in English by the habit of borrowing which set in with the Norman conquest . ' We still have , however , many true compounds in the language , such as railroad , workman , midnight , sunlight , fireworks , baseball . EXERCISES Give at least three examples of words containing each of the following : ( a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ness ; ( c ) the suffix - sly ; ( d ) the suffix ? er ( = " more " ) ; ( e ) the suffix ? est . NoTE : Prefixes and suffixes , with their meanings and examples , can be found in large dictionaries , such as Webster 's Unabridged . It would be better if the class had access to such works as Weekley 's or Skeat 's Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language or The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia . Find the force of the suffixes ? tor , ? ( t ) ion , ? Wive , and ? ist . Write the correct answers in your notebook . Which of these is a root word : teach , teacher , teachable ? Form as many words as you can from rest . ' What is the difference in the sense of ? er in teacher and in stronger ? Combine the words in the columns marked I with the // words in the columns marked II to form as many compounds as possible : I II after spend back case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ache broad book wash ball sun sweet thrift walk white side body quarters foot black ship set pen butter noon mail pick fly pocket fast cast II . ANGLO-SAXON PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES Anglo-Saxon prefixes and suffixes . ? Prefixes generally alter the aspect of the idea . Thus , unkind denotes " not kind " or " the reverse of kind " ; foretell means " tell beforehand . " Suffixes generally change the original word to a different class or type . Kindness means " the state or quality of being kind " ; helpful means " full of help . " Let us now consider further some common AngloSaxon prefixes and suffixes . See whether you can not tell the force of each prefix or suffix in the following words before you refer to the Table of Meanings on page 148. aside mistake friendship watery aboard misspell fellowship healthy forget withstand warmth teacher forbear withdraw truth speaker foresee freedom wonderful boyish foretell bachelordom careful brownish outdo motherhood wearisome careless outbox brotherhood venturesome jobless // TABLE OF MEANINGS Prefixes Suffixes a ? , in , on , at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for ? , from , away ? hood or state that which ( does ) fore ? , before , ahead ? ship of being ? ish , like , rather out ? , beyond , excelling ? th ? less , without mis ? , wrong(1y) ? ful full of , with , against , from ? some abounding in , causing The suffix ? ish ( Anglo-Saxon ? isc ) is the one that we have in the name of our language , English . ' Notice that the prefix for ? has nothing to do with the preposi-tion for . Like the prefix with ? , the preposition with originally meant " against . " This , we still see in ex-pressions such as to fight with . Like some other suffixes , 2 ? hood was originally a word . It comes from the Anglo-Saxon had , meaning " rank " or " condition . " EXERCISE Bring in at least two additional examples of each of the sixteen prefixes and suffixes just discussed . CAUTION : Be sure that you have true examples . Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , do not take every word beginning with for- , such as fortune and fortress , as an example of the prefix for- . Do not take every word in - ish as an example of the suffix meaning " like . " The - ish of finish and furnish , used in forming verbs , is a suffix from the French . SUPPLEMENTARY EXERCISES 1 . Bring in at least three examples of words containing each of these Anglo-Saxon prefixes and suffixes : Prefixes Suffixes be- , to do on all sides or completely , - let , little , small make , affect with or cover with - en , made of , like over- , over , beyond , in excess - ster , one who ( does ) under- , under , insufficiently // ( EXAMPLES : bedew , overrated , underfed , streamlet , wooden , - ongster. ) 2 . Use your words in sentences , to show that you under-stand their meaning . N.B. In making up illustrative sentences , always be sure that t hey really illustrate . It would not show that you understood the word streamlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamlet. " ! tut it would show your understanding of the word if you said : " This is not big enough to call a stream : it is only a streamlet. " 3 . From an examination of these sentences , write in your notebook what you think is the meaning of the suffixes in italics : The lambkin was frolicking with the bigger sheep . I hate a drunkard and a sluggard . Serve the duckling to the young lordling : he may grow up . Shorten his trousers , but do n't blacken his character . ( c ) Backward and forward they swayed . 4 . Give other examples of words containing each of these suffixes . 5 . Why is it wrong to say " little lambkin " ? III . LATIN AND GREEK DERIVATIVES Latin derivatives : roots , prefixes , and suffixes . ? You have already studied with some thoroughness the process of derivation or borrowing . ' It remains to be shown how your English vocabulary can be greatly enlarged if you know the meaning of even a few of the commonest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat have given us literally thousands of derivatives in I ; english . If you know merely the following Greek roots : phon ( voice , sound ) ; graph , gram ( write , draw , portray ) ; // log , logy ( word , reason , science , study ) ; phil ( fond , fond-ness , love ) , think how many words you can recognize . In these words you will find several other common Greek roots of which you will want to know the mean-ing , such as tele , bi(o) , ge(o) , soph(y) . With a mastery of some twenty-five or thirty Greek roots , prefixes , and suffixes , you will have the key to hundreds of English words , mostly scientific terms ; and you will not commit the " boners " of which Mr. Irland 's group of students were guilty . ' If you know that in Latin ad ? or ac ? means " to " or " towards , " and that ex ? means " out ( of ) , " you will not confuse accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that pre ? means " before " and per ? means " through , " you will not write " perscribe " for prescribe . When a doctor prescribes something for you , he writes it down before you , so that you have the correct prescription right in front of you . In this connection , it is well for you to observe that many Latin roots appear in two forms in English . Thus , we have scrib(e) and script , both forms of this same root , or stem . In Latin , scribo means " I write " and scriptus means " ( having been ) written . " Similarly , mitto means " I send " and misses means " ( having been ) sent . " It is very much like the difference in English between write and written , or between send and sent . Sometimes the difference is due to the peculiarities of French . Thus the Latin verb recipere becomes French recevoir , from which comes the English receive . But the Latin noun receptio(n) ? becomes French re-ception , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold a reception // Let us now take this Latin root scrib(e) , which means literally " write , " and see how many words we can find from it in English . scribe , scribble , scribbler , scrip , script , scripture ascribe , ascription circumscribe , circumscription conscript , conscription describe , description , descriptive , describer inscribe , inscription , inscriptive , inscriber postscript , manuscript prescribe , prescription , prescriptive proscribe , proscription , proscriptive subscribe , subscript , subscription superscribe , superscript , superscription transcribe , transcript , transcription We have collected without difficulty thirty-seven derivatives containing the root scrib(e) , scrip(t) . In most of these the idea of writing is clear . In others , the idea must be interpreted . We do not always write flown when we describe ; but the original idea was to write down what you saw . When we subscribe to a magazine , we write under or sign our name to the iugreement . Can you tell the meaning of the prefixes and suffixes that appear in the foregoing list ? In many cases , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to translate it , part for part , into more familiar terms . Such words , with a heir " familiar translation , " are : im-pro-vid-ent in-cred-ible un-fore-see-ing un-believ-able pre-diet-ion bene-vol-ent fore-tell-ing well-wish-ing un-anim-ous pro-gress-ive one-mind-ed foreward-go-ing // But it is not always so simple as this , and we roust interpret the idea properly . When you know that except literally means take out or taken out , it is easy t o see that all except this means " with this taken out . " But it does not justify you in saying that you will " except " your girl to a show . Johnny knew that excavate meant " hollow out , " but when he was asked to illustrate the word , he said " When Pa whips me , I excavate . " Euphonic changes in prefixes . ? You must - be intr duced to the word euphony , which is a Greek derivativ : signifying literally " good sound " ; that is , " pleasan sound . " Many changes in language have been du : to a seeking for euphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronounce the gh of daughter or the k o knee . When a change is made for the sake of euphony it is a euphonic change . Words that are pleasant to t ear are euphonious . Many prefixes in Latin and Greek were altered i certain combinations for the sake of euphony . Wha do all these words have in common ? Word Literal Meaning a-spect a looking at or upon ad-opt to choose to ( oneself ) ac-cept to take to ( oneself ) af-fix to fasten to ag-gression act of walking ( right up ) to someone al-ly one who is tied to ( somebody else ) an-notation a note upon ( something ) ap-peal to call to or upon ( somebody ) ar-rive to come to ( a place ) as-sist to stand by or near ( hence , to help ) at-tract to draw to ( oneself ) // These are all euphonic variants of the Latin prefix ad , meaning to , towards , at , near , or upon . Except in i the case of adopt , the prefix was changed to accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ con-sonant , the d of ad was dropped ( aspect ) . Do n't you think that accept is more euphonious than " adcept ? " EXERCISES Use correctly in sentences the verbs accept , except , prescribe , and excavate . Explain the difference in form between deceive and deception . Explain the difference in form between permit and ermission . Form several English words with the root mit(t) , miss . That is the general sense of this root ? Form some English words from the Greek roots phon , mph ( gram ) , log , phil , tele , bi(o) , ge(o) , soph . Give the " familiar translation " of the compounds super-u-ous , se-clus-ion , in-ex-haust-ible . ( See page 151 and con-0111 dictionary . ) Give the proper result of the following combiiations : ad + parent = ad + finity = ad + gravate = ad + Jude = ad + scribe = ad + sign = ad + tain = ad + nex = ad + here = ad + rogant = ad + quire = IV .
