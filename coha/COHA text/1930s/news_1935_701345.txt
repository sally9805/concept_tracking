txt A national railroad lobby , which " divides up " Congress members among railroads , " is using rail officials as " key men " in " lining up " prominent citizens in every county to bring pressure to bear " whenever the lobby chieftains in Washington give the signal , " according to statements made to the Senate Lobby Committee by the editor of Labor , organ of the standard railway labor unions . Senator Black , chairman of the committee , told Edward Keating , the editor , that at the proper time the allegations , as contained in documentary form and to be published in tomorrow 's issue of the labor organ , would be taken up . According to the union 's summary of the documents in Mr. Keating 's possession , R. V. Fletcher , general counsel of the Association of American Railroads headed by John J. Pelley , with his associates has " gone far beyond the mere formation of ' pressure groups ' in county and Congressional districts . " " They have undertaken to divide the Senators and Congressmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that State and they have designated a railroad official whose special business it is to see that the members of Congress for whom he is responsible are kept under proper ' influence ' at all times , " the summary states . Held New Wrinkle in Lobbies . " So far as Labor has been able to discover , this is an entirely ' new wrinkle ' in American lobbying . Never before have the great corporations of this country undertaken to appoint one of their paid officials to act as a sort of policeman , charged with the duty of seeing to it that a particular member of Congress ' behaved . ' " The list in the possession of Labor shows that in the " division " of members of Congress from New York State it fell to the Pennsylvania to keep close to Senators Copeland and Wagner . Represen ' tative Caroline O'Day was assigned to the New York Central , with M. E. Welch , superintendent of the Grand Central Terminal in New York , designated " to see that Mrs. O'Day was subjected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged . Mr. Pelley declined to comment on the charges when they were described to him in a telephone conversation . He indicated that he wished to study carefully the document to be published by Labor before making a final decision as to public reply . House members from New York districts were assigned to the following railroads , according to the documents purporting to have been issued by Mr. Pelley 's organiza-tion : Representatives from Districts 1 to 24 inclusive ( Greater New York ) ? Pennsylvania : Millard  --  New York Central . Fish  --  New York Central . Goodwin  --  New York Central . Corning  --  New York Central . Thomas  --  Delaware &; Hudson . Crowther  --  Fonda , Johnstown &; Gloversville . Snell  --  Delaware &; Hudson . Culkin  --  New York Central . Merrit  --  Long Island Railroad . Sisson  --  New York Central . Afton  --  Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western . Hancock  --  Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western . Taber  --  Lehigh Valley . Cole  --  Lehigh Valley . Duffy  --  New York Central . Wadsworth  --  New York Central . Andrews  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead  --  New York Central . Reed  --  Erie . No Reflection on Representatives . The publication Labor made it clear that it did not wish to reflect on the integrity of any Representative from New York . " It knows that many of the members who are being subjected to the espionage system set up by the lobby are above suspicion , " the article stated . " Many of them probably have n't the slightest idea that prominent railroad officials have been relieved from duties , for which , in many ' instances , they are paid handsome salaries , in order that they may devote their talents and energies to the job of inducing lawmakers to vote for what the railroads want and to vote against what they do not want . " For example , does Congressman Fred J. Sisson , Democrat , of Whiteboro , New York , one of the most dependable Progressives in the House , know that he has been ' assigned ' to the New York Central , and that the New York Central has kindly detailed S. S. Risley , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sisson ? " Mr. Sisson is probably unconsciousof Mr. Risley 's attentions , but , according to documents in the possession of Labor , Mr. Risley has very definite instructions from his employers as to how he shall proceed to ' influence ' Mr. Sisson 's official conduct . " Asserts County Lists Were Made . The article declares that long before Congress assembled the rail lobby . was perfecting its prganization . A purported letter to " key " men , dated Nov. 20 , ' 1934 , giving instructions on how to compile lists of influential persons in each county of New York State was quoted . The instructions , it was said , " deal with every aspect of the scheme , even to the size of the paper to be used in preparing the list of ' prominent citizens . ' it is to be 7% by 9% . " " Not less than twenty-five names were to be secured in any county and 200 was indicated as a more reasonable number , ! " the article said . " One of the favorite pleas of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' must be kept out of politics , ' but among the documents which have come to Labor is a list of names headed ' County Chairmen in New York State . ' " Then follows a long roster of railroad officials . Every county is covered and several of the large counties have not only a chairman but several assistants . " The correspondence indicates that the lobby has already used the organizations . There are letters instructing the ' key men ' to contact farmers and urge them to repudiate testimony present , to Congressional committees by , leaders in various farm groups . "
