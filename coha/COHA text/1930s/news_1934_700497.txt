txt The Treasury paid to the Federal Reserve banks 5102.000,000 of gold certificates this past week over and above the $155,000,000 which it paid for the week 's gold imports . This large discrepancy between the increase in the gold supply and the increase in gold certificates outstanding can not be explained by bookkeeping technicalities : it clearly indicates that the Treasury is not " sterilizing " its unencumbered gold holdings , but on the contrary is using them for current financing purposes . Since February 7 the Treasury has used $120,000,000 of its idle gold in this manner . It may be technically true that this $120,000,000 did not come either from the 52,000.000.000 stabilization fund or from the ** other " profit " which resulted from devaluation , since the government had something over $300,000. - 000 of unencumbered gold not required as reserve against currency which it may have been using . The important point is that at a time when the Treasury had over $1,900,000,000 on deposit with commercial banks and $35,000,000 on deposit with the Federal Reserve banks , it drew upon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are three separate influences at work in the monetary field , each of an inflationary nature . The first is this use of the Treasury 's unencumbered gold . The direct effect of this type of transaction is to enlarge the credit base of the Federal Reserve banks : namely , their holdings of gold certificates The equivalent of these gold certificates is at once translated dollar for dollar into the commercial banking system , chiefly by increasing the reserve deposits of member banks . Ultimately these expanded reserve deposits could support commercial deposits in a ratio of at least $10 to $1 . Enormous Rise in Excess Reserves A secondary inflationary force which has been particularly evident since dollar devaluation is the result of gold imports . Since February 7. the monetary gold supply of the United States has increased by $520,000,000 . These gold imports have been paid for by transferring an identical amount of gold certificates to the Federal Reserve banks , and consequently have expanded the credit base and also member bank reserves by a like amount . The combination of Treasury gold expenditures and gold imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks by S640,000,000 in one month , bringing that money base to a total of $4,398,000,000 , as against $2,857,000,000 a year ago . The immediate effect has been an expansion of member bank reserve balances in one month amounting to $577,000,000 , bringing the reserves of member banks to the record total of $5,313,000,000 , or $1,537,000.000 larger than a year ago . Excess reserves of the member banks are currently estimated at above $1,250,000,000 . The third inflationary influence is the direct result of the government deficit , which is being financed almost exclusively by the creation of bank credit . This has been particularly marked during the past month . From January 24 to February 28 ( latest available figures ) reporting member banks alone increased their holdings of government securities $1,004,000,000 . The significance of this increase may be appreciated by the fact that these banks , which represent only 40 ' , of the banking resources of the country , financed approximately 47 ' of the $2,140 - 000,000 increase in the federal debt which took place in this period . Bank purchase of new government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain upon bank resources . The purchases are effected by creating a corresponding deposit to the Treasury 's credit . which deposit requires no reserves . For e.cample , in the month ending March 7 the $1 , - 004,000,000 rise in government security holdings a ; the reporting member banks was almost exactly offset by an increase of $1,097,000,000 in government deposits . Buying the Gtnernment 's Deficit Eventually government deposits , as they are spent , tend to come back to banks in the form of private deposits , which of course require reserves . Due to the existence of current enormous excess reserves , however , the banks will have no difficulty in supplying reserves required against any expansion in their commercial deposits which may result from government expenditures . It might be said , therefore , that during the past month the government , by devaluing the dollar , induced a heavy gold import movement which is self-financing and causes an automatic expansion of the credit base and excess reserves . At the same time , the Treasury has been pumping further credit into the Reserve banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it had on hand prior to the recent imports . The resulting expansion of reserves has made it possible for the commercial banks to purchase the great bulk of the government 's current deficit without fear of eventually jeopardizing their reserve position . To date the three underlying inflationary forces , supplemented as they are by the Administration 's policy of raising prices , have not caused a. notable increase in commercial credit . However , it may be significant that the demand deposits of reporting member banks have risen approximately $450,000,000 since early January , in sharp contrast to the usual seasonal decline of between $400,000.000 to $600,000,000 . This non-seasonal rise of demand deposits has not been caused by bank loans or bank investments in non-government securities , which are now at approximately the same level as in January . The plain inference is that it has been caused either by gold imports or by government expenditures or both .
