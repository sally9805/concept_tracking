" Universally my father 's great qualities have been appreciated and valued , " cried Edward VIII this week in His Majesty 's first broadcast as King . " It now falls upon me to succeed him and to carry on his work . I am better known to most of you as the Prince of Wales , as a man who , during the War and since , has had the opportunity of getting to know the people of nearly every country of the world under all conditions and circumstances , and although I now speak to you as the King , I am still that same man who has that experience and whose constant effort it will be to continue to promote the well-being of his fellowmen . May the future bring peace and understanding throughout the world , prosperity and happiness to business people , and may we be worthy of the heritage which is ours . "
