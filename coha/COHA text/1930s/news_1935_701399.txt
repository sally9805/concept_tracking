txt Striking Works Progress Administration workers will not receive relief from the city administration , Mayor La Guardia indicated yesterday . It was the first official intimation of the course the city will pursue . This decision by the Mayor came at about the same time that Thomas Martin , a striking bricklayer of 773 East 155th Street , the Bronx , received $5 for food and a supplementary relief voucher for $23.50 from Miss Rosetta Fisher , case supervisor at the Home Relief district office , 797 Prospect Avenue , the Bronx . The Martin case , the Mayor suggested , was an isolated one and established no precedent . In other respects the strike was dormant yesterday . Union leaders continued to maintain that they were making progress , and said more than 1,000 were on strike . Figures on the number of workers out were not forthcoming from Administrator Hugh S. Johnson 's office , except that it was declared there were fewer men out than on any day since last Thursday . This meant less than 400 . Martin , whose wife , Lena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on the Astor project before it was taken from the old Emergency Relief Bureau works division into the WPA . At that time he was getting $60 a month , and $23.50 a month supplemental relief because of his wife 's illness and his large family . When the WPA took control Martin 's wage automatically went up to $93.50 a month . Martin , who has not yet received his second natularization papers , and has been in the country since 1929 , walked off the job on Aug. 6 , in accordance with the call of the unions . It was the first day of the strike . He did not go back , as many of the other workers did . Meanwhile , because there had been no ruling on whether , in view of the increase of monthly wages received by the WPA workers , the old system of supplemental relief would be continued , his monthly $23.50 check from the Home Relief Bureau continued . Approved by Bureau Head . By accident his check was within a few hours of being ready for him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone conversation with Miss Charlotte Carr , head of the Home Relief Bureau at 902 Broadway , Miss Fisher advanced him $5 for food , since he said his family was hungry and his wife ill , and a few hours later he received the supplemental check . The whole procedure was officially described in a statement from Miss Carr 's office as representing money " given for special diets for Mrs. Martin , food , and other necessities . " There was expected to be a decision within the next few days in the Home Relief Bureau as to whether supplemental checks would be continued for workers whose new WPA income is greater than their old pay . The question whether Miss Carr 's approval of the food check for Martin constituted a decision on policy , as was declared by David Lasser , chairman of the Workers Unemployed Union , who accompanied Martin to the relief office , was taken to Mayor La Guardia . " He was n't given relief , he war. / given some food , " the Mayor said . " Is it fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " the Mayor was asked . " Nothing is fair to assume , " he responded , " except that I say that this city administration will not scab on the Federal Government .

Previously President Roosevelt had placed a ban on the use of Federal money for ' home relief for striking WPA workers . Tells Stand in Speech . The Mayor had earlier attended ceremonies that started remodeling on the Brooklyn Bridge Manhattan . approach , with General Johnson also present . There the Mayor had declared that the city would do nothing ori work-relief projects that would not meet with the approval Of President Roosevelt , and added : " I am certain we can depend upon the best leadership of labor to work this problem out satisfactorily to all concerned .

He was asked if iie'regarded the Martin case as an isolated one , and after explaining that he had no jurisdiction over home relief , he added , " Anybody who takes this case as an example had better be careful . " There was a closed meeting at 265 West Fourteenth Street yesterday of representatives of the unions in all . the boroughs . At its end George Meany , executive manager of the Central Trades and Labor Council , declared that at least 1,000 men were on strike . The unions , he said , are planning a mass meeting dome time within the next two weeks in Madison Square Garden .
