( See front cover ) Texas last week rubbed out the one Republican patch on its huge and other wise Democratic Congressional map . By so doing it definitely handed control of the 72nd House of Representatives which meets this week for the first time , over to Democracy by a molecular majority . On that majority a stocky little Texan with fiery blue eyes and stubbly white hair pre pared to mount the rostrum to the stiff high-backed chair which holds the Speaker of the House and a power second only to that of the President . His name was John Nance Garner and for 28 years he had ably and shrewdly represented in Congress his State 's 15th district , an area the size of New York State stretching along the Rio Grande from above Eagle Pass to Brownsville on the Gulf . <P> Solid Texas . What sent the Congressman of the 15th district up to the Speakership were last week 's elective doings in the 14th district , running from above San Antonio to the Gulf at Corpus Christi . Until his death last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal popularity , carried the 14th around in his pocket for eleven years ( TIME , Nov. 16 ) . To fill his vacancy a special election was called . Democratic leaders raged in despair when six of their party rushed into the contest against one Republican . In far-off Washington President Hoover , nervously aware of the election 's significance , called for the returns , studied them with downcast eyes . For him they spelled another defeat because a Democrat by the name of Richard Mifflin Kleberg was elected . The President needed no political statistician to tell him that this meant that the House , his legislative mainstay for the last two years , was now lost to him , that it would line up : <P> Democrats ... 218 <P> Republicans ... 214 <P> Farmer Laborite ... 1 <P> Vacancies ... 2 <P> On paper the Democrats had a clear-cut majority of one against all combinations . <P> King Ranch . Congressman Kleberg 's election delighted Democrats of the 15th district no less than it did those of his own 14th . It meant the Speakership for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleberg family are part owners of the immense King Ranch , largest single one in the U. S. , which sprawls across 1,250,000 acres of Southeastern Texas and overflows into the Garner district . In 1925 Henrietta King , widow of Richard King , founder of this rural empire , died at the age of 90 , tied her $25,000,000 property up in trust for ten years . A King daughter is Mrs. Alice Gertrudis Kleberg , mother of the new Congressman . After her is named Santa Gertrudis , the great ranch house at Kingsville where visitors are royally entertained , where meals are served at a soft , table by Mexican servants , where a feudal atmosphere still prevails . " Dick " Kleberg once tried ranching but gave it up to move to Corpus Christi , go into the cattle business , play good golf . Today the King Ranch , with its 100,000 head of livestock , its miles of plains and gardens , its oil wells , is managed by the new Congressman 's brother Robert , who roams it from dawn to dark .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
