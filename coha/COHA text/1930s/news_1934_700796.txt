txt The Federal Emergency Relief Administration promised tonight that President Roosevelt 's pledge that no one would go hungry in the United States would be carried out to the letter in New York City in any crisis that arose as a result of discontinuance of State or city relief payments . Sources close to Administrator Hopkins declared that he had received no official notice of Mayor LaGuardia 's order , but that he probably would discuss the problem tomorrow with Frederick J. Daniels , administrator in the New York area . " We will feed the hungry . No one will starve . Women and children wo n't be penalized if New York City has run out of money , " a FERA. spokesman said . He added that the administration had available great quantities of commodities held by the Surplus Relief Corporation , including pork , beef , cheese , butter , flour and eggs , and that " if we ca n't give cash we can at least give grocery orders . " First Obligation on State . He emphasized that the FERA 's policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , city and community , with the government in the status of a " big brother , " but remarked that New York State had been among the leaders in recognizing its responsibility to its own . He pointed out that many factors arose in connection with the new development in New York , including the possibility of a special session of the Legislature called by Governor Lehman to consider the matter , possible sale of bonds by the city to raise money to help share the burden , and others . He indicated that Mr. Hopkins would want to explore the situation and its implications carefully before the FERA , which had poured millions into New York State relief , embarked on a new phase of the program . Called Almost Calamity . Welfare Commissioner William Hodson 's order for discontinuance of work and home relief checks . following disapproval by the Aldermanic Board of the LaGuardia tax bill , evoked expressions of dismay last night from heads of private welfare agencies . Robert P. Lane , executive director of the Welfare Council , which is composed of some 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these units , with contributions smaller than ever before in their history , are in no position to help any considerable number of additional families for more than a few days . " They are handling about 15,000 families now , " said Mr. Lane . " Most of these are families that are not eligible for home relief , either because of the two-year residence requirement , or for other causes . The city has on its relief rolls about 300,000 familibefore the government i started the maximum n cases that could be handl private welfare agencies Lle v er CA , ceeded 30,000 . If 10 per cent of the total number of families now on the city rolls were thrown upon them they would be utterly swamped . " Mostly Special Cases . Mr. Lane pointed out that most of the cases now being handled by the private welfare agencies are not the " bread-and-butter " type . A great many are special cases requiring advice and medical treatment or such service as would be over and above that provided by the home or work relief agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Lane , " can appreciate exactly what would take place in the homes of the unemployed of this city as a result of even a very brief discontinuance in the forwarding of municipal relief checks . " A very large part of these relief families live literally on a hand-tomouth and day-by-day basis . Delay in the arrival of even a single relief check , in thousands of cases , would find the cupboard bare , with the families down to their last nickel . " Nothing Short of Calamity . Major Bernard Devoto , speaking for the Salvation Army , which is taking care of about 1,200 families in Greater New York in addition to thousands of homeless men and women , said " discontinuance of relief checks would be nothing short of a calamity . " " Of course the Salvation Army will go the full extent of its resources if an emergency is created by the present situation , " he said , " but . we are already so heavily overtaxed that what we could offer in the way of additional aid would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we can , and it becomes increasingly difficult with each passing day to get more i money for our work . " " Discontinuance of home relief and work relief checks by the city is most regrettable , " said Dr. Joseph J. Schwartz , executive director of the Brooklyn Federation of Jewish Charities . " The private agencies , already overburdened , can not be depended on to take over cases from the city relief rolls . We are having difficulty meeting our budget as it is and that condition is common among all the private agencies . There can be no question about it ; it will bring a lot of hardship . It would take us back to a form of relief-giving that we thought we had abandoned . " The order stopping distribution of relief payments will affect about 315,000 families , 18 per cent of the city 's population , or about one out of six residents . These figures were announced by Mr. Hodson on Aug. 29 . Assuming the average family in the city consists of four persons , the number of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an estimate which , Mr. Hodson has asserted , is susceptible of error . However , the number on relief was expected to increase at least until the late Fall business pick-up . Mr. Hodson 's statement that " rent and food vouchers might have to be issued with some stamp such as ' valid when and if relief funds are available ' " preceded a statement in his announcement that " whether the recipients of these vouchers were able to ' use them would depend on the willingness of grocers to extend credit to families on relief of this uncertain basis . " This is at variance with Mayor LaGuardia 's previously announced position . Early in August Mayor LaGuardia , discussing the problem of September relief funds , said that the city " has the money but not the cash " to meet relief needs this month . So much red tape is involved in getting the Federal and State contributions , accordine. to the Mayor , that , while the city 's relief credit is good , it can not appropriate the actual cash . Of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $4.77 is provided by State and Federal relief admi istration , about $1.60 representing the city 's expense . Home relief payments aid about 190,000 families , who receive an average of almost $40 monthly , although individual amounts vary according to need from $5 to more than $150 . Emergency work wages , averaging $60 monthly per person , are received by 190,000 persons , and 75 per cent of these expenditures are refunded.
