 | SEEING something which is a closed book to the greater part of mankind is apt to give one a superiority complex . When travelers meet and relate their experiences each takes a savage delight in dwelling on the excellence of those parts of the earth with which his fellow is unacquainted . In this way , I derive infinite pleasure from telling my friends that Nepal is the most wonderful country in the world because I 'm pretty certain that they never will go there ! And , incidentally , even if they do , I 'm not at all sure that they wo n't whole-heartedly agree with me . Nepal is remarkable in a number of ways . It can boast of unrivaled natural scenery , of the highest and most fascinating mountains ; of unique architectural monuments ; of an immense army quite out of proportion to the population ; of an excellent and enlightened system of government which brings peace and prosperity to the little Kingdom . VISITED BY A " CHOSEN FEW " Even the chosen few who gain access to Nepal may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the frontier of India ( see map , page 323 ) . The most agreeable way of reaching Raxaul is by way of Patna , the ancient capital of Asoka . From here the pious Buddhist emperor himself set out , in 250 B. C. , on his religious pilgrimage to Nepal and other sacred strongholds of his faith . At Patna you board a paddle boat and cruise five or six miles up the Ganges ? the distance varies according to the height of the river ? and get into a waiting train on the other side . Next morning you wake up in Raxaul . On one side lie the unbroken acres of the Bihar rice fields , yellowing beneath the sun ; on the other lie more rice fields , in the sequestered Kingdom . You strain your eyes toward the eastern horizon and dimly perceive a dark green belt . This flat , low-lying tract of cultivation and jungle , lying between the Himalayan foothills and the border of Bihar , and stretching 200 miles from east to west , is known as the Tarai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is infested with a deadly malarial fever . Thus the stray visitor to Nepal wisely confines his visit to the winter . Beyond the Tarai again rise huge shadowy forms , the Himalayas hiding in the morning mist . Then ensues the inevitable argument with your neighbor as to whether a certain white object is Mount Everest or merely a deceitful cloud . RICE FIELDS AND JUNGLES From Raxaul , a little meter-gauge train sets off across the Tarai . For the first mile the railroad leads through the main street of the city , with shop and house fronts on either side . Then it comes out into the open rice fields and so into the tiger- and rhino-haunted jungles beyond . And what jungles ! Halfway through them our train drew up , we all got out , clambered onto the backs of waiting elephants , and padded silently off into the mysterious depths . The jungles of the Nepal Tarai are subtropical and consist chiefly of sal trees with long , thin black trunks , and huge leaves starting very near the base . Here and there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward , stately and erect . Festoons of creepers hang from tree to tree . The most common variety has magnificent velvety leaves , large and round like soup plates of palest green celadon . In the lower regions stocky little banana palms flourish , and wild ginger , with brilliant crimson fruits . All this thriving growth is interrupted in certain places by the passage of wide river beds . These have long been destitute of water , and their barren white sands and smooth round pebbles contrast strangely with the luxuriant vegetation on either side . A NOVEL TIGER HUNT A tiger shoot in Nepal is conducted on novel lines : the tiger is attracted to a kill and is then surrounded by a ring of elephants . Slowly the ring closes in until the angry beast , well aware of what is going on , charges . As the undergrowth is very thick , and by no means all the elephants carry armed men , he has a fair chance of escape . On our shoot we rode some two miles from the train to the kill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | Lurking somewhere within that wide circle was the tiger . The huge animals upon which we sat moved stealthily forward . I looked down the line of the waving trunks and swishing tails : there was not another howdah elephant , carrying rifles , for a hundred yards . Perhaps the wily creature we sought would break through the intervening , unarmed ranks ? But I had little time to consider this possibility . From a neighboring clump of banana palms came a series of snarls , and before I quite realized what was happening a huge bristling mass of black and yellow was hurtling toward us . It is a wonderful thing , the charge of an angry tiger ? the break from cover in a crash of thunder , the mighty bounds toward the foe , the gleaming teeth , the flaming eyes , and roars of savage hate . My companion fired once , and the elephants turned with one accord , for none will face a charge ; twice , and the tiger turned with a bitter snarl which subsided into a last groan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of a little gully . CHILDREN FED TIGER MEAT There ensued a terrific hullabaloo : mahouts remonstrating with their charges for displaying so much cowardice , shikaris shouting with delight , beaters breaking off branches to poke the victim and make certain that not a spark of life remained . Then some of the men knelt down by the warm body and spread five or six large sal leaves with fresh blood in honor of their goddess , Kali . Many jungle folk feed their children tiger meat to make them brave and strong ! After two days ' shooting in the Tarai , we pushed on to the railway terminus . Amlekhganj . From here we continued the journey toward Katmandu , the capital of Nepal , by motor . Some thirty miles of narrow but excellent road lead through wooded foothills to Bhimphedi , where the ascent of the first mountain pass begins . Here ponies and dandis take the place of cars ( page 324 ) . There are two different types of dandi : one is a wooden chair with  | leather cushions , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you can lie full length . Both are carried by teams of six coolies in brightblue cotton uniforms . So long as the coolies walk , the dandi is a delight to ride in ; but when they start to run , as they usually do downhill , none but the strongest constitution can remain undisturbed . Ponies are by far the most agreeable means of conveyance . They are not bred in Nepal , but are all imported from Tibet , and they scramble up and down the steepest hills like so many monkeys . Two miles from Bhimphedi lies the little mountain village of Sisagarhi , where travelers customarily spend the night . The village is complete with its garrison of Gurkhas ? a foretaste of the tremendous military power active within the Kingdom . After rising early at Sisagarhi we climbed the few remaining feet which led to the top of the first pass , approximately 8,000 feet high . Directly below us lay a smiling valley , while beyond it a turbulent mountain ocean rose and fell in colossal waves of sunlight and shadow ; far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glistening white horses of the eternal snows . Then the descent began . The path was no longer smooth ; it was exceedingly steep and incredibly rough . It consisted principally of solid rock and along its jagged surface large loose bowlders were strewn at random . Slowly , and with many tortuous turns , it made its painful way down into the valley . For the next six miles we rode through flourishing fields of brown-headed buckwheat , golden mustard , and ripening rice . The snows were no longer visible and the sun shone brightly overhead . Near the various villages kind-hearted women had placed brass vessels full of water and flowers by the wayside , a thoughtful attention for the traveler . COLORFUL PEASANT HOMES The dwellings of the Nepalese peasants are usually two-story buildings of brick , with wooden balconies and thatched or tiled roofs . The walls are plastered over with ruddy-orange clay , producing a charming  | color effect , especially when the houses stand among the mustard and rice . The path eventually left the fields to rise and fall over rolling grassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandragiri Pass . From below , the road before us resembled the sheer wall of a precipice ; but our ponies made light of it . CLIMB LIKE RODEO RIDING Without a moment 's hesitation they charged forward , literally ran up the rough rock , and scrambled with surpassing agility over the huge bowlders . Not only did they carry wonder-struck riders clinging to their shaggy manes for dear life , but they also pulled along the full weight of their grooms , who hung on to their long , thick tails be-@# hind ! My admiration for Tibetan horseflesh knows no bounds . The view from the top of the Chandragiri Pass is so amazing that you can not afterwards believe it exists . Below lies the circular rice-clad valley of Katmandu , bathed in the orange glow of the evening sun . Rising out of it , away to the right , in a medley of miniature pagodas , palaces , and towers , is the magnificent capital city . Surrounding it , in a black and purple wall , are the mighty mountain guardians . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I try to penetrate the misty white banks which clustered around the rocky heights . Sadly I abandoned hope and looked up into the sky to see if the young moon had risen . It 324 THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE  | was difficult to believe what I saw . There , in all their glittering splendor , were the Himalayan giants , leaping to fantastic heights above the clouds . ON THE ROOF OF THE WORLD I stood transfixed at the top of an 8,000-foot pass , gazing at the highest mountains in the world . Another hair-raising path , also beset with bowlders , dropped 4,000 feet down into the valley . Arrived at the bottom , we got into cars and motored the remaining seven miles into Katmandu. * The capital city is a curious mixture of new and old . It centers around the immense parade ground , a beautiful two-mile stretch of closely cropped grass . Broadly speaking , the old part of the city lies to the west of this Maidan , the new part to the east . Before the Gurkha conquest in 1768 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newar . The Newars are of Mongolian extraction and emigrated into Nepal from Tibet in prehistoric times . They are responsible for the origin and development of @#   Nepalese art in all its branches ( page 349 ) . " Gurkha " is really a comprehensive term , embracing both the foreign Rajputs and the indigenous races of Nepal other than the Newar . It comes from the little State of that name in western Nepal , where the immigrant Rajputs from the plains of India originally settled . These Rajputs , ancestors of the present rulers of the kingdom , fled to the hills after the Moslem sack of Chitor in 1303 . Here they established themselves , flourished , and gradually extended their territories . It was not until 1768 , however , that they finally effected the complete conquest of Nepal . Thenceforth the Rajputs held undisputed sway over this unique Himalayan Kingdom . Internally , their activities have been directed not so much towards artistic as towards military advancement . Out of a total population of some 5,600,000 , they have to-day an army of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of their well-trained reserve force , raise as many as 70,000 troops ( see pages 339 , 347 ) . ART AND THE ARMY The bulk of the soldiery is drawn from the Gurung and Magar tribes . Among these peoples are some of the hardiest fighting men in existence . When , therefore , they are placed under Rajput leaders , the descendants of an ancient race , worldfamous for its deeds of courage and chivalry 328 THE NATIONAL GEG   on the battlefield , the power of this mighty Gurkha army is formidable indeed . In Katmandu , the artistic spirit of the Newars and the martial spirit of the modern rulers mingle . To the west of the vast parade ground lies the old town with its palaces and temples , its tall houses and narrow streets . In the Durbar Square , that essential feature of all Newar cities , the principal buildings are grouped in a rich profusion of pagoda roofs , painted wood , chiseled stone , and shining metal ( see Color Plate V ) . At one side stands the imposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtyard . Close by it , raised on a high step plinth , towers the lofty Temple of Taleju , the household goddess of the Royal Family . All around are temples and shrines and tall , slender pillars bearing bronze statues of kings and religious personalities . The buildings in the indigenous " pagoda " style are of dull-red brick with tiled roofs supported by intricately carved wooden struts . The doors , too , are of wood and the lintels are invariably extended into the brickwork , where they form bold and effective designs . The woodwork is usually painted in bright colors and the roofs are sometimes covered with sheets of beaten brass , dazzling in the brilliant sun . Lost in this maze of old Newar splendor stands the modern Hanuman Dokha , a large white building containing huge audience halls and staterooms used for important ceremonies . To this palace , during a durbar , the scarlet lancers of Nepal come clattering through the cobbled streets of Katmandu . Mounted on big bay horses , they form the bodyguard of the King and the Prime Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Kingdom , in large open carriages . At such times the principal figures in this brilliant procession are arrayed in the full-dress uniform of the Nepalese army ? scarlet coats with priceless headdresses of seed pearls and emeralds . COOLIES CARRY AUTOMOBILES ACROSS MOUNTAINS Beyond the lovely Newar city , grouped around the huge Maidan and stretching away to the east , lies modern Katmandu , the creation of the Gurkhas . Here are no romantic pagodas rising golden tier upon golden tier towards an azure Heaven , but severely practical barracks , schools , col- leges , hospitals , and prisons built in the " European style . " Here , too , are the immense " modern " palaces of the King , the Maharaja and the chief nobles , designed by French architects in the late 19th and early 20th centuries ( see page 339 ) . When one recalls the difficult journey into the valley over steep and wild mountain passes , it seems strange to look upon these vast buildings , standing in so remote a country , equipped with the most up-todate conveniences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and broad , and it is amusing to remember that all the motors and lorries which run on them have been carried bodily over the passes by swarms of coolies ( see page 322 ) . Though Nepal is nominally a Kingdom . the King in reality is little more than a religious figurehead , the actual government of the country falling to the lot of the Prime Minister , or Maharaja . WHY MOVIES ARE BARRED He is modern and enlightened in his outlook and anxious to introduce any new invention which may benefit his country . but prohibits importation of certain Western creations . Foremost among these is the cinema . He believes that to show vivid scenes of intimate occidental life has a demoralizing effect on the spectators . The charming son of the Nepalese envoy to India told me that he once sent his Gurkhali servants to a cinema in Delhi . They came back horrified and exclaimed that the male actors they had seen could not possibly be men ; if they were , then they did not deserve to live . So that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 10 o'clock every evening a curfew tolls in Katmandu and the other big towns of the Kingdom and everybody must retire to his house . Anyone found in the streets after this time has to spend the night in prison . Gambling and drinking are forbidden except during certain festivals . The most popular is the great Durga Puja , which lasts 10 days , during which time hundreds of buffaloes are beheaded in honor of the goddess Durga , who is but another form of the famous black Kali . Besides Katmandu , there are two other large towns in the valley , both former capitals of Nepal . Patan practically adjoins modern Katmandu . Passing through its narrow streets   you come into the fantastic Durbar Square . It was difficult to believe I was in the everyday world . It seemed as if I had been miraculously transported to some other planet and stood in a dream city of surpassing loveliness . On one side , a graceful group of temples rises in a series of elegant red pagodas ribbed with gleaming bronze . Brightly colored struts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; shimmering bell finials cap their airy upper stories . Opposite them , and dotted irregularly over the spacious square , lies a swarm of other temples , a fountain , a colossal bell , and a number of tall , slender pillars bearing the shining bronze figures of gods and kings . The pagoda temples have brightly colored stuffs hanging in gay ripples from their eaves . There are also temples in silvery stone built up in tiers of intricately carved pillars , and pavilions which cluster around the massive curvilinear tower rising from their midst like some huge gray cactus plant . TAKING A LOCAL DIVINITY FOR A RIDE Of the many other temples in Patan , situated outside the transcendentally beautiful Durbar Square , by far the loveliest is that of Machendranath . It stands on the edge of the city in a grass courtyard surrounded by a wall and resthouses for pilgrims . From the midst of the slender eucalyptus trees which shelter the courtyard , it rises in three elegant stories , and from the eaves of its pagoda roofs hang rows of little jingling bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important of all the local divinities . He is the protector of Nepal and is said to appear to the rulers of the country in times of national crisis . His festival , the Machendra-jatra , is a popular annual event , for it is then that he brings rain to thirsting crops . He is taken out , in June , in his elaborate chariot with its 25-foot beam ( formerly , no one in Patan might have a house taller than this beam ! ) and exposed to the adoring populace . He is worshiped both by Buddhist and Hindu . If the rains have not previously broken , they are bound to come at his festival , and when they do , they are not looked upon as a miracle . They are in the special charge of the god , and it is his bounden duty to bring them to his people at the appointed time . Another important deity in Nepal is Manjusri . He is not of local origin , but STERED KINGDOM 337 came from China , where he dwelt on the mountain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Katmandu was a huge circular lake . He came , carrying in his right hand a shining sword curved like the smile of the moon . With this wondrous weapon he struck the mountains surrounding the great lake and formed a channel through which the waters flowed . To this day the cleft in the mountains is called the " kot-bar " ( sword-cut ) and the sacred Bagmati River flows through it , draining the fertile valley ( see page 341 ) . Manjusri was a Bodhisattva and is in reality , therefore , a Buddhist divinity . He is worshiped in China and Tibet as well as in Nepal , but in the latter country he is venerated equally by the Hindus . The third large town in the valley is Bhatgaon . It can be approached from Patan by motor over a bad , uneven road , a distance of some seven miles . Far the most delightful way to enter it , however , is on the back of an ambling Tibetan pony . In the early 18th century the city was the capital of Raja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron of the arts . It was he who built the stately Durbar Hall with its famous Golden Door ? one of the chief marvels of Nepal ? and its richly carved windows ( see Color Plate II ) . In the square opposite this door , on the top of a tall stone pillar , his statue reposes in bronze , in the attitude of a religious devotee . Beyond the statue hangs the brass bell used in former times to assemble the people before the palace ( see page 340 ) . A CITY OF SURPRISES Bhatgaon is a city of surprises . Unlike Patan , its beauty is not concentrated in one colossal and breath-taking durbar square ; it is distributed throughout the length and breadth of the town . Here you come upon a little temple of silver stone , set gracefully upon a high step plinth , with an avenue of gods and monsters leading up to its portals . There you walk through a blue wooden door in a crumbling , pink brick wall and lo ! you are in a wild , tangled garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the center a flourishing crop of rice tended by a group of smiling peasants ! Beyond the garden you pass down fascinating little streets of shops and houses with carved windows and suddenly you find yourself in an open square . On your right  | stands another architectural marvel of Nepal , the Temple of the Five Stages . This famous building was erected and is thought to have been actually designed by Raja Bhupatindra Malla A. D. 1700 . So high was the King 's enthusiasm that he brought bricks to the site with his own hands . His subjects quickly followed the royal example and within five days sufficient material was collected for the entire temple ! As it stands today , it is one of the best proportioned and most beautiful buildings in the East . It is raised on a five-step plinth of pale brick , with the customary avenue of gods and beasts leading up to the main portals ( see page 344 ) . On the lowest step kneel the deified Rajput heroes , Jaimal and Patta , who have ten times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two elephants , with ten times the strength of the former ; on the third two lions , ten times as strong as the elephants ; on the fourth two griffins , ten times as strong as the lions , and on the fifth and last step two goddesses , Singhini and Baghini , reputed to be the most powerful of all ! Beyond these omnipotent deities rises the temple proper ? five stories of pagoda roofs clear-cut against an azure sky , each successive pagoda , of brownish-red tiles , a little smaller than the one below it , and the fifth crowned with a bell finial of bronze , glowing like bottled sunlight . By a curious but typical oriental inconsistency this marvelously beautiful temple which should surely house the chief god of the Kingdom ? is today unoccupied . It was originally intended as a shrine for a secret Tantric divinity , but now stands empty . although it is locally regarded as sacred to the Bhairavas , the attendants of Bhairava ( the terrible form of Siva ) and Kali . TEMPLES BARRED TO EUROPEANS No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no great loss because , as can be gathered from half-open doorways . the interior is always dark ( there are no windows ) and devoid of any carving or decoration . The ground floor contains the  | image of the principal deity , while the upper stories either enshrine lesser deities or are simply used as temple granaries . Ladders lead from one story to another ; the staircase was unknown to the Newari architect . After the three large cities of the valley , Katmandu , Patan , and Bhatgaon , the next in size and interest ? to some the first in importance ? is Pashpati , the Benares of Nepal . The place is named for Siva , who once visited Nepal in the form of a gazelle and announced that he wished henceforth to be worshiped there as " Pacu-Pati , " Lord of Animals . It is here , on the banks of the sacred Bagmati River , which flows past the city through a narrow gorge , that the bodies of pious Hindus are burnt and their ashes are cast on the waters ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public burning ghats ; downstream lie the royal ghats confined to the King 's and the Maharaja 's families . Broad flights of steep stone steps lead down to the water 's edge from the myriad temples and memorial shrines which cluster along both banks . But the whole city is dominated by the bright gilt roofs of the two-storied temple of Pashpatinath ? the holiest in all Nepal ( see page 327 ) . The sanctity of this shrine is so great that in 1600 A. D. the Newari queen , Ganga Rani , had a rope tied to the bronze bell finial . This rope was nearly two miles in length and the other end was attached to the Queen 's palace in Katmandu . In 1829 Raja Vikram Sah brought an offering of 125,000 oranges to Pashpati , all of which were piled in the courtyard around the temple ! Hinduism in Nepal is closely allied to the northern school of Buddhism and they flourish side by side . It is not unusual to come across a statue in a temple courtyard which is worshiped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devil dancing is much practiced by the Buddhists , the dances and masques resembling those of Tibet . The Hindus also have special religious dances with masques and headdresses peculiar to Nepal . The most popular dance is that in which the Hindu Trinity is presented in its female aspect . The three forces continually active  | in the world are personified by Sarasvatt the Creator , Lakshmi the Preserver , and Kali the Destroyer . The parts of these goddesses are not played by temple dancing girls , but by male performers . Other participants in the dance are Kali 's attendants , the Bhairavas ; Lakshmi 's lion ? a fine , shaggy , pantomime beast ; and the peacock of Sarasvati . A comic element is introduced in the form of a clown who wears a topi and pretends to be a European ! ( See opposite page . ) THE GOD WHO SEVERED A MOUNTAIN To Buddhists , the most sacred place of pilgrimage in Nepal is Swayambhunath . In the far-off days , when the valley of Katmandu was a lake , Vipasya , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water plants grew therein , but not the sacred lotus . So he took a lotus root , blessed it , and threw it into the water , prophesying that when the root produced a flower , Swayambhu , the Self-Existent , would leap from it in the form of a flame and the lake would be transformed into a fertile and populous country . Accordingly , through the blessing of Swayambhu , the Bodhisattva Manjusri eventually came to the valley and drained the lake through the cleft in the mountains which he cut with his sword ( see text , page 337 ) . The stupa at Swayambhunath was raised on the site of the miraculous lotus planted by Vipasya . Originally built in the third century B. C. , it frequently has been enlarged and restored , because of its great sanctity . It stands on the summit of a hill which rises some 300 feet above the plain . To reach it , you have to climb a seemingly interminable flight of steps guarded by statues of the five Dhyani Buddhas . The present stupa consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white plaster . It is crowned 352 THE NATIONAL GE &;  | by a bronze tower with a square base supporting 13 disks symbolizing the 13 Bodhisattva heavens . On the four faces of the square base a pair of narrow piercing eyes is painted , symbolizing the omniscience of Buddha . The question mark below the eyes is the artist 's convention for a nose . The stone-paved courtyard surrounding the great stupa is littered with smaller relic stupas containing the ashes of various lamas and monks . Scampering about among them are dozens of brown monkeys which are fed by pilgrims and , not always satisfied with what they are so charitably given , steal the rice and other food offerings laid before the several images of Buddha . THE GODDESS OF SMALLPOX Near the great stupa is located the little two-storied Hindu Temple of Hariti ( Sitala ) , the Goddess of Smallpox a further proof of the close relationship existing between the Hindu and Buddhist faiths in Nepal . In the courtyard is the colossal bronze Thunderbolt ( V a jra ) , the emblem of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base ( dhatu mandal ) , divided into 12 panels , each containing an animal symbolical of one of the 12 months of the Tibetan year . Next in sanctity and importance to Swayambhunath is the amazingly beautiful stupa of Boddhnath . It is said to have been built shortly before the Christian era by a parricide king in expiation of his sin . It rises , in a hemisphere of snowy plaster , out of rich fields of brown buckwheat . The omniscient eyes gaze across the valley from the four faces of its bronze loran ; the thirteen Bodhisattva heavens rise in a gleaming pyramid of 13 steps crowned by an elaborate umbrella , the insignia of royalty . A STUPA OF 108 PRAYER WHEELS Around the base of the hemisphere runs a continuous line of 108 niches containing different incarnations of Buddha . The stupa stands on a fine brick three-step plinth enclosed within a circular wall . On the outer face of this wall there are oblong recesses containing in all 108 prayer wheels ! In the courtyard around the central stupa stand several small ones erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we visited Boddhnath we were shown around by the Chini Lama , so-called because he knows Chinese and acts as inter-I preter and scribe in negotiations between China and Nepal . He was a small man , a Tibetan by birth , and he wore a beautiful dark-red brocade robe lined with pervenche blue ; beneath this his feet appeared , clad in smart yellow brogues with crepe-rubber soles ( see Color Plate VII ) . The Chini Lama adopted certain European customs when he went to Calcutta University . He spoke fairly fluent English with a peculiar syntax , and he told us many interesting things . Once every twelve years . in February , water gushes from the base of the Boddhnath Stupa . This is looked upon as sacred nectar and pilgrims come from afar to drink the sanctifying stream . Before they may approach it , however , the Chini Lama comes forward and bottles some of the water , which he subsequently sends to the Dalai Lama in Lhasa . There are other places of interest and beauty in this enchanted Himalayan valley : the lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katmandu ; the Vaishnava temple of Changunarayan ; the little town of Kirtipur ? a book would be necessary to describe them all . WHERE THE BUY-A-BALE MOVEMENT WOULD PROSPER In strange contrast to the gloomy Indian peasant , the village dweller of Nepal is a happy , smiling individual with a true Mongolian joy in living . The women wear gay skirts of painted cotton stuff , mostly procured from India and Japan , with yards of plain material wrapped around their waists for belts ( page 322 ) . Many of them like wearing simple black shirts with strings of scarlet beads about their necks . The men wear cotton jodhpurs ( though their legs are bare when they work on the land ) and brown or peach-colored smocks. with the same bulky belts as the women . Members of the martial tribes from whom the Gurkhas are recruited tuck kukris , the famous Gurkha daggers , into the voluminous folds of these belts ( page 347 ) .
