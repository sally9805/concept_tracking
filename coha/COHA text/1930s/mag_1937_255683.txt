Just after one midnight last week Sheriff Louis Corbitt of Henry County , Ala. and Jailer J. N. Corbitt. his father , asleep in their first-floor bedrooms below the rooms at Abbeville that serve as county jail , were awakened by a great racket outside . Before they could get up to investigate , a mob of 50 armed farmers burst in , ordered them to stay where they were . As sheriff and jailer sat abed looking sleepy-eyed into grim Henry County faces , part of the mob marched upstairs , broke into the jail . Going straight to the bullpen occupied by six cowering blackamoors , they broke into it with a crowbar . From it they dragged strapping 18-year-old Wes Johnson , itinerant Henry County farm laborer , who had been arrested day before for raping the young wife of a farmer at Tumbleton , 22 mi. away . <P> With Negro Johnson in tow the mob stomped out , drove off toward Tumbleton in 25 automobiles . After day broke City Editor Joseph David ( " Red " ) Brown of the Dothan Eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found near the Tumbleton farm home of Rupert Bond in which the alleged attack had taken place . Editor Brown grabbed his camera and dashed off for Tumbleton . There on the brink of a sparsely wooded ravine , 50 yd. from Farmer Bond 's house , he found the bullet-riddled body of Negro Johnson . Tight-lipped farmers , who seemed to be awaiting his arrival , obligingly took hold of a rope that was tightly looped around the neck , hoisted the body high over the limb of a tree so that Editor Brown could make a more vivid camera record of 1937 's No. 1 lynching. * At last week 's end Henry County was buzzing with excitement . A special grand jury , on orders of Governor Bibb Graves , began taking testimony . Sheriff Corbitt , threatened with impeachment by Governor Graves , was quoted as saying he could and would name the owners of no less than 15 of the faces his sleepy eyes recognized in his bedroom . Nevertheless , the grand jury did not indict after hearing Sheriff Corbitt 's testimony . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
