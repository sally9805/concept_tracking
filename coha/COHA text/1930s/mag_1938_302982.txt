Many a European thought this week that Adolf Hitler had forced Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden out of the British Cabinet by a brutally successful maneuver ( see p. 19 ) only to be compared with Kaiser Wilhelm 's historic humiliation of the French in 1905 when he forced them to drop Delcasse from their Cabinet . <P> Ever since he became Prime Minister , businesslike Neville Chamberlain has shown he meant to clean up what he considers the mess his predecessor Stanley-Baldwin made of British foreign policy . It was Stanley Baldwin 's idea in 1935 to equip Great Britain in effect with two foreign secretaries : 1 ) a popular young idealist who could win pacifist votes for the Conservative Party ; and 2 ) a veteran statesman who could unobtrusively do such dirty work in foreign policy as might be necessary . He appointed handsome young Anthony Eden to the completely new office of Secretary for League of Nations Affairs and put in Sir Samuel Hoare as Foreign Secretary . <P> Mr. Eden , quickly popularized as a sort of League of Nations Knight-in-Shining-Armor. was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next General Election . Meanwhile , Sir Samuel Hoare and French Premier Pierre Laval were privately engaged on a deal to condone Italy 's seizure of Ethiopia . The Hoare-Laval " Deal " leaked into the news a few days before its makers were ready to present it to the public as a high-minded effort to make peace on the basis of joint Anglo-French-Italian " carrying of Civilization to the barbarians of Ethiopia . " It made such an ugly scandal that Mr. Baldwin had to take it all back in the House of Commons ; Sir Samuel Hoare sat with tears trickling down his cheeks ; Mr. Eden was made Foreign Secretary ; and within a few weeks many a hard-headed London businessman was saying , " Hoare was absolutely right . " One of those hard-headed businessmen was Neville Chamberlain , then Chancellor of the Exchequer . <P> Downing Street . Last week Mr. Chamberlain invited to No. 10 Downing Street the Italian Ambassador , spade-bearded Count Dino Grandi , and in Mr. Eden 's presence himself made , as Prime Minister , opening moves for quickly closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's conquest of Ethiopia and sending of troops to Spain . Mr. Eden was thus subjected by the head of the House of Chamberlain to acute personal humiliation . Saturday and Sunday , for the first time since the Abdication Crisis there were meetings of the British Cabinet . A patient , drably-dressed crowd almost filled the short blind alley called Downing Street , shouting : " Good old Eden ! No more Italy ! Down with Musso ! " Members of the Cabinet , including Mr. Eden , came &; went repeatedly without taking more than the merest notice of the crowd before the official residence of the Prime Minister . Even after Hero Eden had actually handed in his letter of resignation , he only raised his black Homburg hat once or twice , diffidently . To a few friends waiting for him on the steps of the Foreign Office , Anthony Eden said : " It 's all over . " <P> Next morning 's papers carried the Eden letter of resignation , addressed to " My Dear Prime Minister , " giving his reason : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not in agreement . " In a letter to " My Dear Anthony " Chamberlain accepted it .
