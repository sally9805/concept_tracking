HE GAVE HIM A STONE A STORY BY CHARLES W. FERGUSON HE old man was dying like a tree . I The form and substance of him remained and he still somehow seemed to tower even as he lay against the pillow , but the foliage was gone , and Stan saw him more clearly  --  as if he were limned against a winter sky  --  than he had seen him in life . It 's a pity , he reflected , that we never know a person until we see him die . Pose deserts the dying and aggressiveness the living in such an hour and spirits seem like bodies  --  substantial and real . He grasped the foot of the bed to steady himself and , from the coldness of hospital steel , he knew that his hands were sticky and hot . Behind him the door opened , letting in the muffled sounds of the corridor , then the nurse in her protective stiffness swept past him with that air which the functionaries of death have , showing that they are not in the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers and then straightened them and said , " He 's sleeping . " Stan nodded . His resentment of her intrusion brought him back to the world of the flesh again and he was aware of other intrusions : an ambulance siren screaming like a loon in the distance , that peculiar stench of antiseptics , that odor of artificial purity which permeates a hospital , and the rattle of dishes being cleared outside the door . It seemed intolerable to him that the normal processes of life , of eating and mating , should be going on in this instant as always . There should be some respectful adjournment of destiny for the event of the death of one as great as his father . The nurse sat down by the side of the bed and folded her hands . It was not as though she were keeping vigil but as though she were waiting for a train . " He 's been a good patient , " she said in a sort of irritating undertone . " One of the best . Oh , he 's had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me exactly . Just in general . But I 'm used to it . I remember Senator King-solving . He was one of our patients . Do you remember him ? " But , like Pilate , she would not stay for an answer . " I remember the night he died . Of course we 'd been expecting it for some time , but he just would n't let go , it seemed . Seemed to be waiting around for something or other . Well , one day I think he kind of made up his mind he 'd pass on . They all do that , you know . That is , the ones that are any account . There just comes a time when they seem to say , ' Well , I must be going . ' And that night it was like that . I came on at seven and I could see the Senator was about to make up his mind . You can always tell . " Well , what do you suppose he wanted ? A thirty-piece orchestra in his room ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reason he hated dying was that he was afraid he would n't hear any more good music . Of course we could n't jam an orchestra into a room like this and we tried to humor him with a radio . Did that make him rave ! So , along about two he got so mad he died . That 's the time most of them go , you know . " She glanced at her watch and Stan , brought to action by this last effrontery , managed to speak . " I 'd like to be alone with my father for a while . " " Oh , do n't mind me , " she said airily . " But I do . Would you go ? " " You ca n't talk to him . " " That 's my worry . Would you greatly mind going ? " " Not in the least if that 's the way you feel . " She gathered up a book from the table and started toward the door . " I 'll come back now and then just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't do that . Ili ring if 1 need you . Please go . " She went out and closed the door . Stan felt for a lock . There was none and he pulled a chair against it . He sat down in the chair the nurse had left , putting it where he could study his father 's face . He thought he detected the trace of a smile about his mouth and then the old man opened his eyes slowly and winked at him . Stan got up and took his father 's hand in both of his . He had forgotten , as he realized now in the feebleness of the old man 's grasp and in the childlike affection with which he let the hand linger in his son 's , how rough and cracked it was . " I thought you were asleep , " Stan said . " I probably was until she came in . Then I always pretend I am . If she comes back in I 'll die . " " We 'll both throw her out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man shook his head wearily . " I 've complained to the management but they merely think I 'm crotchety . That 's what comes of a bad reputation . " He seemed to dismiss the matter with a shrug of his face and then he studied his son . " When did you dock ? " " At noon . I caught a plane from New-ark . " " I do n't think there was that much of a rush . " " No , I did n't either , Dad . But , you see , I 've wasted a lot of years  --  you and I both  --  and 1 wanted to have what was left . " His father appeared to consider this . " That 's why you came ? " " Yes . " " Not out of respect ? " " I never thought of respect . I 've always respected you and it 's been natural . But I would never have thought of coming out of respect . There was another impulse this time . I thought we might renew our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply . He turned his head away slightly but he did not release his son 's hand . There came an immense silence between them , something more than the absence of sound . Neither spoke , yet it was as if the two were talking under their breath , so to say , and both were aware of it . And as they talked , not audibly , the present seemed to recede and time reversed itself , so that each exchange of ideas took them farther from the moment and progressively toward the son 's earliest memory . Stan could not keep from his mind the memory of his last meeting with his father  --  a meeting so reminiscent of others that it served to span years of their association . The old man had looked harried and he had seemed to be talking with a business colleague , an employee at best . " I 've every confidence you can handle that English sale , son , " he had said . " Cable if you need me  --  no , do n't cable . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's one thing I 've taught you . You can face what you 're up against without flying to me with your troubles . You 'll be glad of that one day . " Now his father had not asked about English sales . Stan wanted to tell him but he dared not break the silence in which they met . Besides , his father told him in that silence that such matters , English or otherwise , no longer concerned him . There was another time before that and they were talking about it now . It was after Stan had left college and had gone to work in the plant and his father had told him that there would be no favorites in his plant and , with his eternal gospel of self-reliance , he had seemed a stranger . And Stan had looked on this man who was his father and had felt the affection of his youth ebbing from him and in its place flowing a new zest and a new determination to retain the confidence which his father had placed in him . But these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of exposure . The past suddenly became a corridor and they were walking along it together , pausing now and again to gaze at pictures on the wall , but led on toward a light at the end . This light shone upon a picture which both of them knew , for it had the freshness of the present  --  not of the moment but of the eternal present . A boy lay on a bed in a room that was only dimly lighted . Now and then his head moved uneasily from side to side and his hand , which lay in the hand of a man who sat by the bed , was dry and hot . " Tell me a story , Dad , " the boy said , and he clasped the hand of the man more firmly as if to steady himself in his faintness . Then the man , whose hand was rough and cracked and yet somehow tender , told him a story . It was the story of a boy who went out into a field and picked up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it to his father  --  so the story ran  --  and the father told him what the stone contained . The first time the story had been told , the stone became transformed into a magic palace where there were treasures and things to eat and games and exciting toys . Each time the story was repeated the stone had something different in it or something more . This night , when the boy lay sick , the stone contained potions and herbs and elixirs which would bring him back to health . So his father had told him . Stan remembered the story well . Of all the dozens of variations , this one had appealed to him most ; for that night his perceptions , sharpened by the fever , fastened avidly upon its essential details . He thought of the story now as , in thesilence which bound them , the father seemed to be telling it to him again . Words had been whirling through the spaces of his mind without fixed orbit of late . . . " the child is father to the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a peculiar , a special meaning for him . The father who had once heartened him as a child now lay helpless and pathetic on the bed before him . His father 's hand , which was as clear in his memory as it was now in his possession , had relaxed somewhat its grasp . His father spoke again . " Tell me ? " he began . Stan leaned closer to him . There was a haze between them now , as if his father had begun to recede as a figure in a dream . His eyes had a strange intensity , dreadful because the voice of his father had suddenly grown weak until it seemed to be that of another  --  a child 's . " Tell me  --  a story . " Stan felt a shiver run through his body . His father must be delirious . The rally he had made in order to face his son had worn heavily upon his strength . Stan could almost feel his father sinking away from him . He took the rough hand more firmly and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried by his grasp and by hypnotism to hold him a while longer . A story ... He could think of only one story . He was scarcely aware of the sound of his own voice as he began and it seemed to come from a great distance , so that he was not sure that it was audible . " Once , " he began , " a man went out into a field . The man was dreaming of a life he had spent , and he reached down half-consciously and picked up a stone . It was a small stone , but as he dreamed it became large in his hands , and soon it was no longer in his hands but stood by his side as a solid and lovely palace . " Startled at first , the man went into the palace , which was lovely in its appointments and rich in furnishing . He approached a Iong stair which led toagallery above and as he did so a great troop of boys and girls came to meet him , shouting happily . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and their shouts of joy and friendliness made the palace ring . " But this was not all , for there were other friends  --  some of them prosperous , some bedraggled , and they greeted him with strong handclasps and repeated the pledge of their devotion to him . And all about there were evidences of men and women and children who were well-fed and eager and it was like a great homecoming to the man  --  a festive occasion on which all he had befriended were back again . " At last , out of the crowd , there came to meet him one he loved above all the rest ? a boy who changed into a man before his eyes . At first the man was startled , for the boy he saw was weak and the man that this boy became was strong . And the man seemed content , for it was this visionof a son , once weak but now self-reliant and ready to carry on his work , that he had wanted most to find . " Stan felt his father 's grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released him and the hand lay open on the bed . " If you do n't mind , " his father said feebly , " I 'll just take that stone with me . " Stan placed a worn imaginary stone in his father 's hand and the fingers closed upon it . His father seemed to hold his breath , reluctant to let the spirit go from his body . When he did release his breath it was with an immense sigh that seemed to collapse his whole frame . For a while Stan looked with tearless eyes upon his father 's face . Then he pressed the button which would summon the nurse , removed the chair from in front of the door , and went out .
