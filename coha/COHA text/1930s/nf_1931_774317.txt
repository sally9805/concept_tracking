It will not be long before they will not shut tight and this will lead to dripping of water which may discolor the enameled surface of the lavatory , tub , or sink . If the home-owner tries to save money in buying cheap traps , he will find himself defeated in a few years when the traps begin to corrode and rust away . Cheap t raps are made of thin metal that will not long resist corrosion . Doubling the thickness of the metal from which the trap is made will triple or quadruple resistance to corrosion . Furthermore , many cheap traps have joints which are similarly short lived . A word more should be said on the subject of traps . A trap is a device or pipe bend under the lavatory , sink , or other fixture , with or without enlargement , which retains a sufficient quantity of the water that passes through it to prevent the passage of foul air back through the pipe and into the room . There are many kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drum trap are in most common use . The water standing in the trap is called a seal . It is effective when the water is deep enough to close the pipe entirely and thus prevent the passage of air from the drainage system back into the house . If it stands lower , space is left above the water for the passage of foul air back through the pipe , and the seal is " broken . " Under no circumstances should a sink , lavatory , bathtub , or laundry tub be installed without a trap . If the trap is omitted , sewer gas will fill the house . While doctors no longer regard sewer gas as the grave menace to health that it was thought to be 25 years ago , still the fact remains that sewer gasis vitiated air and , if breathed continually , will have an injurious effect on health . Neither is it true , as was formerly believed , that sewer air contains , to a dangerous extent , the germs which cause diphtheria , typhoid , and many intestinal diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from drains and sewers is extremely slight . It will , however , slowly and insidiously cause a general languor , which incapacitates for sustained effort . However , as indicated above , if the home-owner has purchased good fixtures he will have good traps , and good traps will not allow sewer gas to get into his house . Fixtures that have their traps properly vented will also discharge the waste water much faster and quieter than those that are not vented properly . If the joints that connect the piping used in plumbing installation are properly made , the life of the installation will be greatly in-  | creased . It is not uncommon to see houses in which the walls of the room below the bathroom have been ruined by a leaky joint . Unquestionably the material used and the workmanship in such installation was not of standard quality . The home-owner should never be satisfied with anything less than pipes of standard quality purchased from a master plumber of unquestionable reputation . While the bugbear of sewer gas has been largely dispelled by increased scientific knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in soil pipes . Leaking pipes , whether supply or waste pipes , are common causes for dampness in a house , and dampness is one of the worst possible defects in the home . Properly-designed fixtures will eliminate another danger : They will not allow the waste water to contaminate the fresh water supply ? a serious and deadly menace . The purchase of good plumbing pays big dividends in comfort , convenience , health , and pride of ownership . When fixtures of good quality are bought , the total cost of the plumbing fixtures and installation is only 9.9 per cent of the total cost of the home . The first cost is the last cost . If the fixtures are not wisely bought , however , they will sooner or later break down under the strain of daily use and then there will be the cost and inconvenience of repairs . Furthermore , the home with the good plumbing fixtures has that greatest of all assets ? complete sanitation . The prediction has been made that not many years will pass before purchasers will demand not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certificate of sanitation ? a certificate that will leave no room for doubt that the plumbing equipment will protect th ( family . PROGRESS IN FIXTURE DESIGN AND MATERIALS Extensive progress has been made in the use of materials for plumbing fixtures and equipment . Sanitation doubtless is the greatest consideration but comfort , labor-saving , and attractiveness are others of importance . Vitreous china is most desirable for wash bowls and the most sanitary for toilets . However , enameled iron is frequently used for both tubs and bowl 's . The unit faucet , which mixes hot and cold water , is a convenience and most satisfactory for the kitchen . Chromium-plated faucets , although more expensive , will save energy spent in the care of fixtures , and they are also attractive . Acid-proof enamelware is a worth-while con-  | consideration for the kitchen sink where stains are common from fruits and vegetables . Built-in bathtubs and pedestal bowls for the bathroom are an advance over the old types . Color in fixtures has been introduced during the past few years . The choice of color is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selection of color shoald be such that will harmonize well with a number of other colors in order that changes in color schemes , particularly the color of walls , may not be handicapped or become too difficult . FAUCETS ' BY NORMAN J. RADDER Plumbing and Heating Industries Bureau Freedom from repairs ? this is the ideal toward which the plumbing brass industry has been striving . Designers have done their utmost to attain simplicity and efficiency in the mechanical parts of the faucet . A leak in a faucet starts when the faucet begins to drip . Hence , faucet engineers began their task of improving the faucet with a study of what causes faucets to drip , and therefore devoted their attention particularly to an improvement and a strengthening of those parts of the faucet involved in this problem . Out of this research have come numerous improvements in faucet seats , in the composition of the material out of which faucet washers are made , in the mechanism for bringing the washer down on the seat , etc . There is only one thing with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the abuse of the faucet by the person using it . A faucet is abused when it is not completely turned off and allowed to drip . The action of the water cuts the seat and wears crevices in it just as a tiny stream trickling through a dike will wear a hole which will assume dangerous proportions . Another common abuse of the faucet is the application of too much pressure in closing it . This , too , damages the washer and seat and has a tendency to throw the mechanism out of line . Obviously , a faucet is only as good as the metal from which it is made . Reputable manufacturers those who sell their products through competent and established master plumbers ? understand the metallurgical problems involved in the manufacture of brass that will stand up under the daily use in the home . Manufacturers who do not hesitate to guarantee their faucets are extremely careful about the brass mixture . In addition to a high copper conAdapted from " Some Facts about Faucets , " Small Home , February , 1931.  | tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machining and insure against sand holes and other similar defects which are often caused by the use of a haphazard mixture . Years ago nickel was the standard plating for faucets . Nickel , however , must be polished frequently in order to maintain its appearance . After years of polishing , nickel loses its luster and eventually all the plating is worn away and the brass shines through . The use of cheap polishing compounds , which are invariably very abrasive , hastens this wearing of the nickel . The polishing necessary to keep nickel is distasteful to the housewife . Thus , for a number of reasons the plumbing industry as well as the housewife has hailed the use of chromium as a plating for faucets and fittings . Chromium is distinctively the metal of this labor-saving age . It needs no daily polishing and scouring . Just an occasional wiping with a cloth is all that chromium needs to retain its luster . Chromium is hard and durable . It does not dull , corrode , or tarnish . Chromium is highly resistant to fruit and vegetable acids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which dull and discolor most other metals and finishes . When properly applied , it will give lasting service just how long no one knows because chromium has only recently come into general use . Chromium-plated fixtures naturally cost more than nickel-plated fittings because of the price of the plating solution and the more difficult process of application . Unfortunately for the public , there are ways to cheapen chromium plating . A faucet maybe given just a " flash " of chromium , that is , it may be left in t'iie chromium bath for only a short time . For the average person , it will be difficult if not impossible to tell the inadequately coated piece of chromium from the thoroughly coated fitting which has been in the bath for half an hour and has been polished and buffed . Time alone will tell There are various kinds of handles for faucets . A handle may be of metal and plated with any of the platings just mentioned or it may be of china or of glass . Handles are made in a variety of styles and shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of handle . This may be made of metal , china , or glass . The most popular type of handle is the four-arm handle , which , ; c  | the name indicates , has four arms which may be used for turning . This is made in metal , china , and glass . Some manufacturers make a three-arm handle and others make fourarm handles with metal balls at the end , and a five-arm handle . One manufacturer has introduced a radical change in handle construction known as the handle with " finger-tip " control . Since one of the prevalent abuses of the faucet is for the user to seize the handle and turn off the water with all the strength he has in his hands , this manufacturer reasons that if a faucet has a handle which can be manipulated with the fingers only , the chances for damage to the faucet seat are greatly lessened We turn now to a detailed examination of the faucets made for different types of fixtures . Let us step into a modern kitchen with an up-to-date sink with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roomy drainboard . We see on this type of sink a faucet utterly unknown to the housewives of a generation ago . It is a faucet with a swinging spout through which the housewife may draw hot water , cold water , or tempered water . The swinging spout permits her to send the water into either compartment . The compartments are eight inches deep and equipped with a clever combinon stopper and strainer . At the twist of the lever , the metal stopper finds its seat and the water sent into the sink is kept in the compartment . This device makes the dishpan and dishrag obsolete because the deep compartment itself serves as a dishpan . After the dishes have been washed , they may be rinsed with scalding hot water from a hose and spray In some faucets , the hose is attached to the swinging spout ; while in other faucets , there is a separate connection for the hose and the water is sent through either the hose or the spout by the turning of a diverting valve . The soap dish mounted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in many other things , the purchaser gets exactly what he pays for . Quality faucets have either a chromium plated soap dish or a dish made of genuine twice-fire vitreous china . Inferior faucets have a china soap dish made out of second-rate clays fired at a low temperature . These dishes will eventually show stains made by the acids in the soap , or crazes , that is , hair-line cracks in the glaze . Progressive manufacturers have spared no pains to make their best  | kitchen faucets the last word in efficiency and in construction . Recognizing the fact that crevices are dirt-catchers , they have so constructed their faucets that there are no inaccessible places A triple faucet is made for use in districts where a connection for drinking water is needed in addition to the customary hot and cold water con-nection The valves for the kitchen sink faucet may be entirely concealed behind the wall Most interesting , too , are the changes that have taken place in the construction and design of faucets , escutcheons , and drains for lavatories . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and symmetry of form and line , ... . 2 . The combination faucet which enables the user of the faucet to wash with tempered water . 3 . Concealment of valves . 4 . The use of the pop-up drain control methods to replace the obsolete plug and chain . There are four advantages of the combination faucet : It enables the person using the lavatory to wash in tempered water ; washing in tempered water results in a saving of hot water with consequent economy of gas or whatever fuel is used to heat the water ; there is more space on the slab of the lavatory for toilet articles or other accessories ; and there is less metal to clean . Economy of space on the lavatory slab is an advantage of the combination faucet . More and more to-day the bathroom is being used as a dressing room . The number of toilet articles and accessories produced is constantly increasing . While the plumbing industry produces special dressing tableithat match lavatories and while some lavatories are made with room at the side for use as a dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the conventional lavatory for resting toilet articles . When a combination faucet is used , practically the entire slab is free for use as the person may wish . There is still another way to get even more space on the lavatory slab . This is by concealing the control valve in thewail.and supplying tempered water through a china spout which is an integral part of the lava tort ' . When this is done , only the pop-up drain control is on the lava Wry AA . We turn now to the faucets and fittings available for bathtubs . Bat li-  | room conditions and bathing habits differ . One arrangement of supply and waste will prove most convenient and satisfactory to some ; others will prefer a different one . But all want fittings that are lasting and not likely to get out of order . A good tub deserves a good supply and a good waste . The importance of the latter is frequently overlooked by many people who build or buy houses . A cheap waste is an inefficient waste ; it will drain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for it to drain . The ring around the tub which results will increase the housewife 's work of cleaning the tub . , The tub on legs is out-of-date and with it have gone exposed pipes for the bathtub . All the supply pipes for the modern bathtub are concealed . In conclusion , attention should be called to improvements in the internal mechanism of the faucet . While years ago nearly all faucets were Fuller faucets , today all faucets are compression faucets . A modification of the compression faucet is very popular today . This quick compression faucet closes with from one quarter to a half turn while the compression faucet closes with one turn . There are different ways in which this quick closing of the faucet is attained . Some manufacturers use a thread with a steep pitch . Others use a double thread . The double thread is said to have the additional advantage of making the construction of the faucet more rugged and preventing possible wabbling of bath faucets with a long stem . The compression faucet derived its name from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made to close on a metal seat . The washer and the seat , therefore , are the two parts of the faucet which receive the greatest amount of wear . All faucets are so constructed that the washer may be easily replaced . It has taken more ingenuity , however , to devise methods of making the seat renewable . It is cheaper to make a faucet with an integral seat . When the seat of a cheap faucet is damaged , it is possible to trim the worn edge away with a special reseating tool , but usually this is as expensive as the purchase of a new faucet . All better grades of faucets have some kind of a renewable seat . Various manufacturers have attained this end in different ways . Some have the seat in a barrel which easily slides out of the faucet . Others have a kind of disc seat which is readily removable . To minimize the effect of the grinding motion which takes place when a washer is forced on the seat as the faucet is closed , some manufacturers  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washer . The effect of the swivel device is to allow more play in the seating act ion an01 to equalize wearing by preventing the washer from coming in contact with the seat in the same way every time it is closed . The advantage of all these improvements will be more readily apparent when one remembers that damage to faucet seats results from failure to close the faucet with consequent dripping of water and cutting of the seat by the presence of foreign elements , such as metal , shavings , sand , etc. , in the water . The better faucets have anti-splashing devices built in the spout . There is also a difference in washers . Cheap washers give trouble in the hotwater faucet because they will swell up . When a faucet needs a new washer , it pays to buy it from a plumbing contractor because good washers will give many years of service . PLUMBING AND HEALTH A subcommittee on plumbing was appointed in 1921 under the Building Code Committee of the United States Department of Commerce . The purpose of this committee was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum requirements for plumbing codes and local ordinances . Most of the plumbing work of a dwelling is regulated by local ordinances or codes in communities where such exist , and is then passed upon by the local inspector . Many of these codes lack uniformity , some are obsolete , and there are unaccountable differences in regulation . There are at present a number of states that have enacted plumbing laws . These hold plumbing practice to certain main requirements . Several hundred cities also have adopted codes . Health is the basis on which such legislation is enacted . The purpose of this subcommittee has been to prepare minimum requirements based on good plumbing principles and to draft a code based on these requirements . The relation of plumbing to health is discussed briefly in the following paragraphs of the subcommittee 's report : I The work of the committee has emphasized the necessity of considering the plumbing systems of buildings as intimately related to and forming an integral part of public water-supply and sewerage systems . The number and character of plumbing fixtures in a building are largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cOnsidered their relation to features of public serv- footnote Recommended Minimum Requirements for Plumbing ( U.S. Dept. of Commerce ) . Washington : Government Printing Office . 1929.  | ice . Plumbing fixtures are the terminals of water-supply systems , and , to a large extent , control the quantity of water used . At the same time they are the beginnings of the sewerage system . The aggregate discharges from plumbing fixtures determine the flow in sewers and the volume of sewage reaching the outfall , this volume materially affecting the cost of any pumping or treatment of the sewage . It is evident , therefore , that the public interest may well justify a certain degree of governmental control over plumbing fixtures as affecting both the quantity of water available for public use and the economical operation of the sewerage system . An important function of the house-drainage system is to carry away from plumbing fixtures human excreta and wastes which may contain disease-producing bacteria . Because of the possible presence of such organisms sewage may be dangerous and must be disposed of in such a manner that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place great emphasis on the importance of sewage treatment and safe methods of ultimate sewage disposal . The leakage of polluted water from the house-drainage system is insanitary and dangerous . Leakage within the house may pollute the habitation and permit food infection through the medium of insects . Leakage in the ground outside the house may pollute water supplies taken from neighboring wells or find its way into or under the building . The maintenance of water seals between fixtures and drains and the permanent tightness of plumbing systems are important not only because they prevent the passage of air , but because they prevent the access of insects to the interior of the drains and sewers . If cockroaches , water bugs , and other vermin can pass from drains to food , they may transport disease germs , and thus be a bacteriological menace to health . It is therefore important that the drainage system be tight and without danger of leakage . L. O. Howard , chief of the Bureau of Entomology of the United States Department of Agriculture , and C. W. Stiles , United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the committee , are authority for the statement that insects can and do pass from the interior of leaking drainage systems to living quarters . Several other observers also report such occurrences . Auott dxxg* to be guarded against is the use of fixtures in which the water supply and waste connections are so arranged that polluted waste water from the fixtures may , under certain circumstances , return into the water-supply pipes . The line where the safe water supply ends and sewage begins is sometimes very finely drawn . If faucets with open spouts discharge over plumbing fixtures and if there is a break between the water supply and the waste pipe , self-protection exists against possible pollution of the water-supply distributing system by the back flow of waste water into it . Plumbing fixtures such as water-closets , urinals , bidets , bathtubs , and lavatories with direct connections , secret wastes and overflows , and combination cocks offer possible sources of pollution .  | The air in sewers and drains often contains gases resulting from the decom position of excreta , soap , fats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oils which may come from garages , streets , and industrial establishments . Illuminating gas may also find its way into sewers through leakage . Among these gases may be found methane , sulphuretted hydrogen , and carbonic oxide . In large amounts those gases are poisonous to the human system , and there are physiological objections to breathing them even in small quantities . Hence , the air of sewers or drains should be kept from entering buildings intended for human habitation or occupancy by the use of proper plumbing installations and by suitable ventilation of the rooms or compartments in which the plumbing fixtures are located . The smell of these gases and other emanations from decomposing organic matter is naturally repugnant to human beings . It not only offends the sensibilities , but may produce shallow breathing , headache , and even nausea . In addition to the above facts , it is important to consider the bacteriological aspects of sewer and drain air , a subject upon which there has been some misunderstanding . In recent years bacteriologists have made studies which have thrown light upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often contains disease-producing bacteria derived from human excreta and body wastes these bacteria are rarely found in the air which escapes from sewers and drains . Hence , it has been argued by some that escaping sewer air has no influence on health . The committee does not agree with this conclusion . Health may be influenced by factors which do not cause specific diseases , for there are chemical and physiological as well as bacteriological factors involved . The investigations thus far made by bacteriologists should be considered to be merely a beginning of larger and more complete investigations which will doubtless be made as the science of bacteriology advances . The committee is of the opinion , therefore , that until further light on this somewhat obscure subject has been obtained the ' escape of sewer air from the house-drainage system , at frequent intervals or in considerable quantities , threatens the health of the building 's occupants . This whole matter has a quantitative as well as a qualitative aspect . The temporary losses of water seal in traps , which rarely occur and which are immediately replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the occupants , for if many cases the final drainage from the fixture will renew the seal within a short time , but where a loss of seal is likely to be of frequent occurrence and not readily replaced , or where breaks in the system admit sewer air continually to a building , the health of the occupants is subject to the dangers heretofore described . For the above-mentioned reasons regulations governing the installation of plumbing have been established by law in many places . These regulations have been potent in improving living conditions throughout the country ; in fact , they have even set the standards for those places where plumbing is not under public  | control . The knowledge now in possession of sanitarians in regard to the lessened bacteriological dangers of sewer air leads logically to some simplification in plumbing design , but it should not lead to an abandonment of practices necessary to protect buildings against the air of drains , which , in addition to its possible danger , is offensive to the smell . The committee believes that good plumbing is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people 's health , but people also have rights , and plumbing regulations carried too far are unjust . Regulations which will not be supported by the courts fully and without question under a liberal interpretation of the police power may be regarded as unjust . Sanitary science , however , must be the guide to justice in this matter . The principles of science change as knowledge advances , and it is proper , therefore , that plumbing regulations be reviewed from time to time and , if necessary , revised . SUMMARY The plumbing of a building includes the pipes for distributing the water supply , the fixtures for using water and drainage pipes for removing waste together with fittings and appurtenances . Plumbing means the installation of proper fixtures , and other apparatus for bringing in water supply and removing liquid and water-carried wlstes . Good plumbing and plumbing fixtures usually result in a saving as they will require but a small expenditure for upkeep . Brass pipes are desirable for the distribution of the water supply in the home . If brass is too expensive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used around the house heater and hot-water tank . Stops or valves should be installed . The automatic hot-water heater is one of the most desirable methods of heating water . Consider design , metal , and operating device in selecting faucets . The renewable feature of faucets should be considered as there is bound to be wear . Chromium plate is desirable as it requires little care . For kitchen sinks the swinging-spout type is desirable . The most desirable kitchen sink is the one with sink and drainboards cast in one piece . City ordinances usually define the exact methods and materials used in the home for sewage disposal , outline the methods by which connections must be made , specify the installation of waste lines , and give definite rulings on the installation of traps and vents . Considerable emphasis is placed by sanitarians on the importance of sewage treatment and safe methods of disposal . Regulations governing the installation of plumbing have been established in many places as many cities have plumbing codes or local ordinances governing plumbing . These regulations have been important in improving living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in setting up standards where codes do not exist . REFERENCES BABBITT , HAROLD E. Plumbing .

Essential features of good plumbing ( pp. 94-108 ) .  | REFRIGERATION ELECTRIC AND GAS REFRIGERATORS ' There are two general types of refrigerating systems , the compression and the absorption type . In the usual compression type a small compressor , operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vapor coming from the refrigerating coils to a pressure sufficiently high to cause it to liquefy at ordinary temperatures , when heat is removed either by water or air . The liquid is then readmitted through an expansion valve or equivalent device to the refrigerating coils , where its evaporation at a low pressure produces the cooling for which the machine is designed . In the absorption type the vapor from the refrigerating coils is absorbed in a suitable substance , such as water , or other liquid , or by a solid which is capable of absorbing large quantities of vapor . Subsequently the substance containing the absorbed vapor is heated , either electrically or by a gas flame , and the vapor is driven off , then cooled and condensed to a liquid , which is returned to the refrigerating coils . Machines of this type have few or no moving parts , practically all of then . ' are almost noiseless in operation and , in contrast with many machines of the compression type , require connection to a water supply for cooling . Some of the machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat being applied always to one part , while the liquid is caused to circulate . Others are of the intermittent type , the heat being supplied for a time to one part , then to another part , or to one part at intervals . Nearly , all of the machines now on the market are designed to provide for freezing ice cubes , and since this feature is so very generally included , no further consideration of it is required here . A very large number of makes of refrigerating machines of the compression type have been put on the market . These have included such variations as direct drive , belt drive , and gear drive ; reciprocating single or multiple cylinder compressors , various types of rotary compressors ; various refrigerants such as sulphur dioxide , methyl chloride , ethyl chloride , footnote ' From " Electric and Gas Refrigerators " ( Letter Circ. 255 ; U.S. Dept. of Commerce , Bureau of Standards , 1929 ) .  | ammonia , volatile hydrocarbons , etc. ; air or water cooling ; refrigeration by direct expansion or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sealed machines of the compression type have also been made . It is impracticable to discuss here the various merits and demerits of the features which are often emphasized out of all proportion to their importance , in advertising and by salesmen . The user of a machine is not so much concerned with the kind of drive , refrigerant or absorbent used , type of compressor or system of refrigeration as he is in the kind of service the machine will give and what the service may cost over a period of years . For example , there is no outstanding advantage in a machine with a brine tank as compared with one of the direct expansion type , but the success or failure of either will depend upon the quality of the whole machine and not upon such a detail of design . Knowledge of details of design of this kind is of value to the expert in judging whether the machine is designed and made so that it can be expected to have a reasonably long life and give satisfactory service during its life . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seem superior does not necessarily indicate that it will prove to be superior to other machines having other features of design . For example , the refrigerant used is a factor of minor importance as regards efficiency , since machines can be designed to use any of the ordinary refrigerants effectively . Similarly either compression or absorption machines can give very satisfactory service . There have been instances where refrigerants which constituted a distinct hazard to life or health have been used , but this does not apply to the refrigerants now in general use . Again a poorly designed machine might introduce a distinct fire or accident hazard . The purchaser of a machine should , therefore , take into consideration evidence concerning test and approval of the type by some disinterested authority . Short-time tests of refrigerating machines unfortunately furnish only incomplete information as to their relative merits . Such a test may disclose obvious defects and will readily show the power or gas and water consumption and the efficiency of the unit tested , when new . By operating the machine under extreme conditions , e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estimate of the margin of reserve in power , cooling capacity and strength of parts above ordinary requirements , but none of tl ese tests gives information on the most important points , namely , the durability and reliability in service of the average machine under ordinary conditions .  | Some of the factors to which the prospective purchaser of a machine should give attention are the following : I. Standing of the manufacturer. ? If the manufacturer does not remain in business the machine is likely to become obsolete in a very short time , since replacement of worn or defective parts may be difficult or impossible . 2 . Record of the machine. ? A machine in the experimental or development stage is a more speculative proposition than one which has stood the test of service . 3 . Noise. ? Unless a machine runs quietly when new and continues to do so , it will be unsatisfactory to most of its users . 4 . Useful life . The aggregate cost of refrigeration depends to a considerable extent upon the length of life of the machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little information on this point is available , and the purchaser must depend upon the reputation of the product and such information as he can find in regard to durability . 5 . Efficiency of the machine . There are considerable differences in the operating efficiencies of different machines , and figures on operating costs can sometimes be obtained . If a machine is not well made or is allowed to deteriorate , efficiency may be greatly reduced after a short period of use . 6 . Insulation of the refrigerator. ? The refrigerator should be well insulated , preferably with not less than a two-inch thickness of some good insulating material . Refrigerators depending largely upon air spaces for insulation or those with thin walls and doors are likely to require considerable power or fuel and water to keep them cold . 7 . Air or water cooling. ? If the machine is water cooled , the purchaser should determine that his water supply is suitable for the purpose , so that deposits from hard water will not be formed inside the machine , ultimately interfering with its functioning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too expensive . 8 . Servicing of machine. ? Preference should be given to a machine which could be easily and inexpensively serviced or repaired when necessary . A machine which could easily be removed entirely and replaced by another would be classed as easily serviced . If attention such as oiling or adjustments are required from time to time , the points requiring attention should be few in number , and should be readily accessible where the machine is to be installed , lest it suffer from neglect . 9 . Quality of local service. ? A machine obtained from a responsible dealer , who is prepared to attend to adjustments and repairs promptly when required , is to be preferred .  | to . Comparison of refrigeration by machines and by ice. ? The purpose of this section is not to make an exhaustive comparison between machine refrigeration and ice refrigeration but merely to point out some of the more obvious facts , which , if kept in mind , may enable the prospective purchaser to avoid being puzzled or misled . The owner of a refrigerating machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ice . The machine can be set to maintain a lower temperature than is practicable with ice , so that left overs can be kept a somewhat longer time before being thrown away . Few subjects are more misunderstood by the public and by writers on refrigeration than that of temperatures required for proper refrigeration . Most writers draw a dead line at 50 ? F. and state , in effect , that useful refrigeration is not obtained above that temperature . The facts are , however , fairly simple and obvious . Time and temperature are equally essent ial factors in decay . Most foods will remain palatable and wholesome if kept as long as a day at a temperature as high as 6o ? F. If they are to be kept for a week , 50 ? F. may not be low enough . If they are to be kept for a month , the temperature must be still lower . In any case , most users prefer to serve food while it is fresh ; there are very few who purchase a refrigerator for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable periods , and the possibility of keeping foods for more than a limited time is of little practical importance . There is , of course , a wide difference in the keeping qualities of various kinds of foods . The user of a machine is usually less subject to loss from spoilage of food , and in some cases there may be a considerable saving in this respect . Either an ice-cooled refrigerator or a machine-cooled refrigerator tends to maintain a dry atmosphere in the food compartments and thus to dry out moist materials stored in them . The water from the melted ice carries off material in solution thereby removing causes of odors . The relative cost of refrigeration with ice and with a machine depends very largely upon the useful life of the machine and the costs of repairs , replacements and service . To make a comparison of costs , it is necessary to estimate the probable life of the machine and then to estimate operating costs , and costs of repairs , service , etc. , over this period . To these add the initial cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total by the number of years to find the aggregate cost of refrigeration per year . A similar estimate may be made for a refrigerator using ice . Such computations indicate that a machine should have a useful life of at least ten years in order that the cost of refrigeration by machine should not he  | unduly high as compared with ice refrigeration . In many cases the operating costs of a machine are lower than the cost of ice for a refrigerator of comparable size , but this is rarely true of the aggregate cost of refrigera tion , which means that the greater convenience and better service of machine refrigeration are obtained at somewhat higher cost . In many cases the purchaser of a machine compares its operating costs for the first few months with those of his old refrigerator , which may have had but little insulation when new and is almost certainly no better after years of use . Such a comparison does not give a correct picture . It is true that the reluctance , of makers of ice refrigerators , until recently , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in popularizing the nut chines , which are usually installed in well insulated boxes . On the other hand , well-insulated refrigerators for ice are a comparatively recent de velopment . As machines are usually set to maintain lower temperatures than are obtained in iced refrigerators , they require more insulation . The minimum requirement for any type of refrigerator is that the insulation shall be sufficient to prevent the deposition of moisture on the outside of the box , under all conditions in which it is to be used . Adequate insuln tion requires no secret formulas or knowledge not available to the public , but only the use of a sufficient thickness ( not less than 2 inches ) of a good insulating material , adequately protected from moisture . Recently , well insulated refrigerators for ice have been obtainable , and when such are used , the public will have a better opportunity to compare refrigeration by ice , with refrigeration by machine , on their respective merits .

ELECTRIC REFRIGERATION , REFRI ( - FRAM S , AND THE CABINET ' By G. E. MILLER Electrical refrigeration for the home has made such rapid progress and has so much of merit that it is the subject of keen interest to progres sive housekeepers . To those who wish to investigate further , the following general facts may be of assistance in the confusion of claim and counterclaim of zealous salesmen . A complete apparatus or unit includes two essential parts , the ma- footntoe Adapted from " Electrical Refrigeration for the Home , " Journal of Home Econom ics , June , 1926 . ( Revised for this publication. )  | chine by which the " cold " is produced , and the cabinet or box in which the food is stored . These may be purchased and installed separately or cornhined . The character of both of these should be considered in choosing a refrigerator , as well as efficiency , price , and cost of operation and maintenance . The machine. ? Since it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a refrigerating machine , his best criterion is the reliability of the manufacturer and agent . Several manufacturers have been making and selling electric refrigerators for a number of years and their machines have proved commercially satisfactory . In buying a machine the purchaser should inquire how long the manufacturer has been in business , how many machines of the model under consideration have been sold , how long they have been in use , and how many are in use in the immediate vicinity or city ; and he should examine into the facilities available for emergency service and maintenance work in case the machine needs attention . Ofttimes the reliability and business integrity of the Inc-al selling agent , his ability to render prompt service when needed ? for example , on Sundays and holidays , as well as week days will be of first importance in making a selection The older , better-known machines are about on a par and of equal merit . In the case of newer machines which have not been on the market long enough to meet the test of them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to leave no doubt of his ability t n make good in marketing a new device . Refrigerants. ? The medium through which " cold " is produced within t he cabinet is called the refrigerant . Usually this is some liquid which will not freeze except at a very low temperature and which , when driven by electric power through the cooling system of the machine , makes the moisture collect on the outside of the system in the form of ice crystals . The refrigerants most commonly used in household machines are sulphur dioxide , methyl chloride , and butane . The quantity used is small and , when the equipment is properly installed , will last indefinitely . These refrigerants are not explosive and are harmless . The cabinet. ? The necessity of a high-grade cabinet for proper pre , ervation of food in the home is not generally appreciated . An examinai ion of many homes will reveal from basement to attic a real discriminat ion in the selection of household furnishings and equipment . There is , however , almost universally one exception ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refrigeration ? of what is necessary to keep food  | fit to eat in the home ? is almost wholly lacking . How many people would be willing to pay as much for an ice box as for the family piano ? Which k the more important to the happiness of the home ? Investigation has shown that a large percentage of boxes sold to-day through the usual channels of trade are wholly unfit for the preserva t io n of food . Many have little or no effective heat-insulating material in their construction . In wooden boxes , the cabinet work is often poorly done , resulting in warped doors leaving large cracks around the edges , where t he cold leaks out and the heat leaks in . The hardware , latches , and hinges are flimsy and of poor design , thus preventing a tight fit between door and jamb . Manufacturers of electrical refrigerating equipment were among the first to appreciate the necessity of high-grade construction and axle quate insulation in cabinets , and have taken an advanced position by insisting on a high-quality product . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now made of sheet metal instead . If the cabinet is of wood it is essential that this he " treated " so that it will not absorb moisture , shrink , or crack . The interior lining may be of metal covered with porcelain enamel or similar protection against rust , and should be waterproof . Glass linings have been used successfully . The highest-grade cabinets use a glazed solid porcelain lining , similar to a solid porcelain bathtub . In large cabinets these linings are cast in two pieces and the joints cemented to make them waterproof . Such a lining is easily cleaned and from a sanitary poin t of view is unexcelled . The feature of greatest importance in cabinet construction is the in sulating material . Many years of experience in cold-storage plants have demonstrated that solid sheet cork is about the best and most satisfactory material for this purpose , though other insulating materials have been used successfully . Two inches of sheet cork will provide satisfactory in sulation . The purchaser should insist on knowing what is between the inner and outer walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover a multitude of sins of omission . .... The coldest point inside a refrigerator cabinet should be approxi mately 3o to 32 ? F. In hot weather the temperature of the air outside the cabinet frequently runs from 90 to roo F. That is , the range of difference in temperature between the inside and outside of the cabinet is from 6d ' to 700 F. , or about as much as between the inside and outside of the house in zero weather . Houses in cold climates have thick walls , are provided with double doors and windows , and are otherwise protected against cold .  | Great quantities of heat are generated inside to make them comfortable . One would not expect to be warm or even comfortable in a summer coif age or tent in zero weather . About one million ice boxes are sold annually in this country . Thousands of them are of the " summer cottage " variety and many belong to the " tent " colony . Eating perishable food which has been stored for some time in one of these may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical refrigerating machine is occasionally installed with an old cabinet , but unless the cabinet is of the very highest quality of construct ion , this is , generally speaking , a mistake . It makes no difference whether a machine or ice is used in a poor box ; the results as far as preservation of food is concerned are in either case ineffective . An electrical refrigerating machine has intelligence but no brains . It is automatic in operation and will try to keep the box cold , but if the box has not sufficient insulation to hold the cold , the machine will run too much of the time , thus increasing the cost of operating and shortening its useful life . Suggestions for installation. ? Where people own their homes , it is usually desirable to install the machine in the basement or some other out-ofthe-way place where the sound and vibration will be less noticeable . The cabinet should preferably be placed in a refrigerator room or other separate unheated space . The kitchen is not a good location for a cabinet ; in some climates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too F. For use in a rented dwelling it would seem desirable to buy the self contained units ( machine installed within the cabinet ) as these are not rigidly attached and may be moved like any piece of heavy furniture . The electric connection to a domestic refrigerating machine is best made through a convenience outlet , as with washing-machines , vacuum cleaners , flat irons , and all household electrical appliances ; it is , however , possible to connect through an ordinary lamp socket . Cost of operation. ? The average domestic refrigeration machines will consume approximately 50 kilowatt hours of electricity per month , taking the year through . Ordinarily , of course , more electricity will be used in warm summer weather than in the winter . In midsummer the consumption may reach 75 units or more per month . If the cabinet is installed in a kitchen , the seasonal variation in the use of electricity will not be so great , but the average for the year is likely to be higher . In a northern climate , with the cabinet installed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not run at all for two months or more in midwinter . From the above data , anyone who knows the cost of electricity in his community can easily make a fair estimate of the cost of the electricity required to operate a machine . Cost of maintenance. ? The selling price usually includes the cost of servicing the equipment for a period ranging from three months to one year . Manufacturers ' practices differ as to the period thus allowed . There are wide variations in maintenance costs between individual machines just as there are in any other mechanical equipment , but data from vari ous parts of the United States indicate that after the free service period these should not average more than $5 a year . Care of equipment. ? An electrical refrigerator requires little attention on the part of the owner . Usually this amounts only to putting a few drops of oil in the motor bearings once a week during hot weather , less frequently in cold weather . Some machines are now put out with bearings guaranteed to operate a year without oiling ; others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever . When an electrical refrigerating machine is in service and properly adjusted , it is continually freezing the moisture out of the air in the cabinet . This forms a deposit of frost or ice on the cooling element , which will continue to increase as long as the machine is in operation . Too great an accumulation of this frost or ice will prevent a free circulation of air over the cooling element , thus stopping proper refrigeration in the food storage compartments , and perhaps causing foul odors . To avoid this , the cooling element should be defrosted periodically . This operation requires only the opening of the electric switch which controls the supply of electricity to the motor , and allowing the machine thus to stand idle until the accumulated frost and ice melt off . The interior of the cabinet should be periodically ivashed out as would be done in any ice box . The drains , however , do not clog up but need regular cleaning as where ice is used . Electrical refrigerating devices for the household are automatic in their operation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oiling , defrosting , and cleaning indicated . Temperatures maintained. ? The temperature maintained within the cabinet of a good electric refrigerator depends entirely on the quality of insulation in the cabinet , the temperature of the air surrounding the cabinet , and the frequency with which the doors are opened .  | Any of the well-known machines installed on a cabinet with good insulation will maintain satisfactory temperatures in the warmest part of the cabinet . The warmest point in the cabinet is the top of the food compartment and that should never be over 50 ? F. The coldest point is immediately under the cooling element and ranges from 30 ? to 35 ? F. The working range of temperatures within the cabinet can , if desired , be changed either up or down by adjusting the thermostat , .... THE GAS-FIRED REFRIGERATOR , Let us first consider what refrigeration is . " Cold " is merely the absence of heat , and any means of absorbing heat which will lower the temperature to between 40 and 500 will give us the refrigeration we require in the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat by melting ? changing from a solid to a liquid at a low temperature . Certain substances known as refrigerants , such as sulphur dioxide and ammonia , absorb heat by vaporizing changing from a liquid to a gas ? at a low temperature . If , t hen , we can permit this refrigerant to vaporize inside the chamber we wish to cool , and then change it back to a liquid outside of that chamber , we will have continuous refrigeration . The electric machines accomplish this job by means of a compressor driven by an electric motor . The refrigerant is put under a high pressure in the compressor and it will then turn to a liquid at ordinary room temperatures . This liquid is then carried by a pipe to the freezing unit inside of the refrigerator , where the pressure is reduced by a valve . As the liquid refrigerant passes the valve it vaporizes , takes up heat in so doing , and cools the box . The refrigerant , which is now in the form of a gas , is reI urned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gas refrigerator makes use of a small boiler to raise the pressure of the refrigerant , so that it can be changed back to a liquid at ordinary temperatures . The major steps in the cycle of the gas-fired refrigerator are as follows : Ammonia dissolved in water is placed in the boiler and heat , from a gas flame , applied . The ammonia is driven out of the water as a gas under pressure , and is then condensed to a liquid . The liquid flows to the freezing unit and is vaporized , taking up heat and cooling the box . footnote , Adapted from " How the Gas Refrigerator Works , " Domestic Engineering , December , 1928.  | The ammonia , now in the form of a gas , is absorbed again in cold water and flows back to the boiler . At the present time the operating cost of the gas refrigerator is slightly higher than the electric , although less than the cost of ice . The gas refrigerator , however , has no moving parts , which means that few repairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aqua-ammonia " ( that is , water and ammonia ) . It is the same kind of solution known all over the world as " household ammonia " and familiar to every housekeeper . For our purpose the percentage of ammonia is greater . A gas burner is located under the " generator-absorber . " The heat from this burner causes the ammonia in the liquid to become vapor . This vapor passes along to the " condenser , " where it is cooled by circulating water . Under this treatment the vapor becomes liquid and flows down into the " receiver . " This process continues until a sufficient quantity of the ammonia has been " vaporized " out of the aqua-ammonia in the " generator-absorber . " The circulating water is then automatically discontinued in the condenser , and diverted to the cooling coil of the " generator-absorber , " and the gas is automatically turned out . When the " generator-absorber " has cooled down to a predetermined point of temperature , the liquid ammonia refrigerant commences to pass from the " receiver " through the expansion valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice chamber of the refrigerator itself . The evaporation of ammonia gas , from this liquid , draws the heat from the refrigerator and its contents . Cold is merely the absence of heat . This process of drawing out the heat creates a perfectly dry cold atmosphere in the refrigerator . The spent ammonia gas then passes back to the " generator-absorber " ? ( which first generated the gas , and again , when its work has been accomplished , re-absorbs it ) . Thus the whole process of refrigeration has been completed ; matters stand where they were in the beginning . The " generator-absorber " is again in readiness to repeat the operation which is automatically clone as often as is necessary to provide the refrigeration required .  | ICE REFRIGERATION AND THE ICE CABINET ' BY M. E. PENNINGTON National Association of Ice Industries While ice , for many years , has been an indispensable article in the good conduct of households , only recently has its efficient utilization received serious attention . Like the electric current and gas its benefits must he made apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being definitely superseded by the scientifically designed and constructed ice-cooled refrigerator in which are maintained the temperatures designated by bacteriologists and biochemists as necessary for the proper preservation in the home of milk , fresh meats , fruits , vegetables and the like . For example , the portion of the refrigerator receiving the current of air just off the ice is less than 450 F. even when atmospheric temperatures are continuously at 900 F. and the contiguous sections are well below 500 F. Particular attention has been paid to obtaining 45 F. or less for milk and delicate foods , since , more and more , we learn that 45 F. is , for them , the crucial temperature line . For most vegetables and fruits , however , temperatures from 5o F. to 55 ? F. are adequate for household needs . The modern refrigerator for ice has abandoned the so called " dead air space " for insulation and has substituted from one to three inches of pure corkboard or its equivalent . It has properly adjusted openings for air circulation and a " baffle " between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the air movement . There should be available a section of the wall of every refrigerator sold that the purchaser may see for herself ( I ) the thickness and kind of insulator , ( 2 ) the entire absence of so called " dead air spaces , " ( 3 ) the presence , location and kind of waterproofing compound used to protect the insulation from moisture , ( 4 ) the reasonable use of paper to protect the surface of the insulator but not to be depended upon for insulation . The primary requirements in choosing insulators for household refrigerators are ( I ) high resistance to the passage of heat and ( 2 ) high resistance to the absorption of moisture such as is exhibited by pure corkboard . The heat resistance of balsam wool , dry-zero , and to a lesser degree insulite , celotex , nu-wood , weatherwood , and flaxlinum , has permitted these materials to function in refrigerator walls when properly waterproofed . The footnote ' Part of the following article has been adapted from Buying a Refrigerator ( Household Refrigeration Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the remainder has been prepared by Dr. Pennington for this publication .  | less the resistance to heat , the thicker the layer of insulator must be . Therefore , the purchaser should insist upon knowing the name of the insulator and the thickness of it . Regardless of other qualities , insulators used in refrigerators should be strong enough to stand up without support . This requirement places granulated cork , mineral wood , asbestos wool and similar substances in the category of the unreliable insulators for household refrigerators . Refrigerators containing them lose their efficiency too rapidly to be either reliable or economical . Balsam wool , dry-zero and flaxlinum are manufactured in panel form and , if properly protected against moisture absorption , the slabs wear well , In flexible blanket form they are , with our present methods of building , much less reliable . Microscopic air spaces such as nature puts into corkboard are our most efficient insulators . But man can not build such tiny , tight spaces into walls and what man terms " dead air spaces " soon become almost value ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator with air space and paper in its walls melted 28 pounds of ice per day and gave a temperature in the top of the food compartment of 62.8 ? F. A similar refrigerator with two inches of good insulation under exactly the same conditions melted 25 pounds of ice per day and maintained a temperature of 51.9 ? F. on the top shelf . Too often the " bargains " advertised at low prices , or the sales of re , frigerators put on to attract customers , are based on air and paper cabinets without any real insulation . The salesmen have been known to justify their statements by quotations from government bulletins in which were set forth laboratory experiments but they were not applicable to refrigerators of which fact the salesmen may have been ignorant . Of course , the initial cost of air and paper is much less than the cost of a good insulator . But such refrigerators , in spite of good icing , do not protect foods . They soon acquire wet walls , melt ice extravagantly and increase running costs beyond all reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternated air spaces with layers of insulation . Or , they have left a space next to the inside lining . Such walls will not wear well because they are not air tight and so water will condense in them even when both inside lining and outside sheathing are steel . When an insulator is wet or even damp ? heat can go through it easily . Protecting against water absorption is a difficult part of refrigerator construction . Atmospheric air is sure to get into the walls and it always carries more  | or less moisture which condenses when it penetrates to a cold part of the wall , especially the part near the inside lining since that is coldest . Therefore , a coating of some good water resisting compound , such as odorless asphalt , should be applied to all surfaces . If this asphalt binds the selfsupporting insulator firmly to the interior lining on the one side and to the outer sheathing on the other , the insulator will be kept dry and stay in place for many years . Such construction , also , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in applying hot asphalt to such surfaces , heavy paper impregnated with odorless asphalt is often used to cover or wrap the slab of insulation . The lining of a refrigerator should be porcelain or vitreous porcelain on steel if the purchaser can afford it . At lower cost one can now obtain good white enamel-on-steel linings which wear well if well made . Whether of porcelain or enamel , the inside lining should extend unbroken around the ends and back of the refrigerator and the top and bottom should be put on with well-made locked seams . The old type of L lining which necessitated separate fitted pieces for the lining of the ice compartment is undesirable and is rapidly being replaced by linings of the " one piece " type . The enamel metal linings have seams in them . It is the aim of the conscientious manufacturer to make these seams as air tight as possible and they are constantly improving their work . The vitreous porcelain is truly in one piece and so is better able to protect the walls against moisture . The old-fashioned L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous type now much used . All corners should be rounded to facilitate cleaning . Formerly only porcelain could have rounded corners but now enameled linings have them . The purchaser is especially interested in the openings to carry the air to and from the ice ; in the construction of the baffle because of its influence on air circulation ; and in the amount of food space . When buying , be sure that the refrigerator is up to date in these items . Unless there is abundant and continuous circulation of air , the food will not be well kept . To obtain good air circulation we must have ( r ) the surface of the ice unobstructed , ( 2 ) a large opening for the air to escape from the ice compartment , ( 3 ) a guide to direct the cold air all the way down to the floor of the refrigerator and all the way up above the top shelf . Since we must have an open , uncovered ice surface to most rapidly and efficiently absorb heat and food odors , it is obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is encased in metal over which the passing air is to be cooled decrease refrigerating efficiency . Almost without exception those refrigerators so designed and constructed that they cool and deliver drinking water through a faucet have food compartment temperatures which are too high for the adequate protection of food . It is better to put drinking water into bottles , lightly stoppered , and set them into the well-iced refrigerator in the milk or food compartment . In the middle of the floor of the ice compartment in the side icer refrigerator there should be an opening having an area at least one quarter of the total area . In refrigerators having from five to eight cubic feet of food space this cold air outlet is usually from six to eight inches wide and from io to 12 inches long . It is well , when selecting a refrigerator , to remove the ice rack and measure this opening because if it is too small , the refrigerator will not function properly . There should be a space between the ice rack and the walls of the ice compartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the compartment and so through the hole . The surface of the ice rack should stand at least one and one half inches above the bottom of the ice compartment . Otherwise , the flow of air is cramped and , also , there is likely to be sweating of the surface of the metal ceiling of the milk compartment . Thus will the air , cooled by passing over the surface of the ice which is never more than 32 ? F. , find a ready exit into the space where the food is kept . The next item to be sure of is that the air traverses completely the body of the refrigerator and cools every portion of it . A simple and efficient method of guiding the cold air is to extend upward and downward the partition which separates the ice compartment from the food compartment , and to put within this partition some insulator so that it is less cold than all metal would be . Such an extension we call a " baffle " and for the best results it should reach to within five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the refrigerator in cabinets of larger sizes . Then the air falling through the large cold air down drop must continue to fall until it sweeps the floor whereon stand the milk bottles and containers holding the most perishable foods . Then it rises quite evenly , because it is picking up heat as it goes , until it passes over the top of the baffle where there is plenty of space for it to travel easily , and so over the surface of the ice again . The baffle must be solid ? that is , free from openings directly into the food compartment .  | I f such exist , the circulation of air above the level of the ice will be very sluggish and , consequently , the upper part of the refrigerator will be warm . While this defect may not be felt when the refrigerator is full of ice , it will be when the ice level falls . We can easily see that the better the insulation and the better the workmanship , the more space , provided the design of the interior is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this knowledge we can properly reason that a refrigerator having an unduly large proportion of its interior space devoted to ice ? such , for example , as 45 to 50 per cent ? is not so economical a refrigerator nor , all other things being equal , so good a purchase as the refrigerator of the same total interior capacity which is properly cooled with 30 to 40 per cent of that space devoted to ice . Given a total capacity of io cu.ft. , in the one case the housewife would have 6.5 cu . ft. for food space while , with the unduly large ice chamber , she would have but 5 to 5.5 cu . ft. for food . Recently the United States Bureau of Standards fixed the minimum sizes of the door openings and the depth of the ice compartments , ' when they are to accommodate 25 , 50 , 75 , coo and 150 pounds of ice , each quantity to be in a single piece and each to conform to the standard sizes for such weights . ' The most progressive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Standards so that the purchaser , armed with the knowledge , can properly insist upon being provided with such a refrigerator . Equipped when she goes to buy , with a tape measure or a foot rule , she can for herself measure the height , depth and width of the interior and so find the total cubic capacity . Then removing the ice rack , she can measure the height , width and depth of the ice compartment and so determine the proportion which its space bears to the whole . Of course , she will measure the door opening3 to be sure it conforms to the Bureau of Standards requirements . The standardized ice compartments have given the wide awake refrigerator manufacturer a chance to build systematized refrigerators where , with the same amount of space devoted to ice , better building and figure ' Dept. of Commerce , Bureau of Standards , Division of Simplified Practice , Simplified Practice Recommendations R 109 ? 29 : Refrigerator Ice Compartments .

For example , when the walls of the properly-built refrigerator contain the equivalent of one inch of pure corkboard , roo pounds of ice in a standard size ice compartment can refrigerate about five cu . ft. of food space . I f the wall has the equivalent of one and one half inches of corkboard well installed , the roo pounds of ice within the same ice compartment can cool from six to seven cu . ft. of food space . And when we have from two to three inches of pure corkboard insulation , the food space which roo pounds of ice can cool is a minimum of eight cu . ft . The foregoing illustration shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of economical and efficient refrigerator construction , when the ice cut is constant . It applies in principle to the 75 and 50 pound cuts also . Now let us see how the principle might apply if the purchaser had a definite idea in her mind of the amount of food space which her family required and wished to maintain the properly low temperatures necessary at a minimum expense for ice . Should she need about five cu . ft. of refrigerated food space , she could obtain it in a cabinet in which the ice compartment is dimensioned to hold roo pounds of ice . Then the ice compartment would occupy about 40 per cent of the total inside capacity . If , however , she selects a refrigerator having more insulation and better construction , she can have the five cu . f t. of space for food refrigerated with an ice compartment dimensioned for 75 pounds of ice . And with the very best of insulation and construction she will find that five cu . ft. of food space can be refrigerated satisfactorily by an ice compartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of Standards . The space required for 50 pounds of ice when added to the five feet of food space desired by the purchasing housewife gives a total interior volume of about 7.5 cu . ft. of which the ice occupies about 30 per cent of the total insulated space . Let the thrifty housewife remember , also , that ice must melt to cool the ice compartment as well as the food compartment . But because no foodstuffs of any kind should ever be put into the ice compartment , there is no direct return for the ice unnecessarily melted to cool an ice compartment which is larger than it needs to be . Chemists and bacteriologists working in their laboratories have ascertained that an average temperature not to exceed 45 F. in the milk compartment and not to exceed 500 F. in the food compartment is ade-  | quate for the protection of foods in the home . These temperatures have been broadcast far and wide so that the housewife is now familiar with t hem and demands that her refrigerator gives them . SUMMARY The two general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type .

CHARLES BRADLEY SANDERS Plain flat-tone ' paints , tints , wallpapers and commercial wall oilcloths in a cloudy , allover3 pattern make the best backgrounds . For rooms facing north , the best colors are the yellows , ranging from a cream color to a deep pumpkin yellow . For rooms facing south , use light grays , which might range to a deep putty color . In sunny rooms it is possible to use any colors except those which fade easily . On the walls of rooms with northern or eastern exposures , or a combination of both , use warm colors ; southern and western exposures demand cool tones . In the rooms of uncertain exposure , for example where windows on the west conflict with windows on the east , use neutral tones , which are neither warm nor cool colors . NOTE : Although exposure doubtless is the most important factor which influences the choice of color , such considerations as size and shape of rooms , type and size of furniture , and individual preference also should be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a wide doorway between , is to have the walls of both rooms alike , preferably in a neutral color , allover design paper , or plain flat-tone paint . footnote ' From How To Furnish the Small Home ( Better Homes in America , 1929 ) . ' A flat-tone , paint is a paint which contains more turpentine than oil and gives a velvety , smooth finish to walls . 3 An allover design paper includes any of the mottled types or those showing a repetition of a small , close design which lends a soft , cloudy appearance to walls as background .  | There are numerous types of finish for woodwork , such as paint , enamel , stain , waxed or a rubbed finish , and each , in turn , is in good taste , providing it is in harmony with either the furnishings or the wall decoration . Where walls are lightly colored in either a paint or paper , it creates greater harmony to paint the trim white , cream , or ivory . These colors are suitable for Colonial houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bedrooms . Dark woodwork and light walls are not usually in harmony , excepting in the case of all dark furniture ; for example , if the furniture is dark mahogany or walnut , and the house is not strictly of a period , it would be permissible to have mahogany or walnut woodwork . If the furniture is dark oak , woodwork of the same wood and tone would be in harmony . Painting woodwork in any of the light tones creates harmony with light painted or papered walls , while finishing the wood in darker and natural tones makes a contrast , and should be used in connection with the more mellow-colored wall paints or papers . Highly varnished light oak and pine woodwork is the most difficult and trying to make harmonize with either walls or furniture , and should not be considered . Mahogany , walnut , oak and all hardwoods should be finished with either oil , wax or varnish , and rubbed down and finished dull . This helps the woodwork to blend with the furniture and hangings . FINISHES FOR ROUGH AND SMOOTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements of th , background treatment . A familiar principle in their use is that the walls should be lighter than the floor and darker than the ceiling . This customary treatment reflects the out-of-door tonal relations of dark earth , lighter foliage , and luminous sky . But no rule-of-thumb can be applied to so variable a problem ; in a highceiled room the proportions may appear favorably changed by darkening the ceiling several shades below the tone of the walls . The color and tone of the walls , as well as being in harmonious relation to the furniture , should be chosen with reference to the exposure and size of the rooms , the warmer buffs and yellows being in favor for rooms with little sunlight , and lighter shades for small rooms than for spacious ones . Neutral shades , such as buff , ivory , and gray , are safe enough , and often form the most attractive possibility ; but one should not rely too supinely upon the neutrals , because equally suitable and infinitely richer effects may be obtained through more original color-treatments. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , r926 ( Boston : Atlantic Monthly Co. , 1926 ) , pp. 12-15 .

In general , a rough texture or pronounced pattern on the wall diminishes the apparent size of a room . It absorbs the light and makes one more conscious of the nearness of the walls , just as a dark ceiling usually seems lower than a light one . An exception to this statement is found in the skilful use of old-fashioned landscape papers , which lend their distance and perspective to a small room . In general , tone and texture which often pass unnoticed ? through lack of conspicuous qualities tend to make the room seem larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to realize the importance of these and other interlocking details which at first seem obvious and hardly worth mentioning , for they should all be given consideration in choosing the walltreatment . Before making the final selection , the householder should know the possibilities which lie before him PLASTER WALLS AND PAINTED FINISHES ' Plaster walls may be varied by two means , texture and color , and with the possible variations of these two qualities many different effects are attainable . In many rooms the severity of plain plaster walls in neutral tone provides the most successful foil for tapestries or paintings of rich color , while some rooms which lack such distinctive decoration welcome the addition of more perceptible texture and color in the plaster . The modern use of rough plaster finishes , with soft color in plain or stippled effect , can be decorative and satisfactory , but it is easy to overdo unevenness . Moderation , here as elsewhere , is a wise rule . Moreover , where uneven finishes are used , the unevenness should not be mechanically regular . Avoid extremes in designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft and uneven effect of hand finishes , the corner-bead is sometimes omitted from the process of making the corners , and they are molded as squarely as may be by hand .

Actual samples should be required of all wall treatments except footnote ' For illustrations of plaster finishes and plaster glossary see The House Beautiful Furnishing Annual , 1926 , pp. 15-16.  | plain plaster .

If you can not l ) c sure of your visual imagination , try an actual sample in the proposed environment  | Color may be given to plaster walls in two ways : By adding dry color to the plaster before it is applied to the wall , or by painting or calcimining the finished wall . The first method has so far been less practicable than the second , as it requires experience to be sure of obtaining the color desired , and fading has been considered due to the " eating " of the color by the lime in the plaster . Modern materials and methods are removing this objection . Wall paint . The use of flat wall-paint ? dull surface without gloss ? on plaster walls is a practical finish which may be readily washed and kept clean . In most rooms it is preferable to any of the enamel-paint finishes , although in kitchen or bathroom a glossy enamel is clean-looking and easily cared for . As a background for pictures and hangings , in plain color , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The degree of roughness of the wall surface , rather than the applied color , determines the texture in this case . By stippling ? dabbling on the paint from the end of a coarse brush ? a smooth wall may be given more texture , or a rough wall an appropriate finish ; but this , like unevenness of the plaster , is a practice which should be followed in moderation . Avoid much contrast in the tones of color used ; /only a slight variation is pleasant . The same is true of the various other two-toned finishes by which smears of another color than the background are applied with wadded newspaper or similar vehicle . For maintenance , painted walls on account of their washableness are usually preferable to a calcimined finish . Calcimine , however , is perhaps simpler to apply , and is less expensive in preliminary cost . It is often practical to calcimine new walls , then later , after a settling period of a year or two , to wash off the calcimine and apply the permanent treatment . This lowers the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or calcimine is a difficult process , for which a perfect match in tone is requisite , and a light hand on the brush strokes . Calcimine ? cold-water paint ? is usually considered inexpensive enough to make an entire new coat more satisfactory than an attempt at patching . It is generally used in light tints , and always in plain colors . Obviously , the roughness of a wall surface will govern to a certain extent its dust-catching proclivities . But this is not serious enough to alarm any housewife , considering the convenience of wall-brushes , with or without " vacuum " power . Another practical aspect of rough surfaces is their  | scratchiness . For livableness , choose a finish which has no sharp hart it les adhering to it , although it may look comparatively rough . Pargeting. ? An attractive possibility in adding a decorative note to plaster walls in modern non-period rooms is the use of large figures , small patterns in relief , usually arranged unconventionally in the area to be decorated . This is an inheritance from old English work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and naive Tudor animals , flowers , and so forth , but include as well more diffuse patterns of vines and scrolls . Special designs are adaptable for use in this way , the figures being usually cast first and imbedded in the plaster as it is applied , although in some of the old work the plasterer molded the figure as he spread the plaster . Originality in simple effects is attainable with pargeting , and although the informality of the spotting of the small figures may appeal to comparatively few people , the suggestions of ornamental relief may be carried out more conventionally . For instance , an over-mantel decoration in relief is most appropriate in rooms of Spanish as well as of classic inspiration , and gives a satisfying feeling of permanence and individuality . Stenciling. ? Another decoration appropriate to plaster walls is the application of color with a stencil pattern . The misuse of stenciling has given many of us unpleasant associations with it , which may easily be dispelled by a fair consideration of its possibilities . The importance of a design suitable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the connecting links of the pattern which hold together the perforated design ? in most stencils are much to blame for the frequently rudimentary effect of such work . Possibly some design in the upholstery or hangings of the room will provide a motif which can be adapted to its use as a stencil , permitting a judicious distribution of the ties and at the same time adding pleasantly to the decorative unity of the room . The preparation of the pattern and its alignment for use , as well as the preparation and use of colors , demand both good workmanship and good materials . Border patterns are used in numerous ways : Around doors and windows , in decorative panels , or as horizontal borders in the room at any desired height . The majority of stencil patterns are bold enough to be applicable to plaster surfaces of rough texture , and gain in interest from the variation of background . Wall-stenciling should be carefully designed to take its proper place in  | the decorative scheme , and removable samples showing the proposed effect should always be passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stenciling is done in flat paint and enamel paint of the same tone ; with the pattern done in gloss on the dull background , an effect is wrought suggestive of damask . OTHER TREATMENTS FOR SMOOTH PLASTERED WALLS A decorative treatment may be given to smooth plaster walls by paneling . These panels may be made of wood or of plaster molding . Common picture molding often is used , and provides an inexpensive and effective treatment . The difficulty , however , in the laying-out of plaster walls into panels by the use of these moldings is in obtaining proper balance and proportion ; for the room should be properly divided with consideration for doors and windows . For good results in paneling the plaster should be smooth . If it is not , a canvas usually is applied in order to hide cracks and other defects . This canvas is then sized . Generally , it is not considered advisable to panel a wall which has a number of openings.as paneling in such a case would give the appearance of over-ornamentation . Consideration also should be given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its relation in size to other panels . Painting is usually advisable for a wall which has been paneled , and in accordance with other principles of decoration , the moldings and woodwork should be of the same tone , particularly in small rooms . Paneling is inexpensive and is commonly used in inexpensive houses , as it provides a satisfactory decorative wall treatment . The use of canvas is also effective in reconditioning as it hides shabby and worn plaster . If the plaster is too worn , it may be covered with plaster board and then paneled . Antiquing which has been commonly used has not proved highly satisfactory . The results often are " dirty looking , " and the walls do not have the desirable fresh and clean appearance . Antiquing is accomplished both with flat paint and with water color . A common method is to apply a second coat of transparent color over a first coat of flat paint , after the former has become dry . The second coat is then wiped off while still wet . The result is a two-toned effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the appearance of natural wood .  | PLASTIC PAINT ' BY JEANNETTE KILHAM Plastic paint has the same surface appearance as the old ( Timm t it ions materials and is just as permanent . It is , however , far easier to apply . Plastic paint will cover any surface that can be successfully painted and the same general principles which govern the application of paint apply also to plastic paint . Plastic paint , however , has this quality that it provides a uniform coating over a variety of different surfaces such as glass , cement , brick , etc. , which makes it a boon in remodeling . It also covers wall board most successfully providing the joints are properly filled . Surfaces which are to form backgrounds for objects bold in design and color can be richly coated with the material and broadly swept and smoothed with rhythmic sweeps of the trowel or a celluloid triangle , such as an architect uses . The artistry lies in emphasizing the strokes of the implement without placing them too self-consciously or automatically , the heavier the coat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved furniture and gorgeously colored textiles are enhanced by being placed against an effective background of this kind , which offers a subdued contrast of texture . On the other hand , objects fragile in outlines and delicately tinted should be placed against a wall thinly coated with plastic paint and then slightly textured with the brush or stippled . Besides their attractiveness , lightly brushed and stippled textures are practical and economical , particularly where there are large areas to be covered . If a one-coat finish is desired , color is added to the mix before it is applied to the wall . Best results are obtained by tinting with dry or fresco colors of the best grade , avoiding those colors which may fade in water mixes . The color should be broken down in water until it is the consistency of cream . It should be stirred first into a small portion of the plastic paint , which , in turn , is stirred with the whole mix . It is advisable to test the color by force-drying a small sample as some colors dry several shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces , however , is usually applied in a glaze which is washable . The surface is generally sized to kill suction and prepare the surface for the glazing . The glaze , contrary to the mix of plastic paint proper , is tinted with oil colors .

It can be stippled to insure an even distribution and to help in blending the colors . It should be allowed to set a few minutes and then before it becomes tacky wiped evenly and carefully with a cloth rolled into a pad . The wiping removes some of the color from the projections of the texture , giving clear and distinct highlights , and leaves it in the depressions . The finished job results in a pleasing suggestion of light and shade a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been used . Vari-colored finishes are produced by blending separately tinted mixes of glaze . If pastel shades are desired base colors should be toned down by using zinc white The wall finished with plastic paint is textured and colored by hand ; it is a product of the craftsman and as such it is a natural and sympathetic accompaniment to the antiques and other art treasure . One can obtain almost any color effect desired by experimenting a bit with blending different tones . This , with the fact that plastic paint can be applied as readily over an old as over a new surface , makes it an extremely practical interior finish for general use . NOTE : To obtain artistic results from plastic paint the greatest of care should be exercised in its application . ' WALLPAPER AND FABRICATED MATERIALS Wallpaper long has been known as a desirable wall covering . There are many excellent reproductions of Early American and Colonial papers available at moderate cost printed in attractive color and combinations of color . Wallpaper panels ? sections of interesting wallpaper design framed by moldings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and crewel patterns are recommended for paneled rooms . Mr. Matlack Price has discussed , briefly , fabricated ? wall materials and wallpaper in the following paragraphs taken from his article " Wall Treatment : Texture , Color and Design " : ' Chief among fabricated materials , other than wallpapers , which add color and pattern to the interiors , is undoubtedly Sanitas , which of recent years has made a distinct advance in pattern design . Sanitas patterns compare more closely with wallpaper patterns , having abandoned an earlier tendency toward oilcloth , and in a material which , for certain purposes , serves better than wallpaper . If walls are in a bad condition , with old or new cracks , Sanitas , or its newer cousin , Wall-Tex , provides an ideal solution . footnote x In Arts and Decoration , July , 1930 . Printed by courtesy of the Arts and Decoration magazine . p 391 The makers of Sanitas have recently introduced a new wall covering ( nlled Metalline Brocade , a material in " period " patterns , with a lustrous , satin like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising possil , ilit ie , vv I , ( a wall covering can be devised to so closely approximate the effect of rich flhrirs and at the sama time be cleanable with a damp cloth . The new material called Wall-Tex reminds us of the advantage enjoyed any decorative product in which , all other things being equal , the element of figure design has been well and capably styled . Here are designs modern in feeling and technique , and suited in character to city apartment or country home . Quaint chintz patterns , too , provide for interiors that are English or Early American in feeling . As to wallpaper , never before has it been in a stronger position in decorative favor than it is to-day . There was a time when wallpaper , failing to keep abreast of changing tendencies in decoration , came to be thought of as " old-fashioned . " To-day , the situation is entirely different . Importations bring over the very latest in modern patterns from Europe , and our own designers are beginning to create unconventional patterns here . Wallpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , color , and period characteristics , and with the present range offered , the perfect selec-  | tion is entirely up to the decorator . What is more charming , for instance , in a Provencal French interior than a wallpaper reproduction of one of the old Toiles de Jouy ? Or what more perfect for the Early American interior than one of the many reproductions of early wallpapers ? Decorators have enriched wallpapered rooms by antiquing , which is a process that not only enhances the material but preserves it . For simple waterproofing , which will give a glazed effect , clear , transparent varnish is used over a first coat of glue size . After the paper has been given the protection of sizing and varnishing it may be antiqued by a third coat of much diluted orange shellac . At wallpaper stores there may be had a special preparation for antiquing , which produces exactly the degree of mellowing and brings out all the best qualities of the paper . New decorative materials serve new decorative needs and trends , but it is safe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing will ever take its place , nor is anything likely to provide , within reasonable cost , such a versatile decorative resource . The range in wallpaper prices is almost as great as the range in styles , covering papers from sixty cents a roll to papers at three dollars and a half , and upward . The pictorial landscape papers come in sets , and are priced by the set rather than by the roll , with a range from twelve dollars for six-strip sets to seventy-five dollars , and more , for some of the imported sets . Modern decoration calls for wallpaper patterns that are rather delicate in coloring and of a whimsical , often " sketchy " sort of design , departing definitely From the conventional . Many of these have the appearance of being free-hand quality that comes to us through an artist 's direct work . The machine , at last , seems to have been conquered by the makers of modern wallpapers to a point where it does not mechanize a design and delete from it all spontaneity . This , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . The machine , for years , had dominated design and made it a conventional unimaginative thing . Now , in the outstanding instances where authentic original design has come into the field of textiles and wallpapers , the machine has been put to work to interpret and realize , rather than suppress the designer 's expression . Wallpaper , however , like our other decorative resources , has not gone entirely modern . While it has shown a progressive spirit in the production of essentially modern designs , it has , by no means , discontinued its historic reproductions or its more conventional styles . There are still the highly stylized flock papers that rival in depth and texture the rich fabrics they reproduce , and there are still the quaint and charming floral papers that bring the colors and patterns of decorative chintzes into the room .

Wallpaper Guild of America , 465 Eighth Ave. , New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all the variety of modern materials available for wall covering , choice among them rests entirely with the kind of house you have , or the kind of room , which may be anything from Elizabethan to ultra-modern . To begin with the oldest materials , there are plaster , wood paneling and tiles ; to proceed to the less old , there is wallpaper ; and to proceed further , to more modern ideas , there are such materials as glass , vitrolite , sani-onyx and chromite . If the house be Norman , Elizabethan , English cottage old or new , or if it be Spanish or Italian , plaster walls are preferred , perhaps with paneling in the Elizabethan house . Spanish or Italian types , moreover , and especially the former , are full of ideal opportunities to use decorative glazed tiles . In houses of Colonial or Early American derivation , certain plaster finishes can be used , always wood paneling and always wallpaper . The modern in interior treatments is not so stylized by precedent : You can use any of these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fashioned " ) and you can use various new materials , such as glass , cork , or vitrolite . Let us make a few specific notes . First , there is plaster , with all its finishes , from semi-smooth to textures as rough as you please , and plaster , too , is modeled in decorative ceilings or in bas-relief incidents which may be built in . And for the formal interior , and especially for the foyer or hall , there is cast trouvertine , marked in the effect of ancient masonry . A great deal of variety has been added to plasterwork by the development of colored plasters and by the ready availability , now , of really welldesigned and well-cast mantles , placques , bas-reliefs and other decorative incidents . The makers of these casts now go to authentic sources for their models instead of putting out the very poor castings that tended to discredit the whole art of plastering . This , is , in fact , an art usually performed with a higher degree of appreciation by the Italian workman than by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine artistry and craftsmanship of Renaissance Italy . With good , sound plasterwork as a base , there appears to be , at the footnote ' Adapted from " The Walls of Your Home , " Arts and Decoration , March , 1930 . Printed by courtesy of Arts and Decoration magazine .  | present time , a revived popularity for decorative glazed tiles , which are to be had in a wide range of good colors and pleasing patterns . Tiles have been welcomed with joy by lay decorators who do unconventional modern decoration , because there is no limit to the colors or arrangements possible . Being small units , tiles are particularly adaptable to whatever scheme the decorator wants to execute . Nor are tiles the only wall material . Vitrolite and opaque glass are constantly revealing new possibilities . Combined with built-in mirrors and colored plumbing fixtures , here are unthought of possibilities . Even the ceiling is now " glazed " with slabs of these materials , and it is doubtful if anything more sophisticated , more decoratively exotic , than black glass has ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other color , such as jade green or coral , black glass has an incomparable depth and richness . Orchid , grey , gold , amber ? here are colors to conjure with , and the new bath-dressing-rooms , designed in the new wall materials , are like nothing that has ever been attempted before , except in a few isolated instances . Color ranges that include jade and sapphire and turquoise shapes of all kinds ? patterns from odd floral motifs to quaint animals and figures , or a grand Spanish galleon sailing over a singing blue sea ? what materials for any decorator to work with ! All these tiles are not of baked clay : Some are of new and special materials , such as sani-onyx , which is a vitreous substance , or chromite , smooth , flint-hard material that is cemented to the wall in sheet form . Each offers practical as well as esthetic advantages ; we are living in an age of new materials which are revolutionizing interior decoration . We are offered new textures , new colors , new possibilities of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern departure end here . Some vibrant effects have been obtained in sheet metal and leather . The new decorators , to whom precedent is only another term for anathema , have argued that , if tiles , sometimes a floor material , may be used for walls , why not use cork tiles , normally a floor material , for walls ? Cork has , indeed , much to offer for unusual walls . Rich and mellow in its natural color , deeper still when waxed ; soft and interesting in texture , it is also an absorber and deadener of sound . The moderns have looked at various woods , too , and seen in them pos-  | sibilities that have nothing to do with our old ideas of wood rooms , which were paneled . They have seen figure as wood 's chief claim to decorative value , and are using it in great , flat , unpaneled expanses PANELED WALLS OF WOOD ' BY H. VANDERVOORT WALSH Professor of Architecture , Columbia University One of the basic principles in all the arts is that any composition must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to belong together to form one thing . A building may be unified by virtue of being one unit , as for example a small house of rectangular shape , covered with a simple gable roof . But , if we go beyond one part and have a number , it is essential that we produce unity by making one central part much more important than the others . A house consisting of a number of extensions should be so designed that these additions are made less high and bulky than the main body of the house . Now the same is true with the interior of the home . A sense of unity must be produced by the room arrangement inside . The living room should be bigger , have a higher ceiling and be more elegantly treated than any other room , so that it may dominate the plan and give a sense of unity to the house . This is important in the small house . There are a number of ways of doing this . The length and width of the living room may be made quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling may be made higher by not covering the floor beams with plaster , increasing their thickness , separating them further apart than usual and so letting the flooring on top of them serve as the ceiling . If one can afford it , the living room which extends up two stories in height is most effective . This however is an uneconomical thing to do in a small house . But there is another way of giving importance to the living room which is neglected in the American home . It is to cover the walls with wood paneling and have exposed wooden beams on the ceiling . A living room which is decorated in this manner seems to be , if it is properly done , more homelike , than one decorated in any other way . There is a sense of warmth and intimacy about walls of wood . The rich colors and the variations of texture produced by the grain lend an air of dignity Not only do the panels seem warmer , but they actually are , especially if one coat of plaster has been put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paneled Walls of Wood for the Small Home , " Small Home , May , 1929.  | Without effort , a living room decorated with wood paneling dominates the plan and produces that unity which is necessary in any artistic composition . It becomes the center of the family life , and the members gravitate to it without effort . It is not like so many living rooms which are vacant , except when company comes . Often , home-owners , although realizing all of these qualities , hesitate to have wood-paneled rooms , fearing the cost will be prohibitive . This fear figure is usually well founded , for wood paneling as installed in the homes of the wealthy and designed after the finest of Tudor or French traditions is work for a cabinetmaker . Yet it is possible to select types of paneling that are beautiful , and which can be put on by the ordinary carpenter , at a reasonable price . Old English cottages offer some suggestions as to the methods of paneling that are simple enough for any carpenter to make . One method , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade which the  | old carpenters had . Vertical boards were laid up so that every of her one was forward of those on either side of it , by about one halt the thi1 luu ? ss of the board . This was done by having tongues along each edge of hall .. l the boards and grooves along the edges of the other half . By fitting the boards together in this staggered fashion , a feeling of thickness and variety of shade resulted . Other similar methods were used in early times . In our own Colonial period there were similar wooden partitions constructed , but they were slightly more elaborate . Boards about 18 " wide were cut to make a lap joint at the edges , and then ornamented by an interesting molding to hide the joint . Sometimes a molding was also run down the middle of the board to resemble the joint molding , and make the board seem narrower . To-day , if we could get a board as wide as t8 " , we would be so proud of it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like two narrower boards . We can easily sheathe our walls , to-day , with this type of wood finish . Boards of pine , redwood , Douglas fir and yellow pine , or cypress are very well suited to this type of decoration . An ordinary carpenter can do the work too . In finishing this boarding , wax rubbed into the wood and slightly colored with burnt umber brings out the warmth of the wood and makes a somewhat dull finish in harmony with the simplicity and crudeness of this kind of wood wainscoting . Ornamental effects , something like carving , can be obtained with the sand-blasting method , at very little additional expense . Designs can be made to stand out on the board by shielding selected surfaces of the wood from the eating action of the sand . Patterns of the design are cut from manila paper and pasted on the board , so that the portion of the wood under the paper is shielded against the corroding action of the sand blast . When the process is completed and the paper removed , the ornament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects can be obtained by staining the patterns . Redwood is particularly attractive when treated in this manner . Of course it will be next to impossible to secure boards as wide as IS " , as did our Colonial fathers , but even if it were , they would split under the action of our steam heat in the winter months . However , broad and fine surfaces of wood can be obtained , even more beautiful in grain than ordinary boards , by using plywood . This is a wood board , constructed of three layers of thin veneer . The interior layer has its grain at right angles to the exterior layers . These veneers are glued together under  | great pressure and are more durable than real boards . Widths of four and five feet are possible which do not crack under the drying action of steam heat . As the exterior veneer is especially selected for its richness of grain , some charming effects are possible . Nearly all of our native woods are made up into these plywood boards , and they are quite reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low but it is a better type of construction than solid boards . Panels made from plywood will not warp or crack so easily . From the earliest times , carpenters have realized that wood swells in moist weather and shrinks in dry weather and that nothing can prevent this action . This movement of wood is more pronounced across the grain than in its length . A wide board will shrink and swell in its width a good deal , but very little in its length . Knowing this , carpenters and cabinetmakers have developed a method of building panels which has not changed much even in these days of new things . Narrow boards , two and three inches wide , are used to build a frame for the panels of wood . If a room is to be covered with panels , these framing boards , if horizontal , are called rails and if vertical are called styles or muntins . Along their edges are cut grooves into which the edges of the panels can be fitted . Thus the panel boards are held in place but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails and muntins were made about two and three quarters of an inch wide . The edges were cut with a rebate so that the panels slipped behind them . In cross section they were something like a T with a very wide stem and narrow cross bar . Some rails , however , were made like an H in cross section and the edges of the panels were fitted into the slots . The proportions of the panels were quite well established . The width was to the height as 3 is to 5 . Usual dimensions in inches were r 2 " wide and 20 " high . The horizontal rails were usually continuous strips and the muntins were cut into short lengths and fitted in between the rails . Moldings were cut along the edges of the muntins , and a molding added at the top of the panel under the rail to match and miter at the corners . No molding was carried along the bottom of the panel , but the upper edge of the rail was chamfered . The panel itself was about one inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most in vogue was the so called linenfold . Now to build paneling of this type to-day is a cabinetmaker 's job and the cost is rather great . However , there is a way of constructing it so that it has much the same character , but is very much less difficult to build ,  | and is therefore more in keeping with the economics which must be bract iced in the small house . This is the way to do it . First cover the studding with gypsum boa rd s or lath and one coat of rough plaster to serve as a fire stop behind the wood paneling . The position of the various muntins and rails in relation to the openings in the room must , of course , be laid off in a drawing . To maintain good character , the size of the panels should be as near to 12 " wide to 20 " high as possible . Use plywood , veneered on one side with oak , in lengths which will go roughly from floor to ceiling . Paint the back with linseed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dampness . Nail all joints in a position where they will be behind rails or muntins . This of course is also true of the position of nail heads . On top of the walls thus sheathed with plywood , nail the horizontal rails , consisting of plain oak boards 24 " wide by " thick . The short lengths of vertical muntins can also be nailed on . Then apply along the edges of the rails and muntins , mitering at the corners , an oak molding having the right character of profile . It is best not to nail these moldings or rails too firmly together for the lirst year , for as the house settles , some stresses will be set up in this paneling , and if free to move a little , the wood will not split . After the first year , more nails can be driven in . Counter sink these nails where they show and fill up the holes with plastic wood compound . The effect of wood paneling of this type is very pleasing , besides being very much cheaper to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the middle of the panels rubbed with steel wool to lighten up the stain and add a high-light and then wax applied , a very rich room decoration will result . An even less expensive paneled effect can he secured by using plywood of Douglas fir Ind styles of the same wood . The graining of the fir is very beautiful for the veneers are taken from the out layer of the tree and since the logs are sa4great , and the cut is almost parallel to the annual ring of the new growth all the irregularities of the new growth produce a curling , twisting grain of great interest . This wood paneling will look best if no stain is applied . A stain will accentuate the grain so much that it will give the room a restless feeling . The unstained wood , finished with a little wax , in which burnt umber has been added , will be quieter and more cheerful . As the general tone is amber color , the room will not be as dark and heavy as one paneled with oak . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materials for paneling of this  | type cost about $85 . The labor of applying will be about as much again . The same paneling done in the real manner would cost in the neighborhood of $1,000 WOODWORK FINISHES ' For unity 's sake in the modern house where the rooms may so easily be thrown together by the use of the ever charming French doors , or open doorways , the woodwork in all the rooms on each floor , especially in the main living rooms , usually should be finished alike . The necessary variety can then be introduced in the wall finish . Of course if one plans to give each room a distinctly different character the woodwork should be finished accordingly , but the surest and sirnplest method , unless one is an artist , is to finish the woodwork in all the rooms on each floor alike . All built-in features , bookcases , buffets or window seats should be finished in the same manner . The usual finishes for woodwork may be divided into two main types : Natural and painted or enameled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthened and brought out by the use of transparent finishes : Stain and varnish ; or stain , shellac and wax . By the second the surface of the wood is entirely covered . Because all woods do not take the same finish equally well , in planning a house the choice of wood finish desired should determine the choice of material for the wood trim . Soft woods like whitewood or poplar do not take the natural finish well . Cypress or birch cost very little more and take stain very well . Other good woods for natural finish are oak , gumwood , and spruce . Pine varies greatly , usually it is better painted . It always seems a pity , sometimes almost a desecration , to paint beautiful hardwood , especially oak . WOODWORK IN TI-IE NATURAL FINISH At present this method of finishing is somewhat in disrepute because of the very natural reaction from the orgy of " golden oak " and artificially grained woodwork of the past era in decoration . The trouble , however , is not with the finish , but because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than properly finished rich dark woodwork , particularly for the main rooms of the house . Especially if the walls are paneled this finish has a richness , an elegance , and a dignity not equalled by any other . Adapted from Decorative and Practical Treatments for Woodwork and Walls . Good footnote Ilousekeeping Institute , 5926.  | I mproperlydone , however , it has no claims to beauty . Many people hesitate to use wood paneling because of the expense , when in fact this knish has many claims for real economy on the score of durability and permanent ( . From the housewife 's point of view the dark natural finish rates high , as it is undoubtedly very easy to care for . The artificial graining of soft woods to represent hard woods is an imitation that should not be tolerated . The need of simple honesty in the construction and finish of our homes to-day can not be emphasized too often . figure STAINING AND FINISHING The quality and grain of the wood should be enriched and strengthened by staining . This is most important as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . Very interesting effects can be worked out on open grain woods such as oak , cypress or birch by the use of a paste filler in connection with the stain . The purpose of the filler is not only to fill up the open pores of the wood but to bring out the pattern of the grain in a tone either slightly darker or lighter than the stain . In this way the natural beauty of the wood is enhanced . The final finish after the stain may be shellac and wax ; or dull varnish . The steps in the proper finishing of natural woodwork are :  | A priming coat of raw linseed oil and turpentine stain of color required . When dry follow with careful sandpapering with the grain with No. oo sandpaper . Coat of white shellac . Paste wax rubbed in , or After stain , two coats of interior varnish , preferably dull finish . Varnish should be lightly rubbed with No. oo sandpaper between coats . The cost of labor and materials to-day makes it quite expensive to finish natural woodwork properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been devised , most of which , while reducing cost , reduce quality also . Some specifications call for only two coats the first of stain and filler , the second a flat drying varnish . These methods are rarely satisfactory . PAINTED AND ENAMELED WOODWORK By this method the surface of the wood is entirely concealed . Enamel is better than paint for the purpose , as by its use a new surface is built up coat by coat . The success of the final work depends upon the carefulness with which the undercoats have been applied . No directions need be given here as each manufacturer has worked out the necessary steps for his product . For first class enameling , not less than five coats should be given . I f soft wood has been used for the trim it should be painted . Light woodwork will brighten dark rooms . With painted woodwork it is possible to achieve perfect harmony between walls and woodwork because of the wide variety of tints and shades possible . In some very beautiful houses the walls and woodwork are painted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small children , does require much cleaning , a factor to be considered by the housewife who does her own work . CHOICE OF COLOR For some time white was most favored , but now the range of choice has widened to include ivory , tan , sand , putty , and many tones of gray . Unconsciously white surfaces are often a strain on both eyes and nerves , a good reason for using other colors for interior finishing . The practice among the best decorators at present is to paint all the woodwork , including doors , t he sane color as the walls . ' Where the wall is papered , however , this is not always possible . Where the paper has a white or cream footnote Good effects may be obtained , however , by painting woodwork a shade darker than the walls , particularly where light colors are used for wall finishes .  | ground , cream is the best choice for the woodwork .

Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue papered wall of rather a heavy color , the woodwork would be better cream than pure white , as white makes a very strong contrast . Tan , sand and putty , by their very neutrality , are delightful colors , and on the score of cleaning effect a compromise between light woodwork and dark . Blue , green , yellow , or blue-green are sometimes permissible with ivory walls for the sunroom , or an informal breakfast room and for some bedrooms COLOR IN WOODWORK .... A little experimenting along the lines suggested will open up infinite possibilities of variation in the use of color for woodwork . Generally a neutral and not a dominant tone should be selected for the large surfaces of the wood trim . Touches and accents of color , in the way of linings and stripings in the moldings , may be employed in the more informal rooms , the bedrooms , the breakfast room and the sunroom . In fact , in the finishing of these rooms it is quite permissible to vary our principle of finishing all the woodwork on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room may be done in a different hue according to the color scheme being carried out . FACTORS TO CONSIDER BEFORE CHOOSING WALL COLOR ' Exposure and number of windows. ? In south rooms which have many windows and are sunshiny and light , cool colors , grayed in intensity and medium in value , may be used to soften the light . North rooms , or rooms with few windows , usually need light , warm colors . Grayed colors with yellow in them will give cheer and light to these rooms . Uses of the room . Since the living room is the room which must be shared by a number of people and is the most impersonal room in the home , inconspicuous wall color will give the most restful background .

Floor Finishes and Coverings FLOOR FINISHES ' New wood floors may be finished in a variety of ways , depending partly on the kind of wood and partly on individual preference . Wool finishers themselves often disagree about the best method of treating floors , but all agree that it is economy to use the best materials . The present tendency , for hardwood floors particularly , is to keep the natural color of the wood and at the same time give it a smooth , durable finish that can be cleaned and renewed with the minimum of effort . Though darker-colored floors generally give the best effects , light-colored floors have the advantage of showing dust and footprints less readily . Stain , filler , oil , paint , varnish , shellac , and wax , or a combination of t.wo or more of these materials , may be used . Oak and maple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorless filler , white shellac , and lightcolored wax or pale varnish , a treatment that preserves the natural color of the wood with little change . A somewhat golden tone can be obtained by using orange shellac or dark varnish . Before any finish is applied , the floor should be made smooth by planing and sandpapering parallel with the grain of the wood , and then swept and dusted with a soft cloth STAINING Stains are used on floors to bring out the grain of the wood , or to make them harmonize in color with other woodwork or with furnishings , or to give certain softwoods tones similar to hardwoods . Oil and water stains , so called because of the solvent used , are the common kinds . Oil stains are easy to apply evenly and do not raise the grain of the wood , but they do not penetrate very deeply and are likely to give a muddy effect . Water stains , on the other hand , soak in readily , give a clear color , and are cheaper than oil stains , but raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time may be necessary . Water stains may be used on either hardwoods or softwoods , but as a rule oil stains are not so successful an hardwoods . Both water and oil stains may be bought ready mixed , or some of the simple ones can be made at home . In any case , before using , the stain should be tested on an inconspicuous part of the floor or on a sample of the same kind of wood . If the color is too intense , the stain should be footnote ' Adapted from Floors and Floor Coverings . Farmers ' Bull . 1219 . Bureau of Ionic Economics , U.S. Department of Agriculture , 5925 . For formulas for making stains , varnish and varnish remover , and wax see ibid.  | diluted with the kind of solvent with which it is mixed or with other suitable liquid . For example , an oil stain may be diluted with turpentine , and a water stain with water . If an oak floor is to be water-stained , coating it first with clear water and sandpapering it smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain to raise the grain of the wood . Oil stains will be absorbed more evenly by pine or maple floors if the wood is first coated with a mixture of 3 parts turpentine and z part linseed oil and the surface sandpapered smooth after it is dry . Stains should be applied rather thinly with a clean brush or a sponge with even strokes taken parallel with the grain of the wood . With water stains especially , care should be taken not to let the strokes overlap , and the stained surface should be wiped at once with a soft cloth or cotton waste . Oil stains should be allowed to set for a few minutes before the surface is wiped . Two coats of light stain generally give a better effect than one coat of heavy stain . In general , r gallon of oil stain will coat about 400 square feet of floor once , depending , of course , on the depth of color desired and the texture of the wood . After a floor is stained , it should be allowed to dry for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as possible . When thoroughly dry , it should he polished with a weighted brush covered with carpet , after which it is ready for the filler and wax or varnish . Some of the very porous woods may be filled and stained at the same time by combining the stain and the filler , but generally a better effect is obtained by applying them separately . FILLING Porous woods , such as oak and ash , take a smoother and more durable finish if a good paste filler is rubbed into them before the varnish , wax , or shellac is applied . Maple , pine , and other nonporous woods do not need such treatment and in fact will not absorb some kinds of fillers . The best paste fillers are made of silex ( silica ) , linseed oil , turpentine , japan , and coloring matter to match the wood . Cornstarch and whiting are also used as the base of paste fillers , but are less transparent than silex and can not be worked into the pores of the wood so thoroughly . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to obtain in the retail trade . Oil has a tendency to darken wood , so it is sometimes omitted from the filler if a very light finish is desired .  | A filler should be about the consistency of varnish when applied . If too thick , it can be thinned with turpentine for use on nat unit colored woods , or with boiled linseed oil on stained woods . After the toor has been dusted , the filler is generously applied lengthwise of the grain with a clean stiff brush . This coating is allowed to set for 15 or 20 minutes , or until it turns gray , and is then rubbed in with cotton waste or burlap crosswise , not lengthwise , of the grain . A coarser material will drag the filler out of the pores instead of forcing it in . Several days later the floor is rubbed smooth with No.o sandpaper slightly dampened on the back . Ordinary oak will take up about 5 pounds of filler to 250 square feet of floor . If a very high polish is desired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turpentine may be applied and rubbed down as in the first case . Liquid fillers are sometimes used on close-grained woods to fill up the pores and preveni the absorption of the more expensive varnish . A pure shellac varnish made by dissolving gum shellac in alcohol is recommended by some authorities for this purpose . The ready-mixed liquid fillers , which are brushed on and permitted to remain on the surface without being rubbed off , are in many cases little better than cheap varnishes . VARNISHING Varnish gives floors a hard , smooth , glossy finish , and is easy to apply and to clean . Under hard usage , however , it is likely to wear off , leaving patches of bare wood that remain unsightly even after revarnishing . Successive coats tend to darken the floor . Varnish is a common finish for softwood floors , but wax is preferred by many for hardwood . Manufacturers have tested and put on the market an assortment of varnishes adapted to special uses , and it is often better to buy one of these ready-made standard floor varnishes than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly classified into two groups , spirit and oil . The spirit varnishes are made by dissolving a resinous substance , such as gum shellac , in alcohol or some other volatile liquid . They dry quickly , leaving a hard , brittle coating on the wood , and , with the exception of shellac varnish , are not commonly used on floors . Successive coats of shellac varnish well rubbed down may be used alone on a floor , or one ccat may be used as a surfacer on a paste-filled hardwood floor that is to be waxed . For the first coat , i gallon of shellac will cover 300 to 400 square feet of floor , and additional coats will of course require less . Parquetry floors are generally shellacked in order to preserve the light color of the wood .  | The oil varnishes contain resinous gum , oil , and driers , carefully heated and blended so as to bring out certain properties . Most of the floor varnishes are of this type and of the kind known in trade as " medium oil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have luster , hardness , and greater durability . Spar varnishes belong to the kind known as " longoil " and contain an even larger proportion of oil , which makes them more durable and impervious to water . They are sometimes used on kitchen and bathroom floors , where those characteristics are of particular importance . The first rule of varnishing is to have the surface of the wood and the air in the room as free from dust as possible and to use only scrupulously clean brushes . Varnish brushes are chisel shaped or slightly tapering ; a rather wide one will be most convenient for this work . The varnish should be brushed on lengthwise of the grain in a smooth , thin coat without laps or brush marks and allowed to dry for at least two days . If possible , the temperature of the room should be 700 F. or higher and the varnish should be applied in the morning , for it dries better during daylight . When the first coat is thoroughly dry another coat or perhaps several more coats should be applied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of varnish put on a floor , the more durable the finish . One gallon of floor varnish is enough for two coats on about 300 square feet of oak floor or about 200 square feet of pine . WAXING Waxing is considered by many the most attractive and practicable finish for hardwood floors . It preserves the natural color of the wood , brings out the beauty of the grain , and is easily revived and renewed . Given the proper care , waxed floors improve with age , even under hard usage . In some of the European palaces , for instance , floors that have been polished for centuries with nothing but wax are still bright and beautiful in color though now worn thin by use . The chief objections to waxed floors are the amount of labor required to polish them and the fact that water turns the finish white . These water spots , however , may be quickly removed by rubbing on a little wax with a woolen cloth or a weighted brush . Wax of various kinds dissolved in turpentine is the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or paraffin , or a combination of these may be used , and gasoline , ammonia , or some other volatile solvent is often used in addition to the turpentine .  | Wax may be applied to a floor that has been stained , painted , or varnished , or directly on the bare wood . Hardwood floors are generally paste lilted and in many cases surfaced with shellac varnish before being wa %ed . The paste fills up the pores , and the shellac varnish makes a hard founda tion for the wax and prevents grease from penetrating and staining the wood . A waxed floor will be less slippery , however , if the shellac is omit t ed or if only a very thin coat is applied and well sandpapered . Success in waxing floors lies in applying the wax in thin coats and rubbing it a great deal . One pound will coat about 250 square feet of floor . After the preliminary coats of filler or varnish are thoroughly dry , the wax should be rubbed on with a woolen cloth , a piece of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight . The next morning the floor should be polished lengthwise of the grain with a weighted brush or a heavy block wrapped in woolen cloth , burlap , or old carpet . Then one or perhaps two more coats of wax should be applied and rubbed down in the same way as the first . OILING Oiling is a rather common and economical way of finishing kitchen , pantry , bathroom , and porch floors and is by many considered more satisfactory for pine floors than varnishing . Oil is easy to apply , gives a finish that is durable and not slippery , and penetrates the pores of the wood so that it is proof against grease and water spots . Oiled floors , however , darken with use and in time become dingy because dust clings to them and unites with the oil on the surface . Boiled linseed oil is the kind most commonly used and may be applied clear , either hot or cold , or combined with turpentine , which makes it penetrate the wood better and leave a thinner film on the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended for pine floors . If desired , a floor may be stained before it is oiled , but in any case it should be clean , dry , and free from dust when the oil is applied . The oil should be brushed on lengthwise of the grain of the wood , rubbed in with a soft oily cloth , and any excess wiped off with a dry cloth . After the oil has dried for a few hours , the floor may be polished with a weighted brush covered with a clean woolen cloth or piece of carpet . Most floors will al ) sorb two coats of oil . PAINTING Paint is very commonly used on softwood floors , but is not a very durable finish , and worn places can seldom be satisfactorily patched .  | Painted floors are , however , easy to clean , for the paint forms a coat impervious to water and grease , and they can be made to match or harmonize with woodwork or furnishings . Paints , like varnishes , vary in durability according to the materials in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or they may be mixed at home . If only one or two floors are to be painted , one of the ready-mixed kinds will be found more economical and convenient , and one gallon will generally be enough for three coats on about 200 to 300 square feet of floor . White lead , zinc white , linseed oil , drier , and coloring matter are the chief ingredients in a good floor paint . A kitchen floor should have three coats of paint , and the wood should he clean , dry , and free from dust before the paint is applied . According to the United States Bureau of Standards , the first coat should consist of white lead in linseed oil , with a little drier ; the second coat , of equal parts of white lead and zinc white in oil , coloring matter as desired , and drier and turpentine to give a flat finish ; and the third coat , of the same materials as the second , except that instead of turpentine good floor varnish should be added in the proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each coat of paint should be thoroughly brushed into the wood , lengthwise of the grain , and allowed ample time to dry . If desired , a coating of equal parts turpentine and linseed oil may he rubbed on with a soft cloth after the last coat of paint has dried thoroughly , and the floor then polished with a woolen cloth . ' Phis gives a soft lustrous finish and makes the paint wear longer . TYPES OF RUGS ' BY ELSIE RICHARDSON Carpets were originally made by hand , now the majority of them are woven on power looms . Brussels , Wilton , Velvet and Axminster are the principal kinds . There are also machine-made Oriental , ingrain , rag , fiber and grass carpets and rugs . All carpets and rugs are made of warp threads which are set lengthwise in the loom and woof threads set crosswise . All carpets and rugs are divided into the following classes : Flat carpets and rugs. ? May be used on either side , as rag , ingrain , fiber and grass .

Are Wilton , Axminster and Velvet . . Brussels rugs. ? Are made by looping yarn over a series of long wires ; when weaving is completed the wires are withdrawn , leaving loops in the yarn . The quality of Brussels rugs may be judged by the number of loops to a square inch , the kind of backing and whether the surface thread shows on the backing . For each loop or tuft on the surface , there are four strands of yarn buried in the body . This gives the Body Brussels its name . They are all worsted and dyed in the yarn . The loops are not as high as the pile of a Wilton . Body Brussels is the best of this type and is very serviceable . Tapestry is an imitation of the Brussels , made according to the same principle . It is a loop faced fabric , with a wool surface . The design is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all used up on the surface and none is carried to the back . Because the design is printed on the thread , it is not so clearly outlined on the finished rug . Wilton rugs are woven in the same way as the Brussels , except when the wires are withdrawn , a sharp knife on the end cuts each loop . This leaves a straight , long , upstanding pile . A real Wilton rug is dyed in the yarn , and a greater amount of pure , worsted yarn is used in it than in any other rug . Colors in the surface yarns are carried to the back as in the Brussels . The wearing qualities of the Wilton are excellent . Axminster rugs are of the cut-pile type . The yarn is dyed and the surface is of wool . They are woven somewhat on the same principle as the Wilton , but the method adapts itself to a greater variety in color and design . They are not so heavy and not so closely woven , which makes them less expensive . The Axminster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wearing qualities are not so good as in the Wilton or Brussels , it is exceedingly good for the price . Velvet rugs also have cut-pile and resemble the Wilton . They are made exactly on the same principle as the Tapestry , except that the loops are cut . It has wool only on the surface and the design is printed in the thread before weaving . Velvet corresponds to Tapestry , as Wilton does to Brussels in the process of making as well as wearing qualities . Oriental rugs are hand woven by people of the Eastern Countries . They are dyed in the yarn with vegetable dyes . The designs are all symbolical . The value depends upon age , quality of material and richness of color and design . The real Orientals are exquisite and wear wonderfully well . They are extremely expensive and out of reach of the moderate income . There are many machine-made or American Orientals on the market at the  | present time that are very fine imitations of the real Oriental . Most of them are Wiltons with Oriental designs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are sometimes used for other rooms in the house . These rugs usually have a cotton warp and a filling of wool fiber , flax , grass or twisted paper . Dyes are not very lasting in these rugs , but they may be freshened by brushing on new dye : In comparison to the price of these rugs , they are fairly durable and good in design and color . Linoleum is the most commonly used covering for kitchen , pantry and bathroom floors , and is used to some extent in the other rooms in the house . Linoleum may be the neutral background for other furnishings , or it may be the decorative element in the room . It must be chosen according to the same principles in design as other floor coverings . Linoleum is made of linseed oil and ground cork . It is mixed to a plastic mass and applied to a burlap backing . There are three standard types of linoleum , plain , printed and inlaid . The color of plain linoleum is put into the mixture before it is applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , color extends to the backing and is good as long as the linoleum lasts . Plain colors show soil very easily . Plain linoleums are protected if they are kept waxed . Printed linoleum is simply plain linoleum with a design stamped on the surface . The design will wear off . Varnish is a great protection to this type of linoleum . Inlaid linoleum is the type in which the patterns are made separately and pressed into the backing . The colors are always good . To distinguish between an inlaid and printed linoleum , examine the cut edge . If the color extends to the backing in all designs , it is inlaid . To protect inlaid linoleum , it should be waxed . TYPES OF LINOLEUM AND CORK COMPOSITION FLOOR COVERINGS ' By C. STANLEY TAYLOR President of Taylor , Rogers &; Bliss , Inc . Resilient flooring materials are the outgrowth of a definite need for a suitable and economical floor over wood , concrete and other hard floor surfaces , and for a material which can be easily applied as a replacement footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Architectural For 2on , October , 1928.  | floor over old floors of any type . Cork composition products and rubber are the principal flooring materials having resiliency as a dominant characteristic . They have been evolved through many years of development and improvement , and have to-day reached a state of perfection and quality which places them very definitely in the class of quality materials having distinctive characteristics not present in similar combinations in any other type of floor surfacing material . We are concerned in this discussion primarily with cork and cork composition floorings , which are known in the trade under the general titles of linoleum , linoleum tile , natural cork tile , and cork carpet . The evolution of cork composition flooring materials from the status of a floor cover to that of a finished flooring material has been slow , and architects have only recently awakened to the intrinsic values which such materials possess as contrasted with their use primarily as substitutes or replacement coverings . It must be acknowledged to-day that these products have earned for themselves a definite , permanent place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , builders and owners new opportunities for creating special effects in color , pattern and texture and for introducing other values of comfort , quietness , sanitation and maintenance that particularly adapt them to solving many modern flooring problems . Types of cork flooring products. ? The various types of resilient flooring materials , of which cork in some form is the principal component , each possess special characteristics which make it important to differentiate one from the other , both in this discussion and in the use and specification of such materials . The prevalent use of trade names to distinguish the various types of products is somewhat confusing and we must go back of the distinguishing and commonly employed trade names and classify the products in another manner . There are three major classes of cork flooring products : ( 1 ) Cork composition floorings , broadly termed linoleums and linoleum tiles ; ( 2 ) natural cork tiles ; ( 3 ) cork carpets . Their characteristics deserve consideration . Natural cork flooring products . Cork tiles are composed of particles of cork , such as the thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the manufacture of cork bottle stoppers . These particles are compressed under heat in such a manner that the natural gums of the cork are liquefied and form the only binder required to produce a firm , rigid , and homogeneous product . The better grades of natural cork tile contain nothing but pure cordL without any of the harder bits of cork bark or other foreign ingredients . ' the tile forms come in various sizes , usually in square  | or rectangular shapes , and in thicknesses ranging from approximately 4-inch to - inch . Natural cork tiles take their color from the cork itself and from the baking process which is essential to their manufacture . They are thus available only in natural cork browns of various shades , ranging from light to dark , according to the amount of heat applied . The extreme hydraulic pressure usually employed in the manufacture of cork flooring produces a material which is quite resistent to wear and abrasion , and which is at the same time highly resilient , quiet and pleasant to walk upon . Cork composition flooring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a principal ingredient . The cork is pulverized almost to the fineness of flour and is mixed with oxidized linseed oil and various gums , fillers and pigments . The mixture is compressed under huge heated calender rolls onto a burlap backing employed as a measure of reinforcement on the underside . A process of curing the cork composition aids in producing a firm , homogeneous material of considerable resiliency which will not buckle or crack and which is practically free from odor . Cork composition floorings are available in many forms and in a number of distinct types . . The sheet forms may be classified as Battleship Linoleum , Jaspe , Inlaid Linoleum , Embossed Linoleum and Marbleized Linoleum . Battleship Linoleum is a high quality , plain color cork composition flooring in sheet form , which earned its name from its original use as a decking material over the steel decks of warships . It is available in various thicknesses from slightly less than s-inch to a full 4-inch . Jaspe Linoleum is distinguished by its striated pattern in two tones of a single color , giving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is otherwise similar to Battleship Linoleum in its composition , and is usually available in three weights . Small insets of contrasting color are frequently used in Jaspe Linoleum with interesting effects . Inlaid Linoleums have various patterns in which each individual color runs through to the burlap back . In surface appearance these linoleums often resemble a floor laid with individual tiles , but possess the advantage of lower initial cost and considerably lower laying cost because of its sheet form . This type of linoleum is available in many combinations of colors and in a wide variety of patterns , some of the small tile forms resembling mosaic tiles , and some patterns resembling quarried tiles or blocks of cut stone or slate , as well as other designs . Embossed Linoleums are usually inlaid linoleums in which an apparent joint is introduced between the tile units of the pattern , and this joint is  | compressed below the surface of the sheet to give the appearance of a masonry joint in a hard tile floor . The tiles themselves may also be em bossed for decorative effects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ingenious processes of manufacture result in producing a variegated color effect which resembles with remarkable fidelity the color and appearance of fine marbles , there apparently being no limitation to the manufacturing process in the reproduction of all types of colored marbles . Marbleized Linoleums may be in either full sheet forms , in which the marbleizing effect is carried out over the entire sheet , or of the inlaid type , having the appearance of blocks of marble laid in pattern . The tile forms , which are sold under various distinguishing trade names , are essentially the same as the sheet forms in composition but are usually available only in plain colors or in marbleized effects . There are in addition a number of newer types constantly being developed which produce various special flooring effects , including a reproduction of wood plank floor , accomplished by using the Jaspe Linoleum with inset joint strips , pegs and butterfly wedges of darker color . The tile forms are in plain colors and in marbleized effects . Some manufacturers are producing an embossed tile for special uses which have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce variety and interest in the pattern of a floor . The architect has at his disposal , in these materials . floorings to harmonize with any designs . Cork carpet . Though frequently classified with linoleum , cork carpet differs somewhat from both cork tiles and linoleums . It is composed of granulated cork using a different proportion of cork and linseed oil from that usually employed in Battleship Linoleum . It is compressed under heat . As the name implies , it is manufactured in sheet forms . It comes in several solid colors , and in thicknesses of approximately .22-inch ( polished ) and .26-inch ( unpolished ) . Cork carpet has not the density nor therefore the resistance to wear of the several types of cork composition flooring material , but its great resiliency and relatively low cost give it a very definite utility for solving certain flooring problems . These classifications cover the principal standard types of cork composition flooring , but it should be noted that each individual manufact nrcr is constantly developing new combinations and new patterns which have their special uses from both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features here noted , however , may be applied to the newer forms , and hence an extended discussion of them is not necessary before we proceed to the next consideration . p 416 An important new development in the manufacture of linoleum and cork composition flooring materials is the utilization of pyroxylin or nitrocellulose lacquers to produce a surface wholly impervious to moisture , dirt and to the staining effects of many common materials such as ink , foods , greases , and mild acids . . . . The lacquer finish is not merely a surface painting in the ordinary sense , for the leading manufacturers , while retaining in secrecy the exact nature of the process employed , claim and demonstrate that there is a certain amount of penetration of the lacquer into the upper strata of the material , although no manufacturers claim complete penetration . The lacquer functions to close the minute pores in linoleums and other cork composition flooring products so that ordinary dirt and dust will not be ground into the surface , vastly simplifying the cleaning and maintenance operations . The nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally stain wood , marble , concrete and other types of flooring will not penetrate into the cork compound , and a spot can be readily wiped off from the surface without leaving any stain or mark . To a large extent the lacquer treatment eliminates or minimizes the need for waxing linoleum floors for their maintenance and preservation , although wax may be applied as usual if desired . Undoubtedly this new development marks a real advance in improving the life and utility of cork composition flooring materials , giving added qualities of sanitation , low maintenance cost , improved appearance and probably greater durability . SUMMARY Paints , tints , wallpaper , commercial fabrics , and wood paneling are commonly used for wall finishes and coverings . style of architecture , size of rooms , and type and style of furniture . Artistic results are obtained by paneling smooth plaster walls with wood or plaster molding . Picture molding frequently is used . Plaster walls also are commonly painted both with flat paints and with calcimine . Wash paints are most suitable for kitchens and bathrooms . Good effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly applied . These may be used on any materials that may be successfully painted with ordinary paint . Wallpaper long has been known as a desirable wall covering . New wash wall coverings are on the market that are most satisfactory . Antiqued paper and waterproof papers are also in use .  | Wood paneling which was formerly too expensive for the family with a small income now may be obtained at reasonable cost . For South rooms which are light and sunny , cool colors , nmedinnl in value , maybe used to soften light . North rooms with less light need light , warm colors . In small rooms which are comfortably lighted , colors light in value will accentuate the size . Furniture may be emphasized by the use of a wall color grayed in intensity , and light of value . The kind of finish , selected for new wood floors depends upon the wood and the preference of the individual . Durability , ease in cleaning , and economy in replacing are considerations which should be observed . The most common finishes are stain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a combination of two or more of these materials . Brussels , Wilton , Velvet , and Axminster rugs are commonly used . Tapestry is an imitation of Brussels and similarly made . In addition to these floor coverings there are Oriental rugs , Chinese rugs , fiber and grass rugs , and linoleums . Resilient flooring materials are the outgrowth of a definite need . Cork , composition products , and rubber are the principal materials having resilience as a dominant characteristic . The three classes of cork-flooring products are : ( I ) Linoleum and linoleum tiles , ( 2 ) natural cork tiles , ( 3 ) cork carpets . The new lacquer treatment of linoleums provides a surface which is not easily stained and also adds qualities of sanitation , low maintenance cost , and durability . V REFERENCES 1 .

SEXTON In an age of standardization we have not yet standardized good taste . We are all still free to exercise our own opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' art . While harmony is the basis of design , what one may consider harmonious another may deem devoid of all harmony . It is in our interpretation , then , of the principle embodied in the word that our standards of good taste are grounded . Harmony in a composition might be described as that quality which tends to retain unity between the various elements . The success of a musical composition is dependent upon the laws of harmony ; a composition painted by an artist on a canvas must be harmonious in design and color to warrant approval ; and in the design of a completely furnished room or interior one must immediately sense a harmonious relation between the various furnishings and the details of the architectural scheme in order to truthfully say that the room is well designed . While I have in the preceding paragraph paralleled the design of a completely furnished room with the composition of a musical score and that of a painted canvas , there is a vital difference which should not be overlooked . A musical composition and a painted picture are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design of a room one artist ? the architect ? starts the composition , and another ? the decorator ? finishes it . This unusual procedure frequently tends to disrupt harmony . To apply the same procedure to the development of a musical score or to the completion of a painted picture would undoubtedly result in a dismal failure . In order to be successful as a team , one might say , the architect and decorator must not only collaborate , but must actually have similar ideals . They must not only appreciate the value of harmony between the various elements that go to make up the finished room , but they must have similar ideas as to the real meaning of the word " harmony . " We are just emerging , fortunately , from an era which might he de- footnote ' Adapted from " Furniture and Architecture , " Good Furniture and Decoration , Sep tember , 1929 . Reprinted through the courtesy of Good Furniture and 1 ) eroralion Magazine .  | scribed as " The Revival of the Periods , " during which time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever . We " originated " period designs , " adapted " period ideas , and " reproduced " period details until the entire country was astonished and ashamed to find that during this era , while we had been copying designs originated in some European country five and six and seven centuries ago , these same European countries had been seriously and successfully developing an art which would express their modern character and reflect their modern tendencies . During the " Revival " epoch in this country , however , we learned a lesson . It was easy to practice harmony under conditions that then prevailed . A Louis XVI room needed Louis XVI furniture . It was as easy for the decorator to design or select Louis XVI chairs as it was for the architect to panel the walls in true Louis XVI character . The client or owner in those days gave to his architect and decorator an order to execute that called for little if any ability . What a difference today ! An architect designs a room to reflect modern impulses , to satisfy modern desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decorator may attain harmony between the design of the furniture and the architectural treatment of the interior , for unquestionably the furniture is the feature of the decorative scheme . Design , as used in this particular case , means much more than composition . An artist designs his composition and then paints it on canvas . His design is merely a picture . The architect and the furniture designer , however , find that design has a much larger meaning than that . To them , design means , first , materials . The physical properties which a material possesses very largely influence design in both architectural and decorative spheres . Materials have pattern , color and texture , too . Then , design means giving a form to these materials . The architect and furniture designer compose their designs in two dimensions , as does the painter , but they must create a design that can take shape in certain materials in three dimensions , so that the finished object will satisfactorily serve a definite purpose . Very often harmony between a piece of furniture and the architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both schemes . Thus there is effected in the design a certain relationship which is not limited to the natural pattern of the material and its color , for certain materials stipulate a certain type or style of craftsmanship . Let me illustrate my point . The coarse , open grain of oak , for example , is particularly adaptable to crude and rugged details . Thus in a room in which the  | ceiling is beamed with hand-hewn timbers of oak and the ( lour is Lod OI random-width oak planks , harmony is attained by introducing n i l I. I urni ture of a similar style of craftsmanship . Another illustration night hw that of a room in which the walls were designed of mahogany with ( Him mental motifs occasionally carved in the wood . The detail of the orn ; m ment carved in mahogany would be entirely different from ornament carved in oak , for example , due to the fine and close grain of mahogany . Thus , to effect the proper relationship between the architectural treatment and the furniture , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also was characterized by a close and fine grain in order that a similarity of craftsmanship might prevail . Often an attempt is made at harmony by introducing in the wall decoration , by means of applied plaster or painted ornament , some detail which is featured in the upholstery fabric used to cover the chairs , for example . This may tend to make the finished scheme more unified , but this alone will not create a harmony which is satisfying . The tendency toward a greater expression of originality and creative ability ( which we absurdly refer to as " the modern movement " ) makes the attaining of harmony between architecture and furniture more difficult . Modern design involves the interpretation of modern impulses . The architect and decorator may have entirely different ideas as to what modern impulses should he expressed and what should not . It is up to the decorator to attune himself to the architect 's ideas , however , if he would attain success . The architect designs the house ; he decorates the interior , to a very great extent , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ceiling , although his ideas on the placing of the furniture , as well as its design , are seldom sought . And he has his own ideas , too . He could not design a room successfully if he did not visualize it completely decorated and furnished to the very last detail . PRINCIPLES OF GOOD FURNITURE MAKING ' BY RALPH C. ERSKINE The ability to recognize good furniture comes from an understanding of the elements and principles which are at the bottom of good furnit ure making While we still adhere to the best traditions of cabinetmaking , both iii design and manufacture , our modern ingenuity has developed some footnote ' Adapted from " IIow To Recognize Good Furniture , " American Dome , March , 1930.  | methods which take their place beside the time-honored ones . These include new mechanical processes by which pieces of furniture , while retaining all the grace of the old designs , are often constructed by methods which make them more enduring and more adapted to our climate than many of the old examples . Quantity production now makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , which , in The early days of America , could have been found only in the mansions of the very wealthy . These methods include the modern use of veneers , of plywood , of inlay , and of enduring finishes . In buying furniture nowadays values are determined by two things : Utility and style or design . Utility means strength , comfort , capacity . Style and design mean proportion , form , correctness of traditional details of ornament in a given period , and all those elements which go to make up its value in the eyes of a cultivated community In knowing good furniture it is the little things that we have to look for as the essential points of larger import . There are fundamental principles of construction and finish that make all the difference between good and bad furniture . Good construction may be studied without regard to period , and its simplest details make a fascinating study for the householder , for they include the curing of wood , the ingenious use of plywoods , the knowledge of veneers , of built-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these elements . Let us take up some of these in detail . Plywood . There is a method of making such parts of furniture as table tops , the backs of bureaus , and bottoms of drawers that will prevent warping and cracking . This is the process of gluing together thin sheets of wood , layer upon layer , and the method is called " lamination . " The gluing is done under tremendous pressure , and the grain of the interior layers is made to run across the grain of the top and bottom layers so that there can be absolutely no swelling or shrinking in any direction . If there are three layers , or laminations , it is called " three-ply " ; if five , " five-ply . " Good glue , properly prepared , is a marvelous substance . If two pieces of wood , fully dried , are planed so perfectly on their edges that you can not see the light shining through between them when they are held together , you can apply t he thinnest film of glue , rub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry , and you can not break them apart on the glued joint . The wood will tear before the glue will give . On exposed tops and on doors there should be always a thin frame of solid wood around the edges to conceal the laminations . For instance , in making a Sheraton side-  | hoard with curved front and doors , it is much better to have these doors built up than to saw out solid wood on a curve , especially when the is to be finished with a highly figured veneer . Points where you should look for laminated or plywood cons ( rue ( io n are tops , ends , and backs of bureaus , backs of mirrors , paneled ends of bureaus , paneled doors , and drawer bottoms . The makers of cheap furniture have been substituting paper or wallboard backs for bureaus and mirrors . It is well , therefore , to turn a bureau around and look at the back before you buy it . Also , see if it has a dust board between the drawers , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thin , horizontal Partitions which keep dust from working down back of the drawers , and make it impossible to see into a lower drawer by pulling out the one above it . Thus , one drawer may be locked safely without regard to the other . Curing the woods. ? The furniture that you put into your house should be made by firms adequately equipped with the proper scientific apparatus for curing the woods . A poorly cured piece of wood will shrink or swell , causing damage that can not be repaired easily . For furniture , wood must have stood " on the sticks " in the open air in piles , from two to five years . This is very important . After this , it can be put through the kilns . Briefly , the process of curing is to put wood into kilns where warm , live steam can he turned in until all the lumber is brought to the same state of dampness . Then the temperature is increased gradually and the amount of dampness reduced , until each board is uniformly dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard case around the surface , imprisoning the moisture that would later dry out causing the wood to crack and warp . Much as we like the idea of furniture built to our special order in some little cabinet shop , we owe it to ourselves to find out what facilities the maker has for obtaining properly cured woods . An unfinished board will reabsorb at least 12 per cent of moisture simply in transportation or when lying around in unheated places . Veneers. ? There is an inherited prejudice against the word " veneer . " To many people it means superficial show and this impression probably dates from the time when an atrocious false Colonial type of furniture was produced , where heavy scrolls and brackets were made of soft wood and overlaid on all the surfaces with thin veneers of crotch mahogany . Veneers have their proper uses and the great cabinetmakers of the past employed them on their finest pieces to get beauty of grain in appropriat e  | places . It is only the abuse of veneers that has brought them into disrepute . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly , but it would be practically impossible to obtain the beautiful effects of ferns , waves , and scrolls by any other method . The wood from which they are cut comes where the great roots join together , and solid boards cut from these places would crack and check to such a degree that they could not be used . The most usual forms of veneer found in high-grade cabinetmaking are crotch mahogany , cut from the crotch of the tree ; figured walnut , taken from the heart of walnut stumps ; and burled walnut , elm , and oak , cut from burls or gnarled growths caused by the stings of insects in the young tree . Some of these burls grow to tremendous proportions , and I have seen whole groves in the mountains of North Carolina where almost every tree was afflicted with these gnarled and fantastic protuberances , so deformed and yet so valuable to the veneer sawyer . One of the wrong ways to use veneer was mentioned above , that is , on exposed surfaces where it is liable to be knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people have purchased old pieces of furniture of the style that is distinguished by heavy bracket scrolls , thinking they are valuable simply because they are old and made of mahogany , and have been greatly disappointed when the veneer cracked and came off in large pieces . Good design and workmanship  --  not age nor sentiment ? are the most important features of a piece of furniture . The proper use of veneer in good furniture building is for the beautifying of drawer fronts , the inner spaces of panels , all inlaid surfaces that are not unduly exposed , and outside edges which have some projecting members of solid wood . For instance , in some fine old models there is a raised bead around each drawer . This is a thin strip with rounded edges that is set into the drawer front like a frame around a picture . It projects slightly beyond the surface of the drawer front and thus offers protection to the figured wood which has been applied for its beauty . When you see an old piece that has beautiful wood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten to one it is a good piece in other respects . These details in construction are sure signs of integrity in workmanship , and it is not likely that a maker who executes them carefully would be ignorant of the other elements of good design and good construction . Joinery . One of the most important points in the construction of good furniture is the way the different joints are made , as careful workmanship  | here is absolutely essential if the piece is to last and give good service . An explanation of the details of some of these joints may be hell pf ul. c Inc of the best known joints is the " mortise and tenon , " which is a t yl e t li ; i t was universal in all old furniture . When the end of a board is fastened into the side of another , as in a door frame , a tenon , like a tongue , is cut on one end of the board and fitted into a mortise or rectangular hole that is cut out of the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glove into the mortise before it is glued . Often in old pieces a peg was put through from the outside with the end left showing . This is called a " pegged joint " and is regarded as a mark of quaintness and handwork . Pegging of joints is appropriate in pieces of oak , maple , pine , and early walnut dating up to 1740 in design , but is rarely found in mahogany pieces except in very fine chairs where the seat rails join the back posts . A dowel joint was invented to take the place of a mortise and tenon . Instead of the rectangular tenon on the end of a board , the end is sawed off straight , and a little " pin , " or round stick , is put in to join both pieces together . When done in upholstered chair-frames this practice is correct , but dowel construction as commonly practiced in desks , bureaus , and even tables and chairs , is the cheapest known method of joining , and is had more often than good . A dovetail joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . Pull out a drawer and you will notice a series of little key-shaped notches down the corners . There is no adequate substitute for this joint . It is exactly what its name implies , a projection cut in the shape of a dove 's tail , and , like the keystone in an arch , has tremendous strength when litted into the notch cut to receive it . In hand-dovetailed drawers , long and short dovetails alternate , and all old pieces have this method of construction . Many old chests were made with dovetail joints at all four corners , and sometimes the ends of an old bureau were dovetailed to the top . If this construction is found on a piece made by a modern maker you may be sure he has a fine appreciat ion of the highest qualities of workmanship . A machine-made dovetail joint is practically as durable as the handmade joint . It is used on the finest modern furniture , and is , therefore , not a guide to quality of workmanship , but is an infallible guide to the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flush construction is an excellent indication of quality of workmanship . Any chair , table , or cabinet that possesses it shows that the maker has taken extra care and spent additional money for the sake of good  | tradition in design . Flush construction means keeping the outside faces of two pieces of wood that join each other flush or smooth to the touch . In upholstered furniture , correct tying of the springs is another important thing to be considered . In the best upholstered furniture springs are tied by hand eight or ten times , and this work is an art in itself . NOTE ? Simplified Practice : The purpose of simplified practice is to eliminate waste , and the cooperation of the Division of Simplified Practice of the U.S. Department of Commerce with manufacturers , distributors , and users has reduced the variety of sizes , dimensions , patterns , and models of many materials and articles . The varieties of beds , springs , and mattresses have been reduced from 78 to 4 , bed blankets from 78 to 12 , sterling-silver flatware from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may follow later . ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH VENEER AND SOLID FURNITURE CONSTRUCTION ' The advantages of veneered construction as compared with solid construction may be summed up as follows : T. A ply-wood panel is stronger , in some respects , than a single board of the same thickness . 2 . The cores of veneered panels may be made of softer , lighter , and cheaper lumber than can be used for solid construction . 3 . Highly figured woods , some of which it would be impractical to use in thick sizes because of their cross grain and resulting irregular shrinkage , can be used for face veneers . This method has the additional advantages of reducing the expense of the use of highly figured woods and of making the supply go farther . 4 . Because of the thinness of the finer face veneers , several pieces , cut consecutively , look practically alike and can be matched to produce symmetrical figures impossible to attain in solid construction . 5 . Under ordinary methods of construction , for reasons already explained , veneered panels are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . 6 . Curved and irregular surfaces can easily be produced by gluing veneer together in shaped forms which would be difficult if not impossible to produce from solid lumber . The following are the principal advantages of solid construction : T. The owner has the satisfaction of knowing that the furniture he footnote ' Adapted from The Identification of Furniture Woods ( out of print ) . U.S. Department of Agriculture Misc . Circ. 66 ( 1926 ) .  | possesses is constructed throughout of the kind of woad elm ( sented at the surface . 2 . The wood can be carved , which is not practicable in vcncet ( on struction unless special provision is made for it . 3 . In case the surface chips off , the same kind of wood is exposed . 4 . The surfaces can be heavily sandpapered or even planed off and re finished operations which , as a rule , are not practicable with veneered construction . 5 . The surface layers can not loosen and peel off , as may occur in veneered panels when they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of time ( unless a water-resistant glue is used ) ; although prolonged dampness may likewise have deleterious effects on the glue which is used in the joints of solid furniture . IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS IN FURNITURE SELECTION AND ARRANGEMENT By ELSIE RICHARDSON Always consider the spaces in rooms before furniture is selected or you may awaken to the fact that the beautiful things selected do not fit in . After the necessary articles have been chosen , the big thing is to get them together so that they serve the purpose best and appear attractive . Usefulness is c eident and tangible , but beauty is more vague and left to the tastes of those responsible . Certain elements of beauty must be considered . Unity is that quality which draws the room together as a whole . There must be one important element throughout , with other elements subordinated to it . This dominant element in line may be the graceful curve which can be repeated in furniture and hangings or the straight line designating strength and formality . A dominant color in the scheme of decoration is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyed to this one . If the background is a value of neutral tan the ecrus , golds and tans key in better than does a silver or gray . The room as a whole should have a dominant element or center of interest , as a fireplace and mantel or an arrangement which features an attractive and useful group of windows . In carrying out a dominant element , do not overuse it . It must be just strong enough to tie all parts of the room together , giving that feeling of ' Adapted from Furnishing the Home . Home Economics Bull . 42 . Iowa State College , 1928.  | oneness . The element , unity , spells restfulness but beware that it does not change its name to monotony . The room in values of brown is a very dull , drab and depressing place unless it is relieved with bits of cheery contrasting colors , such as orange or blue-green . Variety is the element of contrast . It breaks monotony and adds interest . Contrast stimulates through opposition , consequently it must be used very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given more character by the use of an occasional straight line . Dark tones are given more charm when opposed by bits of lighter tone . Subdued colors are given snap by a splash of bright color . It takes variety in unity to produce beauty . Proportions. ? To make a room seem to grow together just as if every piece belonged there , good proportions must be emphasized . The apparent proportions of a room may be improved .

Such features as color , form , texture and contrast ha v t heir influence in the problem of balance . The warmer and purer a color is , the more decorative weight it holds . A striking contrast will call attention and lend much weight . Coarse , rough texture adds more weight than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than light furniture with graceful curves . figure Bi-symmetrical balance divides the space in the middle and decorates exactly the same on the two sides . This is merely a mechanical process . It gives the effect of formality . A whole room could not be decorated in that way or it would become very stiff and uninviting . With the greater part of the room in rather informal lines , the bi-symmetrical wall groupings are very effective . The mantel is very charming with a picture or tapestry above , a low bowl in the center and candlesticks at the ends . A console table beneath a picture or mirror is held in position by the use of the candlesticks on the ends , and perhaps a piece of pottery in  | the center . A buffet makes a very attractive formal spot with a bowl of flowers in the center and candles at the sides . Grouping of uneven numbers are more artistic than those of even numbers . Occult or informal balance is not a mere mechanical process . It is tying down one side against another by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance is not so evident , yet it exists in an easy , natural sort of way . Consideration of the decorative weight of furnishings is very essential in occult balance . If a group is heavy and seems to overbalance when against the wall , it may be placed nearer the center of the room , thereby decreasing the apparent weight . A fireplace with a davenport , small end table and lamp on one side may be balanced by a table , chair and lamp on the other side . Balance from one end of the room to the other is secured by the placing of separate groups of furniture . Do not sacrifice the use of a chair or table to secure balance . Arrange in useful groups , or the stiff , lonesome atmosphere will creep in . Occult balance will be observed in the living room group . Color is undoubtedly one of the most expressive elements in decoration . A home without color seems to represent a colorless personality , while a home with too much color becomes gaudy and speaks of poor taste . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in color and decorations is necessary to satisfy . The background of the room should follow the general scheme found in nature the floor the darkest area , walls second , and the ceiling the lightest portion . In general , the background should be kept in quiet , neutral tones . If the background is " noisy " in itself it is impossible to place decorations against it so that they appear to the best advantage . Intense colors must be used only in small proportions to add life , interest and character to a room . Contrasting color harmony is much more difficult to use than harmony of likeness , but is very effective . A room where a great deal of blue is used may look very solemn , dignified and cold unless it is cheered by some splashes of warm contrasting color . Orange will add the snap that is lacking . It may be supplied by a bowl of flowers , lampshades or pieces of pottery . As soon as the use of contrasting color is overdone , it loses its charming effect . Contrast is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of two . Colors with red or yellow predominating impart warmth and make the room appear smaller , while those with blue as the dominant element are 430  | cool , solemn , dignified and give space . Light colors give more si t 11.1 n dark colors . It is well to consider the amount of sunlight and size of r Il l when selecting a color scheme . Persons should choose colors for their rooms and their homes to suit their own types . It is just as necessary that one should appear well in her home as a background , as to choose costumes that are of the appropriate colors . The house should be the frame and the family the picture of home life . The frame must always be kept subordinate to the picture and its colors chosen to enhance the beauty of the picture . The same is true of the home picture . Design is very . closely related to color . A room without design lacks individuality . In choosing design in rugs , cretonnes and tapestries avoid that which seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type flies out to greet you when you enter the room . An indistinct all-over pattern closely related to its background is more dignified and restful . Large , distinct and colorful designs take up space and should not be used in a small room . Wallpapers of plain or very indistinct patterns are best in all rooms because they are not tiresome , and make the ideal background . A room lacks character with everything plain as well as with everything in design . It is essential to balance plainness and design . A little bit of design will balance a great deal of plainness . If a beautiful , designed rug is used on the floor , it should not be killed by the use of figured wall paper or figured over draperies , but they should be kept plain and subordinated to the rug . If the rug is plain , design may be introduced in the upholstery or draperies . If the wallpapers are figured , the window draperies should be kept plain . Pictures , tapestries and other decorations are not well used against figured walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the actual placement of furniture is simple . In the first place , do not overcrowd . Eliminate all useless pieces . Line is the main feature to be considered . In order to have a definite scheme of decoration , it is best to place the main pieces of furniture , as davenport , piano , large table and desk parallel with the walls , whether they are against the walls or not . Straight lines should be observed in the bedrooms in placement of bed , table and dressers . The stiffness is broken by grouping furniture in the charming centers of interest and by placing minor objects , as chairs , small tables , etc. , where they are really the most useful , regardless of line . An easy chair is scarcely ever placed at right angles with the walls and major pieces of  | furniture . In fact , it looks more inviting , if it is a little off the straight line . Rugs should be placed straight on floors . To place them obliquely is similar to hanging a picture that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight-line arrangement is wrong . WINDOW TREATMENT Glass curtains and draperies both are of importance in obtaining the desired results in interior decoration . By regulating light , framing a view , accentuating color , they will add to the beauty of the interior if carefully selected and properly designed . Also , since they represent an appreciable portion of the furnishing budget they should receive careful consideration both in selection of materials and in methods of hanging . Owing to the fact that an excellent publication , Window Curtaining , ' prepared by the United States Bureau of Home Economics , is easily obtainable , the subject will not be discussed here . This bulletin contains valuable information on the selection of materials and directions for the making of glass curtains and side draperies , detailed directions for making curtains for the various rooms and for special types of windows . The list below taken from the above-mentioned bulletin is a few of the hundred or more glass curtain and drapery materials that are on the market : figure  | seed oil , Austrian cloth ( a crinkly fabric woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rl to render it translucent ) , and others are in common use . Waterproof shade an h sirable for kitchen and bathroom . THE IMPORTANCE OF COLOR Color is becoming more and more important in both house furnishing and equipment , and it is now daringly used in furniture , upholstery materials , draperies , bath and kitchen equipment , and even in small kitchen utensils . Even though more color is in use , the principles governing it remain the same . ( To use color effectively and artistically in interior decoration requires something more than merely becoming " color conscious . " Although we do not know just to what extent colors please us or irritate us , we do know that certain combinations of color are annoying to some persons and other combinations are pleasing . It requires a knowledge of the use of color ? its effect on the height and breadth of rooms , the effect light has on it , the effect of certain colors upon each other , color harmony and contrasting color harmony , and of many other uses to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter as there are many good books on the subject . A few principles should be observed , however , if best results are obtained with color in furnishing a home . ( Colors differ according to their dimensions , that is , in warmth , in lightness , and in value . Exposure , area , and shapes and colors of objects in a room dictate uses . " The law of areas " is perhaps one of the most violated of color laws . According to this law , large areas should be restful with few or no contrasts while small amounts may show decided contrasts . In furnishing it is well to keep in mind that in all color combinations there should be a predominating color or principal color and that backgrounds should be kept subdued or ( lull in effect , particularly if the objects in the room are to stand out and to appear effective . The " keying of colors " also is important . This may be done by mixing them to introduce one color in common or by uniting them by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to key colors. e Some color combinations are pleasing and others are not . There are , however , certain harmonies that will produce pleasing effects under near y all conditions . Whatever the combinations used there should be one color in common throughout . Color may also be used to change the effect of the size of rooms . Small interiors maybe made to appear larger through the use of light colors . Before deciding upon the color of a room its size ,  | the amount of light , and its architectural treatment should be considered .

What is clear is that at present modern design in its best and sanest manifestations , as far as it relates to three-dimensional things , mainly represents an effort to express what are conceived to be sound , practical and aesthetic principles peculiarly related to modern life . Let me try to define these principles as I see them in this particular relation . First of all , I should say modernism requires direct and effective meeting of functional needs and straightforward construction that respects the nature of material involved . These two ideas are very old . They are attributes that have characterized every high period of art , and they have been lost sight of in every decadent period . They have in particular been in the background of artistic thought for the last three-quarters of a century since Ruskin hammered upon them and reiterated them to the betterment of the world 's art . Let us see why they are so peculiarly meaningful to-day . LIVING CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED In what way is life different from what it was ? In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from what they were , and they are different almost wholly because of power and the machine . These two factors have changed the face of the earth and given us modern transportation and communication which allow people to meet and obtain new ideas as they never could before . They make possible our modern dwellings . They provide us with our clothes and our household fittings and furnishings . Then , again , a large fraction of us live in cities where room becomes more and more at a premium . This has made the apartment house our typical living arrangement , with the constant tendency to smaller and fewer rooms . Furthermore , household service , because of higher wages and changed social attitudes , becomes increasingly difficult to afford . All these things require that we have fewer and smaller pieces of furniture . We no longer have space for the chaise longue or for couches . We must put up with fewer great chairs or tables . What furniture we have must function effectively and its material must be used economically and according to its qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we find another . These conditions outlaw carving and deep moldings that catch dust and require constant cleaning . On the other hand , our mental attitudes are different from those of  | past generations . We live more intensely and our daily experiences are much more varied and of a transient nature . Our conversation is much more direct and simple as theedemands of many brief contacts require . The flapper of to-day frankly reveals ( I am not referring wholly to her dress ) much that was concealed in former times . On the whole , we face life more simply and directly , and all this tends I o reflect upon our applied art . It tends , for one thing , I think , to make us less satisfied with ornament that covers up and overlies the structure of our household belongings , and inclines us to prefer the aesthetic appeal t hat comes from expression of the structural material itself . We see this in contemporary furniture , silver , glass , ceramics , and in building . A potter to-day , making stoneware in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms that are the quintessence of modernism that is , through glazes that are part of the substance of his creations . I t is safe to say that over three-quarters of the pieces shown in the International Ceramic Exhibition , .... are of this character . These , as I see them , are some of the tendencies that are present in the best of the modern work in three-dimensional things . These tendencies do not comprehend decoration in the old sense . Perhaps that will come later ? I do not know . But they include , necessarily , it seems to me , scrupulous attention to appropriateness of form , firmness of proportion , elegance of line , and the discreet use of structural material for surface decorative effect On the continent of Europe one finds varying expressions of the modern movement . Probably in no country are there more than one or two designers producing things fine enough to have a universal appeal , but for the most part the creations are at least sane and practical . One thing that marks much of the English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairs . This , it seems to me , represents much good sense . n , for no earthly good reason , we try to make a chair that is entirely unlike any chair produced before 1900 , we generally achieve something that is both uncomfortable to sit in and uncomfortable to look at . Why not drop this frenzied effort at mere novelty ? We do not need forms never before seen . We need old forms simplified or modified better to meet present-day needs . As a matter of fact , there is much of Sheraton and of Hepplewhite and a deal of Early American that meets the requirements of modern life most admirably .  | The making of furniture in any important way to-day is a matter of quantity production . Of all peoples in the world , we are the one that should , by virtue of our special genius and social conditions , best express modern tendencies . At the moment we seem to be held back by a false conception of what these tendencies mean . Many of our manufacturers are rushing in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly failing to appreciate that true modernism in applied art is not a matter of freakishness , queerness and novelty , but an expression of fundamental tendencies in our modern life . It seems evident that the time has come for the American furniture industry to apply some real courage , some real thinking , and some real taste to this situation and to tackle the problem of working out modern expressions of furniture in terms of our own demands and tastes with a seriousness worthy of the need . It is surely not too much to say that if our furniture manufacturers and designers , instead of seeking something merely bizarre and eye-catching , would take lessons from the best of our city architecture , from our fine automobiles , from modern ceramics , silver and glass and from woman 's street dress , they might in time succeed in making American furniture the finest expression of the modern spirit . A few , sadly few , of such instances of appreciation are beginning to appear . From these we may take a measure of encouragement , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too slowly . SUMMARY One of the first considerations in treating interiors is to plan for the proper relationship between the architectural treatment and the furniture . A well-designed room must have a harmonious relation between the various furnishings and the details of the architectural scheme . If there is an architect and a decorator they should collaborate . Quantity production now makes it possible for many more families to have good furniture than in earlier days . In buying furniture utility and design are the two important considerations . Furniture woods should be properly cured or the wood may shrink , swell , crack , or warp . Modern use of veneers , plywood , inlay , and many lasting finishes all have been means of improving furniture . Lamination is the process of gluing together thin sheets of wood , layer upon layer . The abuse of veneers has brought them somewhat into disrepute , but veneer is the only means by which some of the beautiful effects in wood may be obtained . Both solid and veneer construction have many good points and certain advantages  | over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to last and give good service . In upholstered furniture correct tying of the springs is essential f , pr durability and satisfaction . In arranging furniture the first consideration is the space to be occupied . Usefulness and beauty are the two main essentials to be observed . Unity is produced by emphasizing one important element throughout with all other elements subordinated to it . Variety which is the element of contrast should be used sparingly . By careful selection and arrangement of furniture a room of poor proportions may be greatly improved . Color , form , texture , and contrast are effective in obtaining balance . Color is one of the most expressive elements in decoration ; intense colors , however , should be used in small proportions and their use should be to add life , interest , and character to a room . Contrasting harmony is much more difficult to use than harmony of likeness but it may be made very effective . A room without design lacks individuality ; " spottiness , " however , should be avoided . In arranging large pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be grouped according to use and attractiveness and with reference to the various centers . Curtains are used for privacy , to regulate light , frame views , and accentuate color . Care should be exercised both in selecting the materials and in their method of hanging . Since the hall , owing to its location , creates the first impression of the house interior it is important to strike the right keynote in its furnishings and decoration . The living-room interior , however , is undoubtedly of the greatest importance since it is the gathering place for family and friends , and should be interesting and satisfying . Light and cheerfulness are desirable results to be obtained in furnishing the dining room , and restfulness and simplicity are the chief considerations in the treatment of bedrooms . Changes in living conditions have had their effect on the present modernistic movelmlin furniture and furnishings . Less space and more intense living , new use of materials , and new materials have influenced furniture design . REFERENCES I. GENERAL INFORMATION ( ' LUTE , EUGENE . The Treatment of Interiors .

In shape the oblong is more economical of floor space than the square and fewer steps are required in crossing the room from one work center to another . For the average family in a house of six or seven rooms , a kitchen with from 90 to 108 square feet is satisfactory . The exact size should be determined by the number of activities to be accommodated , by the size of the large pieces of equipment , by the number of doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in cooking . The chief work in most kitchens is food preparation . In addition the ' kitchen must sometimes be used as the family dining room , as a laundry , .... and as a playroom for small children . More floor space is then required than if it is limited chiefly to work connected with food . Even so , efficient arrangement is possible in a large , general-purpose kitchen by planning work centers for the various activities . At the other extreme is 1 he kitchenette where every foot of wall and floor space must be utilized and sliding and drop shelves and other ingenious devices studied out tom , provide the needed working surfaces . Stove , sink , table or cabinet , or both , cupboard for dishes and utensils , and sometimes a refrigerator are the large pieces of equipment for which allowance must generally be made . By careful planning such economical use can be made of walls and floor space that all these can be conveniently placed in a comparatively small area . Two doors , one to . the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the minimum in the kitchens of most houses . Two or three more doors leading to cellar , pantry , and hall are not uncommon . In many cas he kitchen is made larger than would otherwise be necessary in order t rovide wall space for these doors , when by forethought they could hav een placed elsewhere to better advantage . Coal or wood as the cooking fuel generally makes necessary a larger footnote Adapted from Convenient Kitchens . Farmers ' Bull . 1513 .
