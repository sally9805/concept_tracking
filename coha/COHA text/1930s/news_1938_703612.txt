Thus , fresh from a leisurely journey they strike the upper rapids that lead to Celilo Falls by remaining in the current , and forsaking the pools of listless water The excuse of the commercial seiners , seen h om the light of existing facts , sounds logical . The seiners have caught little or nothing this season . On the other hand the Indians at Celilo havelbeen making catches that far exceed past years .
