Flunkies at Grosvenor House , swank London hotel , chortled behind their hands last week as they recounted an embarrassing incident that lately befell their No. 1 guest , 73-year-old His Highness Ala'idin Suleimin Shah , Sultan of Selangor in the Federated Malay States . The Sultan , happily attired to meet the demands of East &; West in yellow silk trousers and a European overcoat , stood boggle-eyed before the hotel 's rapidly twirling swing-door , was completely baffled . With Oriental arrogance he tried to pass through in the opposite direction to that in which the door was turning , got his yellow trousers caught , only managed to escape after muttering Malayan curses . More successful was his favorite wife , youthful Inche Anjong . <P> The Malayan ruler was in London ostensibly to consult Harley Street specialists who had been warned not to recommend operations , an outrage to the Sultan 's beliefs . Whitehall wiseacres , however , were saying last week that the real purpose of the visit was to unravel a diplomatic tangle , the succession to the throne of Selangor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposed , and , in accordance with Malayan custom , the second son was nominated successor . To this the British Colonial Office objected , nominated the Sultan 's third son . To this the Sultan objected , said : " The British Government is interfering with Malayan customs which they promised to respect . "
