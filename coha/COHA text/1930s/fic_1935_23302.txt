DEBT A STORY BY WALTER GILKYSON MHE sun shone through the archway I of the porch on his right ; there was a ship in the green morning sea just beyond St. George 's with a tender beside her , looking for all the world like a small nosing replica of the steamer itself . The April wind , soft with the mild young fragrance of the island , swept through the oleander bushes in front of the house , disturbing a cardinal who darted across the white wall and disappeared . There was another one still in the bush , whistling for all he was worth . Harry Layton , who watched him from the open door , felt as cheerful as the bird . Dorothy would be out in a minute . He stepped down on the grass and into the sunlight that filled the small courtyard with a dazzling invigorating warmth . It burned pleasantly on his bare back and legs ; they were brick red and his square flat face and heavy nose had peeled twice and were turning brown . He walked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and examined the gray trunk to see whether there were any signs of life . His huge blunt-fingered hands touched the bark gently ; he stooped down , then squatted on his heels to examine the earth round the tree . With a swift easy stretch that belied his great size and height , he stood up and then glanced back at the porch . " It 's going to grow , " he said . Dorothy smiled as if lie had come round to her way of thinking . She was even more optimistic than he was , which was going very far . At the sight of her , standing there with that look of grave composure on her dark face , stepping out on the grass and coming toward him like a slender image of bronze draped with bright cloth at the breast and loins , and a white towel over one shoulder , he felt as if he had never known a care in his life and never would , and that Dorothy , his white house , the island of Bermuda , and the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on forever , bringing the memory of its morning perfection into whatever evening lands the years  --  the far years that he could n't even imagine  --  might take them . They had been married two years , and in that time he had seen her against the fantastic background of many outlandish places , and at moments the small central figure in a definitely dangerous situation , but never without that Took of grave composure on her face . She ran her hand down the trunk of the tree until she came to a bud . " Everything grows here , " she said , looking up at him with her face foreshortened so that her forehead and wide-set green eyes looked disproportionately large . " Now that we 've bought the house I 'll probably produce an infant and upset our plans . " " Children can travel , " said Layton cheerfully . " Or we can leave him with Jim . " " No , we 've left enough with Jim . " Her warm , faintly husky voice was resolute and self-reproachful , " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not that he minds , " she added quickly , as if to take any possible sting out of her words . " He does n't , he enjoys it , " said Harry with great confidence . " After all , it 's only a matter of investing our money and taking care of the incomc tax . Look , Dorothy , there 's a Lady Boat going out . " He pointed at the white steamer , so close that she seemed to be making for the wharf . " Saint Kitts , Grenada , and Demerara , with a stop in Hayti on the way back . We 'll do that next month . " " Harry , your eyes turn bright blue when you look at a boat and your hair stands on end . " She regarded him critically , a suppressed smile at the corners of her big mouth . " I think it 's getting thicker and more Germanic-looking , like yellow winter grass . " " For God 's sakel " He twisted with discomfort . " Come on , let 's swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with Dorothy nearly half way to the rocks . She stayed in after he had climbed up on the wharf , so he sat in the sun and waited , hot and tingling from his reaction to the water . With a sense of utter physical well-being he let himself drift into contemplation of his immense good fortune that seemed , both past and future , to merge with subtle harmony into the scene before him . It was complete , and so was his good fortune complete . It shone on him as the sun shone on this bright April morning . The world might be terrible , and it was in spots , but he could n't complain about what had happened to him ; he was a lucky man . As free as that boat which moved through dim shoals of purple toward the opening sky , and never lonely , because hiswork kept him company , and that small figure swimming with busy preoccupation in an element that was neither air nor water , but only liquid space above formidable jagged shapes crouching harmlessly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was filled with it at this moment , and it carried him into a sort of golden eternity . To be free to love your work and your wife , and to be young ; to follow an infinite horizon down to the very end of life . He folded his arms as if clasping his good fortune to his breast , and the glorious pageantry of the globe passed in a stream of light and darkness before his eyes . Dorothy climbed up on the steps and sat down beside him . " Remember the fish in the harbor of Amboina ? " she said . " I think I recognized one down there . " She drew up her legs and crossed them like a fragile Buddha . " I like to remember one place when I 'm in another , " she announced . They had breakfast in the big living room which now , after two weeks , felt comfortably familiar . Patrina Geranium , who was fifteen years old and the daughter of their cook , waited on the table with the bright-eyed bobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Zealand Inchcup , was a great find , Dorothy said , being able to preach , garden , carpenter , and sail a boat as well as cook . " He can show you the channel when the motor-boat comes , " she suggested . " They promised to get it up here sometime this afternoon , did n't they ? " Harry nodded . " I 'd like to put glass in the bottom of that boat , " he said thoughtfully . After drifting about for a moment or two in the living room , Dorothy went to the studio to " bite a plate " for an etching of one of her illustrations in Harry 's book . The house became quiet and he sat down at his desk in the front part of the room to get to work . It could hardly be called work , and he wondered sometimes if it really was , or if indeed he had ever actually worked in his life . As a child he had pored over pictures of what to him were the strangely dissimilar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scranton , Pennsylvania , where he also lived . He had known them by name and dress , and talked with them and dreamed of them at night . Just when they had lost their local character and become divided into separate primitive races he could n't remember , nor could he quite fix the time when his simple pictorial amazement and delight had changed to an absorbing curiosity about these strange people and a determination to see them and know them . Certainly long before college he had made up his mind to be a traveler and to study the wilder tribes of the earth , and at college the science of anthropology had given precision and scope to his passion , absorbing the colored fragments of adventure that haunted his imagination into a timeless vision of history to be pursued steadfastly in the obscure and exotic corners of the earth . His Indians , from mere pictures in a forgotten book , had become the immediate and enduring purpose of his life , as if from their remote and fever-laden jungles they promised magic and a satisfaction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time in which they stood so richly implanted . He had devoured countless books , gone to Cambridge after Princeton , running up at vacation time to the British Museum ; and never ceasing , whether weary of study or so translated that the touch , taste , and smell of the tropics seemed to rise from the page , to hope and believe that sometime he would see those countries and those people , and never be forced to return to Scranton and his job in the mill . Two years ago his father had died . By his will and the kindness of Brother Jim his own immediate good fortune had begun . Maybe in the course of years he might justify their confidence and love . If this study of the Toradjas of Celebes turned out to be anything it would be a beginning . The desk was heaped high with folders containing notes made during the year and a half he and Dorothy had lived in the Malay Archipelago . Now it had to be put into shape and the fact and color of his experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true without being dull , if that were possible . He did n't know . The obscure , detailed , monotonous , ritualistic life that to him was like a revelation of mankind in a sort of childhood twilight , whose slow archaic rhythm could scarcely be distinguished from the incessant mindless growth and decay of nature herself , might seem drab and pointless when expressed in words . He had no art . As Dorothy said , he took the Toradjas too seriously . And maybe himself . But to write this book and make it good was the only way in which he could even attempt to justify his freedom or communicate the value of what to him was neither more nor less than enchantment . He went on after lunch until Dorothy came in and stopped him . " How about a ride to St. David 's ? " she said . " We 're invited to Paget Monday for dinner at the Butterfields ' , and I accepted . Was that right ? " " Sure . " " Caroline Peters came down on the Monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily said . " " We 'll ask her over . " He gathered up his papers and put the knife on them . " I got started anyhow , Dorothy , but it 's going to be a big job . " They bicycled down the hill and into the village of Bailey 's Bay , then on for another mile between oleander bushes just coming into flower , and gardens that lay on the white road behind hedges that half concealed the reticent peaceful houses outlined in white against the blue sea . The sun was far down on the left when they crossed the causeway leading to St. George 's , and the Castle Harbour Hotel on the right shone from its hill across a mile of shallow water . It seemed to Harry even farther away and almost legendary , like a strange outcropping of luxury in the midst of solitude . All that he had escaped from was contained in that white intrusion which clung to its hill like a fortress of rest for weary giants . The tangled skein of affairs hung invisibly from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came there to rest . It was a symbol of the strain and effort that supported his own particular kind of existence and made it possible for him to do what he wanted . When they returned to the house Patrina Geranium told them the motorboat had come . Her father was at the boathouse , covering it up for the night , she said . They hurried down and found England and New Zealand inside , just putting the cover on the engine . " We 'll go out to-morrow and you can show me the channel , " said Harry , a little disappointed . " Yes , sir . " The big negro swung lightly around the edge of the house and onto the wharf . His large benign face and slow-moving eyes expressed a great certainty and self-confidence . " It is quite a handsome boat , " he said in his lazy English voice that rose and fell with a sort of minor complaint . " I was in charge of a boat like that in my last position , but the owner was disinterested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words came with mournful delicacy from his thick lips , and he looked at the bay wistfully as if seeking his lost opportunity . " If you wish to go out in her now , sir , for a minute or two in the twilight I can get her ready . " " There is n't time , " said Dorothy . She turned as Patrina Geranium appeared at the top of the hill . " Telephone message for Mr. Layton , Mrs. Layton , " she cried . As soon as Harry picked up the receiver he was back again in Scranton . Robert Pattison was on the ' phone . " We 're at Castle Harbour , came down to-day , and we want the young lady and you to come over and have dinner with us . " The level authoritative voice stopped at the brink of a command . " Judge Beale arid Martin McKinstry are down here too , and we want to see you very much . " There was silence . " We 're just sitting down to dinner , " Harry said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ? " There was an embarrassed laugh . " That 's too short notice , I do n't think we 'd better . " " To-morrow , then ? " " Yes , I think we could . But would n't you like to come over after dinner ? " " Yes , I will , most certainly . " " And the young lady ? " " I 'll ask her . " " Fine . Good-by . " Harry laid down the receiver . " They 're old family friends , " he called to Dorothy in the living room . " You do n't mind having them for dinner , do you ? " " No , of course not , but find out how many there are , " she answered cheerfully . He put on a dinner coat as a concession to his friends and the hotel . Dorothy said she would n't go because they were all coming to-morrow night , and that he had better telephone for a carriage instead of getting mussed up DEBT on his bicycle , so he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the livery stable which they had used once before . " You are forgetting the boat , sir , " England and New Zealand reminded him with an air of admonishment . " Unless you prefer not to use the boat and consider a carriage more appro-priate . " " I 'd forgotten all about it ! " Harry exclaimed . " I can pilot you there and back , " said the negro , as though the latter were unusual , " provided you would like to proceed by water instead of by land . " " One 's as good as another . " It was difficult not to laugh at the mild deliberate eloquence of his cook , who stood like a dark-faced prophet before the stove and the steaming pots , ready to offer magic to the devout . " At nine o'clock , " Harry said , feeling that the appointment was becoming very serious to them both . When they left the wharf an hour later he knew he could steer the boat himself , with a few directions from England and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from shore must have many openings , and he suspected his cook of creating imaginary difficulties for the purpose of showing the boss how much he knew . Without saying anything , Harry measured the distance from the shore to the house , and the exact point where the man turned north to pass through the reef . He was confident , sending the boat along quite fast , and making a wide sweep to the east as if the water were no longer dangerous . The crest of the island slid by on the right in wooded patches broken by pale lighted houses that turned in a slow arc under the stars as the boat swung round the headland of St. George 's . The island of St. David 's lay to the left . They passed under an iron bridge that con-of wordless understanding that formed the tacit likeness of race , superseding all voluble differences that might spring from occupation or interest or conviction . The bald massive head and white rim of hair and opaque eyes of Robert Pattison reminded him of his father . They belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of running his fingers through his thick white hair and then stroking the back of his head . In the restaurant he looked theatrical with his blue eyes , black eyelashes and eyebrows , and handsome scarlet face . The first to see him , Judge Beale waved his hand and then spoke to the other men . Years , assurance , all the direction and purpose he had acquired since boyhood seemed to fall away and leave him as he greeted his father 's friends . Like his father , they stood among the powers of childhood , setting the standards against which he had rebelled . Their air of solid local success had a walled-in certainty that made his own far-flung activity appear nebulous and thin , calling for explanation and excuse . He was on a perpetual vacation in a place where they had come to rest . Embarrassed , not knowing what to say , he sat down beside them , furious at himself for being so weak and lacking in self-confidence . Martin McKinstry immediately asked him what he was doing and when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beale cleared his throat , repeated the name with wonder , and fell silent . The compelling and brilliant reality of that obscure race faded out in the heavy silence that followed , as if unable to endure the scrutiny of practical men . " You must write an article about Celebes for the Scranton Daily Republican , " said Martin McKinstry . " I meant to ask you , but we have n't any of us seen you for so long . Our readers are interested in what you 're doing , and nobody in the town has ever traveled as extensively as you have . Milder whiskey than at home , is n't it ? And costs less . " His quick ugly face moved forward au inch at the sight of the group coming through the nearby door . With an editor 's instinct he had perceived their exact importance , but he said nothing , only dropped his eyelids and smiled faintly . A bit of knowledge had been stored up for future use . " You do your work I suppose at certain set hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a great many distractions in a place like this . Not that there 's any particular obligation upon a man to work , " he added with a tinge of bitterness in his voice . " Our own generation has been a hardworking one , but we 've left the world in quite a mess . My boys do n't want to go into the steel business and I 'm not going to force them . I had to . When I was your age , Harry , I wanted to be an architect . " " Did you ? " The confession surprised him . It was hard to imagine Mr. Pattison as anything but the stout prematurely aged captain of industry that he was . " I do n't see why ? " he began , and then stopped . " Obligation , " said Mr. Pattison lightly . " Luck , if you please . My father was in a hole in 1893 . It 's chance ; you get into a situation and there you are . The same thing might happen if you walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That would n't change a man 's career , Harry thought , unless he was injured or killed . Such risks did n't bother him because he took them for granted , hoping he would meet them decently if they occurred . His own work involved a certain amount of danger , although very much less than people supposed ; but it was incidental and did n't require a deliberate sacrifice . Mr. Pattison had been caught DEBT 215 at the beginning , just as he might be caught now if it had n't been for his father and Brother Jim . He must ask more about Jim and the mill . " Or get married at twenty-three , " Martin McKinstry interrupted , lifting his black eyebrows and contorting his seamed bitten face into an ironic smile . " Marriages , even the best of them , spring from chance encounters . " " Yours is better than you deserve , " said Judge Beale . " I 'd like to know what you would have done if you had n't married . " " Written plays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I intended to do when I left college . This is not a complaint , Jerry , but a philosophic reflection on the beginning of a man 's career . Either you incur an obligation or somebody incurs an obligation to you , and in the latter event you ride free , as you do , or Harry here does . You 've done what you liked all your life , and so has the boy , which is all to the good so long as you do n't take too much credit for it . I 'm not at all sure the best work in the world is n't done that way , even though it is at somebody else 's expense . " That gave him more assurance when he asked , as casually as he could , how Jim was making out with the mill . " He never tells me , " he explained , " although of course I have no financial interest in it now . " " So I understand , " Robert Pattison answered slowly . " By your father 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it of a certain sum payable to you . " " Three hundred thousand dollars . " It upset them to hear the sum mentioned although every one of them knew exactly how much it was . " Jim paid me that amount and he 's been taking care of it for me ever since . " Nobody spoke . The grave implications of business silenced them ; in a moment they had become brooding , tight-lipped , and apprehensive , more wary than if in the presence of physical danger . His question had come home to them where they lived , transforming them as a surgeon at a party is transformed by a message from the hospital , or a captain at dinner when the table steward whispers of an accident . They envisaged a possible destruction of material values , the terrible stifling constriction that comes from poverty , and the agony and shame of empty hands . All that they saw bore down on his spirit with the weight of sin . In the midst of revelry he had caught a glimpse of the watchers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " lie cried out , and then stopped , recoiling from the sharpness of his own voice . It startled them all . Judge Beale looked at him with surprise and disapproval . " Your brother 's having a fight , " he said , " and so is everyone else in the United States . " " I know that . " The admission sounded like an admission of guilt . " There has n't been any . . . change , has there ? For the worse I mean . " Robert Pattison glanced at the other two men . " Please tell me ! You know Jim , he never says a word . " " Jim 's proud of you , " said Mr. Pattison irrelevantly . " There 's no reason why he should bother you with business of his own . " " Which might be better if I had n't taken three hundred thousand dollars out of it . " It was a relief to say that in plain words . Martin McKinstry looked at him sympathetically . " Jim will get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a manner of humanity I think you ought to know how things are , because they are n't as bad as you imagine . Jim 's pledged the stock of the company to the bank , and they are n't press-ing him and wo n't ; but in the meantime the family is living close . " Layton nodded . Almeira , Tidore , and Tifore , they were distant islands whose beautiful names shone in bright syllables over seas that he had crossed at Jim 's expense . There was no freedom after all , no escape from the weight of burdens that another bore . " Are Jack and Henry still at St. Paul 's ? " he asked timidly . " Yes , so far . Do n't you worry now . pull get along . " The dancing stopped suddenly and the sound of gay voices and laughter scattered over the room . Robert Patti-son turned in his chair , then called McKinstry 's attention to a couple still on the floor , dancing cheek to cheek . The waiter came up and Mr. Pattison ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath , and regarded the couple with bland reminiscent approval . " Our young lady when she comes down here insists on the Princess , " he said . " More life , " Judge Beale suggested . " They run in shoals . Now my boys . . . " He went on to explain the prejudices and preferences of his three sons . Jim and his trouble had been decently buried . It angered Layton ; they showed Jim 's brother too much consideration . To spare a man so abruptly was not to spare him at all ; what he owed Jim they deliberately avoided . " Do you know , " he stammered , feeling himself grow red , " I think I ought to put that money back in the business . " The effect of his words astonished him . Mr. Pattison drew away as if offended . The judge shook his head impatiently and frowned . " Jim would n't take it , " said Mr. Pattison in a severe voice . " It 's not a commercial loan . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your father took care of that , " said the judge with the irritation of one called upon to explain an obvious fact . " Jim was given the business , Harry , you understand that , do n't you ? And you were given three hundred thousand dollars . " " That 's the law of it . " " And the justice too if it 's the law . " " Your father placed that obligation upon Jim , and do n't you go disturbing it , young man , " said Martin McKinstry , shaking his finger at him . " Remember the Toorajahs of Celebes and all the other books you have to write . " Harry was silent . For a moment no one spoke . Then Robert Pattison leaned forward and put his hand on Harry 's arm . " It 's what we were talking about , " he said in a gentle voice that , nevertheless , admitted of no argument . " Every man , including your brother Jim , has to meet his obligations in the form in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolved him from all responsibility . If not humane , their creed was utterly just , leaving each man 's duty where fate had placed it . A sense of universal obligation would in time , if fully developed , reduce all mankind to a monotonous likeness where individual achievement , and indeed character , would be lost in a uniform mass of mutually helpful creatures . His work ? like all work that had ever been done in the world  --  depended upon the exercise of a very definite kind of selfishness , and he wanted to go on with his work and the life he was leading ; to think of stopping was like imagining death . And yet Jim needed money . Not only to live , but for the rehabilitation of the mill . He sighed deeply . The men had become silent , as if standing aloof from his struggle . " I must go , " he said . if he stayed any longer it would only result in a discussion that he would be sorry for afterward . " We 'll look for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the pier . As he descended the steps they stood above him , side by side , of unequal height but strangely similar in their evocation of the world it seemed he could never leave . They had stated a question and answered it in their own fashion , ignoring with righteous determination the moral byways that might perplex a weaker soul . As the boat moved off in the light haze their figures became more and more indistinct and finally disappeared , leaving Layton alone in the shallow harbor under a starless sky with a grave trouble in his heart that blurred his vision and contaminated his peace . " It is transformal weather , " said England and New Zealand from the stern where he was steering the boat . " A sudden change of sky is one of the idiosyncrasies of the month of April in Bermuda . There is a prohibition upon steamships leaving the harbor after dark that is inexplicable to boats owned privately , such as ours . " He lengthened the last word with a lingering pride that increased the bizarre refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplated the big negro who sat with the wheel between his knees and a cloth cap pushed back from his forehead , revealing the earnest and childlike solemnity of his face that seemed to be sculptured out of the darkness , and without life save for the white flicker of his eyes . England and Ncw Zealand had no problems . In spite of his extraordinary vocabulary he presented the simplicity of a Toradja . " You know what you 're doing , do n't you , no matter how the sky changes , " said Harry enviously . " The bay is in the palm of my hand , " the negro answered . His words filled the hollow darkness under the bridge with an echo of assurance . It died away , leaving no sound but that of the engine and the swiftly movingwater that came toward them from an obscure and indeterminate horizon . The lights from the shore were faint , and the sea and the sky had become a transparent shadow , damp and fragrant , blowing over them in a wind that was like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trouble grew more and more remote as the strange momentary solitude expanded to an acquiescent peace of mind in which not only the present but the years beyond were peopled with shapes that moved in the heat-stricken silence of great rivers , beside desolate huts , and upon cliffs above thin smoke issuing from a plain of mighty treetops . The incorrigible traveler in him awoke , overriding obligation with a passion that would not be stayed . A man had to live at no matter whose expense . Jim insisted upon living ; the negro in front of him would put up a terrible fight for life . Even Dorothy ? no , she would n't where someone she loved was concerned . But then women .. . " We turn here , " said England and New Zealand in a resonant voice . " Yonder ? " But he never finished the sentence . It was interrupted by a splitting , grinding shock that threw Harry forward on his hands and knees . He struggled to his feet . The stern of the boat was under water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a slow sidewise motion . England and New Zealand , leaping across on the starboard side , climbed up on the deck . It slanted shureward and he flung himself down and grasped the upper edge with both hands . The slow turning motion continued and the water washed through the cockpit in dark gleams . Harry swung a leg over the starboard side . The negro lay flat on the deck , silent , motionless , with his feet slowly sinking and his hands curved like iron damps about the edge . " Get out of there , " Harry shouted , " or you 'll sink with the boat . " " I cah n't swim , " the negro sobbed with a fantastically incongruous accent . He pushed his forehead down on the deck as if to keep out the sight of the water . Harry seized his right hand and tore it loose . " Jump out now , quick , " he commanded . " When the boat turns over you can hold on to it . " England and New Zealand drew himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking and his eyes fixed on Harry were wild with entreaty . " You take care of me , sir , in the water , " he moaned . " I cah n't swim ? " His voice rose to a stifled animal cry . Then , lifting his arms in supplication , he wrapped them about his head and plunged off the boat . Harry dived in and came up in front of him . The man was a water-wheel in a cloud of spray . If those hands got hold of him ? He came in from behind and seized the negro by the collar . Sinking , he grasped him under the arms and drove him toward the boat . The weight lifted and he came up beside England and New Zealand , who had hold of the keel by the bow . She was nearly over . The negro 's body rose from the water and descended with the final settling of the boat . She was lower , and he had a better grip . Harry swam away and got off his shoes and trousers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the water up to his breast , he considered the situation . " Is the tide coming in or out ? " he called . " Coming in , sir , " said England and New Zealand . He turned cautiously as if seeking Harry through the darkness . " You stay there and I 'll swim in to shore . I wo n't be long . " " Mr. Layton ! " The man 's voice was hollow with fear . " You wo n't swim off and leave me by myself , will you ? " " Ca n't you hold on ? " " No , sir . I will drown . " His words carried terrible conviction . " Now behave yourself , " said Harry severely . " You hold on tight and be right back . " As he passed the bow of the boat England and New Zealand changed his position , then stretched out an arm as if to intercept him . " I cah n't stay here alone ! " he cried in a mournful bellow . " Mr. Layton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . " Stop it ! " Harry shouted . The man was out of his mind . " You 'll fall off ! " Hell . That was just what he 'd done . Screaming and churning in the water like someone crazy . " If you stop that I 'll take you in . Stop it . " He caught hold of his wrist and the man climbed up on him in a spouting , writhing , idiotic frenzy . Harry drove him back . " Be quiet  --  stay still ? " He could n't see for the way the man splashed . " Awgh ? " There was no sense in him . He was a maniac . Harry hauled off and hit him in the face . That stopped him . To make sure he hit him again . The man was a bundle of cloth in his hands . Heavy . He settled under him , pulled one arm up over his shoulder , and began to swim . It must be six hundred yards to shore . He swam slowly , careful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding his slack wrist clasped in his right hand . Now and then , as he drew back for a stroke , their heads touched . The poor crazy fool , he was quiet enough now . Swimming double was slow work . The water Lapped at his mouth and swirled off from his face , to return again and again . He watched a light on shore ; it grew a little brighter and nearer , but very slowly . Another light had come out from the trees . Thcre was form and depth to the outline of the shore . It overhung the water in caves that were guarded by rocks . They joined together on the right hand side in a low promontory . The neckband of his shirt bothered him and he tore it loose . His arms and chest and the hack of his neck began to ache . He was afraid his fingers might go stiff and let the negro slip . He bumped along behind him with a comforting monotony . It was quiet except for the gurgle in his ears and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so far off now , maybe fifty yards . It wavered , dropped out of sight , and reappeared . He was n't moving , only keeping up . England and New Zealand must be awash . He pulled down and the ncgro 's head touched his . Slowly , inch by inch , he fought his way on . The overhanging shadow moved forward , receded , came closer , shutting out more and more of the sky . It was dark . A bird flew over him with a terrified scream . He could almost touch the foam in the hollow of the rock . Then a sharp invigorating pain flashed through his foot . He pushed down , took a step , then another , and his knees struck the edge of the rock . He put out his hand and pulled himself up . The negro dragged back into the water with a dead dripping weight . Harry got under him , leaned against the side , and took hold above . Then he tore his way up on the jagged points , climbed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock . England and New Zealand groaned as if revived by the contact with earth , stretched out his legs and drew them up to his stomach . He began to whimper and twitch as if he were coming out of a bad dream . Then he sat upand stared at Harry without a sign of recognition and a mighty collection of words roiled out of his mouth . The experience had loosened him up completely and turned him into a mad dripping oracle who was still immersed in the terror of his descent to death .
