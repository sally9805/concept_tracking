First student to enroll in Johns Hopkins Medical School for its opening in 1893 was Louis Philip Hamburger . From the able scientists on that faculty Student Hamburger learned a great deal about scientific medicine , not much about the minor ailments he was to meet in general practice . As a result Dr. Hamburger made a specialty of treating minor ailments in Baltimore . Today he lectures about them to Johns Hopkins medical students just before they graduate .
